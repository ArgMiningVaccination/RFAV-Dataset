Itwas established in 1988 to continue the work of thecampaigning nutritionist Caroline Walker, who passionatelybelieved that everyone deserved access to good-qualityfood. The CWT has produced a series of publications whichprovide practical guidance on eating well for those whocare for vulnerable people in our society. The CWT's firstexpert report - Nutritional Guidelines for School Meals , published in 1992 - set the standard for the provision ofnutrient-based standards which the Trust continued in its Eating Well reports for: older people; under-5s in child care; looked after children and young people; and children atschool.The aim of all the CWT reports is to provide a summary ofcurrent knowledge about the eating and drinking issues forspecific population groups and to provide nutrient-basedstandards, practical guidelines and recommendations whichpeople can use as the basis for developing policy bothnationally and locally. In the last 20 years there has beenmuch greater public and political awareness of the need forgood food and good nutrition. However, shocking reportsof negligence in ensuring that some of the most vulnerablepeople in the UK are enabled to eat well still make thenews each year. From the evidence compiled in this reportit would appear that there is still much work to be done toensure good nutritional health for people with learningdisabilities and their families and to raise awareness of theneed for good nutritional health to be given higher priorityin national and local initiatives. We hope that this reportwill stimulate discussion, training and policy developmentamong all those who support children, young people oradults with learning disabilities throughout the UK, and thatothers will now take up the challenge to put the nutritionaland practical guidelines in this report into action.CWT is extremely grateful to Anne Dillon and the membersof the Expert Working Group who steered this reportskilfully and provided advice and useful discussionsthroughout. We would also like to thank all those whokindly offered help, support and guidance throughout theproduction of the report and particular thanks, as always,go to Rosie Leyden who edited and managed this projectwith great skill.Dr Helen Crawley Joe Harvey Science Director Chair Caroline Walker Trust Caroline Walker Trust29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 34Contents Chapter 1 Summary and recommendations 7 Summary 7What is the scope of this report? 8The aims of this report 9Who the report is for 9Recommendations 10Practical guidelines 12 Chapter 2 About learning disabilities 19 What is learning disability? 19Who has learning disabilities in the UK? 20Care and support for people with learning disabilities 21Employment and benefits 22How does having a learning disability impact on everyday life? 22Causes of learning disabilities and their impact on health 23Other health difficulties associated with learning disabilities 25The impact of learning disabilities on eating and drinking 27The effects of drugs on nutritional status 30Can diet be used to prevent or treat learning disabilities? 31Can diet be used to treat specific conditions found among people with learning disabilities? 32 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutrition 35 Energy (calories) 36Fat 37Carbohydrates 38Fibre 40Protein 40Vitamins Good Health 46Preventing diseases: heart disease, bone disorders, cancer and infections 47 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilities 51 Infants 52Children 52Teenagers 54Pregnancy Page 45Chapter Weight 59 Identifying and overweight 59Underweight 61Nutrition support 62Overweight and obesity 63Managing overweight 65Physical activity 66 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral health 71 Gastrointestinal disorders 71 Constipation 72Diarrhoea 73Coeliac disease 74 Swallowing difficulties 74Oral health 75 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day 81 Food for all 81The eating environment 82Eating patterns, and timing of meals and 83Breakfast 83Snacks lunches 89Packed lunches 90Eating out and take-aways 90Food allergy and food intolerance 91Food hygiene and safety 92 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating well 97 Philosophy of care: rights and responsibilities 97Helping people make good choices 98Organisational culture 100Staff training and support 100Involving and listening to family and friends 100Food as a treat or reward 101Engaging with health and other professionals 101Health action plans and annual health checks 102Food knowledge and skills of people with learning disabilities 10329552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 56Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficulties 105 Monitoring nutritional status 105Maintaining independence in eating 106Practical aids to eating and drinking 106Helping people to eat 106Positioning when people need help with eating and drinking 107Strategies to deal with eating and drinking difficulties 108 Extreme faddy or selective eating 108Food refusal 108Nausea and vomiting 109Mouth 109Drooling or dribbling 110Bruxism (teeth grinding) 110Other problem behaviours around food and drink 110Identifying distress among people with moderate to severe communication problems 113 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidance 115 Nutrient-based standards 116Food-based guidance 120 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special diets 127 Meeting the nutrient-based standards 127The cost of a good diet 128Sustainability 128Example eating plans 128Finger foods 132Changing food and 133Pur\u00e9ed diets 134Fortified foods 134Food supplements 135 Appendix 1 National minimum standards: care home regulations and home care (domiciliary) services 137 Appendix 2 Good sources of nutrients 140 Appendix 3 Weight monitoring chart and nutrition checklist 144 Appendix 4 Resources 148 Index 158 List of tables Table 1 Classification of weight among adults 60 Table 2 Nutrient-based standards for children, young people and adultswith learning disabilities 117 Table 3 Examples of energy intakes which may be appropriate for population groups with differing energy needs 118 Table 4 Food-based guidance for food served to adults with learning disabilities, aged 19 to 74 years 12129552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 67 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsChapter 1 Summary andrecommendations Summary Food and drink bring enormous pleasure toour lives. Eating and drinking well have animportant part to play in the health andwellbeing of people of all ages in the UK.Simple changes to what we eat and howmuch we eat can contribute to a betterquality of life, and enabling eating wellshould always be seen as one of the mostpositive things we can do as part of providingsupport and good care. Since the turn of this century, a number of policy documentsacross the UK have provided a new platform for the promotionof better health among people with learning disabilities. In2000 The Same as You? ,1published in Scotland, provided the first new national document on learning disability policy. Thiswas followed: in 2001 by Valuing People2in England; in 2002 by Fulfilling the Promises3in Wales; and in 2005 by Equal Lives in Northern Ireland.4The rights of people with learning disabilities to be valued and supported as equal citizens and toreceive equitable health care and support are now fullyenshrined in policy. However, there is no doubt that peoplewith learning disabilities have greater health needs whencompared with the general population and that their healthneeds are frequently unrecognised and unmet. 529552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 78 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsWhy nutritional guidelines are needed forpeople with learning disabilities There is considerable evidence that people with learningdisabilities are more likely than those in the generalpopulation to have nutritionally-related ill health, and thatthis is less recognised by support staff and professionalsthan it is when it occurs in the general population. 6Issues relating to body weight (both overweight andunderweight), swallowing difficulties, gastro-oesophagealreflux disorder, diabetes, bowel disorders and oral healthare frequently reported among people with learningdisabilities. 5The prevalence of other common age-related disorders which might be linked to poor diet - such ashypertension (high blood pressure), stroke and coronaryheart disease - among people with learning disabilities maybe similar to the prevalence in the general population.However, many of these conditions and the related illhealth are avoidable. People with learning disabilities arealso frequently poorer, live in more challengingcircumstances, and may be socially excluded, all factorswhich may contribute to poorer eating patterns. The evidence presented in this report suggests that there isan urgent need for training in how to enable people withlearning disabilities to eat well and to provide healthyeating choices for their families if they become parents.Despite evidence of excellent practice in some areas of theUK and considerable innovative work promoting betterhealth, the nutritional health status of many people withlearning disabilities remains poor. Some evidence suggests that people with learningdisabilities have a 58% increased risk of dying before theyare 50 years old compared to the general population. 7The main cause of the increased risk is respiratory diseases suchas pneumonia, 8exacerbated by swallowing difficulties, aspiration of food, posture, feeding difficulties and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, 9but early death has also typically been associated with congenital heart disease,cerebral palsy, more limited mobility, and residence inhospital. 7It is highly likely that poor nutritional status throughout life contributes to this reduced lifespan, as wellas contributing to morbidity (ill health) and poorer qualityof life. It is also acknowledged that there is insufficientattention paid to the health needs of people with learningdisabilities, a lack of basic health promotion, insufficientsupport to achieve a healthy lifestyle, and under-identification of particular health conditions, all of whichrequire specific action. 5 In this report we outline the reasons why people withlearning disabilities might be more vulnerable to poornutrition, and how positive changes to eating and drinkingcan improve their health and wellbeing. We also providepractical guidelines to explain what good nutrition meansand the steps that can be taken to make positive changes.From the evidence reviewed a series of recommendationsand a summary of some important practical guidelineshave also been compiled with the purpose of improvinggood nutrition for this population group and these aregiven on pages 10-18. What is the scope of thisreport? This is an evidence-based report which summarisesavailable information on the nutritional needs of children,young people and adults with learning disabilities. It alsolooks at issues around food choice and eating well, andprovides practical information to support these groups andthose caring for or supporting them.This report is the latest in a series of expert reports fromthe Caroline Walker Trust, which has produced nutritionaland practical guidelines for: under-5s in child care; school-aged children; looked after children and young people;older people in residential care and for community meals.Details of all these reports, and a report from VOICES oneating well for older people with dementia, can be foundon the Caroline Walker Trust website www.cwt.org.uk.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 89 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsThe aims of this report The aims of this report are: To improve the health and wellbeing of children, young people and adults with learning disabilities by providingpractical guidelines and information to improve theirnutritional health To provide clear, evidence-based background information about the importance of good nutrition and physicalactivity to the health of children, young people andadults with learning disabilities To offer practical and nutritional guidelines to enable all those with a responsibility for providing food for children,young people and adults with learning disabilities todevelop suitable menus and make good food choices To offer practical and nutritional guidelines to enable children, young people and adults with learningdisabilities to make good food and drink choices forthemselves and their families To highlight some of the important practical issues which need to be considered when helping children, youngpeople and adults with learning disabilities to eat anddrink well To provide examples of good practice in encouraging eating well for children, young people and adults withlearning disabilities To make recommendations about the training and support needed to ensure that children, young peopleand adults with learning disabilities are enabled to eatand drink well and can provide good food choices fortheir families if they become parents To act as a resource document for all those working for better standards of care for children, young people andadults with learning disabilities To raise public and political awareness of the importance of eating well for children, young people and adults withlearning disabilities. Who the report is for Policy makers, primary care trusts, inspectors and regulators, health and safety authorities, GPs and otherhealth professionals, health and social services staff,teachers, community workers, CAFCASS officers, judges,legal representatives, Independent Mental CapacityAdvocates, and others who are responsible for ensuringthat children, young people and adults with learningdisabilities receive the best possible care and supportthroughout their lifetime Commissioners and contractors of services for children, young people and adults with learning disabilities Managers, catering staff, support staff and others in care settings (including residential and day care settings) whosupport children and adults with learning disabilities MPs, MSPs, MEPs, civil servants, journalists, researchers, writers and others who may wish to know more aboutthe importance of eating well for people with learningdisabilities. We hope that the information in this report will be used tosupport children, young people and adults with learningdisabilities to improve their own nutritional health and thatof their families. To that end we recommend that therelevant Health Departments in England, Scotland, Walesand Northern Ireland should make easy-to-read versions ofthe main messages in this report, in appropriate languagesand formats, available for people with learning disabilities,to act as guidance on issues around food and healthyeating.Relatives and friends of people with learning disabilitieswho may want to know more about eating well and whomay wish to promote better nutrition in environmentswhere food is provided for the people they care for andsupport may also find this report useful.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 910 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendations6 Appropriate health promotion agencies should ensure that the practical guidelines in this report, or an easy-to-read version of them, are made available to family,friends and support staff of children, young people andadults with learning disabilities. 7 All agencies that provide practical information and advice on healthy eating to the UK population - forexample, the Food Standards Agency, the Departmentof Health, Health Scotland, the Health PromotionAgency Northern Ireland, the Welsh Assembly andrelevant voluntary organisations - should ensure that alltheir existing and new advice is provided in formats thatare appropriate for people with learning disabilities andtheir family, friends and supporters. 8 Agencies which provide information for health professionals - such as the National Institute for Healthand Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the ScottishIntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) - and relevantvoluntary organisations should ensure that allprofessionals involved in the support of children, youngpeople and adults with learning disabilities receiveappropriate information about promoting goodnutrition. 9 Nutrition should be identified nationally as a priority in the support and care of children, young people andadults with learning disabilities and the governmentdepartment with responsibility for Valuing Peopleshould make sure that the promotion of eating well isincluded when determining new priorities. 10 All those who regulate services for people with learning disabilities should ensure that inspection reports includespecific and detailed comments on food service andthe management of nutritional issues in that setting,based on the information in this report. Commissioning services 11 Local authorities should ensure that detailed nutritional and practical guidelines are included in theirspecifications when commissioning catering and otherservices for the support of children, young people oradults with learning disabilities in residential, day care ordomiciliary settings. Local authorities who provide suchservices 'in house' should similarly adopt, implementand monitor nutritional and practical guidelines in thesesettings.Recommendations These recommendations are addressed to: all those who make, implement and enforce policy and legislation - specifically national and Europeangovernment, health and social care commissioners,local authorities, and the Judiciary those who regulate, inspect or manage services for children, young people and adults with learningdisabilities, and those professional bodies and sector skills councils responsible for training and development. Policy development 1 The nutrient-based standards for food and drink for children, young people and adults shown on page 117should become minimum standards for all residential,day care and other settings where children, youngpeople or adults with learning disabilities are providedwith food and drink. 2 Government departments should make reference to the nutrient-based standards and practical guidelines in thisreport in all guidance and legislation affectingresidential, day care and domiciliary support forchildren, young people and adults with learningdisabilities. 3 All those responsible for legislative change to national minimum care standards for residential, day care anddomiciliary care should include standards which willensure children, young people and adults are supportedin all settings by staff and managers who arecompetent in enabling service users to eat well. 4 Local authorities and relevant NHS bodies and primary care trusts should work in partnership to ensurecontinuity of nutritional care for individual children,young people or adults with learning disabilitiesthroughout their lifespan. General practice should beproactive in identifying and working with patients withlearning disabilities to coordinate, monitor and managetheir nutritional health. 5 The relevant Health Departments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should make easy-to-readversions of the main messages in this report, inappropriate languages and formats, available forchildren, young people and adults with learningdisabilities. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1011 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendations12 Nutrition should feature in the commissioning guidelines when primary care trusts seek services whichwill be directed to people with learning disabilities.Local authorities and primary care trusts should makenutrition a priority in any relevant services theycommission. Coordinated healthcare planning 13 GPs should be involved in promoting the nutritional health of children, young people and adults withlearning disabilities throughout their lives. 14 GPs should proactively offer people with learning disabilities an annual health check. This should look at arange of indicators related to nutritional health such asbody weight, weight change, bowel health, oral health,specific medical conditions, difficulties around eatingand drinking, and medication reviews. 15 Everyone with a learning disability should be encouraged to be involved in developing their ownhealth action plan, with support from a healthfacilitator, and to include in it information about theirnutritional health. Education and training 16 Managers of residential, day care and domiciliary services, and all those who contract and supply staff tosupport people with learning disabilities, should ensurethat those they employ or contract, including agencystaff, have had and continue to have suitable on-goingtraining about eating well, and information and trainingon how to use the nutritional and practical guidelines inthis report. 17 The nutrient-based standards and practical guidelines in this report should be used as part of training andguidance for all those who regulate residential, day careor domiciliary services for children, young people andadults with learning disabilities. 18 NVQs, SVQs and other appropriate social care qualifications are important training opportunities forsupport workers and other staff. Qualifications at alllevels should contain an appropriate section onnutrition and eating well which allows students tounderstand the information in this report.19 Those who validate and assess undergraduate professional courses for doctors, dentists, nurses andother health and social care workers should ensure thatthe courses provide students with adequate informationabout good nutrition for children, young people andadults with learning disabilities and about how tomonitor nutritional status. 20 Training in the provision of dental care for people with learning disabilities and the importance of advisingpeople with learning disabilities and their families,friends and support staff on food and drink choiceswhich impact on oral health should be included in theundergraduate curriculum for dentists and in trainingfor dental nurses and oral health promoters. 21 Learning and skills councils should accredit courses in nutrition and health and basic cookery for all peoplewith learning disabilities, and make courses or trainingaccessible for family, friends and other supporterswhere appropriate. Special courses should be madeavailable for those people with learning disabilities whoare parents or who wish to or are likely to becomeparents. Courses should also be made available forpeople with learning disabilities from ethnic minoritieswho are likely to be under-represented in post-schooleducation. 22 All those who support people with learning disabilities should have training in recognising and managingswallowing difficulties (dysphagia). 23 All those who support people with learning disabilities should receive first aid training to ensure that theyknow how to deal with choking among ambulatory,chairbound or bedbound people as appropriate. Legal representation and advocacy 24 Judges, magistrates and magistrates' clerks, legal representatives (barristers, solicitors and legalexecutives), guardians ad litem, Independent MentalCapacity Advocates, and other advocates should use theinformation in this report when dealing with issuesaround good nutrition for children, young people oradults with learning disabilities. 25 The Judicial Studies Board, the Court of Protection, the Office of the Public Guardian, the Official Solicitor andthe Ministry of Justice should be aware that there arenutritional and practical guidelines which can helpthose who are responsible for supporting children,29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1112 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsyoung people and adults with learning disabilitiesand their families to eat well in all settings. 26 Social workers, court-appointed guardians and Children and Family Court Advisory and SupportService (CAFCASS) officers who work with families ofchildren with learning disabilities or with learning-disabled parents should be aware that practicalguidelines on eating well are available to help themsupport their clients to eat well. They should alsoensure that learning-disabled parents have access toinformation and support to give them the bestpossible opportunity to learn how to care for thenutritional health of their children. 27 Any staff who undertake child or adult protection investigations should be aware of therecommendations, and the nutritional and practicalguidelines in this report. It is essential that staff arewell informed about the signs and consequences ofpoor nutrition.Practical guidelines A summary of practical guidelines to help children,young people and adults with learning disabilities toeat well is given below. For further explanation andmore detail about these guidelines, see the relevantchapters of this report, which put the guidelines intocontext. Eating well Children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should wherever possible be encouraged byfamily, friends and support staff to eat a varied diet.They should eat foods from each of the four main foodgroups every day to ensure they get all the nutrientsthey need. The four main food groups are: - bread, pasta, other cereals (such as rice), and potatoes and other starchy roots (such as yam) - fruit and vegetables- milk and dairy foods such as yoghurt and cheese- meat, fish and meat alternatives such as eggs, peas, beans and lentils, soya and nuts. Fruit and vegetables are particularly important for good health. Everyone should be encouraged to eat at least5 portions of a variety of different fruits and vegetablesevery day. Most people in the UK eat too much fat, saturated fat and sugar. Foods which are high in fat and sugar(particularly snacks) can contribute to overweight andobesity if they are eaten frequently or in large amounts.Many people with learning disabilities, and in particularthose who are overweight or obese, should beencouraged to replace fatty and sugary foods, drinksand snacks with more fruit and vegetables and otherlower-fat and lower-sugar alternatives. Most people in the UK eat too much salt and this can contribute to high blood pressure, which is a risk factorfor coronary heart disease and stroke. Most people areencouraged to reduce the amount of high-salt foodsand snacks they eat and to reduce the amount of saltthey use in cooking and at the table. Adults are encouraged to eat a portion of oily fish each week - for example, salmon, trout, mackerel, herring orsardines - since the long-chain fats in oil-rich fish havebeen shown to help with heart health. There is noequivalent food suitable for vegetarians, but a dietwhich is rich in wholegrain cereals, peas, beans andlentils, vegetables and fruit will contribute to a diet low29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1213 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsin fat and saturated fat and high in complexcarbohydrates and fibre which is recommended toprevent heart disease. For more information on eating well, see chapter 3. Nutrition and pregnancy All pregnant women should ensure that they attend all the appointments made available to them with healthprofessionals throughout their pregnancy, so that theycan be supported appropriately. Pregnant women withlearning disabilities should be enabled to obtain andattend such appointments and sufficient supportshould be provided at those appointments to ensurethat they can access the information orrecommendations made on how to eat well and on thefoods they need to avoid while pregnant. Women with learning disabilities who are planning a pregnancy, and those who may become pregnant (thatis, if they are sexually active and not usingcontraception) should take a daily supplement of 400micrograms of folic acid before pregnancy and duringthe first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women who have ahistory of neural tube defect or diabetes mellitus, orwho take anti-convulsant drugs, should talk to a healthprofessional about the amount of folic acid they need,as they have greater needs than other women. Women should take a supplement of vitamin D during pregnancy. For pregnant women, Healthy Start vitamins,which contain vitamin D (as well as folic acid andvitamin C), are available free to beneficiaries throughthe Healthy Start scheme. Women who are not entitledto free vitamins are advised to consult a healthprofessional about the appropriate vitamin Dsupplement to take during pregnancy. For women with learning disabilities who are planning a pregnancy, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding, drugsshould be prescribed cautiously and regular drugreviews carried out, in order to minimise the risk ofharm to the fetus or child. Pregnant women with learning disabilities should be counselled about the importance of avoiding alcoholduring pregnancy since this has been associated withincreased risk of a baby being born with a learningdisability. Women with learning disabilities who are overweight at the start of pregnancy should be given accessibleadvice, tailored to their needs and circumstances, onhow to eat sensibly during pregnancy and after theyhave given birth.For more information on nutrition and pregnancy, see Pregnancy on page 54. Infant nutrition Supporting women with learning disabilities to breastfeed, and finding innovative ways to ensure that allinfants receive breast milk - regardless of their mother'sdisability or any disability in the child - should be seen asa priority. Breast milk is hygienic, easily digested andnutritionally unique, and contains important antibodiesto help babies fight infections. Breastfeeding can alsoprotect women from some diseases of later life. Womenwith learning disabilities should be offered specific andtailored support to help them breastfeed their infants ifthey wish to do this. All parents and carers of infants with learning disabilities should be given advice and on-going support on infantfeeding and weaning so that they can establishappropriate eating patterns in their children which willpromote good nutritional health in later life. All parents who have learning disabilities themselves should be given clear, accessible advice and on-goingsupport on how to feed and wean their infantsappropriately. Breastfed babies over 6 months of age and all children between 1 and 4 years should receive daily vitamin drops(containing vitamins A, C and D). Vitamin dropscontaining vitamins A, C and D for children from the ageof 6 months until their 4th birthday are available free tobeneficiaries under the Healthy Start scheme(www.healthystart.nhs.uk). For more information on infant nutrition, see Infants on page 52. Nutritional needs of children and youngpeople All parents and other carers of children with learning disabilities, and all parents with learning disabilities whohave children themselves, should be given appropriateinformation on eating well for their children, to ensurethat they can prevent underweight and overweight andestablish appropriate eating habits for their children toprevent nutritionally-related ill health in later life. Children with learning disabilities who eat a poor variety of foods - for example, because they are very selective orbecause they have eating difficulties - may be at greaterrisk of nutritional insufficiency, and care should be takenthat sources of important nutrients such as vitamin A,29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1314 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsvitamin C, iron, zinc and calcium are included in theirdiet regularly. The teenage years can be a critical time for weight gain or dietary change among young people with learningdisabilities as they gain greater independence in foodchoice. Young people with learning disabilities shouldwherever possible be encouraged to be active and eat avaried diet. See also Drinks on page 16. For more information on children see page 52, and for more information on young people see Teenagers on page 54. Bone health To minimise the possibility of low bone density, people with learning disabilities should be as mobile as possible,spend time outside in the summer sunshine safely, andhave adequate vitamin D and calcium intakes. Anyone with a learning disability who has little regular exposure to summer sunshine, young children, pregnantand breastfeeding women, those who live in residentialcare and all older adults (aged 65 years or more) shouldbe considered for vitamin D supplementation. Where thisis the case, advice should be sought from a medicalpractitioner. People with learning disabilities who are at increased risk of falling and fracturing their bones should be assessedby a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that sufficientpreventative strategies are put in place to prevent fallsand that adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes areensured. For more information on bone health, see Bone disorders on page 47. Undernutrition It is important that children, young people and adults with learning disabilities are offered a good variety offoods that they will accept and which ensure theirnutritional needs are met. Where people with learningdisabilities have small appetites or eating difficulties, itmay be difficult for them to eat enough food to obtainall the nutrients they need. Support staff therefore needto be aware of the importance of adopting strategies toencourage sufficient food intake. It is essential that all those who support people with learning difficulties are alert to undernutrition and aretrained to spot the signs that food intake is inadequateas soon as possible and to take appropriate action byinforming the person's medical practitioner. For more information on undernutrition, see chapter 5. Healthy body weight Support staff should be able to monitor weight change easily and to act on changes appropriately. Allresidential settings should have weighing scales,preferably sitting scales, for monthly weight checks. Thescales should be checked appropriately. Support staffshould be shown how to act on the weight datarecorded, and there should be an appropriate chart ineach person's care plan which highlights when action isneeded because of significant weight change. Challenging the perception of what are normal body weights for children, young people and adults withlearning disabilities is essential. It is important thathealth professionals are given clear information on thegrowth and development that should be expectedamong people with learning disabilities and theimportance of intervention if an individual is below orabove a healthy body weight for their height. Where weight gain is rapid and avoidable, or where someone is very heavy for their height and where acareful assessment has been made by a dietitian ormedical practitioner that weight maintenance orweight loss would be beneficial, individuals withlearning disabilities should be supported to reduce theamount of calories they eat and to be more active. For more information on healthy body weight, see chapter 5. Physical activity Everyone should be as active as possible as physical activity builds muscle strength and overall fitness,encourages better mobility and balance, increasesappetite and burns up calories. Activity also helpsprevent constipation, coronary heart disease andosteoporosis, and has been associated with bettermental health. Where practical, children and young people with learning disabilities should be encouraged to domoderate-intensity activity - for example, playing withtheir friends in a playground, swimming or playingfootball - for at least an hour a day. Adults should aimto do, or build up to, at least 30 minutes' moderate-intensity activity a day on at least five days of the week.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1415 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendations Where people with learning disabilities also have physical disabilities which make movement difficult, it isimportant that they are given as much help as possibleto be as active as they can be, even if this involves onlyvery limited chair-based movement. People with learning disabilities may find activity more enjoyable if they do this with others, and support staffshould consider taking part in activities with serviceusers wherever possible. For more information, see Physical activity on page 66. Nutrition support People who receive some or all of their nutrients through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube will oftenrely on support staff to help manage their artificialnutrition support, ideally with back-up from a dietitianor nutrition support nurse. Training should always begiven so that support staff know how to manage tubefeeding and solve any practical problems people mayhave. For more information on nutrition support, see page 62. Constipation All those who support people with learning disabilities should be alert to signs which may indicateconstipation, such as a reluctance to go to the toilet,obvious discomfort, long periods spent in the toilet, achange in eating habits, unexplained diarrhoea, foodrefusal, or unexplained challenging behaviour. To avoid constipation it is important that adults are as mobile as possible, and have sufficient fluid andsufficient fibre in their diet. Children and young peoplewho are constipated should seek advice from a dietitianor medical practitioner on the amount of fluid and fibreappropriate to their needs. For more information on constipation, see page 72. Dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) Dysphagia should always be considered when there are unexplained eating or breathing difficulties, changes ineating patterns, distress associated with eating, orrecurrent chest infections. Those who are at high risk of dysphagia should be assessed for vulnerability and their care plans updatedaccordingly. The involvement of a speech and languagetherapist with specialist knowledge of swallowingdisorders is critical in creating a management strategyand in training the person himself or herself, as well ashis or her family, friends or support staff. Medication reviews of a person with dysphagia should take into account swallowing difficulties, as the personmay be unable to swallow tablets or other medication orsupplements. For more information on dysphagia, see page 28. Oral health All children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should visit the dentist twice a year. Cutting down on the amount of sugar eaten, and on how frequently sugary foods and drinks are consumedthroughout the day, will help to prevent dental decay. Good daily oral hygiene is essential, including brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Childrenunder the age of 8 years and anyone who may havedifficulty in brushing their teeth independently should behelped when brushing their teeth. Support staff should be offered training on the importance of oral health and how to help someoneclean their teeth. All those who support people with learning disabilities should be alert to changes in behaviour such as loss ofappetite, unwillingness to participate in activities,sleeplessness, irritability or self-harm, and should find outif mouth or tooth pain is a possible cause of thebehaviour change. For more information on oral health, see page 75. The eating environment and timing ofmeals and snacks All children, young people or adults with learning disabilities should be respected as individuals and theirfood preferences and religious and cultural requirementsaround food should be accommodated. Food should be appetising and attractively served, to ensure that people enjoy their food. This is particularlyimportant if the food has its form or texture changed forpeople with swallowing difficulties. The timing of meals and snacks throughout the day should be organised to fit around the needs of theindividual being supported. Some people may needfrequent small meals and snacks throughout the day.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:06 Page 1516 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendations It is important to ensure that everyone has enough time to eat and drink and that, where necessary, food is keptwarm safely during the meal for those who eat and drinkslowly. It is important to ensure that people arrive at mealtimes ready for the eating occasion, for example, having hadthe opportunity to go to the toilet and wash their handsor collect their hearing aid, glasses or dentures. Wherepossible, children, young people and adults with learningdisabilities should have the opportunity to servethemselves at mealtimes and independence in eatingshould be encouraged. The appropriate cutlery, crockery,tables and chairs should be available to ensure thateveryone is as comfortable and independent as possible. To make mealtimes a time of pleasant social sharing, and as good practice, staff should sit with the people theysupport during meals and snacks, and where appropriateshare the same foods and drinks. Mealtimes offer an opportunity for support staff to model eating skills and to encourage social interactionand conversation. To encourage this, distractions such astelevision are best avoided during mealtimes. For more information on the eating environment and timing of meals and snacks, see pages 82 and 83. Breakfast Breakfast is an important meal, firstly because many breakfast foods are a very good source of fibre and otherimportant nutrients, and secondly because, if breakfast ismissed, it is more likely that individuals will be temptedby other snack foods later in the day. For those who have a good appetite in the morning that recedes as the day continues, breakfast should be seenas an opportunity to eat a significant amount of energy(calories) and other nutrients, and a range of foodsshould be offered, rather than just traditional breakfastfoods. For more information on breakfasts, see page 83. Snacks A variety of snacks should be offered and these should be included in menu plans. Snacks provide anopportunity to supplement nutritional intakes betweenmeals and can be particularly important for those withsmall appetites or who are fussy or selective eaters, orwho are growing rapidly. However, for those people withlearning disabilities who are gaining weight or who havebeen advised to lose weight, snacks that are high in fatand sugar (such as confectionery, savoury snacks, softdrinks, cakes, biscuits and ice cream) should be kept toa minimum as these frequently contribute significantextra calories to the diet. For more information on snacks, see page 83. Drinks It is important that everyone is encouraged to drink a sufficient, but not excessive amount, of fluid each dayand it should not be assumed that people willnecessarily drink enough fluid without encouragement.Most adults need at least 1.2 litres of fluid a day (about6 glasses) but older people or people who are prone toconstipation should be encouraged to have at least 1.5litres a day (about 7 to 8 glasses). However, excessivefluid (more than 5 litres a day) can be very dangerousand advice should be sought from a medicalpractitioner if there is concern that someone is drinkingexcessively. Free, fresh, chilled tap water should always be offered with meals and regularly throughout the day andshould be widely available in any places where peoplewith learning disabilities may live, work or visit. The amount of soft drinks given to children with learning disabilities should be limited since these offerlittle nutritional benefit and may suppress appetite andprevent children eating more nutritious foods. If softdrinks (such as squashes) containing saccharin are givento the under-5s, they should be diluted much morethan they would be for an adult - for example, adilution of 1 part squash to 10 parts water. If sugary, fruit-based or fizzy drinks are given to children and young people with learning disabilities,they should be kept to mealtimes since frequentconsumption of soft drinks is related to tooth decayand tooth erosion. Drinks other than milk or water arehighly likely to contribute to tooth decay, so they shouldnot be given at bedtime or during the night. For more information on drinks, see page 84. Vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements See also: page 13 for information on supplements for pregnant women and on vitamin drops for children; and page 14 for information on vitamin D supplements. Advice should always be sought from a medical practitioner or pharmacist before any dietary29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 1617 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationssupplements are taken, as high doses of certainvitamins and minerals and some herbal supplementscan cause adverse reactions and may interfere with theabsorption of other nutrients or with the action ofmedicines. For more detailed information on vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements, see page 89. Food allergy and food intolerance If a child, young person or adult with a learning disability has a medically diagnosed food allergy, thisneeds to be taken extremely seriously. It is importantthat everyone understands the importance of avoidingcontact with those foods that may trigger a seriousreaction. Full information on the food allergy should becarefully recorded in care plans and be communicatedto schools, day centres and any other places that theperson may visit regularly. It is important that food allergies should be medically diagnosed. People with learning disabilities, their family,friends and support staff should be discouraged fromattempting to restrict a person's diet due to a perceivedallergy or intolerance, as this may make it difficult forthe person to get all the nutrients they need. This isparticularly true if foods such as milk and milk productsor bread and other cereals are avoided. For more information on food allergy and food intolerance, see page 91. Food hygiene and safety It is important to remind children, young people and adults with learning disabilities, and their family, friendsand support staff, about the importance of washingtheir hands with soap and water before eating meals orsnacks and after going to the toilet. Support staff should always wash their hands with soap and water before preparing food or before helpingpeople to eat, and after they have blown their nose. Support staff should seek information about food hygiene and safety, and requirements for training, fromtheir local authority's environmental health department. Support staff need to ensure they know how to store food safely, handle leftover food, and cook and heatfood appropriately. Children under 5 and anyone who has any form of eating difficulty should never be left unattended wheneating or drinking, as they may choke.For more information on food hygiene and safety, see page 92. Philosophy of care - rights andresponsibilities Managers and support staff should be aware of the code of practice of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 whichpresumes that anyone over the age of 16 has the right tomake his or her own decisions and must be assumed tohave the capacity to do so unless proved otherwise, andthat people should be supported to make their owndecisions and choices. For more on the Mental Capacity Act, see page 98. Helping people make good choices A variety of foods and drinks should be made available to everyone and support staff should be trained andsupported to help people with learning disabilities makeinformed choices. Where there are communicationdifficulties around food and drink choices and eating,support staff should be encouraged to develop skills ininterpreting people's wishes. Courses on nutrition and health and on basic cookery for people with learning disabilities, and for their friends andfamily, should be made available. Special courses forthose people with learning disabilities who are parentsshould also be made available. For more information on making choices see page 98. Organisational culture In all settings it is essential that there is a commitment to good nutrition and an awareness of the wider role offood and drink in contributing to wellbeing and quality oflife. Managers and staff at all levels need to demonstratetheir commitment to good nutrition by ensuringeveryone receives adequate training and support. Efforts should be made to find out about the food preferences and eating patterns of people with learningdisabilities - including those who move into new orresidential settings, regardless of how long they will staythere. This information should be recorded, shared withall support staff, and regularly updated. People with learning disabilities should be encouraged to include information about food and nutritional health intheir health action plan which is compiled to explain theirhealth needs, and in all care plans. For more information on organisational culture, see page 100.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 1718 Chapter 1 Summary and recommendationsStaff training and support The importance of staff training cannot be over- emphasised. In order that children, young people andadults with learning disabilities are supported to eat anddrink well, it is essential that everyone involved insupporting them has a clear idea about what eating wellmeans in practice and that appropriate training is on-going for all staff, regardless of whether they arepermanent, temporary, employed through an agency orinvolved in a voluntary capacity. It is important that anyone who supports those who need assistance with eating is trained to help in asensitive and efficient way. Helping someone with eatingdifficulties to eat can be complex and stressful and it isessential that staff are given sufficient support fromcolleagues when this is challenging. For more information on staff training and support, see page 100. Involving and listening to family andfriends A real partnership between families, friends and support staff is essential so that everyone works together toensure that each individual eats and drinks in a way thatthey prefer and which is appropriate, safe and health-promoting. In residential and day care settings it isimportant that adequate notice of, and the reasons for,changes to meals and snacks are given to everyone sothat people can comment on and discuss the changesbefore they are introduced. For more information on involving and listening to family and friends, see page 100. Monitoring nutritional status All support staff should be able to make simple nutritional assessments that might alert them to changesin the nutritional status of those they care for. For more information on monitoring nutritional status, see page 105. Maintaining independence in eating, andhelping people to eat Those who are able to eat independently, even if this is by hand only, should be encouraged to do so tomaximise independence and dignity. If independenteating skills are not encouraged, there may be a rapiddecline to dependence. Where people need help with eating, it is essential for staff to be trained in helping them to eat and to do thisin a sensitive and efficient way. The use of finger foods - foods which are presented in a form that can be eaten easily by hand without theneed for cutlery - should be used as a way ofpreserving eating skills and promoting independencefor those who have difficulty using utensils or who donot recognise the purpose of cutlery. Some people with swallowing difficulties may need to have their food or fluid modified. Specialist adviceshould always be sought when texture modification isrequired, to ensure that the person's nutrient needs aremet and the food is of the correct texture.

Learning disability is a term used to describe the presence of asignificantly reduced ability to understand new or complexinformation or to learn new skills (impaired intelligence), alongwith a reduced ability to cope independently (impaired socialfunctioning), which started before adulthood, and has a lastingeffect on development. 1The classification of a learning disability as mild, moderate or severe is often related to theamount of support that a person might require and isfrequently based on IQ (intelligence quotient). An IQ of 50-69 issometimes termed as 'mild learning disabilities', an IQ of learning disabilities', an IQ of 20-34 as 'severelearning disabilities', and an IQ of less than 20 as 'profoundlearning disabilities'. 2The requirement for the additional support someone may need is not solely based on IQ butincludes an assessment of the person's communication andsocial skills and their ability to manage their everyday lives.Some people with mild to moderate learning disabilities maketheir way through life without using special services or beingcategorised as having learning disabilities at all, while otherscan live independently with support. Severe learning disability isalso defined as needing significant help with daily living, 1and profound learning disability has been defined as having severelylimited understanding, immobility or restricted mobility andrequiring constant supervision. 2Many people with learning disabilities also have sensory and/or physical impairments whichmake them more in need of assistance, and some people havevery complex health needs which require significantintervention. In this report, the term severe learning disabilities29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 1920 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesis used to describe all those individuals who have significantsupport needs that might be considered either severe orprofound.It has been estimated that well over a million people inEngland (about 2% of the population) have some form oflearning disability, although estimates vary widely and nodefinitive figures are available. 3Valuing People estimated that about 25 people in 1,000 have mild or moderatelearning disabilities (about 1.25 million people), andestimates in Scotland suggest that about 20 people inevery 1,000 have mild or moderate learning disabilities(about 100,000 people). 4Estimates from Northern Ireland suggest there are about 12,000 people with a moderatelearning disability. 5In Wales there are around 13,500 people on local authority learning disability registers.6 The number of people with severe learning disability inEngland was estimated as about 210,000 people (0.4% ofthe population) 1by Valuing People in 2001. Of these, around 65,000 were children and young people, 120,000were adults of working age and 25,000 were older people.More recent estimates from the Department of Healthsuggest that there are about 160,000 adults and between55,000 and 75,000 children with a moderate to severelearning disability in England. 7In Scotland it has been estimated that 3 to 4 people in every 1,000 have severelearning disabilities (equivalent to about 15,000-20,000people, of whom 4,000-5,000 are under 16 years of age). 4 In Northern Ireland in 2003 it was estimated that therewere about 4,500 people with severe learning disabilities,about 1,700 of whom are under 16 years of age. 5 It is anticipated that the total number of people withlearning disabilities will increase by 1% (about 15,000people) by 2008, partly due to increased life expectancy ofpeople with learning disabilities and partly because of anincreased incidence. 8Rising maternal age associated with increased risk of Down's syndrome and increasing numbersof children with complex and multiple disabilities, who nowsurvive into adulthood, will contribute to the rise. Alsoadding to the increase is a sharp rise in the number ofschool-aged children with autistic spectrum disorders,some of whom have learning disabilities, and a greaterprevalence of learning disabilities among people of SouthAsian origin. 1 In 2004, it was estimated that there were between 4.5 and11.3 million people with learning disabilities across the 25member states of the European Union at that time, about1.3 million of whom have moderate or severe learningdisabilities. 9Differences in the definitions of learning disability make it a challenge to estimate prevalencefigures, and also standard terminology across countries isnot used. 'Intellectual disability' is the term used in the USand the Republic of Ireland, and both 'learning disabilities'and 'learning difficulties' are used in the UK. Afterconsultation with our stakeholders, it was agreed that theterm 'learning disabilities' would be used in this report. Who has learning disabilities inthe UK? People with learning disabilities are born into families fromall walks of life and from all ethnic groups. Some of theprimary causes of learning disabilities are genetic andinclude Down's syndrome, Fragile X syndrome,phenylketonuria, Prader-Willi syndrome, and congenitalabnormalities such as congenital hypothyroidism.Secondary disorders, which can occur during or after birth,may result from external factors such as oxygendeprivation, or alcohol or drug abuse. They may also occuras a result of a traumatic birth, meningitis or head injury, 10 or as a result of a child being undernourished, abused orneglected. 11Low birthweight and prematurity are strongly correlated to the later development of learningdisabilities. 12There are, however, incidences where no reason for the learning disabilities can be identified.10 Severe learning disabilities are more common in males,young people, and people of South Asian origin, but areuniformly spread among all socioeconomic groups. Mildlearning disabilities are more common among males,young people and those from families living in poverty orwith other mental health and social difficulties. 13More boys are born with learning disabilities than girls because somecauses are genetically determined and associated withmales, so that approximately 60% of cohorts of childrenand young adults with learning disabilities are likely to bemale. This ratio decreases with age as women typically livelonger than men. 14 Learning disability and different ethnicgroups The number of people with learning disabilities from ethnicgroups is not known, but it is estimated that the prevalenceof learning disabilities among South Asians aged between 5and 32 years is up to three times higher than in othercommunities. 15It is suggested that this greater prevalence is due in part to high levels of social deprivation amongSouth Asian people with learning disabilities and theirfamilies, and poorer access to health services, as well asgreater genetic risk. 16Prevalence within other minority ethnic groups is not as well documented, but it has beensuggested that there is also a relatively high prevalence inthe African Caribbean community. 17There is an expectation29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2021 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesthat the number of people with learning disabilities fromethnic minority groups will increase in the UK. 18 Parents with learning disabilities There are no precise figures on the number of parents withlearning disabilities in the population. The most recentevidence comes from the first national survey of adultswith learning disabilities in England 19where 1 in 15 of the adults interviewed had children. It is generallyacknowledged that the number of parents with learningdisabilities is rising and that their needs are not adequatelyaddressed. 20Parents with learning disabilities are far more likely than other parents to have their children removedfrom them and permanently placed outside the familyhome, and the national survey mentioned above foundthat 48% of the parents interviewed were not looking aftertheir own children. Care and support for peoplewith learning disabilities Almost all children with learning disabilities live with theirfamilies, while most adults live either with their families orin some form of communal housing or other supportedaccommodation. 21Of those who live at home, many are supported by older parents: Mencap estimates that almost30,000 people with severe learning disability live at homewith family carers aged over 70 years. 22 People with learning disabilities may live in a variety ofsettings including family homes, group residentialaccommodation, their own homes, sheltered housing,hostels, with landladies or landlords, in private sharedarrangements supported by home carers or others, or inother forms of supported lodgings. It is difficult to get aclear picture of where people live since some people arefunded through direct payments or via individual budgets,some receive specific 'Supporting People' funding andsome receive home care services. It is estimated that in2006 there were about 35,260 supported residents withlearning disabilities in England aged between 16-64 years,80% of whom lived in independent residentialaccommodation. 23 In Scotland in 2005, there were 5,691 supported residentsin 861 care homes, of which 50% were privately owned,44% voluntary and 6% provided by the NHS. 24In Northern Ireland in 2003, around 450 people with learningdisabilities were still resident in long-stay hospitals, andaround 1,900 people lived in residential and nursing homesor in supported living accommodation. 5In 2005-2006there were 92 residential homes in Northern Ireland solelyfor people with learning disabilities, providing 1,105 places.In Wales, about half of adults with learning disabilities livewith their families, approximately 20% live in their ownhomes, 20% in residential care and about 10% insupported living arrangements. 6 It is estimated that about \u00a34.6 billion is spent each year inthe UK to provide formal services for people with learningdisabilities. 25 Respite care Some people with learning disabilities will spend some timeaway from their own home in respite care, either overnightor for short breaks. In 2005-2006 in England, 12,000people with learning disabilities were supported forovernight respite services and 5,800 for short-termresidential breaks. 26 Costs of residential care The average cost of a place in residential care in the privateand voluntary sector in Scotland in 2005 was \u00a3696 a week 24 and in England in 2005-2006 the average cost of aresidential care place for an adult aged 18 years or abovewas \u00a3895 per person per week. 27The cost of caring for people with learning disabilities is, however, likely to be veryvariable and for those with severe learning disabilities andchallenging behaviour or forensic needs (ie. learning-disabled offenders) the cost may be considerably higher. Children with learning disabilities in fostercare It is not known how many children with learning disabilitiesare looked after in foster care in the UK as a whole, butestimates from Wales suggest that, in 2005-2006, of thetotal of 3,353 children fostered in Wales, 28125 were children with learning disabilities under the age of 16, 29 suggesting that about 4% of fostered children may have alearning disability. Approximately 60,000 children inEngland are looked after by local authorities 30and it is likely that around 2,500 children with a learning disability arelooked after in foster care. Home care for people with learningdisabilities A number of people with learning disabilities may receivehome care (called domiciliary care) in their own homes. InEngland in 2005-2006 27\u00a31,240 million was spent on day care and domiciliary services for people with learningdisabilities, with an average of \u00a3346 per person per week29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2122 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesspent on home care services for adults with learningdisabilities receiving home care. Home care is provided bylocal authorities and by private agencies. The mainpurchasers of home care are local authorities who buy 80%of the hours of care provided by the independent sector. 29 In 2005-2006 there were 27,000 people with learningdisabilities in England receiving home care services. 26In 2004 there were estimated to be 163,000 home careworkers in England, 65% of whom worked in theindependent sector. In Scotland, 3,066 people withlearning disabilities received home care in 2006, 3285% of whom were under 65 years of age. In Scotland the majorityof home care is provided by in-house local authority teams(76% in 2006) but the use of the independent sector isgrowing. There are estimated to be 27,200 home careworkers in Scotland, with about 6,700 in the independentsector. 32The number of people with learning disabilities receiving home care services in Wales is not currentlyavailable but, in 2006, 45% of publicly funded home carewas provided by the independent sector and increasing useof the independent sector is also being seen in Wales. 33In Northern Ireland, 880 people with a learning disabilityreceived home help and meals services in 2005-2006. 34In 2002 it was estimated that there were about 4,250homecare workers and managers in the independentsector working for 92 independent sector homecareproviders. 35 Domiciliary care is regulated by the National Minimum CareStandards for Domiciliary Care and equivalent legislation inScotland, Wales and, in the near future, Northern Ireland.(See Appendix 1 for a summary of these standards.) Thestandards in England provide little support for eating wellbut more extensive support is provided by the Scottishstandards. The current Scottish standards explicitly expectservice users to be supported around eating well andacknowledge the key role of home care workers inidentifying people who may be at risk of poor nutrition. Community meals are also part of homecare services andsome people with learning disabilities may also receivethese. In 2005-2006, 1,100 people with learning disabilitiesin England received community meals. 26 Day services Day services have undergone significant change in recentyears and rather than congregating large numbers ofpeople with learning disabilities in 'adult training' or 'socialeducation' centres for activities, day centres are morefrequently administrative bases from which moreintegrated activities - such as work experience and collegecourses - are coordinated. It is estimated that about58,000 people with learning disabilities in England usedlocal authority day care services in 2005-2006. 26The average cost of day care services for adults with learningdisabilities in England in 2005-2006 was \u00a3277 per personper week. 27 Employment and benefits It has been estimated that about 17% of people withlearning disabilities are in paid employment 19but most people with learning disabilities are reliant on state welfarebenefits. The main welfare benefit is Income Support whichincludes a premium for people with disabilities. Many mayalso receive the Disability Living Allowance and theIndependent Living Fund and some people may gethousing benefit. There can be financial disincentives forthose moving to employment. Although a number ofschemes attempt to allow transition to work without theloss of income, the loss of benefits such as housing benefitcan still be a disincentive to moving to full-timeemployment. There has been a growth in 'supportedemployment' agencies (mostly funded by local authoritysocial services departments) which aim to find paidemployment for people with learning disabilities. Bringingup a child with severe disabilities is likely to have seriouscost implications and have an impact on a family's entryinto and escape from poverty. 36It has recently been estimated that nearly half (44%) of all children withlearning disabilities in Great Britain were experiencingpoverty, compared with just under one-third (30%) ofchildren who do not have learning disabilities, and it isestablished that poverty is likely to be associated withpoorer health and wellbeing. 37 How does having a learningdisability impact on everydaylife? Learning disabilities can affect many different aspects of aperson's life, and individuals will be affected differently.Some of the aspects of daily life frequently affectedinclude: Reasoning (sometimes called cognition) - the person may not be able to organise and put thoughts together,use thinking and learning strategies or learn frommistakes Memory - difficulties remembering facts and instructions Social behaviour - difficulties with social judgement,29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2223 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiestolerating frustration and making friends Physical coordination - the person may have difficulty with handwriting, manipulating small objects, runningand jumping Physical and mental health - people with learning disabilities may be more likely to have other healthdifficulties Organisation - managing time and belongings, or carrying out a plan Communication - difficulties with expressive and receptive communication Reading - difficulties decoding, recognising and understanding words Written language - may not find it easy to write, spell and organise ideas Mathematical skills - may not find it easy to understand arithmetic. People with severe learning disabilities may find most tasksassociated with daily living impossible to carry out withoutassistance, and may well have a number of physical andhealth difficulties which impact on their quality of life.People with severe learning disabilities may have additionaldifficulties with: Communication - Communicating thoughts and feelings can be difficult and frustrating for people withsevere learning disabilities. The person may not be ableto talk clearly and communication may be by signing (eg.Makaton) or through other forms of non-verbalcommunication such as gestures, body language, facialexpressions or by using resources such as Talking Mats(see page 153). In addition the person may not be ableto understand speech unless very simple language andshort sentences are used. Challenging behaviour - People with severe learning disabilities may show aggressive, disruptive or sociallyunacceptable behaviours and may have little or no senseof danger. Such behaviour may well be an expression ofan underlying problem such as pain or distress. Physical difficulties - restricted mobility, motor skills, posture, swallowing, chewing and eating difficulties maymake simple tasks of daily living difficult. Ill health - People with severe learning disabilities are more likely also to have other physical and mental healthdifficulties which impact on daily life such as epilepsy,autistic spectrum disorders, sensory impairments,gastrointestinal disorders (problems with the digestivesystem) and respiratory problems. Causes of learning disabilitiesand their impact on health Some of the causes of learning disabilities and theirimpacts on health are outlined below. While support staffmay feel uncomfortable about labelling people, it isimportant to people's health to understand theimplications of certain conditions. This list is not exhaustivesince there are many conditions that can lead to some levelof learning disability - for example, a stroke or an accident,including road traffic accidents. A review of many of themajor specific disorders and their impact can be found in Physical Health of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities , by Prasher and Janicki.38For information on how to find out more about the conditions detailed here, see Appendix 4. Cerebral palsy Currently about 1 in 400 children born develop cerebralpalsy. 39Learning disabilities are not inevitable but can occur as a result of the brain damage that has caused thecerebral palsy. 40In about 1 in 50 cases of cerebral palsy, learning disabilities are a result of poor brain development,and in about 1 in 10 cases they are due to damage to thebrain during birth. Other causes of cerebral palsy includebrain cells damaged by lack of oxygen resulting frominfections such as meningitis or encephalitis while the childis young and the brain is still developing. Cerebral palsy can cause difficulties with speech, hearing,balance, coordination and sight. It can also cause limbs tostick rigidly in abnormal positions, and epilepsy. People withcerebral palsy often have specific difficulties withswallowing, gastrointestinal difficulties, low body weight,and a greater risk of heart disease, and women withcerebral palsy have been reported to be at greater risk ofiron deficiency. 38 Congenital hypothyroidism This affects about 0.1 to 2 births per 1,000. It is a generalterm for a collection of genetic disorders of the thyroid orpituitary glands resulting in too little, or very rarely the totalabsence of, thyroid hormone production. The mostfrequent form (1 in 3,000 births) is an incompletedevelopment of the thyroid. Girls are twice as likely tosuffer congenital hypothyroidism as boys. Those with the disease have a thick, protruding tongue,poor feeding and muscle tone, prolonged jaundice,constipation and delayed development. Early diagnosis andtreatment with thyroxine can prevent irreversible damageto the nervous system seen in the first few months of life,which can otherwise result in poor mental and physicaldevelopment of the child. 4129552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2324 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesDown's syndrome One in every 1,000 children born in the UK has Down'ssyndrome, 42which is the most common congenital cause of learning disability, caused by an extra chromosome atposition 21. About 600 babies are born with Down'ssyndrome each year and it is estimated that there areabout 60,000 people with Down's syndrome living in theUK, 4280% of whom are over 50 years of age,43reflecting a significantly higher previous incidence of Down's syndrome.The chance of having a child with Down's syndromeincreases rapidly with maternal age, from approximately 1in every 1,500 births for those giving birth at 20 years ofage, to 1 in every 350 births at age 35, and 1 in every 30births at age 45 years. 44 The life expectancy and life chances for people withDown's syndrome have dramatically improved in recentyears and people with Down's syndrome are increasinglyable to live rich and varied lives, which may includebecoming parents. However, there are a number of healthdifficulties which may be more common among peoplewith Down's syndrome, including an increased incidence ofobstructed gastrointestinal tract, respiratory difficulties,thyroid disorders and congenital heart problems. 45 Compared with the general population, people withDown's syndrome are more likely to have insulin-dependentdiabetes, obesity, depression, difficulties with hearing andvision, and early onset dementia similar to Alzheimer'sdisease. 42People with Down's syndrome also have a different bone arrangement of the skull and may have asmaller oral cavity, both of which could affect chewing. 45In addition, in Down's syndrome the ligaments which normallyhold the joints stable are more slack and this canparticularly impact on the joint at the base of the skullwhich might make neck dislocation more likely if someoneis given vigorous treatment during a choking incident. 46 Fetal alcohol syndrome Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most common non-geneticcause of intellectual disability in the western world. Forevery 10,000 births in the UK, 19.5 babies have fetalalcohol syndrome and 1 in 100 have alcohol-related neuro-developmental disorder. 47Alcohol drunk by the mother while pregnant can pass into the developing fetus and inlarge amounts can cause both physical disabilities such as adistinctive poor formation of the mid face, structuralabnormalities of the brain, congenital heart defects andgrowth retardation, as well as learning disability. 48The Department of Health suggests that pregnant women orthose trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. 49 For more information about eating well in pregnancy seepage 54. Fragile X syndrome This occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in8,000 females. It is caused by abnormal expansion of theDNA at the top of one arm of the X chromosome andresults in learning disabilities which can range from mild tosevere. People with Fragile X syndrome can also have somebehavioural difficulties, have difficulties establishingrelationships with family, friends and support staff, anddistorted or delayed language or speech skills. 50 Neurofibromatosis Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nerve tissue.There are two types, depending on the gene affected.(Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused when chromosome 17is affected, and type 2 is caused by chromosome 22.) Thedisorder can be inherited or occur spontaneously. It cancause tumours, and affect the nerves, bones or organs.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) occurs in 1 in 2,500 peopleworldwide and there are about 25,000 people with nf1 inthe UK. Between 30% and 60% of those with nf1 will alsohave learning disabilities. Features include a lack of finemotor skills, failure to understand non-verbalcommunication, poor spatial awareness, poor short-termmemory, and impulsive or unpredictable behaviour. Thesymptoms vary and are often overlooked or mistaken foridleness or naughtiness. 51 Phenylketonuria (PKU) PKU is a genetic disorder which results in the inability to usethe essential amino acid phenylalanine, resulting in changesin the metabolism of myelin and amines, and interferenceof the nervous system. Approximately 1 in every 10,000babies in the UK are born with PKU. 52Some forms of PKU are treatable with a lifelong diet low in phenylalanine (usingprotein substitutes which contain tyrosine and no or verylittle phenylalanine). PKU can result in cognitive deficitsincluding severe brain damage, increased hyperactivity andlearning disabilities. A national screening programmedetecting affected infants (the 'heel prick' test given tobabies shortly after birth) provides early treatment andreduction of symptoms. 53 Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) This is caused by a defect in chromosome 15. Theincidence of those with PWS is estimated to be about 1 in10,000 births. 38PWS causes weak muscle tone, varying degrees of learning disability, and poor emotional andsocial development, and it is associated with increased riskof affective psychosis (mood-altered state). 14Hyperphagia (abnormally increased or excessive appetite) and foodforaging, possible binge eating and pica (eating non-food29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2425 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesitems) are common, resulting in an impaired ability torecognise that enough has been eaten. 54In the past, life expectancy for those with PWS was short, mainly due tohealth problems associated with extreme obesity, butbetter dietary management and understanding of thesyndrome is improving life expectancy. 55 Prematurity About 4 in every 10 babies born before 26 weeks havemoderate to severe learning disabilities, and these verypremature babies are also more likely than other babies tohave cerebral palsy, blindness and profound deafness. 12 Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is a complex neurological disorder. It affectsmainly girls. Although present at birth, it becomes moreevident during the second year of life. People with Rettsyndrome have severe learning disabilities and are highlydependent on others for their needs, including eating anddrinking, throughout their lives. At least 1 in every 10,000females born has Rett syndrome and it is believed to be thesecond most common cause of severe learning disability ingirls. 38 Tuberous sclerosis Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder whereapproximately 33% of cases are inherited. It is estimated toaffect 1 in 7,000 people in the UK, with a total of 8,000people affected. Tuber-like growths on the brain becomehard and calcify with age. They can also affect the skin andany other organ in the body. Symptoms include white skinpatches and the appearance of nodules on the skin.Seventy per cent of people with tuberous sclerosis haveepilepsy and approximately 50%-60% have learningdisabilities, with 25% classed as having severe learningdisabilities. Twenty-five per cent of people with tuberoussclerosis are autistic, and another 25% show aspects ofautistic spectrum disorder. 56 Turner syndrome Turner syndrome affects females and is caused by absenceof all or part of the second X chromosome. It occurs in 1 in2,000 live female births and up to 10% of all miscarriages.The primary characteristics are short stature and earlyovarian failure, resulting in failure to produce eggs andhormones necessary for the development into puberty.People with Turner syndrome also experience heart, kidney,thyroid and hearing problems, are more likely to havecoeliac disease and have varying degrees of severity ofnon-verbal memory and attention span. 57This syndrome has been linked to anorexia nervosa and possible bodyimage disturbance. 54Other health difficultiesassociated with learningdisabilities People with learning disabilities may also have a physicaldisability or another health problem such as epilepsy,thyroid disorder, osteoporosis, sight or hearing problems,mental ill health including dementia, or congenital heartdisease. Epilepsy, thyroid disorders, mental ill health, eatingdisorders, dementia, and attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder and autism spectrum are discussed in more detailbelow. Other conditions are included in the sections onhealth and practical difficulties associated with eating (seepages 47 and 28). Epilepsy About 30% of people with learning disabilities also haveepilepsy, 58increasing in incidence with increasing severity of learning disability.59It has also been estimated that about 20%-25% of children and young people with learningdisabilities have epilepsy but that this increases to over 50%for children with severe learning disability. 60Some of the many different types of epileptic seizure can be hard torecognise and include strange, repetitive or unusualbehaviour and confusion. In some people with a learningdisability it may be difficult to distinguish a seizure fromusual behaviour and the person may be unable tocommunicate how they are feeling. Drugs are normallyused to control seizures, but this may prove more difficultin people with learning disabilities because of theunderlying cause. The side effects of drugs - such asnausea, drowsiness, inflamed gums, disturbed vision, poorattention and behaviour change - may result in a personbecoming withdrawn or developing challenging behaviouras they are unable to express themselves. 59Drugs frequently given to control epilepsy may impact onnutritional status since they may cause constipation ordiarrhoea, nausea, weight loss or weight gain, and mayinterfere with vitamin K absorption and folate metabolism. 38 Thyroid disorders Thyroid disease can occur at any age but is more commonamong older people and is particularly common in peoplewith Down's syndrome. 61Thyroid disease can be difficult to diagnose and should be suspected if changes in behaviourare reported or there is an unexplained increase in appetiteand/or weight loss (hyperthyroidism), or decreased appetiteand/or weight gain (hypothyroidism). Other symptoms ofthyroid disorder and 16:07 Page 2526 Chapter About learning disabilitiesLearning disabilities and mental health Between 25% and 40% of people with learning disabilitiesalso have mental ill health. 22Over a third (36%) of children and adolescents with learning disabilities in Britain have adiagnosable psychiatric disorder and are six times morelikely to have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder thanchildren and adolescents without learning disability. 62It has been suggested that some mental health disorders amongpeople with learning disabilities are related to poverty andsocial exclusion, and may not necessarily all be directlyrelated to the learning disability itself. 62 Many learning disability syndromes of genetic origin areassociated with psychiatric disorders 63and people with learning disabilities are more likely to experience traumaticlife events that make them vulnerable to mental ill health. 64 One study reported that having a learning disabilityincreased the risk of schizophrenia by three times that ofthe general population. 65 Learning disabilities and mental health are two separatediagnoses but, as those with learning disabilities are oftenunable to express themselves, mental illness can fail toreceive proper attention or diagnosis. It has been reportedthat between 10% and 39% of adults with learningdisabilities have mental health needs arising fromdiagnosed psychiatric and behavioural difficulties. 10 Communication needs and lack of awareness by supportstaff and other professionals can lead to mental ill healthbeing under-diagnosed and unmanaged 66and many symptoms of mental health are written off as challengingbehaviour, or assumed to be less important because of thecontext of a person's learning disability. 67 Mental ill health can in itself also be a risk factor forbecoming obese or for under-eating 68and people with mental ill health are often treated with drugs such astranquillisers and anti-depressants which can haveunpleasant side effects. A report published by Sustain 69has suggested potential links between diet and mental healthand it would appear prudent to encourage a balanced dietfor anyone with mental health disorders. Eating disorders Eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa andatypical eating disorders have been reported to be moreprevalent among people with learning disabilitiescompared with the rest of the population. 70, 71In a recent sample of service users of a project for people withlearning disabilities in South London, 13% were found tohave binge eating disorder and about 1% anorexianervosa. 72The causes of eating disorders are complex and poorly understood,73but among people with learningdisabilities they have been associated with being younger,having reported abuse, having poorer social networks,having difficulties with eating and drinking, and havingother behavioural disorders. 71Eating disorders are likely to co-exist with other associated eating difficulties andabnormal eating behaviours such as pica, selective eating,vomiting, regurgitation and rumination, chewing andspitting out food and food refusal. (For more on eatingbehaviour and dealing with eating difficulties, see page108.) Dementia Dementia is defined as the \"Deterioration of intellectualfaculties, such as memory, concentration, and judgement,resulting from an organic disease or a disorder of the brain.It is sometimes accompanied by emotional disturbance andpersonality changes.\" 40The term dementia encompasses a number of physical disorders of the brain arising from avariety of causes. It has no cure and is ultimately fatal.Those affected are progressively unable to care forthemselves; they lose the ability to communicate andeventually need help with all aspects of everyday life,including eating where they may fail to recognise food orknow what to do with it. 74In addition, there is now evidence that swallowing difficulties in Alzheimer's disease(the most commonly occurring form of dementia) occursmid-way through the illness rather than as a terminalsymptom. 75The physical and psychological changes associated with dementia place an added burden on family,friends and support staff and reduce the life expectancyand quality of life of those with the condition.It has been reported that 21% of older people withlearning disabilities have dementia, compared with 5.7% ofthe general population. 42Research commissioned by the Down's Syndrome Association found that, in over 50% ofthose people with both Down's syndrome and dementia,the onset of dementia occurred before the age of 60 -several decades earlier than would be expected for thegeneral population. 42 This is of particular relevance, as life expectancy of thosewith Down's syndrome is increasing due to improvinghealth care, and ageing brings changes in health status andneeds. Many age-associated diseases go unnoticed in thosewith learning disabilities because of a lack of awareness ofsupport staff or clinicians, deficient or non-existentscreening practices, or a lack of focus on healthsurveillance. 76Polypharmacy (taking several different medicines) and inadequate medication reviews are alsocommon in those with learning disabilities and theirimportance grows as a person's medical conditionbecomes more complicated. 7729552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2627 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesThe need for eating well among older people withdementia has been discussed in the report Eating Well for Older People with Dementia .78For details of this and other resources to support those with dementia, see page 154. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and autism spectrum These conditions are not just specific to learningdisabilities. However, someone who has one of theseconditions is more likely than other people to have alearning disability. ADHD Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refers to arange of difficulties associated with poor attention spanand in people with learning disabilities it is largelyoverlooked and under-managed. In the general population,1.7% of children have ADHD and boys are more likely to beaffected than girls. Of those affected, between 25% and30% have learning disabilities, and children and adolescentswith learning disabilities are eight times more likely to haveADHD than their peers. 62ADHD can be caused by stress such as family problems, or by biological factors includingbrain injuries as a result of traumatic birth, or pre-birthproblems such as hypoxia (shortage of oxygen).Failure to recognise ADHD could prevent someone fromreaching their true potential and receiving correct specialisthelp, and this may be more common among those withlearning disabilities where there might already bechallenging behaviour or poor attention span. 79 For information on the effect of artificial food colours onbehaviour and concentration, see page 32. Autistic spectrum disorder Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively new termwhich reflects that there are a number of conditionsencompassed by the term 'autism'. ASD is estimated tooccur in approximately 1 in 200 people but is 33 timesmore common among children and adolescents withlearning disabilities than in the general population. 62People with ASD have difficulties with verbal or non-verbalcommunication, and in understanding social behaviour.These difficulties affect their ability to form relationships,and those with ASD often exhibit restrictive, obsessional orrepetitive behaviour, often reflected in food and drinkchoices and around mealtimes. Apart from learningdisabilities, autistic spectrum disorders are also associatedwith obsessive compulsive disorder, ADHD and mentalhealth issues such as depression and anxiety. 80Asperger's syndrome is a form of autism, but people with Asperger'ssyndrome do not usually have a learning disability. The impact of learningdisabilities on eating anddrinking Learning disabilities are likely to impact on a person's abilityto eat and drink well and to enjoy eating and drinking in anumber of ways: Lack of understanding about the need for a balanced diet may lead to poor food choices among both disabled individuals and family, friends and support staff. Physical and dental health problems and difficulties with eating, chewing or swallowing may directly impact on food choice and the ability to eat well unaided. Lack of experienced skilled staff, specialist eating and drinking equipment or insufficient support atmealtimes to help with slow eaters or those who require modified texture foods and drinks may cause difficultiesand frustrations. Digestive problems such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disorder may deter people from eating. Bowel function problems such as constipation and diarrhoea may deter people from eating because of theunpleasant consequences. Poor communication skills may mean that food choices are overlooked, the temperature of food is wrong, andportion sizes are misjudged. Sensory impairments, the need for assistance with eating, and loss of eating independence may reduce enjoyment at mealtimes. Some medicines may have side effects which play a part in abnormal eating behaviour, appetite changes or eatingdisorders. 54There may also be interactions between particular drugs and nutrients. Structural brain damage or dysfunction such as epilepsy, seen in some people with learning disabilities,have been linked to appetite, metabolic and weightchanges, hyperphagia (abnormally increased or excessiveappetite), and episodes of binge eating. Some people with learning disabilities have abnormal eating behaviours or disorders and a greater number of eating disorders are commonly observed among peoplewith learning disabilities. 54 Poverty , poor housing and social isolation may mean that food choice is restricted, and that affordable, good-quality food cannot be accessed easily. There is little information available on the nutritionalintakes or nutritional status of adults with learning29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2728 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesdisabilities. Limited data from two small studies carried outin residential care suggests that adults with learningdisabilities typically eat diets low in fruit and vegetables andhigh in fat and protein, 81, 82although this is also true of a majority of adults in the UK population. Information on thenutritional intake of children with learning disabilities isdiscussed on page 52. Factors which may contribute toproblematic eating and drinking Dysphagia Dysphagia is the term used to describe eating and drinkingdisorders which may include difficulties in dealing with foodor drink in the mouth, difficulties with movements of themouth such as sucking and chewing that prepare food forswallowing, as well as the process of swallowing itself. 83The prevalence of dysphagia among people with learningdisabilities is unknown but it is likely that estimates ofdysphagia in the community of 5%-8%, based ondysphagia referrals, are likely to be under-estimates. 84 Dysphagia is more common among adults with learningdisabilities who have a physical disability such as cerebralpalsy, those who have physical disability of the palate, teethor tongue, and those with the greatest health needs. 84 Dysphagia can lead to aspiration of food or fluid into thelungs, which causes coughing and gagging and which canalso cause choking and death through asphyxiation. 85 Aspiration is also related to respiratory tract infections andpneumonia, which are a leading cause of death amongpeople with learning disabilities. 14It is frequently acknowledged that dysphagia - despite its potential life-threatening implications for people with learning disabilitiesin terms of undernutrition and dehydration as well aschoking and aspiration - is frequently under-diagnosed andpoorly managed. 86For information on how to recognise and support swallowing difficulties, see page 74.Information on how to modify the consistency of solids andliquids and manage the physical environment to supportthose with swallowing difficulties can be found on pages133 and 112. Dyspepsia (indigestion) This is very common in children with complex neurologicaldifficulties and common in adults with similar difficulties. 87 There are three types of dyspepsia: gastro-oesophagealreflux disease (GORD); functional (dysmotility) dyspepsia;and structural (organic) dyspepsia. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) GORD is a major clinical problem in people with learningdisabilities and is frequently overlooked and under-estimated. 88It has been estimated to occur in 48% of people with learning disabilities,14but to occur more frequently among those with cerebral palsy, severe learningdisabilities, those taking anti-epileptic drugs and those witha history of rumination (see the next page). 88It has also been reported to occur in up to 75% of neurologicallyimpaired children. 89Factors which increase the risk of GORD include cerebral palsy, use of anti-convulsant drugs, drugswhich slow gastric emptying, benzodiazepines, and havingan IQ less than 35. 38GORD is caused by acid from the stomach entering the oeosophagus, causing pain andsymptoms including heartburn, painful swallowing,vomiting, vomiting blood and regurgitation and re-chewingof food. The very severe pain that can be caused by GORDcan lead to challenging behaviour, particularly amongindividuals with learning disabilities who are unable toexpress themselves. If the symptoms go unnoticed orunreported and the condition untreated, the oeosophaguscan be permanently damaged and oesophageal cancer candevelop. 38GORD is a highly treatable condition, so it is essential that it is recognised and treated, as it would befor the rest of the population. Functional (dysmotility) dyspepsia This is due to abnormal movement of the stomach oroesophagus. Symptoms may include a poorly emptyingstomach (which can be seen in the person as fullness,refusal to eat, abdominal pain, or effortless large-volumevomiting). Treatment is either to change or stop any drugscausing the abnormal movements, or to use drugs thatencourage normal movements. Structural (organic) dyspepsia This is dyspepsia caused by damage to the lining of thestomach or duodenum, such as a gastric ulcer. Thecommonest cause is infection by the helicobacter pylori bacteria. People living in close proximity to each other areparticularly prone to this - such as people living in acommunity home. An equally common cause is the use ofnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asaspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac. This type of dyspepsia istreated by treating the cause of the damage. Thesymptoms of ulceration may be mild, or masked bycommunication difficulties. An untreated ulcer canperforate and result in death, so early diagnosis is crucial. Pica Pica is the term used for eating non-food items such asplaster, coal, faeces, soil or cigarette ash. Pica, which is notnormally seen in the general population (exceptoccasionally among pregnant women and children aged 1-6 years 90), has been associated with severe learning29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2829 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesdisabilities, schizophrenia, depression, large group living,younger age and male gender, autism, dehydration, andswallowing difficulties. 71, 72It has been reported among between 9% and 25% of people in residential care andbetween 0.3% and 14% of people with learning disabilitiesliving in the community. 91Eating non-food items can prevent the absorption of vital nutrients, cause lead ornicotine toxicity, block the colon, or produce medicalproblems if the ingested item is toxic or harmful. 91There has been debate as to whether pica may be associatedwith mineral deficiencies and there is some evidence thatpica is more common among those with low iron and zincstatus, 92but whether this is the cause of pica or a consequence of the pica itself has not been established.Strategies for dealing with problem eating behavioursamong people with pica are considered on page 111. Polydipsia Polydipsia is the excessive drinking of non-alcoholic drinksin the absence of the physiological stimulus to drink or aphysiological condition such as diabetes. Acute excessivefluid consumption (which has been defined as more than 5litres of fluid a day) can result in restlessness, confusion,lethargy, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, convulsions, seizures,coma and even death. 93Chronic polydipsia may result in long-term physical complications such as incontinence,renal failure, cardiac failure and dementia. This disorder hasbeen noted in particular among schizophrenics and thosewith autism and pica, and a prevalence rate of 14.5% hasbeen suggested among those with learning disabilities. 93 There are likely to be behavioural aspects to polydipsia: ithas been suggested that excessive drinking of fluid mightbe associated with agitation, stress or pre-menstrual stress,or might be a reaction to conditions such as toothache orconstipation. Polydipsia may also be linked to lifestylefactors such as smoking or experience of limited availabilityof fluids, or to the side effects of some medication, butmore research is needed to explore the factors which maycontribute to this condition. Hyperphagia Hyperphagia, also known as polyphagia, is an abnormallyincreased or excessive appetite which is insatiable. Theperson is continually seeking food, often to the point ofgastric pain or vomiting. It is often linked to damage to thehypothalamus. This condition is frequently seen in peoplewith Prader-Willi syndrome 55and can lead to excessive weight gain. Rumination Rumination involves the continuous regurgitation, re-chewing and sometimes re-swallowing of food. It has beenassociated with hiatus hernia, infections of thegastrointestinal system or congenital abnormalities. 94 Drooling The escape of saliva from the mouth as drooling can resultfrom problems with the facial and palate muscles. It ispossible that the main causes are inadequate swallowingand lip closure and head-forward posture. Drooling cancause chronic irritation of the facial skin, infections aroundthe mouth area, halitosis (bad breath), and dehydration dueto fluid loss, and can be undignified and unpleasant. Manymanagement techniques - surgical, non-surgical andpharmacological - have been used, but none appear to beuniversally successful, and many of the drugs haveproblematic side effects. Management is mainly aimed atalleviating the symptoms and maintaining the head in anupright position. 95Some strategies to support those who have difficulties with drooling are outlined on page 110. Bruxism Bruxism, or the grinding of teeth, can lead to tooth wearand in severe cases can lead to tooth pain, infections andoral wounds when it is also associated with cheek chewing.Bruxism has been reported among people with learningdisabilities, particularly among people with cerebral palsywhere it is suggested it may be linked to anxiety andcommunication problems. 96Bruxism is also associated with Rett syndrome and Down's syndrome as well as gastro-oesophageal reflux and to the long-term use of some drugsincluding some given for treating depression or behaviouralproblems. 97Teeth-grinding requires careful individual assessment to prevent damage to the teeth and oraltissues and to treat any pain which might interfere witheating and drinking. Other difficulties associated with eating among people with learning disabilities Regurgitation, vomiting, binge eating, selective eating andspitting out of food are all difficulties that have beenassociated with those with learning disabilities, and withouttreatment may cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalance,malnutrition and possibly increased mortality. 71Strategies to support those who have difficulties with eating anddrinking can be found on page 108. Asphyxiation and choking In long-stay hospital wards it used to be common forpeople to eat their food very quickly in an attempt toensure no-one else ate it, especially if they were oftenhungry and had no access to snacks. Some people withlearning disabilities in residential care still have thisbehaviour and it has been linked to increased risk of29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 2930 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesasphyxiation and choking.85Risk of choking can also be associated with bolting food - for example, in people whotake food from someone else's plate and bolt it to avoiddetection. 98For information on how to handle choking incidents see page 75, and for strategies to deal withproblem eating behaviours see page 108. Posture and mobility There are high rates of mobility difficulties among peoplewith learning disabilities that increase with age and whichcontribute to nutritionally-related ill-health such as chronicconstipation, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease andosteoporosis. 14People may also have postural difficulties and be unable to sit up straight or hold their head up,making eating and drinking more difficult. For advice onpositioning for eating and drinking, see page 107. Sensory disabilities An individual with learning disabilities is very likely to havedifficulties with communication. It is estimated that about40% of people with learning disabilities have a hearingimpairment 99and an association between people with Down's syndrome and hearing impairment has been wellestablished. 100However, it can be difficult to diagnose and recognise hearing problems among people with learningdisabilities and this is particularly true for age-relatedhearing loss. Older people with learning disabilities andhearing loss may appear difficult and uncooperative andexhibit challenging behaviour, or they may bemisdiagnosed with dementia, so careful, regular andpatient assessment of hearing ability is essential. 101 Among adults with learning disabilities, almost 50% havesome degree of visual impairment either at near or longdistance, and 1%-5% have severe impairment orblindness. 102There will also be age-related deterioration of vision. People with Down's syndrome have a higherprevalence of sight problems than other people withlearning disabilities. People who cannot see well are likelyto find tasks of daily living more challenging. They may findit harder to prepare food, may not see if food is unfit toeat, or may be unable to read food labels, or cooking andpreparation instructions. It is important to ensure thatpeople with learning disabilities have their sight testedregularly, that corrective glasses are available and thatthese are worn.The effects of drugs onnutritional status Many people with learning disabilities take a number ofdifferent drugs, both those prescribed by medicalpractitioners as well as over-the-counter medicines. Manydrugs influence appetite, food intake and ultimatelynutritional status. Some drugs can cause loss of appetiteand some cause adverse responses to food such as nausea,dry mouth or loss of taste. Some drugs may also alterbowel function, causing constipation or diarrhoea. If drugscause drowsiness, people may miss meals and snacks. It isalso important to recognise that poor nutritional status canimpair drug metabolism and people who are dehydrated orwho have had recent weight loss may experience greaterside effects. 103 Psychotropic medicines Between 20% and 50% of people with learning disabilitiesare found to be prescribed psychotropic medication 104 which is given for treating mental illness (anti-psychoticmedication), helping with challenging behaviour (anxiolyticmedication) and reducing anxiety and depression (anti-depressants). The side effects of some anti-psychotics andanti-depressants may include weight gain, a craving forsugary foods, raised blood cholesterol levels, dry mouthand an increased incidence of diabetes. All anti-psychoticsand some anti-depressants cause constipation. Newer SSRIdrugs (selective serotonin re-uptake inihibitors) which maybe given for depression or other psychological difficultiesmay cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipationand the mood stabiliser lithium can cause nausea,vomiting, diarrhoea, polydipsia and weight gain. 105 Drugs for epilepsy Drugs which may be given to control epilepsy (particularlyphenytoin) can lead to vitamin D deficiency and may putpeople with limited exposure to sunlight at risk ofosteoporosis 106(see page 47). Some drugs given to control epilepsy may also interfere with the absorption of folicacid 107and vitamin K 108and may cause constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, weight loss or weight gain.38 Drugs for other conditions Certain diuretics, beta-blockers, drugs to manage urinaryincontinence and anti-histamines can cause a dry mouth. 109 Many anti-dementia drugs have side effects such as nausea,diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss andabdominal pain. 11029552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3031 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesDrugs which affect swallowing function Medication which alters levels of alertness (eg. some anti-psychotics and drugs given for controlling epilepsy), 111those which alter muscle tone or coordination (such as someanti-depressants), and medicines which delay theswallowing process or increase salivation (such as someanti-psychotics) 112can all impact on swallowing function. Managing medication among people withswallowing difficulties There are also particular problems in managing medicationamong those with swallowing difficulties and some sideeffects of the drugs themselves - such as having a drymouth - can make taking medication more difficult.Guidance on managing medication among adults withswallowing difficulties has been produced. 113 Medication reviews It is important that there are regular reviews of medicationamong people with learning disabilities and that sideeffects which may impact on eating, drinking andnutritional status are considered carefully when medicationis prescribed. A very detailed handbook for support staffabout medication and people with learning disabilities hasbeen written by Miriam Wilcher for South BirminghamPrimary Care Trust (see page 155). Can diet be used to prevent ortreat learning disabilities? The brain is the largest organ in the body and it is affectedby what we eat and drink, but the links between the dietand the brain are complex. We know that diet can impacton development in the womb: the role of folic acid, forexample, in preventing neural tube defect births is wellestablished. However, to what extent diet and dietarymanipulation can impact on the brain and its function afterit has developed remain speculative, as much of theresearch has been done on small groups or groups ofpeople in special circumstances. We know that learningdisability associated with specific inborn errors ofmetabolism (for example phenylketonuria) can beprevented when a person consumes, from birth, a diet thatmanages the levels of amino acids in the blood which maydamage the nervous system, but these are very specificmetabolic diseases. The evidence so far accumulated forother conditions or for the population as a whole does notshow that diet can prevent or cure brain-related disorders.There is, however, increasing interest in the role ofpolyunsaturated fats and some minerals and vitamins inpotentially relieving the symptoms of some mentalillnesses, improving the effectiveness of medication forsome conditions, and reducing the side effects of somemedications. 69 A review of research studies of food supplements amongpeople with Down's syndrome has failed to find anyevidence that any form of nutritional supplementationimproves the outcome in Down's syndrome. 114A large trial of vitamin and mineral supplementation of children withDown's syndrome recently completed by the Institute ofChild Health in London may, however, provide some newevidence in this area.Eating and drinking well during pregnancy, breastfeedingfor at least six months, and weaning infants onto a variedand nutrient-dense diet are all recommended to ensurethat children have an optimum start in life. Encouraging allthose with learning disabilities to eat well would seemintuitively to be a sensible approach and of particularrelevance to those who have both learning disabilities andmental ill health and those who may have had poornutritional experiences in early life. Can diet impact on behaviour andlearning in children? There has been a longstanding interest inwhether dietary components can influence thebehaviour and learning of children, but it is adifficult area to research and there remainsinsufficient evidence to reach clear conclusions inmany areas. Overall, research shows that a good,varied diet is the best way to ensure optimalmental and behavioural performance in children,and that only those children who have very poornutritional status (for example those with severeiron deficiency) may benefit from significantdietary manipulation. 115 There also remains insubstantial evidence thatgiving children fish-oil supplements impacts ontheir performance. It is better to concentrate ongiving children good-quality food rather thanrelying on expensive supplements.For information on the effect of artificial foodcolours on behaviour and concentration inchildren, see page 32.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3132 Chapter 2 About learning disabilitiesCan diet be used to treatspecific conditions foundamong people with learningdisabilities? Autistic spectrum disorders There is some belief that dietary restriction or dietarysupplementation will benefit people with autistic spectrumdisorders (ASD), although there is only weak evidence thatthese strategies are beneficial. The most common dietarytreatments suggested are the exclusion of gluten andcasein from the diet and/or nutritional supplementation,for example with high doses of vitamin B 6and magnesium. A recent guideline from SIGN (Scottish IntercollegiateGuidelines Network) reviewed all the current literaturelooking at potential dietary interventions, dietarysupplementation and ASD and concluded that there isinsufficient evidence that exclusion diets, including thosethat exclude casein (found in milk and milk products) andgluten (found in wheat, rye, barley and oats), orsupplementation with vitamins and minerals, havesignificant benefits for children and young people withASD. 116 Advice on diet and food intake should be sought forchildren and young people with ASD who display significantfood selectivity and dysfunctional feeding behaviour or whoare on restricted diets that may be adversely impacting ontheir growth or producing physical symptoms of recognisednutritional deficiencies. Advice should be sought from aregistered dietitian (see Where to get advice about eating wellon page 151). For more information on diet and ASD, see the websites ofthe British Dietetic Association at www.bda.uk.com and ofSIGN at www.sign.ac.uk. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) The role of diet in ADHD is controversial. A review ofstudies that have attempted to link ADHD to a number ofnutritional disorders found some evidence among somechildren of potential links with deficiencies of essential fattyacids, iron and zinc. 69However, there remains a need for more clinical trials of longer duration before anyconclusions can be reached. Permanently eliminating anumber of foods may be harmful and professional adviceshould be taken from a registered dietitian beforesignificant dietary changes are attempted. There is some anecdotal evidence that certain vitamin,mineral, or omega-3 supplements can help to treat ADHD.The evidence is not conclusive and the safety of high dosesof supplements is unproven. It would seem prudent toensure that those with ADHD are given a varied andbalanced diet, including oily fish rich in omega-3 fats oncea week (eg. mackerel, herring, trout or salmon) if fish iseaten.New evidence does, however, suggest that some artificialfood colours may impact negatively on the behaviour andconcentration of some children, and current advice fromthe Food Standards Agency is that, if a child shows signs ofattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eliminatingthe allura red (E129) from their dietmight have some beneficial effects. 117 References 1 Department of Health (2001) Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century .

British Journal of Principles of good nutritionChapter 3 Principles of goodnutrition This chapter provides information on theimportance of good nutrition and physicalactivity for children, young people andadults. The nutrient-based standards for groups of people discussed inchapter 10 of this report are expressed as the amounts ofenergy (calories) and nutrients that are needed for goodhealth. The term 'nutrients' refers to the substances in food anddrink which humans need in order to function, grow and repair(for example, after illness or injury). The term nutrients includes: fat carbohydrates protein vitamins minerals water. Most foods contain a variety of nutrients so it is the balance of different foods within a person's eating pattern that determineswhether the recommendations for 'healthy eating' are met. It isimportant for everyone to have a diet that contains a variety offoods if they are to obtain all the nutrients their bodies need.There are no magic foods or food supplements that cancompensate for a poor diet. Eating well is not complicated anddoes not mean that people have to eat unusual or expensivefoods. Advice on good nutrition can be obtained from adietitian or a registered public health nutritionist (see page 151).29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3536 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionWhy we need energy Where does energy (calories) come from? We all need energy to function and be active. The bodygets energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein and alcohol,but most energy needs are met by fat and carbohydrate.Children and young people also need energy for growthand development.Energy is measured in kilocalories 4.2kJ, and 1,000kcals 4.2MJ.The nutrients fat, carbohydrate and protein, as well asalcohol, all provide the body with calories. (For more aboutthese nutrients, see pages 37-40.) Recommendations for a healthy diet are often expressed aswhat proportion of energy should come from each ofthose nutrients. Most of our energy should come fromcarbohydrates (found in foods such as bread, potatoes,pasta and rice). There are also recommendations for thedifferent types of carbohydrates, including the proportionof total energy that should come from sugars. (See Carbohydrates on page 38.) The importance of physical activity The energy we need every day is determinedboth by a basic level of requirement to keep ourbodies functioning (called the Basal MetabolicRate or BMR) and by the amount of physicalactivity that we do (for example moving around,walking or exercising). People who are inactivehave lower energy needs and will need less foodto maintain their body weight. It becomes muchharder to get all the nutrients needed for goodhealth if people are inactive and have a poorappetite.Overweight and obesity have become a growingproblem in the UK. Overweight is as much aproblem of doing too little activity as of eatingtoo much. People who are overweight should beencouraged to increase their activity levels andeat healthily. Information about strategies toprevent and reduce overweight is given inchapter 5.Energy (calories)29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3637 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionFat in the diet Foods it is found in Fat provides the most concentrated form of energy in thediet. It provides 9kcals per gram of fat, compared with4kcals per gram for protein and carbohydrate.There are basically two types of fat found in foods: saturated fats , which are mainly from animal sources, and unsaturated fats , which are found mainly in plants and fish. The unsaturated fats include monounsaturated fatsand a group called polyunsaturated fats. Some fat in the diet is essential and fat in foods is alsoassociated with the uptake of fat-soluble vitamins -vitamins A, D, E and K (see page 41). Diets that are high in total fat and saturated fat areassociated with high blood cholesterol levels, which area major risk factor for coronary heart disease. People areencouraged to use unsaturated fats in cooking and asspreading fats, and to cut down on the amount of foodthat is high in saturated fat.Omega-3 fats (derived from oil-rich fish) are thought to be beneficial for heart health. Omega-6 fats are found in cereals and grains and the average amount of these in theBritish diet is thought to be enough. To ensure there is abalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fats in the diet,people are encouraged to increase their intake of oily fishto 1 portion a week. Some claims have been made aboutthe ability of omega-3 fats to improve behaviour andlearning. This is discussed on page 32.Trans fats are a particular type of fat that is found in some manufactured foods that use hydrogenated oils. The transfats found in foods containing hydrogenated oils or fats areharmful and have no known nutritional benefits. They raisethe type of cholesterol in the blood that increases the riskof coronary heart disease. Some evidence suggests thatthe effects of these trans fats may be worse than the effectof saturated fats.Unsaturated fats Monounsaturated fatsOlive oil and (almonds, and nuts, trout and fresh tunaOther omega-3 fats can be found in oils such as rapeseedoil, soya oil, walnuts and almonds, pumpkin seeds, organicmilk and green leafy vegetables. However, there is noevidence that these omega-3 fats protect against heartdisease. Saturated fats ButterHard cheeseFat in meat and poultryMeat products (such as sausages, processed meats, andmeat pies)BiscuitsCakesCreamLardDripping SuetGheeCoconut oil and palm oil Trans fats Some pastries, cakes, biscuits, crackers, deep-fried foods,take-away foods, and ice cream desserts.Foods that have 'hydrogenated oils' or 'hydrogenated fat' inthe list of ingredients are to contain trans fats. Fat29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3738 Chapter 3 Principles STARCH Non-milk extrinsic sugars pulses, root vegetables. These sugars are found naturally in foodssuch as vegetables, fruits and milk.This includes table sugar,sugar added to recipes,and sugars in soft drinks. Carbohydrates is the term used to describe both starch and sugars in foods. Carbohydrates provide energy. The term sugars is often assumed to describe something white and granular found in sugar bowls, but in fact thesugars found in foods can be quite variable. In order toclarify the roles of different sugars in health, the sugars infoods have been distinguished as: intrinsic sugars milk sugars, and non-milk extrinsic sugars (or NME sugars). Carbohydrates29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionWhat are they? Starch is the major component of cereals, pulses, grains and rootvegetables (for example yam) and tubers (such as potatoes). Most peoplecan visualise starchy foods when they think of flour and potatoes. Intrinsic sugars and milk sugars are the sugars found naturally in foods such as milk, vegetables and fruits. Non-milk extrinsic sugars - or NME sugars - is the term used for those sugars which have been extracted from a root, stem or fruit of a plantand are no longer incorporated into the cellular structure of food. NMEsugars therefore include table sugar, sugar added to recipes (for example,cakes and biscuits) and sugars found in confectionery, soft drinks and fruitjuices. Honey and syrups are also included in this group.The recommendation to reduce the energy in the diet provided by NMEsugars is mainly to prevent tooth decay. 1The other concern is that foods high in NME sugars often provide calories but few other nutrients andthat NME sugars can contribute to the development of obesity. This isparticularly true for drinks such as squashes and fizzy drinks, sweets, andalso highly sweetened breakfast cereals, biscuits, cakes and sweetenedsnacks. We don't need NME sugars for energy. We can get all the energy weneed from other carbohydrate foods.Foods they are found in All types of bread and rollsChapattis and other flat breads Rice and other grains All types of pasta and spaghetti NoodlesBreakfast cerealsPotatoesYams Plantains Fruits (but not fruit juices) VegetablesMilk and dairy products contain milk SUGARS Intrinsicsugars andmilk sugarsNon-milkextrinsicsugars Glycaemic index refers to the speed with which carbohydrate foods increase the level of sugar in the blood after they are eaten. It is suggested that foods with a low glycaemic index keep you fuller for longer and may bebeneficial for people with diabetes and those who are overweight. 2Many foods which have a low glycaemic index are also high in fibre, such as higher-fibre cereals, oats, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 3940 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionWhy we need it Fibre (also called non-starch polysaccharides or NSP) is foodmaterial from cereal and vegetable foods which is notbroken down in the small intestine of humans. Fibre isparticularly important to prevent constipation and otherbowel disorders. Some types of fibre known as soluble fibreare important for lowering blood cholesterol levels.Foods it found in Wholemeal breadWholegrain breakfast cerealsPulses (peas, lentils and beans - including baked beans, kidney beans and butter beans) Dried and fresh fruit and vegetables Soluble fibre is found in fruit, oats and beans and pulses.These foods provide good sources of other nutrients too.

Alcohol affects all the parts of the body it comes into contact with:the stomach, gut, brain and especially the liver. Alcohol affects brain activity. The first thing to be switched offare our inhibitions, which can make people behave in a way they would not normally, and this can lead to risk-taking behaviours. Men are advised to drink no more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day, and women to drink no more than 2-3 unitsof alcohol a day. Women who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant should avoid having alcohol.1 unit of alcohol is equivalent to 10ml of alcohol - for example, half a pint of ordinary-strength beer or lager,half a glass of wine, or a pub measure of spirits.

Vitamin A in food can bedestroyed by heat or by oxidation if left exposed to theair.Water-soluble vitamins Some of the most important water-soluble vitamins are: vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacinvitamin B 6 vitamin B12 folate vitamin C These are not stored in the body. They are water-soluble, so they are more likely to be destroyed by heator by oxidation if left exposed to the air.Vitamins and minerals Vitamins Vitamins are often divided into two groups: those that arefat-soluble and those that are water-soluble. Some vitaminsare found predominantly in animal foods - for examplevitamin B 12and vitamin D (see pages 43 and 42). Others are found predominantly in foods of vegetable origin - forexample vitamin C. It is important to get enough of each vitamin. However,having too much does not bring any benefit and may beharmful. Most people should be able to get all thenutrients they need by eating a varied and balanced diet. Ifanyone chooses to take supplements containing vitaminsand minerals, it is important to know that taking too much,or taking them for too long, can cause harmful effects.Current advice about safe intakes of vitamins and mineralscan be found at: www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/vitaminsandminerals.Many vitamins are not stored in the body and are also morelikely to be destroyed if foods containing them areovercooked or exposed to sunlight or air for long periods.This is why it is important to prepare vegetables close tothe cooking time and not to overcook them.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4142 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionVitamin A Vitamin D Vitamin EVitamin KWhy we need it Vitamin A is often thought of as the 'anti-infection' vitamin asit plays an important role in maintaining the immune system.It is also essential for growth, which is why children needrelatively more vitamin A than adults. Vitamin A is alsoassociated with good vision in dim light as retinol is essentialfor the substance in the eye which allows night vision.Experts now believe that carotene has a much wider role thanjust as a means to produce vitamin A. It may protect the bodyfrom internal damage to the cells, which could lead eventuallyto heart disease or the development of cancer. There is noevidence that supplements of carotene are protective, so it isimportant to include good sources of carotene in the diet. Vitamin D is needed for healthy bones and teeth. Prolongeddeficiency of vitamin D in children results in rickets, the mainsigns of which are skeletal malformation (such as bowed legs)with bone pain or tenderness and muscle weakness. People who rarely go outside in the summer, those whoalways cover their skin when they do go out, black and ethnicminority groups, adults aged 65 years or over, pregnant andbreastfeeding women and children under the age of 4 are atrisk of vitamin D deficiency. For more information aboutvitamin D and those groups recommended to take vitamin Dsupplements, see page 47.Vitamin E is involved in a number of body processes andprotects cell walls as it acts as an antioxidant.Vitamin K is important for bone health, wound healing andblood clotting.Foods it is found in (See also Appendix 2.)Vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, which is only found in animal foods, and carotene, the yellow or orange pigment found in fruit andvegetables (both those colouredyellow or orange and in manygreen ones where the orangecolour is masked by chlorophyllpigment). Vitamin A is found in: liver* liver p\u00e2t\u00e9* carrots and other orange foods such as sweet potatoes mango, melon and apricots (dried or fresh) green leafy vegetables such as spinach, watercress and broccoli tomatoes red peppers.Oily fish such as tuna, salmon and pilchards Egg yolkLiver*, liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 *Some fortified breakfast cerealsMargarines Plant oils such as soya, corn and olive oil Nuts and seedsWheatgerm in bread and cerealsWe can make vitamin K in the bodybut it is also found in green leafyvegetables such as broccoli andspinach, and in vegetable oils andcereals. Small amounts can also befound in meat (such as pork) anddairy foods (such as cheese). * As these foods can contain high levels of vitamin A, it is suggested that theyare not eaten more than once a week. Anyone who is pregnant should avoideating liver and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (and avoid dietary supplements which containvitamin A), as very high vitamin A intakes may damage the fetus.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4243 Principles of good nutritionB vitamins -thiamin,riboflavinand niacin Folate Vitamin B 6 Vitamin B 12Thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are particularly important forthe brain and nervous system. The body also needs thesevitamins to be able to use the energy (calories) in food. Folates are a group of compounds, found in foods, whichcollectively are known as 'folate' or 'folic acid'. Folate is anessential vitamin for many body processes, including formingred blood cells, making new cells, and using protein in thebody. Deficiency can lead to a particular type of anaemiaknown as megaloblastic anaemia. Also, low folic acid intakesat conception and in early pregnancy are associated with anincreased risk of neural tube defect births (such as spinabifida).Vitamin B 6is the name given to a whole group of substances that are commonly found in both animal and vegetable foodsand which are involved in a number of body processesinvolving amino acids (the protein building blocks). Vitamin B 12interacts with folate and vitamin B 6. Together these vitamins help the body to build up its own protein,especially for nervous tissue and red blood cells.Thiamin and niacinBread and other foods made with flourBreakfast cerealsPork (including bacon and ham)Offal such as liver* and kidneyOily fishYeast extract (such as marmite)NutsPotatoesRiboflavinMilk and milk products such as yoghurt and cheese Meat, offal* and poultryOily fish (such as tuna, salmon or sardines) EggsGreen leafy vegetables and salads Oranges and other citrus fruitsLiver Yeast extract Foods which have been fortified including breakfast cereals andsome breads Bran flakesRed meatPoultryLiver*Oily fishPotatoesBananasNutsPeanut butterDried fruitWhite fishAll animal origin, forexample: meat, white fish, eggs andmilk.Some other foods are fortified withvitamin B 12, such as fortified breakfast cereals, and drinks such as fortifiedblackcurrant drinks.

The body needs vitamin C toproduce and maintain collagen, the foundation material forbones, teeth, skin and tendons. It is also important in woundhealing. It is suggested that vitamin C also has a role as anantioxidant vitamin in preventing damage to cells and tissues.Vitamin C also helps the body to absorb iron in the diet ifboth nutrients are present in the same meal. Iron is an essential part of the pigment in red blood cellscalled haemoglobin, which carries oxygen. A deficiency in ironwill cause anaemia. In a person with anaemia, the bloodtransports less oxygen for the body's needs and so limits theperson's ability to be physically active. People with anaemia may become pale and tired and theirgeneral health, resistance to infection, and vitality will beimpaired. Sometimes there are no apparent symptoms andanaemia may be undetected. Iron deficiency during periods ofrapid brain growth during childhood can impair brain functionand iron-deficient children do less well in both motor andmental development tests. Sufficient iron in pregnancy is alsoimportant to ensure a healthy term baby.Some women may have higher needs for iron and mayrequire an iron supplement. Always seek advice from amedical practitioner about iron supplementation and keepiron supplements (as with all medicines and vitaminsupplements) out of the reach of children.Calcium is needed for building bones and keeping themstrong, for transmitting nerve impulses and muscle actionsand for many other body functions. Adequate calcium intakes(and vitamin D production) during childhood, adolescenceand young adulthood are essential for long-term bone health.Older people are advised to ensure they have good sources ofcalcium in their diet every day. Zinc plays a major role in the functioning of every organ in thebody. It is needed for growth and development, and fornormal metabolism of protein, fat and carbohydrate, and it isassociated with insulin, the hormone which regulates thebody's energy. Zinc is also involved in the immune system, the use of vitaminA, and in wound healing. Most fruit and vegetables and freshjuices.Good sources include: citrus fruits such as oranges green vegetables such as broccoli and green peppers potatoes blackcurrants and strawberries. Some drinks are also fortified withvitamin C. There are two forms of iron in foods: haem iron, and non-haem iron. Haem iron is found in foods of animalorigin such as beef, lamb, chicken andturkey, liver and kidney, and in somefish such as sardines and tuna. Haemiron is absorbed into the body moreeasily than non-haem iron. Non-haem iron is found in foods ofplant origin including cereal foods likebread, pulses (such as peas, beansand lentils), dried fruits and greenvegetables. It is also found in fortifiedbreakfast cereals.

Minerals29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4445 Chapter Copper Iodine Magnesium PhosphorusPotassium SeleniumSalt (sodium chloride) is the main source of dietary sodium.Sodium is essential for fluid balance, but too much sodium isassociated with raised blood pressure in later life, and this is arisk factor for heart disease and stroke. There is also evidencethat people who are obese may be particularly sensitive to theeffect that salt has in raising blood pressure.People who regularly eat snack foods such as crisps or saltednuts, processed meats (such as salami or ham), cheese andtinned foods such as beans or spaghetti in sauce are gettingfar more salt than they need. Copper is an essential component of many substances whichcontrol body functions. We do not yet know whether thehealth of those with low intakes is affected. No tests are yetavailable to make this assessment. Iodine helps to make thyroid hormones necessary formaintaining the metabolic rate. Iodine deficiency is now rarein the UK but is still common in many areas of the world. Magnesium is important for the development of the skeletonand for maintaining nerve and muscle function. About 80% of the phosphorus in the body is present in thebones, and phosphorus, with calcium, provides rigidity to theskeleton. Potassium helps to regulate body fluids and blood pressureand also has a role in nerve and muscle function. Selenium is involved in the mechanism which protects thebody from damage inside the individual cells due to oxidation.Low intakes of selenium are associated with increased risks ofheart disease and some cancers. Foods to which salt is added inprocessing or preparation - forexample, sauces, soups, processedmeat and fish products, some cannedfoods, bacon, ham, sausage, smokedcheese or smoked fish, crisps andother snacks, and some cereal foods.(For example, some breakfast cerealsand breads are very high in salt, andmany biscuits and other bakeryproducts also have a high saltcontent.) Take-away and fast foods such aspizzas, burgers and coated chickenproducts are also likely to be high insalt.Fresh meat and poultry, and all freshand frozen fruit and vegetables, arelow in sodium.Copper is found in a wide variety offoods, particularly in vegetables, fishand liver.

Water is vital to many functions in thebody including the maintenance of cell structure, thephysical transport of other nutrients and oxygen throughthe body via the bloodstream, the transport of white bloodcells to fight infection via the lymphatic system, andenabling the body to get rid of waste products via theexcretory systems, such as through the formation of urine.Water is lost from the body as urine, in faeces and byevaporation from the skin and lungs, and more water is lostfrom the skin and lungs in high temperatures, at highaltitude and when the air is dry. The amount of waterrequired by the body can vary markedly depending, for Food is an important part of our lives. In order to get allthe nutrients needed for good health, it is essential to eat avariety of different foods every day. The Government's Balance of Good Health plate below shows the five food groups and the balance to aim for.Water The Balance of Good Health Balance of Good Health Fruit and vegetables Eat at least five portions of fruitand vegetables a day.Bread, other cereals and potatoes Eat lots of these. Milk and dairy foods Eat or drink moderateamounts of these. Chooselower fat versions wheneveryou can. Foods containing fat and foods containing sugar Eat only small amounts of foods containing fat.

Ifsomeone breathes through their mouth, sweats a lot or hasa high temperature, they will have increased requirementsfor fluid and should seek advice on the amount appropriate to their needs.

High-fat diets and increasing lifespan of people withlearning disabilities, combined with obesity and low activitylevels, have been linked to the reported increases ofcoronary heart disease seen in people with learningdisabilities. 5Heart disease is the second highest cause of death in people with learning disabilities (accounting forbetween 14% and 22% of deaths 6), but the rate is lower than that seen in the general population, possibly due toreduced life expectancy. 7 Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the UKand the most common cause of severe disability, 8but there do not appear to be any statistics directly relating to theincidence of stroke among people with learning disabilities.The current high levels of salt habitually consumed by theUK population increase the risk of high blood pressure,which increases the risk of stroke and premature deathfrom cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease andstroke). It is currently recommended that the adultpopulation as a whole would benefit from reducing theirintake of salt from about 10g a day to 6g a day. 9 What can help to prevent coronary heart disease and stroke? Eating a diet which is rich in fruits and vegetables andwholegrain cereal foods, and which has moderate amountsof fat, sugar and salt, is recommended for reducing the riskof coronary heart disease. Everyone is encouraged to haveoil-rich fish (such as salmon, trout, herring, mackerel orsardines) at least once a week. Useful information abouthow to eat well to protect your heart can be found on theBritish Heart Foundation website www.bhf.org.uk. Bone disorders What do we know about bone disorders among people with learning disabilities? Fractures and vitamin D insufficiency are relatively commonin people with learning disabilities, although there is notnecessarily a correlation between the two. 10, 11People with learning disabilities are also reported as having highprevalence of low bone mineral density, and those who areimmobile are reported as being at greater risk of both lowbone mineral density 12and vitamin D insufficiency.10Lowlevels of vitamin D are particularly common among thosewith learning disabilities in long-term care wards, 13 suggesting that people who may be less likely to gooutside are at particular risk. Taking oral vitamin Dsupplements has been found to restore normal vitamin Dlevels among those with low levels of the vitamin, 10and it has been suggested that this be considered for people withlittle exposure to sunshine. 13Research among children with Down's syndrome who had low vitamin D status has shownthat adequate exposure to sunshine restores their vitaminD levels. 14 Osteoporosis is an abnormal loss of bone density. It isgenerally associated with post-menopause, a sedentarylifestyle and long-term use of steroids. It is also linked topoor diet, small body size, Down's syndrome, under-activityof the ovaries or testes, and high phosphate levels infemales. 11The reduction of oestrogen at menopause means that women (particularly those with Down'ssyndrome) are at increased risk of osteoporosis. One studyof hospital patients found that those with learningdisabilities had poorer bone density than patients withoutlearning disabilities 15- suggesting that those with learning disabilities are at greater risk of osteoporosis. Low bone density has also been found in children andadults with cerebral palsy, particularly if they arechairbound. This may be due to low calcium intakes, 16 decreased exposure to the sun, immobility, and druginteractions, all of which make vitamin D metabolism lesseffective. 17 What can help to prevent bone disorders? To minimise the possibility of low bone density, people withlearning disabilities should be encouraged to be as mobileas possible, to spend time outside in the summer sunshinesafely, and to ensure adequate vitamin D and calciumintakes. Anyone with a learning disability who has littleregular exposure to summer sunshine would benefit fromvitamin D supplementation, as would young children, andpregnant and breastfeeding women. All those who live inresidential care and all older adults (aged 65 years or more)should also be considered for vitamin D supplementation.Families, friends, support staff, and people with learningdisabilities themselves, are encouraged to seek advice froma medical practitioner on the most suitable form of vitaminD supplementation, since some over-the-counter medicinesmay be of variable strength or may not be easily tolerated. People with learning disabilities who are at an increased riskof falling are at particular risk of fracture, and a holisticapproach to their care with careful risk assessment from amulti-disciplinary team as part of the care planning isrequired to ensure that sufficient preventative strategies29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4748 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionare put in place and that adequate calcium and vitamin Dintakes are ensured. Cancer What do we know about cancer among people with learning disabilities? In the past it has been reported that the incidence ofcancer is lower among people with learning disabilitiesthan the rest of the population, but that the types ofcancer experience differ. 18 However, more recent evidence suggests that among people with Down's syndrome theoverall risk of cancer is the same as for the rest of thepopulation, 19and that some people with learning disabilities are at particular risk of certain types of cancer.20 Some individual cancers are more common among peoplewith learning disabilities (eg. leukaemia and testicularcancer in people with Down's syndrome), while others areless common (eg. breast cancer in people with Down'ssyndrome). For people who have both a learning disabilityand mental ill health, rates of some cancers may be higher.For example, women with schizophrenia are one and a halftimes more likely to get breast cancer than other women,and people with schizophrenia are almost twice as likely toget bowel cancer. 20A higher proportion of cancers in people with learning disabilities affect the intestinal tractsuch as the oesophagus, stomach and gall bladder 21and there is evidence that cancers of the intestinal tract arelinked to lower intakes of fruits, vegetables and fibre 22and higher rates of helicobacter pylori infection which can cause gastritis, and peptic and gastric ulcers.23Mortality rates from stomach cancer have been reported to behigher among people living in community settings thanamong the general population. This may be due to agreater prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection which is more commonly observed among people who have beenmoved from institutions to residential or community carethan among the general population. What can help? The possibility of helicobacter pylori infection should be considered in health checks. A diet rich in fruits, vegetablesand higher-fibre carbohydrates, with moderate amounts offat and alcohol, is also recommended to prevent cancer.Infections, immune function and recoveryfrom illness and surgery among peoplewith learning disabilities What do we know about these issues in people with learning disabilities? Infections are common among people with learningdisabilities and respiratory infections have been reportedto be more common among people with Down'ssyndrome, 24Prader-Willi syndrome25and among those with more severe disabilities where swallowing difficultiesmay lead to aspiration. 26Urinary tract infections have been reported to affect 5.6% of women with learningdisabilities, with the highest prevalence among thoseaged 55-64 years. 27Living in a group setting has also been linked to a greater risk of infections. What can help? It is well established that good nutrition plays animportant role in the immune system and that optimumnutrition is associated with shorter hospital stays andfewer infections among hospitalised patients. 28There is significant evidence that adequate nutrient intakes areessential for those recovering from illness and surgery astissue repair requires increased energy and nutrients. 29 The nutrients particularly linked to the immune systemare zinc and vitamin C. For more on these see page 44.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4849 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionEating well Children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should wherever possible be encouraged by family, friends and support staff to eat a varied diet. They should eat foods from each of the four main foodgroups every day to ensure they get all the nutrients they need. The four main food groups are:- bread, pasta, other cereals (such as rice), and potatoes and other starchy roots (such as yam)- fruit and vegetables- milk and dairy foods such as yoghurt and cheese- meat, fish and meat alternatives such as eggs, peas, beans and lentils, soya and nuts. Fruit and vegetables are particularly important for good health. Everyone should be encouraged to eat at least 5 portions of a variety of different fruits and vegetables every day. Most people in the UK eat too much fat, saturated fat and sugar. Foods which are high in fat and sugar (particularly snacks) can contribute to overweight and obesity if they are eaten frequently or in largeamounts. Many people with learning disabilities, and in particular those who are overweight or obese,should be encouraged to replace fatty and sugary foods, drinks and snacks with more fruit and vegetablesand other lower-fat and lower-sugar alternatives. Most people in the UK eat too much salt and this can contribute to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Most people are encouraged to reduce the amount of high-salt foods and snacks they eat and to reduce the amount of salt they use in cooking and at the table. Adults are encouraged to eat a portion of oily fish each week - for example, salmon, trout, mackerel, herring or sardines - since the long-chain fats in oil-rich fish have been shown to help with heart health.There is no equivalent food suitable for vegetarians, but a diet which is rich in wholegrain cereals, peas,beans and lentils, vegetables and fruit will contribute to a diet low in fat and saturated fat and high incomplex carbohydrates and fibre which is recommended to prevent heart disease. Bone health To minimise the possibility of low bone density, people with learning disabilities should be as mobile as possible, spend time outside in the summer sunshine safely, and have adequate vitamin D and calciumintakes. Anyone with a learning disability who has little regular exposure to summer sunshine, young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, those who live in residential care and all older adults (aged 65 years ormore) should be considered for vitamin D supplementation. Where this is the case, advice should be soughtfrom a medical practitioner. People with learning disabilities who are at increased risk of falling and fracturing their bones should be assessed by a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that sufficient strategies are put in place to prevent falls andthat adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes are ensured.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 4950 Chapter 3 Principles of good nutritionReferences 1 Department of Health (1991) Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom.

There is very little data which describes typical food andnutrient intakes among people with learning disabilities. Thereis, however, considerable evidence to suggest that adults withlearning disabilities are more likely to be either underweight oroverweight than the general population, and body weightissues are looked at in detail in chapter 5. Gastrointestinaldisorders, swallowing difficulties and oral health also impactthroughout the lifespan and are dealt with in detail in chapter 6.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 5152 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesInfants The nutritional needs of infants are very specific, andadvice about infant feeding is available from midwives,health visitors and other health professionals. Exclusivebreastfeeding is the best way to feed babies, and for thefirst 6 months a baby can receive all his or her nutritionalrequirements from breast milk alone. Supporting women tobreastfeed and finding innovative ways to ensure that allinfants receive breast milk, regardless of their mother'sdisability or any disability in the child, should be seen as apriority. Breast milk is hygienic, easily digested andnutritionally unique, and contains important antibodies tohelp babies fight infections. Breastfeeding can also protectwomen from some diseases of later life. 1Women with learning disabilities should be offered specific and tailoredsupport to help them breastfeed their infants if they wishto do this. Some infants with learning disabilities may havefeeding difficulties and this may lead to 'failure to thrive',which means they are not growing as well as other childrenof their age. Mothers of learning-disabled infants should beaware that they may experience feeding difficulties andshould be offered tailored support to help with breast-feeding as well as emotional and practical support ifbreastfeeding is unsuccessful. For information on resourceson breastfeeding, see page 155 in Appendix 4. Learning disability manifests itself in the developing child asslower development through typical milestones - forexample, a failure at 6 months to show interest in theirsurroundings or to attempt to sit up and grasp objects.Diagnosis of learning disability is rarely possible, and with afew exceptions, unwise in the first 6 months of life. Themost important exception is infants born with Down'ssyndrome. Once learning disability has been confirmed, a multi-disciplinary team of health professionals will be able tosupport the family, and where there are dietary-relatedproblems a paediatric dietitian will be consulted. Too littleor too much weight gain may be seen if babies are weanedtoo early, or weaned onto the wrong types of foods, or ifthey are fed inappropriately during their first year. Weaningmeans the introduction of complementary foods to babiesin addition to milk. It is currently recommended that babiesare weaned at about 6 months of age. Whencomplementary foods are introduced, the following pointsare important. No salt should be added. No sugar should be added. The first foods recommended are: smooth rice or oat cereals; potato or other root vegetables; a variety of fruitand vegetable pur\u00e9es; and pur\u00e9ed beans, peas, lentils,meat or fish. A variety of tastes should be introduced and, as babies become more confident at taking food from a spoon,soft, minced and chopped food can be given rather thanpur\u00e9es, as well as finger foods for babies to chew on suchas rice cakes or pieces of vegetable or fruit. It is important that parents are given guidance oninappropriate foods, and on portion sizes and mealtimebehaviour and that they are aware of safety issues such asnever leaving a baby or child alone with food. It is important that all parents, guardians and other carers,regardless of their own disability or any disability recognisedin their child, receive careful and individually tailored adviceon nutrition for babies in the first year of life. This isparticularly important if one or both parents have alearning disability. For information on vitamin drops for infants, see page 53.For more detailed information on infant feeding andweaning, see the Caroline Walker Trust publication Eating Well for Under-5s in Child Care (details on inside front cover). Children Eating well and being active in the early years are essentialfor proper growth and development. This is true for allchildren, regardless of whether they have a learning orphysical disability or not. It is the responsibility of everyonewho cares for and supports young children that thechildren are exposed to good experiences around food andencouraged to develop positive attitudes to good nutritionand physical activity. It is recommended that all parentsand other carers of children with learning disabilities, andall parents with learning disabilities themselves, are givenappropriate information on eating well for their children, toensure that they can establish appropriate eating habitsand prevent underweight or overweight and othernutritionally-related health problems in later years. Some ofthe key points to consider when helping children to eatwell are outlined below. Children with learning disabilities Various research studies have examined the nutritionalstatus of children with learning disabilities. Children withdisabilities and neurological impairment (conditions whichimpact on the brain and spinal cord, including cerebralpalsy, brain injury and epilepsy) have been shown to havenutritional problems, and in particular insufficient energyintake which can impact on growth. 2Stunting (being shorter than would be expected) and wasting (beingthinner than expected) have both been reported in childrenwith disabilities. 2Micronutrient deficiencies - including29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 5253 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesdeficiencies of calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, riboflavin andthiamin - have been reported in children withdevelopmental disability and may be under-recognised. 3 Nutritional problems are more likely among children withmore severe disabilities and, where there are feedingdifficulties and children rely on a milk-based diet, it is morelikely that they will get insufficient amounts of othernutrients, particularly iron. 2Children with learning disabilities may have some particular difficulties aroundeating and drinking, such as difficulty controlling food orfluid in their mouth, mouth sensitivity (where the child hasan exaggerated response to touch in the mouth or aroundthe face), or difficulty managing cutlery. Advice onmanaging eating difficulties can be found in chapter 9.Parents of children with disabilities and eating difficultieshave reported that meat, fruits and vegetables are oftenavoided and this can have a particular impact on iron andzinc intakes. 2For information about the importance of iron and zinc see page 44.It is recommended that all children between 1 and 4 yearsreceive daily vitamin drops (containing vitamins A, C, D).These are free to beneficiaries under the Healthy Startscheme. Information on vitamins can be obtained fromhealth visitors or the Healthy Start website onwww.healthystart.nhs.uk. Children with learning disabilities want to be treated likeother children and to be included in ordinary activities. 4All children with special needs should be encouraged to eatthe same healthy diet and, wherever possible, do this in thesame way as other children they are with. Advice onhelping very young children to eat well can be obtainedfrom a paediatric dietitian (see Where to get advice about eating well on page 151). For more information on drinks for children, see page 84.For information on healthy eating for children up to theage of five and for school-aged children, see the CarolineWalker Trust publications Eating Well for Under-5s in Child Care andEating Well at School (see inside front cover). Key issues for eating well among children Children should be encouraged to eat a varied diet. They should eat foods from each of the four main food groups every day. The four main food groups are: bread, other cereals and potatoes fruit and vegetables milk and dairy foods, and meat, fish and meat alternatives such as eggs, peas, beans and lentils, soya and nuts. Fruit and vegetables are particularly important for good health. Children should be encouraged to have at least 5 portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables a day. Vitamin C is important in maintaining good health and may have a role in helping the body to absorb iron if both nutrients are present in the same meal. Children should be encouraged to eat foods containing vitamin Cat meals. Vitamin C is found, for example, in most fruit and fruit juices, potatoes, broccoli and other greenvegetables, tomatoes and peppers. It is recommended that children aged 1 to 4 years should receive vitamin drops containing vitamins A, C and D. The iron and zinc intake of children is lower than currently recommended and there is evidence to suggest that low iron and zinc status is common in this age group. Children should therefore eat a diet that is high in iron-rich and zinc-rich foods such as meat, poultry and fish, as well as cereals and some vegetables. Children who donot eat meat should have a varied diet containing foods such as cereals, pulses (peas, beans and lentils),vegetables and fruits.The intakes of the type of sugars in the diet which most contribute to tooth decay are higher than recommended among children. If children have sugary foods and drinks, these should be given with mealsrather than as snacks between meals. Children do not need sugary foods or drinks - such as sweets, chocolate,soft drinks or honey - for energy. Starchy foods - such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and yam - are bettersources of energy as these foods contain other important nutrients too. Children should be encouraged to be physically active and it is important to fit activity into children's daily routines throughout the year. Physical activity helps to ensure that children eat enough food and get all thenutrients they need. It also builds up muscle strength and overall fitness, develops physical skills such as balanceand coordination, and provides a release for children's energy.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 5354 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesTeenagers The teenage years are characterised by a move to greaterindependence for almost all children as they forge theirown identities and make more decisions about their ownlifestyle. Teenage is often seen as a time of rebellion andexperimentation with food and this may impact on foodchoices leading to, for example, irregular eating habits,increased snacking or grazing, missed meals,unconventional meals and an increase in the consumptionof fast food, soft drinks and confectionery as teenagersbecome more financially responsible for their foodchoices. 5Many young people with learning disabilities will be faced with the same pressures as other teenagers toadopt a more risk-taking lifestyle and it has been suggestedthat teenagers with low self-esteem and less hope for theirown futures are more likely to adopt behaviours which puttheir health at risk. 6 As young people with particular health needs grow olderand move away from specialist child healthcare provision,family, friends and support staff may find it more difficultto access services which will help to support olderteenagers and young adults to eat well and be active.Teenagers are at risk of weight gain when they have greateraccess to food and if they become less active, so this canbe a crucial time to develop good eating habits and doregular physical activity where possible, both of which willhelp to prevent other physical health difficulties. It isimportant that each person's nutritional needs areconsidered whenever their health is reviewed. If youngpeople develop a circle of friends or supporters in theirteenage years, it is useful if those friends and supportersare aware of the importance of healthy eating and activityso that they can encourage the young person to eat welland be active. Pregnancy It is widely acknowledged that a healthy diet duringpregnancy optimises the health of the mother and theinfant. There are some important nutritional and healthmessages associated with pregnancy and all women shouldbe offered appropriate advice on eating and drinking wellthroughout their pregnancy. For women with learningdisabilities, it is important that the advice is specificallytailored to their particular condition and geared to theirlevel of understanding. It is very important that women with learning disabilitiesattend all the appointments made available to them withhealth professionals throughout their pregnancy so thatthey can be supported appropriately. Those with learningdisabilities should be enabled to access that support. Thosecaring for or supporting women with learning disabilitieswho are or who may become pregnant should ensure thatmedical advice is, at all times, accessible and accessed.Women with learning disabilities who are planning apregnancy, and those who may become pregnant (that is,if they are sexually active and not using contraception)should take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms of folicacid before pregnancy and during the first 12 weeks ofpregnancy. Women who have a history of neural tubedefect or diabetes mellitus, or who take anti-convulsantdrugs, should talk to a health professional about theamount of folic acid they need, as they have greater needsthan other women. Folic acid is essential for the earlydevelopment of the fetus and for preventing thedevelopment of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.(See Folate on page 43.) Women should take a supplement of vitamin D duringpregnancy. Vitamin D is essential for ensuring healthybones for both the mother and the infant. Advice shouldalways be sought from a health professional on whichvitamin D supplements are appropriate and how much ofany supplement the woman should take. Women who receive Income Support or income-basedJobseeker's Allowance, and some women who receivefamily tax credits, are entitled to free vitamins - whichcontain folic acid, vitamin C and vitamin D - as part of theHealthy Start programme. More information about who iseligible for free vitamins and about food vouchers inpregnancy can be found on www.healthystart.nhs.uk.Women who are pregnant may also need extra iron andadvice should be sought from a medical practitioner. There are also recommendations about which foods toavoid during pregnancy and women with learningdisabilities who are pregnant should be helped to makegood choices about food and be given accessible and clearinformation about the foods they should avoid whilepregnant. Pregnant women should be advised not to drinkalcohol when they are planning a pregnancy or whenpregnant. If they choose not to follow this advice, theyshould limit their alcohol to no more than one glass of wineonce or twice a week. 7 For women with learning disabilities who are planning apregnancy, pregnant or breastfeeding, drugs should beprescribed cautiously and regular drug reviews carried out,in order to minimise the risk of harm to the fetus or child.Those who prescribe or recommend pharmaceutical drugsto a breastfeeding mother should have access toconsistent, accurate and regularly updated information onthe drug and levels that will pass to the baby, from anexpert or a specialist text or source. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 5455 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesWomen who are overweight or obese before they conceivehave an increased risk of complications during pregnancyand birth which pose health risks to both the mother andbaby. 8Pregnancy may be associated with a permanent increase in maternal body weight, and it has been reportedthat mothers who have a higher body mass index (BMI) pre-pregnancy and who gain significant weight duringpregnancy are more likely to be heavier after pregnancy. 9 Women who are overweight at the start of pregnancyshould be given accessible advice, tailored to their needsand circumstances, on how to eat sensibly duringpregnancy and after they have given birth. All womenshould be encouraged and supported to breastfeed theirinfants (see page 52). Breastfeeding women should beadvised that losing weight through a combination ofhealthy eating and regular physical activity will not affectthe quantity or quality of their milk.For information on resources on pregnancy andbreastfeeding, see page 155 in Appendix 4. Parenthood There is little information about the challenges faced byparents in ensuring healthy food choices for their children,but it is generally acknowledged that the number ofparents with learning disabilities is rising and that theirneeds are not adequately addressed. 10Parents with learning disabilities are far more likely than other parents to havetheir children removed from them and permanently placedoutside the family home. Many learning-disabled parentswill not be in employment and their children will be borninto low-income households. Appropriate help and supportshould be provided to learning-disabled parents to ensurethey know what an appropriate diet for their children iswhen they are infants and small children, and in later yearsknow how to prepare food for their children and how tobudget. For more information on children up to the age offive, see the Caroline Walker Trust publication Eating Well for Under-5s in Child Care (see inside front cover). The menopause Women with learning disabilities have the samemenopausal symptoms as other women, but generallyexperience the menopause earlier - particularly those withDown's syndrome. The symptoms of the menopause canbe particularly distressing for women with learningdisabilities as they may lack the cognitive ability oreducation to understand the implications of themenopause or why they are experiencing symptoms suchas hot flushes and anxiety. Hormone replacement therapy(HRT) is frequently prescribed to relieve the symptoms ofthe menopause, but some women with learning disabilitiesare unlikely to be able to make an informed decision aboutthe treatment. 11Research has shown that most women with learning disabilities are influenced by the beliefs ofthose who care for them about what can aid the symptoms- for example, being given evening primrose oil in themisguided belief that it will relieve symptoms. 11Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetablesand being as active as possible may help to mitigate someof the symptoms associated with the menopause. Old age Older people with learning disabilities are likely to be livingin a variety of settings: a few people remain in long-stayhospitals; some live in group homes, and some in their ownhomes or in sheltered accommodation; and some peoplelive in residential care designed for all older people. Some'younger' older people are living with their families. Somecontinue to use specialist services for people with learningdisabilities which allow them to 'age in place' and remain infamiliar surroundings with people they know. Others moveto using generic services for older people, although oftenat an earlier age than for other older people. 12The increased longevity of people with learning disabilities andtheir growing numbers will put additional stresses on familycarers in particular and it is essential that adequate supportis planned for both older carers and the people they carefor. There will also be an increasing number of older peoplewith learning disabilities from ethnic minority groups in thecoming years, and it is important that the needs of thisgroup around food are built into care planning strategiesboth in the community and in residential care.Older people with learning disabilities are at risk of thesame age-related physiological changes as the generalolder population and the nutritional needs of older peoplehave been summarised in the Caroline Walker Trust report Eating Well for Older People . There is some evidence that, as people with learning disabilities age, many behaviouralproblems and disorders appear to decrease, and increasesin behaviour problems tend to be associated with the onset of dementia rather than with the learning disability itself. 13For information on coronary heart disease, bone disorders and cancer, see page 47.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:48 Page 5556 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesOlder people are at greater risk of depression and this maybe a particular problem among those with learningdisabilities if they have poor communication or verbal skills.In the general older population there is usually a goodoutlook once depression is treated, but there is someevidence that, among older people with learningdisabilities, mental ill health can be more persistent. 13The mental health needs of older people with learningdisabilities have been reported to be overlooked andunmet and this is likely to be an increasing problem as thispopulation ages. 13 Many older people with learning disabilities have verylimited social networks and few opportunities to useordinary leisure provision in the community. Many peoplewith learning disabilities in residential care for older peoplehave impoverished lives with few opportunities to get out,and are socially isolated. 14This is in marked contrast to the experiences of many non-learning-disabled people who, asthey grow older, take up new hobbies and other leisurepursuits. People with learning disabilities need support toshare these opportunities and it is essential that learningdisability services are better equipped to meet age-relatedneeds. Provision for people with learning disabilities who developdementia is a key area of concern. People with Down'ssyndrome are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer'sdisease and will do so at a younger than average age. 15 However, in the case of people with learning disabilitiesother than Down's syndrome, the prevalence ofAlzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are nogreater than for the rest of the population. A number ofstudies and action research projects are currently underwayto identify ways in which family carers and residential andday services can best support people with dementia. 12The nutritional needs of older people with dementia, who mayhave more problems with eating and drinking, have beenconsidered in the report Eating Well for Older People with Dementia . (Details of this and other useful resources about growing older with a learning disability are given on page 154.) End of life Caring for people at the end of their lives is an importantrole for health and social care professionals. End-of-life carerequires an active, compassionate approach that treats,comforts and supports individuals who are living with ordying from progressive or chronic life-threateningconditions. Such care is sensitive to personal, cultural andspiritual values, beliefs and practices and encompassessupport for families and friends up to and including theperiod of bereavement. One of the key elements tosupport people at the end of their lives is to find out whattheir preferences and wishes are in relation to how theywould like to be cared for. End-of-life planning for peoplewith learning disabilities should be given the same care andattention as it is for any other member of society. Usefulinformation on end-of-life planning can be found athttp://www.endoflifecare.nhs.uk/eolc. There are frequentlyspecific issues around food and drink at end of life and it isessential that issues around nutrition and hydration andoverall patient comfort at end of life are carefully discussedwith all those involved in end-of-life planning for anindividual. Nutrition and pregnancy All pregnant women should ensure that they attend all the appointments made available to them with health professionals throughout their pregnancy, so that they can be supported appropriately. Pregnantwomen with learning disabilities should be enabled to obtain and attend such appointments and sufficientsupport should be provided at those appointments to ensure that they can access the information orrecommendations made on how to eat well and on the foods they need to avoid while pregnant. Women with learning disabilities who are planning a pregnancy, and those who may become pregnant (that is, if they are sexually active and not using contraception) should take a daily supplement of 400 microgramsof folic acid before pregnancy and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women who have a history ofneural tube defect or diabetes mellitus, or who take anti-convulsant drugs, should talk to a healthprofessional about the amount of folic acid they need, as they have greater needs than other women. Women should take a supplement of vitamin D during pregnancy. For pregnant women, Healthy Start vitamins, which contain vitamin D (as well as folic acid and vitamin C), are available free to beneficiariesthrough the Healthy Start scheme. Women who are not entitled to free vitamins are advised to consult ahealth professional about the appropriate vitamin D supplement to take during pregnancy.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:48 Page 5657 Chapter 4 Nutrition through the lifespan for children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesFor women with learning disabilities who are planning a pregnancy, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding, drugs should be prescribed cautiously and regular drug reviews carried out, in order to minimise the risk ofharm to the fetus or child. Pregnant women with learning disabilities should be counselled about the importance of avoiding alcohol during pregnancy since this has been associated with increased risk of a baby being born with a learningdisability. Women with learning disabilities who are overweight at the start of pregnancy should be given accessible advice, tailored to their needs and circumstances, on how to eat sensibly during pregnancy and after theyhave given birth. Infant nutrition Supporting women with learning disabilities to breastfeed, and finding innovative ways to ensure that all infants receive breast milk - regardless of their mother's disability or any disability in the child - should beseen as a priority. Breast milk is hygienic, easily digested and nutritionally unique, and contains importantantibodies to help babies fight infections. Breastfeeding can also protect women from some diseases of laterlife. Women with learning disabilities should be offered specific and tailored support to help thembreastfeed their infants if they wish to do this. All parents and carers of infants with learning disabilities should be given advice and on-going support on infant feeding and weaning so that they can establish appropriate eating patterns in their children which willpromote good nutritional health in later life. All parents who have learning disabilities themselves should be given clear, accessible advice and on-going support on how to feed and wean their infants appropriately. Breastfed babies over 6 months of age and all children between 1 and 4 years should receive daily vitamin drops (containing vitamins A, C and D). Vitamin drops containing vitamins A, C and D for children from theage of 6 months until their 4th birthday are available free to beneficiaries under the Healthy Start scheme(www.healthystart.nhs.uk). Nutritional needs of children and young people All parents and other carers of children with learning disabilities, and all parents with learning disabilities who have children themselves, should be given appropriate information on eating well for their children, toensure that they can prevent underweight and overweight and establish appropriate eating habits for theirchildren to prevent nutritionally-related ill health in later life. Children with learning disabilities who eat a poor variety of foods - for example, because they are very selective or because they have eating difficulties - may be at greater risk of nutritional insufficiency, andcare should be taken that sources of important nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, zinc and calciumare included in the diet regularly. The teenage years can be a critical time for weight gain or dietary change among young people with learning disabilities as they gain greater independence in food choice. Young people with learningdisabilities should wherever possible be encouraged to be active and eat a varied diet.

Identifying underweight andoverweight There is considerable evidence that many people with learningdisabilities have inappropriate body weights - eitherunderweight or overweight. However, it is not always easy totell if people are too thin, and it can be difficult to know if aperson's weight gain is impacting on their health andwellbeing. In order to measure people's body weight we rely onsome simple measurements which we describe below. Growth charts Growth charts are used to ensure that children are growingappropriately. Special growth charts (height, weight and headcircumference) are available for boys and girls with Down'ssyndrome from birth to 5 years, based on data from around1,100 healthy children with Down's syndrome living in the UKand Ireland. 1There are also specific height charts available for children with Turner syndrome from the same source.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 5960 Chapter 5 Weight management Table 1 Classification of weight among adults Classification BMI (kg/m2) Underweight Less than 18.5 Normal weight 18.5-24.9 Overweight 25.0-29.9Obese 30.0 or over Class I 30.0-34.9Class II 35.0-39.9 Class III 40.0 or over Source: NICE, 20063 The use of BMI as a measure of fatness does not take intoaccount fat distribution or differing body composition (forexample, the percentage of muscle). 4There are no predetermined correction factors available specifically foruse with those with Down's syndrome, who tend to beshorter compared to the general population. 5Also, BMI may not be appropriate for those who are disabled throughmissing or withered limbs, who have muscle wasting orwho have abnormal anatomy or body functions. 6However, BMI remains the measurement of choice for the populationas a whole. Waist measurements Another simple way to show health risks associated withoverweight is to take waist measurements. This can oftenbe the most straightforward way of alerting someone totheir increased body weight, although care has to be takenwith anyone who may have an inappropriate waistmeasurement for other reasons (eg. related to the use ofmedicines or to another illness). Also, these measurementshave not been validated in a learning-disabled population,so they should only be seen as a general guide. Themeasurement of waist circumference is also a measure ofrisk for conditions such as coronary heart disease.The correct position for measuring the waist is at the levelof the belly button. The waist circumference measurementfor men and women at which there is an increased relativerisk is defined as follows: Healthy waist Risk to health Men Up to 40 inches (102cm) 40 inches (102cm) or more Women Up to 35 inches (88cm) 35 inches (88cm) or more Tools to help monitor weight It is important that support staff are able both to easilymonitor weight change and to act on changesappropriately. There are a number of tools to help with thisand we suggest that tools are used both to measureweight and to consider nutritional status (see page 154). A simple tool has been developed for use with people withlearning disabilities. It allows support staff to plot a person'sweight on a chart and, with input from a healthprofessional, lines can be added which show whenattention should be sought for an inappropriate weight. An example of this simple weight chart is shown below,and a blank version of it with instructions for completing itis given in Appendix 3. Body mass index Deviations from 'ideal weight' are most commonly definedin terms of body mass index, or BMI. This is calculated bydividing a person's weight (in kilos) by the square of theirheight (in metres). The classification of weight amongadults by NICE (the National Institute for Health and ClinicalExcellence) is shown in Table 1 below. This classificationaccords with the World Health Organization classification ofoverweight and obesity. 2 Weight monitoring chart Name Address Date of birth Height Weight BMI GP Aims Adapted from: Mental Health Group, The British Dietetic Association, 2006 1Weight: mark the weight in kilos Date Monthly measurements: mark the date for each measurementStarting weightPlot each measurement on the black vertical lineTerry Woods 12-12-64 1.65 70kg 90kg 88 86 84 82 80kg 78 76 74 72 70kg 68 66 64 62 60kg 58 56 54 5250 10 June 06 12 July 06 15 Aug 06 18 Sept 06 15 Oct 06 14 Nov 06 13 Dec 06 16 Jan 07 14 Feb 07 13 Mar 07 12 April 07 11 May 07Maximum Minimum29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6061 Chapter 5 Weight management experience of underweight and even that some supportstaff accept smallness and resist change as the person theycare for may be easier to manage if he or she remainsunderweight. 10Challenging the perception of what are normal body weights for people with learning disabilities isessential and it is important that health professionals inparticular are given clear information on the 'normal'growth and development that should be expected amongpeople with learning disabilities, and the importance ofintervention if an individual is below a healthy body weightfor their height. Why does underweight matter? Significant underweight is associated with increasedsusceptibility to infection and reduced ability to performphysical tasks. 11Undernutrition is related to increased mortality, increased risk of bone fracture, increased risk ofinfections and an increased risk of specific nutrientdeficiencies which can lead to a variety of health-relatedconditions that can greatly affect quality of life. Suddendeath from respiratory illness typifies the end-of-life storyfor people who have insufficient food intake. 10People who are underweight will have weaker muscle tone which canimpact on their ability to do everyday tasks and mayimpact on eating itself. People who are underweight areless likely to be active and this may impact on appetite and,as they are more prone to infection, there is a typical cycleof poor food intake, illness, reduced appetite and furtherreduced food intake that can lead to chronicundernutrition. What to do if someone is underweight It is possible to reverse undernutrition with careful andpatient assistance with eating and drinking or with nutritionsupport (see next page). It is essential that all support staffare alert to undernutrition and are trained to spot the signsthat food intake is inadequate as early as possible. Themain strategies to reverse undernutrition are: keeping weight records and following up if there is unexplained weight loss or if weight drops below anagreed cut-off point for the person keeping records of food eaten and wasted investigation of any underlying medical problems which might be related to weight loss increasing physical activity among those who are able, in order to increase appetite and interest in food (see page66) improving techniques to support people who have eating difficulties (see page 108) offering small meals regularly (for example six smallIt is important that scales used to measure people areaccurate and where possible sitting scales should be used,should be checked regularly and should not be moved. It isuseful if there are discussions with each person about howfrequently weighing should take place and whether weightswill always be taken with clothes on or off. For people whoare chronically constipated, constipation can add 0.5kg to1.5kg of weight and this should be considered whenpotential weight loss or weight change is considered.It has been suggested that a person is potentially at risk ofmalnutrition if they have unplanned weight loss of 5%-10%in the past 3 to 6 months, and is at significant risk if theyhave lost more than 10% of body weight in the past 3 to 6months. 8This would mean, for example: If someone of 60kg had unintentionally lost 3kg in the past 4 months (equivalent to 5% of weight), they may beat risk of malnutrition and should be monitored carefully. If someone of 50kg had unintentionally lost 5kg in the past 3 months (equivalent to 10% of weight) they are athigh risk of malnutrition and advice should be soughtfrom a medical practitioner as a matter of urgency. It is important to remember that, even if people appear tobe normal weight or overweight, they can be at risk ofmalnutrition if they lose a significant amount of weightunintentionally. Underweight What do we know about underweightamong people with learning disabilities? A study of 1,542 adults in supported accommodationfound that 14% of those with learning disabilities wereunderweight (with a BMI less than 20) 6and a review of 25 studies by Gravestock9concluded that between 35% and 72% of those with severe learning disabilities weresignificantly underweight (with a BMI less than 17). This wasmostly confined to those who were immobile, or unable tofeed themselves or tolerate solid foods, or who exhibitedregurgitation, rumination or chronic vomiting. It has beencommon for severe undernutrition to go unrecognised bysupport staff and health professionals, particularly when ithas been longstanding (\"They have always been thin.\") 10 Thinness can appear to be resistant to obvious practiceslike offering more food (\"No matter what we do we can'tget weight on them. They are just like that and always willbe.\") It has also been suggested that maintenance of low weightamong people with learning disabilities has been continuedbecause expectations are based on long-standing29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6162 Chapter 5 Weight management When does dysphagia become an issue? Dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) occurs early in many progressiveneurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease,challenging the usual view that this is a terminalsymptom. 20 Is early dysphagia being identified? Dysphagia is often missed because of poor screening so, when it becomesobvious, it is already at an advanced stage. 21 Are tubes being inserted too late? Any delay in identifying dysphagia means that malnutrition mayalready have developed when the tube is inserted, andthere is evidence that malnourished dementia patientsdo less well after a gastrostomy is inserted than thosewho are not malnourished. 22 Is the re-feeding syndrome being recognised? This syndrome is caused by an imbalance of electrolytes inthe body when food is suddenly reintroduced after aperiod of starvation and is often ignored in researchabout people with learning disabilities, even though thissyndrome can be a cause of death. 23 There is also debate about the risks associated with thesurgical procedure required for the insertion of agastrostomy and the possible increased risk of respiratoryproblems. 24, 25There are also concerns about the loss of the eating experience when nutrition is provided artificially, andthe lack of support given to families and caregivers beforeand after the intervention. While these areas still requirerigorous debate and further research, there is compellingevidence that maintenance of nutritional status throughartificial nutrition support for many individuals can lead tobetter health and may improve quality of life and extendlife. For many children and adults the addition of nutritionsupport does not mean an end to eating and it isimportant that it is not viewed as an either/or scenario inmany cases. Where the provision of food and drink isextremely time-consuming (more than 45 minutes permeal for example), oral nutrition can become very fatiguingfor both the person involved and the caregiver. Nutritionsupport alongside oral support can significantly reduce thetime spent helping someone to eat. Following advice froma speech and language therapist there may be no need todeny the person the social aspects of eating or thepleasant tastes of foods and drinks. Gastrostomy tubes can be hidden under clothing and alsoallow the accurate administration of medication. There arelikely to be fewer battles over nasty-tasting medicine asmedicines given through the gastrostomy bypass thetastebuds altogether. It has been reported that, whilenutritional intake may be effectively maintained amongchildren with a gastrostomy, parents of children withmeals a day) - sometimes called 'little and often' eating exciting the appetite by making food look good and taste good and ensuring meals are served at appropriatetimes, in a calm and happy atmosphere (see page 82) dietary enrichment and supplementation (see pages 134 and 135) artificial nutrition support (see below). Nutrition support When an individual has significant difficulties with eatingand drinking and is no longer able to maintain his or herbody weight by eating and drinking normally, they may beoffered some form of nutrition support. This can be in amodified oral form if they have difficulties with chewing orswallowing, or it can be through a tube, where liquid foodpasses straight into the stomach. In extreme circumstanceswhere there is disease of the gut or very serious illness,individuals may be offered parenteral nutrition supportwhere nutrients are passed directly into the blood supply. The use of non-oral feeding among people with learningdisabilities has been an issue of debate among healthprofessionals, and decisions about how to feed people whohave significant disability is one of the most difficult forprofessionals to confront. 12Many people in whom the issue of artificial nutrition support arises are unable tocommunicate their own wishes and may not have relativesable to speak on their behalf, making it essential that issuessurrounding nutrition support are discussed openly with allconcerned. There is evidence that nutrition support viagastrostomy can be an effective way of improving theweight and nutritional status of children with cerebralpalsy, 13but there remains some controversy about gastrostomy feeding, especially in people with dementia. A common view is that the current evidence fails to showthat gastrostomy feeding among people with dementia hasa favourable outcome. 14The criticisms are based on work among patients with dementia showing that: gastrostomyfeeding fails to lengthen survival; 15, 16prognosis worsens after tube insertion;17there is a higher complication rate;18 and outcomes are poor in malnourished patients.19 However, there remain many unanswered questions: Is survival a relevant outcome measure? Survival will be unchanged against the background of a progressive,untreatable condition. The survival curves are parallel forpeople with dementia and people in the generalpopulation who have gastrostomies, 17suggesting that it is the dementia that reduces survival, not the insertion of atube.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6263 Chapter 5 Weight management Overweight and obesity What do we know about overweight andobesity among people with learningdisabilities? When the total amount of calories in the food and drinktaken in exceeds that expended by the body, any excess isstored as body fat. Obesity is defined as a condition inwhich the stores of body fat have increased to a level whichimpairs health. Obesity in the general population is risingrapidly and predictions suggest that the current estimate of22% of men and 23% of women 28being obese will rise to 25% of all adults in the UK by 2010. 29 Numerous studies have looked at overweight and obesity inthose with learning disabilities. In 2000, Gravestockreviewed 25 research studies, with samples varying from 35to 2,202 people, which included people in hospital and inresidential units. In most studies the rate of obesity amongthose with learning disabilities was higher than the rateamong people without learning disabilities at that time. In2000 it was reported that 13% of men and 24% of womenwith learning disabilities over 18 years of age living insupported accommodation were obese 30and this had risen to 27% of men and women with learning disabilities over16 years of age in supported accommodation in the northof England in 2005. 6A recent study in Ireland reported that almost 70% of people with learning disabilities had aBMI greater than 25, with 30% of subjects having a BMI ofmore than 30. 31Almost all studies report greater rates of obesity among women than men, and significantly greaterlevels of obesity among women with learning disabilitiesthan women in the general population. 4 Evidence also suggests that people with intellectualdisabilities will experience obesity at a younger age thanthe general population 4although there is little information available about rates of obesity in children and youngpeople with learning disabilities. Research currently on-going in Northern Ireland looking at children with learningdisabilities in comparison with those of a similar age inmainstream schools is already showing significantly higherlevels of overweight and obesity among children in specialschools, suggesting that overweight in children withlearning disabilities is also greater than for the childpopulation as a whole. 32 Obesity is more common among those with Prader-Willisyndrome and other genetic syndromes such as Cohensyndrome and Barder-Biedl syndrome. 33Studies have reported an increased prevalence of obesity in people withDown's syndrome, 34but more recent evidence from one study reported that, while women with Down's syndromehad a higher rate of obesity, this was not true for men withlearning disabilities require considerable support beforeand after the insertion of the gastrostomy, and that this isfrequently inadequate. 26 Living with artificial nutrition support People with either naso-gastric tubes or gastrostomies willoften rely on the support of family carers and support staffto manage their artificial nutrition support, ideally withback-up from a dietitian or nutrition support nurse. Trainingshould always be given so that family, friends and supportstaff know how to manage tube-feeding and solve anypractical problems people may have. For information onorganisations which can offer advice, see Organisations in Appendix 4.Some people may find living with a gastrostomystraightforward but some may find that it impacts onaspects of daily life. One small study reported that 90% ofparents of children with learning disabilities were happywith the tube-feeding regimen for their child, but thatsome parents would have liked more support when theirchild first needed a gastrostomy. The commonestdifficulties dealt with by parents in this study werevomiting, leakage, infection, diarrhoea and nausea. 27 In order to make life with a gastrostomy as normal aspossible, especially for children, it is worth considering thefollowing: Feeding regimens should consider the individual's lifestyle, and feeding should not dominate each day. Individuals may choose to join in with the social aspects of mealtimes and children and young people in particularshould be encouraged to do this wherever possible. Oral intake of food and drink at meals may still be possible but should only be given under the guidance ofa speech and language therapist and dietitian. It is important that oral hygiene continues even if food and drink are not consumed orally (see page 75). If people fiddle with their PEG, try a close-fitting vest or provide another distraction. Also, profile button tubescan be fitted which sit snugly on the skin surface. People may feel self-conscious about their tube and feeltied down by the gastrostomy. Talking to other people canhelp and there are a number of organisations that mightbe able to offer support (see Organisations in Appendix 4).

Being diabetic may be particularly problematic for somepeople with learning disabilities. They might experiencedifficulty adjusting to, or understanding the reasons for andimportance of diet and lifestyle changes. However, manypeople are able to learn to manage their diabetes withsupport. It is important to ensure that diabetes is takenseriously, as a failure to manage the disease properly canresult in further medical problems, such as blindness, nervedamage resulting in possible amputations, and anincreased risk of atherosclerosis leading to an increase ofkidney failure, heart disease, and stroke. 50In some people with learning disabilities, the responsibility for managingthe diabetes is likely to rest with their family, friends andsupport staff, and a diagnosis of diabetes can in somecircumstances encourage support staff to find out moreabout eating and drinking well and pay greater attention tothe foods and drinks made available. For most people withdiabetes, the diet of choice is the diet encouraged for thepopulation as a whole - namely a diet that is rich in fruit,vegetables and wholegrain carbohydrates, and lower in fat,saturated fat, sugar and salt. Special diabetic products andstrict dietary regimes are unlikely to be necessary. Forsupport on how to eat well with diabetes, contact DiabetesUK (see Organisations in Appendix 4). Down's syndrome4and it is likely that obesity among the majority of people with Down's syndrome is linked tolifestyle factors rather than the condition itself. People withDown's syndrome are more likely to have thyroid diseasethat can lead to overweight, and screening for thyroiddisease is important for people with Down's syndrome. Why is obesity higher among some people with learning disabilities? It has been suggested that the increased rates of obesityamong young adults with learning disabilities are linked toliving in poorer households, increased dependence onothers, lower levels of activity and overfeeding tocompensate for boredom, social isolation and behaviouralproblems. 5Obesity may be higher in young people with learning disabilities when they leave school as many find itdifficult to move into employment or continuing education,or to access some purposeful activities. 36Propensity to weight gain can be compounded by using food as a rewardor comfort, or by an eating disorder. For example, recentevidence suggests that about 13% of service users with alearning disability in South London had a diagnosable bingeeating disorder associated with obesity. 37Children and adolescents with learning disabilities are four times morelikely to have an emotional disorder and this is morecommon among girls and those who live in poverty. 38 In the general population, increasing rates of obesity andpoor nutrition have been linked to: a lack of understandingof what constitutes a balanced diet; limited access to freshfruit and vegetables, a sedentary lifestyle; 39a diet high in fat and sugar,40particularly sugary drinks;41environments which contribute to and do not discourage obesity;42 portion sizes;43and behaviour patterns.44Studies have reported that people with learning disabilities living inresidential care, who rely on their support staff for adviceand help with their diets and lifestyle, are also subject tothese factors. 4, 6, 30, 45, 46 The health consequences of overweightand obesity It is known that overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI30 or above) in the general population are linked to anincreased risk of developing coronary heart disease, type 2diabetes, certain cancers, stroke and osteoarthritis. 40, 11 Being overweight can also contribute to skin infections,which can develop into abscesses if not treated. There isalso social stigmatisation associated with being overweightwhich means that fatter people, and particularly fatterchildren, can be viewed very negatively by their peers andby society. 47Type 2 diabetes is described in more detail opposite. For information on the other conditionsmentioned above, see page 47.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6465 Chapter 5 Weight management programme with an understanding of the health risks ofobesity is necessary in order to reinforce behaviouralchanges in the longer term. 53 However, it is not easy to lose weight and it may beparticularly difficult for people with learning disabilities ifthey have mobility difficulties or are chairbound orbedbound. It is therefore useful to consider the followingquestions before starting attempts at weight loss, and tobe realistic about what can be achieved: Is it really necessary for the person to lose weight? If health and mobility are not affected by a person's weightand it is stable, then be cautious before recommendingweight loss. If someone has a BMI of between 25-30, buteats well, is active and their weight is stable, interventionmay be counter-productive and impact on quality of life. Ifsomeone is over the age of 65, extreme caution should betaken in encouraging weight loss unless there is a clearrationale for doing this. Is weight increasing rapidly? If someone is gaining weight rapidly and consistently - forexample, if they have gained 3kg (half a stone) or more peryear for a number of years - this may well requireintervention to maintain weight. It can be more successfulto encourage weight maintenance than weight loss to startwith and this can seem more achievable. Have there been any lifestyle changes that can be compensated for? Simple changes in lifestyle can often trigger weight gain. Ifsomeone changes their place of education, work ortransport route this can mean a decline in small amountsof regular activity. If someone walks 15 minutes to a busstop twice a day, this adds up to 150 minutes' exercise overfive days and losing this regular activity can tip the balancein terms of weight maintenance and weight gain.Encouraging small, regular amounts of exercise every day isoften preferable to, and more realistic than, a weekly visitto a gym. Three short 10-minute walks a day often seemmore achievable than a more vigorous exercise plan. Formore information on physical activity, see page 66. Have there been any changes in eating pattern? Weight gain may be related to a change in eating habitsthat might be triggered by a change of residence, achange in lifestyle or a change in the people who areoffering care and support. Be alert to simple changes oradditions to the diet that might be related to changingcircumstances, as it is often small changes to daily patternsthat can trigger weight gain.Managing overweight In simple terms, weight management means balancing theamount of energy that is consumed (as calories) with theamount of energy that we use up (in normal bodyprocesses - the basal metabolic rate - and in any activitythat we do). Weight reduction therefore requires eitherenergy intake to go down, or energy expenditure toincrease, or some combination of the two. Weightmaintenance requires a consistent balance of input ofexpenditure and intake.There is, however, no simple solution to weight gain as thelarge numbers of the population who are currentlyoverweight would testify. Preventing overweight involves: eating well and being active. Weight loss interventions A recent review of weight loss interventions for people withlearning disabilities 51reported that moderate weight loss can be achieved and that the factors that related to weightreduction included the teaching of behavioural techniques(that is, how to manage meals, portion sizes and eatingpatterns), the involvement of support staff, increasedphysical activity and the sharing of nutritional and healthinformation. Adults with learning disabilities oftencollaborate in their decision-making with support staff andthis review highlighted the importance of motivated andaware support staff in supporting people to manage theirweight. There is evidence that the health knowledge and skills ofadults with learning disabilities can be increased 52and in particular that equipping participants of a weight lossFocusing on weight itself is often unhelpful andbeing thin, but not eating well, not exercising, orusing smoking to manage weight does not lead togood health. Promoting healthy body weight andbody image is particularly important for youngpeople who need to be given positive messagesabout health and to realise that people come in allshapes and sizes. Family, friends and support staffneed to be sensitive to body shape dissatisfactionand ensure they do not make derogatorycomments about their own or other people's bodyshape and do not aim for unrealistic media imagesof body shape and weight. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6566 Chapter 5 Weight management Physical activity Why is physical activity important? Inactivity can be disabling. As well as being implicated asone of the reasons for the increase in obesity amongpeople with learning disabilities, inactivity is reported todouble the risk of coronary heart disease. 54This is particularly relevant for people with learning disabilities asthey have more risk factors for coronary heart disease thanthe general UK population. 30Physical activity builds muscle strength and overall fitness, encourages better mobility andbalance, increases appetite and burns up calories. 54 Exercise is also important for preventing constipation andosteoporosis. There is also significant evidence to show thatactivity can be beneficial in treating depression 55and this might be particularly important for many people withlearning disabilities. Activity is important for underweightpeople too, as it helps to increase appetite.What weight is ideal? It may be more constructive to aim for an achievable andcomfortable weight than aiming at an 'ideal' weight whoseachievement would require considerable discomfort andsacrifice. To keep the need for weight loss in perspective, itis important to balance a healthy body weight with aperson's need for quality of life and the circumstances inwhich they may be living. Simple, practical tips to help people who may wish to lose weight or not gainweight Aim to have 5 portions of fruit and vegetables every day and make this a priority when menu planning (see page 86). Offer water as a drink. Place personalised and fun bottles of tap water in the fridge each day and encourage people to drink from these. If people are frequently hungry and impatient while waiting for meals to be served or prepared, offer slices of fruit or vegetables such as carrots and peppers to eat while waiting rather than biscuits or crisps. Follow the guidance in this report for good choices for snacks and drinks (see pages 83 and 84) and look at the example eating plans in chapter 11 to see how much food in a week people typically need to get all thenutrients they need. Look at portion sizes carefully: people may be used to disproportionately large portion sizes of food and may eat them because they are given to them. Using smaller plates can be helpful in reducing portion sizes. Home-made vegetable soup is filling yet low in calories and contributes to vegetable intake. After the main course, offer fruit routinely and then dessert if the person is still hungry. Simple changes in the kitchen can be helpful. For example: switching to semi-skimmed milk and reduced-fat spreads; using less oil in cooking; grilling rather than frying some foods; buying leaner meats and usingsmaller quantities of them; buying fewer ready-prepared foods; and avoiding pies and pastries. See the food-based guidance in chapter 10 for more tips. If food is eaten for comfort, be sensitive to the relationship the person may have with food. If people are able to, encourage them to talk about their feelings and how their food intake and mood are related. Amongthose with less severe learning disabilities it may be possible to find non-food ways of stimulating a feeling ofwellbeing, such as encouraging people to take up hobbies and pastimes that are creative, taking walks withfamily, friends and support staff, having a haircut or massage, or spending time in the garden. (See page 156for information about therapeutic horticulture.)29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6667 Chapter 5 Weight management people spend time outdoors being active. It has beensuggested that, when lack of exercise is combined withunemployment, there is likely to be apathy and boredomwhich can contribute to mental ill health and behaviouraldisorders. 63 What can help? The recommendation for the general adult population is doat least 30 minutes' moderate-intensity activity a day on atleast five days of the week. 54For children and young people the recommendation is at least one hour's activity a day.54 While these are the ideal recommendations, any activity isbeneficial and if people have been inactive, they should beencouraged to start at a level of activity they feelcomfortable with and gradually build up the duration andintensity of activity. Where people with learning disabilitiesalso have physical disabilities which make movementdifficult, it is important that they are given as much help aspossible to be as active as they can be, even if this involvesonly very limited chair-based movement.The key to achieving and maintaining a more active lifestylefor people with learning disabilities is to find activitieswhich they personally enjoy, which can be easilyincorporated into their routine and which fit in with otheractivities of daily living. There is some evidence that drop-out rates for exercise programmes among people withlearning disabilities are lower when the programmes arestructured and supervised. 64There have been demonstrated benefits among young children with Down'ssyndrome from a simple jumping exercise routine topromote motor and balancing skills. 65There is some evidence that structured programmes such as 'Activate'produced by the Health Promotion Agency in NorthernIreland, which encourages exercise and healthy eating, canhelp to reduce weight in the longer term (more than oneyear) among people with learning disabilities. 66 Regular active games, walking, swimming, social dancing,climbing stairs, cycling, gardening, housework, DIY andchair, bed and wheelchair exercises can all be used tosimply increase activity levels. Where practical, children andyoung people with learning disabilities should beencouraged to do moderate-intensity activity - forexample, playing with their friends in a playground,swimming or playing football - for at least an hour a day.Activities must: consider safety issues associated with a particular disability or health condition take place in a safe, supportive environment to minimise the risk of injury and to promote confidence and avoidunnecessary feelings of embarassment take account of an individual's needs. What do we know about physical activitylevels among people with learningdisabilities? Studies have consistently reported that people withlearning disabilities have low activity levels. 4, 6, 30, 45, 54 Why are people with learning disabilities often inactive? Physical disabilities and illnesses can create extra obstaclesto exercising at all ages. Among younger people withlearning disabilities there is an increased risk of epilepsy,sensory disorders, underweight and overweight, congentialheart disorders and neurological problems, all of which canbe barriers to exercise. 56Among older people with learning disabilities, impaired mobility, respiratory problems,arthritis, deafness and heart disease are common healthproblems that will impact on physical activity. 57Adults with learning disabilities are often prevented from beingphysically active due to financial difficulties, transportbarriers or a shortage of staff. 58People with learning disabilities in residential care may have even more limitedopportunities for community leisure or to be active as partof tasks of daily life or employment. 59Secondary attitudinal barriers may also impact on the activity patterns of peoplewith learning disabilities. Individuals may be less motivatedthemselves, they may be less encouraged to be active, mayhave overprotective family, friends and support staff, andstaff in leisure facilities may not be aware of the age-appropriateness or safety of different forms of activity. 60 Perceived barriers to being active reported by people withlearning disabilities include: 61 Insufficient support staff and resources to enable physical activity Location, availability and accessibility of leisure services Personal finance and budgeting Lack of choice and autonomy Lack of time Poor weather conditions preventing outdoor activities Perceived safety of local environment Concern over injury or health problems made worse by activity Overprotection and negative attitudes to activity by support staff. Work and activity In a survey of adults with learning disabilities in Englandcarried out in 2003/04, only 17% had paid employmentand another 6% had unpaid work. 62Increased work activity may help to increase activity levels, as may involvement incommunity activities or volunteering activities where29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6768 Chapter 5 Weight management Activities might include specific mobility, stretching andstrengthening exercises. Postural awareness, balance andcoordination are important considerations.Appropriate medical advice should always be sought beforea person with learning disabilities begins an exerciseprogramme. There is evidence that health practitioner input with peoplewith learning disabilities can significantly improve activitylevels and reduce levels of obesity. 60Home-based programmes are an important option and can supplementother activities. Home-based programmes should be self-determined but are more effective when they are tailoredto the person, when someone acts as a supporter andwhen they are preceded by an initial introductory andtraining phase. 67 People with learning disabilities may findactivity more enjoyable if they do this with others, andsupport staff should consider taking part in activities withservice users wherever possible. Eating after activity It is common for people to over-eat after they haveexercised as they believe that activity burns up a significantnumber of calories. While being active is important forthose who want to maintain their weight or lose weight, itis important that the amount of calories burnt is kept inperspective. Encourage those who have done exercise todrink water rather than sweetened drinks or sports drinks,and avoid additional snacks other than fresh fruit afteractivity unless these have been specifically recommendedby a health professional or there is concern aboutunderweight or excessive weight loss. Undernutrition It is important that children, young people and adults with learning disabilities are offered a good variety of foods that they will accept and which ensure their nutritional needs are met. Where people with learningdisabilities have small appetites or eating difficulties, it may be difficult for them to eat enough food toobtain all the nutrients they need. Support staff therefore need to be aware of the importance of adoptingstrategies to encourage sufficient food intake. It is essential that all those who support people with learning disabilities are alert to undernutrition and are trained to spot the signs that food intake is inadequate as soon as possible and to take appropriate action byinforming the person's medical practitioner. Healthy body weight Support staff should be able to monitor weight change easily and to act on changes appropriately. All residential settings should have weighing scales, preferably sitting scales, for monthly weight checks. Thescales should be checked appropriately. Support staff should be shown how to act on the weight datarecorded, and there should be an appropriate chart in each person's care plan which highlights when actionis needed because of significant weight change. Challenging the perception of what are normal body weights for children, young people and adults with learning disabilities is essential. It is important that health professionals are given clear information on thegrowth and development that should be expected among people with learning disabilities and on theimportance of intervention if an individual is below or above a healthy body weight for their height. Where weight gain is rapid and avoidable, or where someone is very heavy for their height and where a careful assessment has been made by a dietitian or medical practitioner that weight maintenance or weightloss would be beneficial, individuals with learning disabilities should be supported to reduce the amount ofcalories they eat and to be more active. Physical activity Everyone should be as active as possible as physical activity builds muscle strength and overall fitness, encourages better mobility and balance, increases appetite and burns up calories. Activity also helps preventconstipation, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis, and has been associated with better mental health. Where practical, children and young people with learning disabilities should be encouraged to do moderate- intensity activity - for example, playing with their friends in a playground, swimming or playing football - forat least an hour a day. Adults should aim to do, or build up to, at least 30 minutes' moderate-intensityactivity a day on at least five days of the week.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 6869 Chapter 5 Weight management Where people with learning disabilities also have physical disabilities which make movement difficult, it is important that they are given as much help as possible to be as active as they can be, even if this involvesonly very limited chair-based movement. People with learning disabilities may find activity more enjoyable if they do this with others, and support staff should consider taking part in activities with service users wherever possible. Nutrition support People who receive some or all of their nutrients through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube will often rely on support staff to help manage their artificial nutrition support, ideally with back-up from a dietitian ornutrition support nurse. Training should always be given so that support staff know how to manage tubefeeding and solve any practical problems people may have. References 1 Available from Harlow Printing.

It alsolooks at the importance of maintaining goodoral health. Gastrointestinal disorders 'Gastrointestinal disorders' includes conditions such asconstipation, diarrhoea and coeliac disease. There are alsosome specific structural problems associated with Down'ssyndrome in particular, such as small bowel obstruction,abnormalities of the anus, and Hirschsprung's disease. Detailsof these conditions and their management can be found onthe Down's syndrome association website www.downs-syndrome.org.uk.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7172 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthConstipation What do we know about constipation among people with learning disabilities? Constipation is a common complaint in people withlearning disabilities and is mainly caused by a lack of fibre,and by dehydration and inactivity. One study identified69% of people with learning disabilities living in residentialcare as being constipated. 1Major tranquillisers, opioid analgesics, anti-convulsants, and any drug effects (drugs given for tremor and shaking)produce constipation as a side effect. 2Constipation has also been linked to the use of anti-epileptic drugs.1Other factors contributing to constipation include thyroiddisorders, weak bowel muscles, anxiety, over-use oflaxatives, food refusal, severe learning disabilities and lackof mobility. People with cerebral palsy are at particular riskof constipation because of abnormal gastrointestinalmotility. 3Failure to report lack of bowel movements, or inability to communicate pain or discomfort, might result inconstipation going unnoticed in some people with learningdisabilities. This could lead to rectal and womb prolapse,ulcers, hernias, and changes in behaviour if people cannotcommunicate their discomfort and pain. What can help? To avoid constipation it is important that people are as mobile as possible , have sufficient fluid and have sufficient fibre in their diet . All of these can be difficult for some people with learning disabilities. Support staff shouldalso be aware that some people may be at particular risk ofconstipation because of the drugs they take or theparticular conditions they have. Support staff should bealert to signs which may indicate constipation, such as areluctance to go to the toilet, obvious discomfort, longperiods spent in the toilet, a change in eating habits,unexplained diarrhoea, or unexplained challengingbehaviour, including smearing faeces. Constipation shouldalways be considered when food is refused. 1 Fluid and hydration. How much fluid?There is debate about the amount of fluid needed and it isdifficult to estimate a general requirement, because of thewide variability within and between individuals.To ensure people are adequately hydrated it is currentlyrecommended that adults should have at least 1.2 litres offluid a day 4(about 6 glasses) but older people or people who are prone to constipation should be encouraged tohave at least 1.5 litres a day (about 7 to 8 glasses). 5If someone breathes through their mouth, sweats a lot or hasa high temperature, they will have increased requirementsand advice should be sought on the amount appropriate totheir needs. Fluid can be in the form of drinks but also in foods such assoups, milk puddings, jellies, yoghurt, mousses, gravy,sauces, ice cream and ice lollies. Taking small amounts offluids regularly throughout the day may be necessary.Those who have swallowing difficulties may need to havethickened fluids (see page 133) and it may be moredifficult to provide enough drinks each day. Make sure thatthere is a good choice of different hot and cold drinksavailable, as people may become fatigued of the samedrinks. If it is safe, some people with eating difficulties mayfind that ice lollies or sorbet in cones provide an alternativesource of fluid. Some people may find it easier to drinkthrough a straw and some find cold drinks easier totolerate than hot drinks. For more information about drinks,see page 84.FibreFoods that are high in fibre include bread, cereals, fruitsand vegetables and pulses. Increasing the amount of fibreeaten can help to alleviate constipation, but it must bedone carefully. Fibrous foods are bulky and can reduce theenergy density of the diet, and some people may find thatsudden increases in fibre intake cause bloating and wind. Itis recommended that fibre intakes are increased verygradually to start with, by increasing fruit and vegetableintakes, then by adding in peas, beans and lentils, and thenhigher-fibre cereal foods such as wholemeal breads orhigher-fibre cereals. When increasing the amount of fibre inthe diet, it is important also to increase fluid intake.Some people with advanced disease (such as cancer) orfunctional (dysmotility) dyspepsia will struggle with high-fibre diets. Also, in people with poor appetites, care shouldbe taken that the diet does not become too bulky orunpalatable.Here are some suggestions for simple ways to increase fibreintakes, for those who are able to increase their fibre intakesafely: Pur\u00e9ed tinned peaches, apricots or mango as a sauce served with ice cream or sorbet Dried fruit added to cakes and desserts Using rhubarb, blackberries, plums and other fruits in desserts, or stewed with custard or ice cream or sorbet Dried fruit such as apricots, raisins and dates can be eaten as fruit snacks with meals. Baked beans Canned beans and lentils pur\u00e9ed into soups Houmous as a sandwich filling or on toast Sweetcorn and peas added to stews and casseroles Mixing some brown flour into white when baking Using wholemeal pasta in pasta dishes29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7273 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral health Using brown rice in rice dishes Switching to higher-fibre white bread if wholemeal bread is not liked. For more information on foods high in fibre see page 40,and for information on menu planning see page 127.ActivityThe importance of being as active as possible is discussedon page 66. Even for those who are chairbound orbedbound, simple exercises may help to reduceconstipation and everyone should be encouraged to be asactive as they can be. Support staff should always be awarethat a sudden loss of mobility due to an accident orworsening of a longstanding condition is likely to beassociated with constipation and they should make surethat, if a person's level of activity changes, the person getsadequate fluid and fibre as a priority.MedicinesIf a diagnosis of constipation is confirmed and anyunderlying conditions have been investigated, constipationshould be managed in the first instance by increasingmobility, and increasing fluid and fibre intakes. Where thesesimple measures are ineffective or impractical (for example,because people are immobile or take medicines whichcontribute to constipation), a short course of laxatives mayrelieve symptoms and restore normal bowel function. Themost commonly used laxatives are: bulk-forming (for example, ispaghula husk or methylcellulose) softeners or lubricants (for example, docusate sodium) osmotic laxatives (for example, lactulose or macrogols) stimulant laxatives that directly stimulate colonic nerves to cause movement of the faecal mass (for example,senna or bisacodyl). Laxatives should be chosen on a case by case basisaccording to symptoms and side effects, but a commoncombination is a stimulant (eg. senna) and a softener (eg.docusate or low dose lactulose). Using combinations allowslow doses and volumes to be used (eg. senna syrup 10mls,and lactulose 10mls at bedtime), and also allows thestimulant and softening laxatives to be adjusted individuallyfor the best response. Combinations avoid the need to usehigh doses of lactulose alone, which can cause bloatingand fluid shifts into the gut. There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend themore expensive macrogol laxatives over other well-established, less expensive combinations of stimulant andsoftening laxatives. 6Particular care should be taken over the use of macrogol laxatives which must be mixed withexactly the recommended volume of water to be effective,eg. 125ml per sachet of full strength macrogol.Children and young people who are constipated shouldseek advice from a dietitian or medical practitioner on theamount of fluid and fibre appropriate to their needs. Diarrhoea Diarrhoea can be caused by a bacterial infection, can be aside effect of medication, can be caused by poor bowelcontrol or food intolerance, can be spurious (overflow as aresult of constipation), or can be stress-related. Foodpoisoning is the most common cause of diarrhoea, andanyone with diarrhoea lasting more than 48 hours shouldhave a stool specimen sent to bacteriology for testing.Diarrhoea can also be a symptom of bowel disorders suchas ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or coeliac disease andlactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance means having aninherited reduction in the amount of the enzyme lactaseavailable to digest the lactose in milk and dairy products. Itis more common in people from Asia, Africa, SouthAmerica and Mediterranean countries. Diarrhoea has alsobeen reported as a common side effect of antibiotics whenused in conjunction with tube feeding. What can help? Finding out the underlying cause of diarrhoea will help withits management. If difficulties are associated with tubefeeding, seek advice from a registered dietitian. (For moreon managing problems with tube feeding, see page 62.) If problems are caused by infection, ensure that everyone isaware of the importance of food hygiene and handwashing (see Food hygiene and safety on page 92). If someone is lactose intolerant, they may be able totolerate a small amount of milk products in the diet but, ifmilk and milk products are excluded or reduced, care mustbe taken to ensure that the diet still contains enoughcalcium. (For good sources of calcium, see page 44.) If someone appears to have a food intolerance or conditionwhich requires a special diet, this should be undertakenwith advice from a registered dietitian.People who have diarrhoea should be encouraged to havea diet which has sufficient fibre. For some people, simplyrestricting the amount of sweetened drinks (includingapple juice) consumed each day may help reduce theseverity of diarrhoea. People who have diarrhoea will needextra fluids and, if the diarrhoea is severe and prolonged orif it occurs in a child, it is essential that medical advice issought so that the person does not become dehydrated. Itis important also to ensure that the person with diarrhoeadoes not actually have constipation, as this can be veryserious if faeces become impacted. (For more onconstipation, see page 72.)29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7374 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthCoeliac disease People with Down's syndrome or Turner syndrome aremore likely than the rest of the population to have coeliacdisease. 7Coeliac disease means that gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and oats) cannot be tolerated,and this may cause diarrhoea and malabsorption ofnutrients, which can lead to osteoporosis and irondeficiency. It is also possible to have coeliac disease whichhas more vague symptoms such as tiredness, mouth ulcers,constipation or abdominal pain, and it is important thatthose at high risk are considered for regular screening. 7 Once diagnosed, people require a gluten-free diet for life,and advice on how to manage this should be given by aregistered dietitian. Swallowing difficulties What do we know about swallowingdifficulties among people with learningdisabilities? There is a high incidence of dysphagia (eating, drinking andswallowing difficulties) among people with learningdisabilities. 8Health risks associated with dysphagia include poor nutritional status, dehydration, asphyxiation andaspiration (breathing in of food particles to the lungs)which can lead to respiratory tract infections - the leadingcause of death among people with learning disabilities. 9 Dysphagia not only results in a reduced ability to swallowfood and drink safely, but also leads to inadequate foodintake, and this may result in either general undernutritionor not getting enough of some specific nutrients. Problemsresulting from eating and drinking difficulties are notalways obvious and the gradual changes that accompanyeating difficulties may go undetected or be accepted aspart of the person's normal condition. 10 Swallowing difficulties - what can help? Intervention to manage dysphagia is a multi-disciplinaryapproach usually coordinated by specially trained speechand language therapists who both assess swallowingdifficulties and train support staff and family carers inmanagement techniques. Family carers can be very expertin positioning to aid swallowing and avoid choking and it isimportant that support staff work in partnership with familyand friends where appropriate so that their valuableexperience is not lost. The need for training of allsupport staff who support people with learning disabilities inrecognising, understanding and managing dysphagia ishowever considered critical. 8An inter-professional dysphagia framework is now available which consists ofcompetencies which can be developed by a range ofpractitioners to enhance their skills in this field. 12 Management of swallowing difficulties can involve: modifying the texture of food and drink (for example, offering a soft textured diet or a pur\u00e9ed diet - see page133) altering the position of the person while he or she is eating (see page 107) use of specialised equipment and eating aids (see page 106) training for people with learning disabilities themselves on how to manage their dietary requirements and eatand drink safely, and training for support staff about how to support peopleSigns and symptoms of aswallowing problem in people withlearning disabilities Coughing and/or choking before, during or after swallowing Recurrent chest infections Difficulty in controlling food and drink in the mouth Change in breathing patterns Unexplained weight loss or chronic low body weight 'Wet voice' - sounding gurgly when someone speaks Hoarse voice Drooling The person reports difficulty and/or painful chewing and/or swallowing or feelings ofobstruction in the throat. Heartburn Frequent throat-clearing Change in eating pattern - for example, eating more slowly or avoiding foods or meals Constipation Repeated urinary tract infections Adapted from: Nutrition Support for Adults: Oral Nutrition Support, Enteral Tube Feeding and Parenteral Nutrition (see www.rsceng.ac.uk).1129552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7475 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthto eat and drink safely. There is evidence that there needs to be on-going supportfor people with learning disabilities themselves to helpthem understand the reasoning behind the managementstrategies suggested. 13There can be conflicts between foods that people with dysphagia want to have and safetyissues. Support staff need to be trained to handle theseconflicts sensitively and to ensure that as far as possiblealtered textured food looks and tastes appealing.The following factors can all contribute to difficulties insupporting people with dysphagia to eat and drink: 14 Lack of sufficient staff or of well trained staff, high staff turnover and lack of consistent care. Insufficient time allowed for people who are being helped to eat to process and swallow their food incomfort. One-to-one help with eating and drinking may mean that meals and drinks have to be given in shifts and at oddtimes of day. Maintaining a good posture may be difficult. Getting consistent food textures can be difficult. Mealtimes can be very long, and it can be difficult to pace meals and drinks throughout the day. Food can get cold if mealtimes are lengthy. Constantly monitoring food and drink intake may prove problematic. Encouraging people to eat and drink slowly can be difficult and can lead to conflict if the person resentsinterference in how they manage their eating occasions. Those who are at high risk of dysphagia should be assessedfor vulnerability and their care plans updated accordingly.The involvement of a speech and language therapist withspecialist knowledge of swallowing disorders is critical increating a management strategy and in training the personhimself or herself, as well as his or her family, friends orsupport staff.A person with dysphagia will often be unable to swallowtablets or other medication or supplements and it isimportant that medication reviews take swallowingdifficulties into consideration. For more information on texture modification of food anddrink, see page 133. Strategies to help deal with difficultiesaround eating and drinking can be found on page 108. Theimportance of staff training is considered on page 100. For information on mouth sensitivity (where the person hasan exaggerated response to touch in the mouth or aroundthe face), see page 109. Oral health What do we know about oral healthamong people with learning disabilities? Poor oral health can adversely affect the intake of abalanced diet - especially of foods that require chewing(such as fruit and vegetables) - and can result in theconsumption of soft foods that are easily swallowed. Gooddental health is also linked to happiness and good generalhealth and poor teeth can impact on self-esteem,confidence and socialisation. 15 Diets which are high in sugar lead to the development of dental caries (dental decay).What to do if someone chokes If someone does choke: First check whether the casualty has a mild or severe case. Ask 'Are you choking?' If theperson can reply, cough or breathe (or in ababy's case cry) then the advice is to encouragethe person to cough. If a person can't speak, cough, cry or breathe, treat the incident as severe choking and followthe procedures from current first aid training,which is likely to include giving blows betweenthe shoulder blades in the first instance. Other useful advice includes: Try to remove any loose bolus of food from the mouth. Call other staff for help. (If the personresists, he or she may injure you, rendering youunable to help. Also, other people may try tostop you if they misunderstand your intentions.) If the person is wearing dentures, remove them. (The person may not understand that you arehelping and in fear may bite you.) Stay calm. Talk to the person and reassure him or her. Encourage big, deep coughs rather thanshallow irregular ones if possible. When the choking episode is over, try to reassurein a calm voice. The experience of choking is a veryfrightening one. Try to work out what caused thechoking so that a similar incident can be preventedin the future.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7576 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral health Poor dental hygiene and the build-up of plaque causes periodontal disease (gum disease). Direct acid attack of the teeth (particularly from acidic drinks such as fruit-based drinks) causes tooth erosion. People with learning disabilities have a higher level ofuntreated dental decay, more prevalent gum disease, moretooth extractions and poorer dental hygiene than thegeneral population. 16, 17All research studies report uniformly poor standards of oral hygiene and plaquecontrol and poorer periodontal health in children withlearning disabilities. 18Little is known about the oral health of adults with mild learning disabilities since many are notin contact with dental services, but studies in day centresand residential settings report higher levels of untreateddisease than in the general population. 19Infections of the mouth lining occur easily and can cause considerabledistress and difficulties with eating and drinking (eg. thrushin the mouth, cold sores and mouth ulcers).Suggestions for the reasons behind the high levels of poororal health include difficulties accessing dental services dueto people's challenging behaviour, or lack of NHStreatment. 17Studies have also demonstrated a lack of knowledge, support and training about oral health availableto family, friends and support staff of people with learningdisabilities. 20Oral health care is often given a low priority by support staff21and there is a shortage of training particularly in community-based and residentialaccommodation. 22Family and friends may be able to provide useful information on how to handle oral care.Historically, it has been reported that people with Down'ssyndrome have a lower prevalence of caries due to latetooth eruption and abnormal tooth formation. However,more recent studies have shown that while caries incidenceis lower among people with Down's syndrome, it is not aslow as it used to be since a higher percentage of peoplewith Down's syndrome are now living in the communitysetting rather than in institutions and have more access tofoods and drinks that can cause caries (dental decay). 23 People with Down's syndrome are more likely to suffer frombruxism (grinding teeth) and gum disease. The tongue canbe large relative to the size of the oral cavity and this canbe a cause of badly aligned teeth. 24Gum disease can be severe in children with Down's syndrome, even when oralhygiene is of a good standard. Hennequin et al 25have reported that, in France, people with Down's syndrome hadmore oral health problems compared with their siblingsand that, with age, the prevalence of chewing difficultiesdid not improve; the prevalence of bleeding gums andbreathing through the mouth increased; but tongueprotrusion decreased. In Sweden, a longitudinal study oforal health of adults with learning disabilities found thatthose with Down's syndrome had higher average annualloss of tooth-supporting bone compared with those peoplewith other diagnoses. 26 Poor oral hygiene and gum disease can put people at riskof transfer of bacteria into the bloodstream during somesurgical or dental procedures. If the bacteria lodge indamaged or abnormal heart valves, life-threateninginfection of the heart can result. Good oral health, of bothteeth and gums, is therefore essential. In children with alearning disability, who may be slow to clear food or whomay 'pouch' food in their mouth, as has been reported forsome children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), 27there is a need for good oral hygiene both at home and atschool. 28 People with learning disabilities have fewer denturesprovided for them than people in the general UKpopulation, and those who do have them have increasedproblems with them related to poor dental hygiene. 29 Frequent food and drink consumption allows little time forremineralisation of the teeth between snacks or meals andtherefore those who may need to eat or drink 'little andoften' should pay particular attention to their oral health. 28 People who require higher-energy food supplementsbetween meals and those who take sugar-basedmedication will also have an increased risk of dental decay.People who take medication which causes dry mouth arealso at greater risk of tooth decay. There may be someconflict between health professionals, family, friends andsupport staff when conflicting messages around oral healthare given, for example, when high-sugar snacks arerecommended between meals to increase energy intake. Itis important that health professionals consider theconsequences of their recommendations on other healthmessages and seek advice on how to manage this mosteffectively.Tooth erosion is a progressive, irreversible loss of dental enamel usually caused by acids other than those producedby plaque bacteria. Erosion can lead to a reduction in thesize of teeth and to tooth destruction. One of the maincauses of tooth erosion is the frequent consumption offruit juices, fruit drinks and fizzy drinks. Even those markedas 'no added can cause tootherosion. reflux, vomiting andrumination can also contribute to tooth erosion.A person with learning disabilities suffering dental pain maybe unable to express discomfort and may exhibit a changein behaviour such as loss of appetite, unwillingness toparticipate in activities, sleeplessness, irritability or self-harm. It is important for family carers, friends and supportstaff to be alert to such changes and to find out if mouthor tooth pain is a possible cause of behaviour change. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7677 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthOral health - what can help? If dental services are to respond to the needs of allmembers of a community it is important that communitydentistry teams are trained and confident in treatingpeople with learning disabilities. Extensiverecommendations and guidance on how to ensure thatpeople with learning disabilities receive appropriate oralhealth care have been written by the Faculty of DentalSurgery and the British Society for Disability and Oral Health(see page 154). Tips on oral health All children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should visit the dentist twice a year. Good daily oral hygiene is essential, including brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. (See Toothpastes below.) If brushing is not completely effective, dentists may recommend that a mouthwash or chlorhexidine gel is used after brushing. Parents, guardians or support staff should help with brushing of teeth for children under the age of 8 years, and anyone who may have difficulty in brushing their teeth independently. If helping someone to brush their teeth, use the procedure suggested in the box on the next page. ToothpastesThe best toothpastes to use are those which contain fluoride, as these are effective in preventing dental decay.In guidance soon to be published by the Department of Health, it is recommended that all children and adultswith disabilities should brush their teeth twice a day with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste (1350-1500ppmfluoride). All children and adults should be encouraged to spit out excess toothpaste when they have finishedbrushing, but not rinse their mouths with water.Food and drinkLimiting the intake and frequency of consumption of sugary foods and drinks is the most important way ofpreventing tooth decay: The only drinks that should be given in a bottle are milk and water. Sugar should never be added to milk for infants or children. It is particularly important to ensure that drinks other than milk or water are not given at bedtime. This is because the mouth produces less saliva during sleep, which means that teeth are at greater risk of damage. As far as is possible, keep food and drink that have sugar in them to mealtimes only. Milk, water, and tea or coffee (without sugar) are the only drinks which will not damage teeth between meals. For information about good choices of snack foods between meals, see page 83. Medicines where possible should be sugar-free. For details of resources about oral health for people with learning disabilities and general information on gooddental health, see Appendix 4.The recommendations made in this report relatespecifically to simple oral hygiene and the role of food anddrink in oral health, but the Expert Working Group stronglyrecommends that staff in all community dental serviceshave disability awareness and communication skills training.It also recommends that training in the provision of dentalcare to people with learning disabilities should be includedin the undergraduate curriculum for dentists. All those whosupport and care for people with learning disabilitiesshould be offered training on the importance of oral healthand how to help people to clean their teeth.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7778 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthHow to help someone to clean their teeth Always explain what you are going to do first. Brushing someone else's teeth is an invasive procedure and can be frightening. Make sure the person is relaxed, comfortable and well supported. Encourage the person you are assisting to do as much as they are capable of themselves. Prompt, encourage or assist as necessary. Support staff should wear latex-free gloves when helping with toothbrushing and stand behind the person, slightly to one side. Partial dentures should be removed before cleaning natural teeth. Gently draw back the lips with the thumb and forefinger on one side of the mouth to gain access to the upper teeth. Using a small, soft brush with the appropriate toothpaste, brush the teeth and gums using short, scrub motions and try to brush the outer, inner and biting surfaces of all teeth to ensure all plaque and food debrishave been removed. Carefully brush all the teeth in the mouth, trying to reach all areas. If cooperation is limited, it may be necessary to brush different areas of the mouth at different times. If necessary, help the person to rinse their mouth afterwards. A straw can be useful to help the person rinse his or her mouth. If recommended by the dentist or dental hygienist, use mouthwash or chlorhexidine gel. If someone has no natural teeth, it is still important to clean the gums and the inside of the mouth daily with a soft toothbrush or gauze to maintain good oral health. Record the toothbrushing session on an appropriate oral healthcare plan. If any changes to the mouth are noticed, contact the person's dentist. Adapted from the British Society for Disability and Oral Health and the Faculty of Dental Surgery, 2001 30 Artificial sweeteners Some health professionals are in favour of products with artificial sweeteners which do not contribute to toothdecay, especially for those people with a tendency towards obesity. Others have concerns about the metabolismof sweeteners - particularly of aspartame - in children with syndromes which may compromise thephenylalanine-tyrosine-dopamine-serotonin metabolic pathway. Aspartame causes significant increases inplasma phenylalanine, and probably brain phenylalanine, and therefore has the potential to interfere withneurotransmitter production. 28There is also some concern that, if people get used to sweet tastes through the use of artificially sweetened foods, this will not help them to make long-term, permanent, beneficial changes totheir diet to reduce high intakes of sugar. Moderation in the use of artificial sweeteners and in the amount ofartificially sweetened foods and drinks included in the diet would therefore seem prudent.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7879 Chapter 6 Gastrointestinal disorders, swallowing difficulties and oral healthConstipation All those who support people with learning disabilities should be alert to signs which may indicate constipation, such as a reluctance to go to the toilet, obvious discomfort, long periods spent in the toilet, achange in eating habits, unexplained diarrhoea, food refusal, or unexplained challenging behaviour. To avoid constipation it is important that adults are as mobile as possible, have sufficient fluid and have sufficient fibre in their diet. Children and young people who are constipated should seek advice from adietitian or medical practitioner on the amount of fluid and fibre appropriate to their needs. Dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) Dysphagia should always be considered when there are unexplained eating or breathing difficulties, changes in eating patterns, distress associated with eating, or recurrent chest infections. Those who are at high risk of dysphagia should be assessed for vulnerability and their care plans updated accordingly. The involvement of a speech and language therapist with specialist knowledge of swallowingdisorders is critical in creating a management strategy and in training the person himself or herself, as wellas his or her family, friends or support staff. Medication reviews of a person with dysphagia should take into account swallowing difficulties, as the person may be unable to swallow tablets or other medication or supplements. Oral health All children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should visit the dentist twice a year. Cutting down on the amount of sugar eaten, and on how frequently sugary foods and drinks are consumed throughout the day, will help to prevent dental decay. Good daily oral hygiene is essential, including brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Children under the age of 8 years and anyone who may have difficulty in brushing their teeth independentlyshould be helped when brushing their teeth. Support staff should be offered training on the importance of oral health and how to help someone clean their teeth. All those who support people with learning disabilities should be alert to changes in behaviour such as loss of appetite, unwillingness to participate in activities, sleeplessness, irritability or self-harm, and should findout if mouth or tooth pain is a possible cause of the behaviour change.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 7980 Chapter 6 oral healthReferences 1 Bohmer CJ, Taminiau JA, Klinkenberg-Knol EC and Meuwissen (2001) The prevalence of constipation in institutionalized people withintellectual disability.

Food for all Eating together, having special foods or avoiding particularfoods are all intimately related to aspects of people's family life,cultural and religious beliefs. It is important to value thecontributions which different cultures and nationalities make tothe variety of foods eaten in the UK today. While many peoplewho have settled in the UK still try and preserve many of theirtraditional food patterns, within each family, and for eachindividual, food choice will be unique and it is essential to treateveryone as an individual when finding out about their foodchoices and preferences. Food-related customs Over the page is a brief summary of some of the differences infood choice commonly observed by those from differentreligious and cultural groups. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8182 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day * Strict Hindus and Sikhs will not eat eggs, meat, fish, and some fats.** Some Rastafarians are vegan.*** Jains have restrictions on some vegetable foods.

Inadequateor inappropriate nutrition in those with learning disabilitiescan be partly due to environmental factors which arecommonly reported in residential care. Mealtimes are oftenhurried and staff are frequently untrained in nutrition andconstrained by finances and cooking abilities. This canresult in residents not getting a nutritionally balanced diet. 1, 2, 3It is important to ensure that people arrive at mealtimes ready for the eating occasion, for examplehaving had the opportunity to go to the toilet and washtheir hands, or collect their hearing aid, glasses or dentures,and having been informed of the eating occasion ahead.Ensuring everyone has the correct cutlery and crockery fortheir needs and the appropriate seating is also important. In residential and day care settings, support staff shouldalso consider how the choice of tables and layout of theroom impact on people's mealtime experience. Whereverpossible: People should choose where they sit and whom they sit with. People should have the opportunity to serve themselves the amount of food that they would like, from servingdishes brought to the table. Tablecloths, colourful table mats, matching crockery and table napkins can all help to make mealtimes moreenjoyable and give them a sense of importance andoccasion. Mealtimes should be protected and other routine tasks and visits should be avoided during planned meals. For people with learning disabilities who may have sensorydisabilities, using cues to stimulate appetite may beparticularly important. The smell of food being prepared,the sound of food preparation and service, and the sight oflaid tables may help to orientate people to the mealtimeahead. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8283 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day Food should be appetising and attractively served, toensure that people enjoy their food. This is particularlyimportant if the food has its form or texture changed forpeople with swallowing difficulties.To make mealtimes a time of pleasant social sharing, andas good practice, staff should sit with the people theysupport during meals and snacks, and where appropriateshare the same foods and drinks.Mealtimes offer an opportunity for support staff to modeleating skills and to encourage social interaction andconversation. To encourage this, distractions such astelevision are best avoided during mealtimes. Eating patterns, and timing of meals and snacks When people with learning disabilities are living in theirown home, they are likely to be able to choose when to eatand drink and will find patterns of eating and drinkingwhich suit their lifestyle and routines. In residentialaccommodation, the national minimum standards for carehomes for adults give clear guidance that mealtimesshould be flexible and that a range of food and drinkshould be available at all times. (See Appendix 1.)Additional guidance for care settings has also beenproduced by the British Dietetic Association 4and by the National Association of Care Catering.5 The timing of meals and snacks throughout the day should be organised to fitaround the needs of the individual being supported. Somepeople may need frequent small meals and snacksthroughout the day.It is important to ensure that everyone has enough time toeat and drink and that, where necessary, food is kept warmsafely during the meal for those who eat and drink slowly. Breakfast Breakfast is an important meal for two main reasons. Firstly,many breakfast foods are a very good source of fibre andother important nutrients. Secondly, if breakfast is missed,it is more likely that people will be tempted by other snackfoods later in the day. Breakfast cereals can be a useful source of nutrients. Thebest breakfast cereals to choose are those that are high infibre and low in salt, sugar and fat and those that arefortified with extra vitamins and minerals: for example,puffed wheat, wheat flakes, weet bisks, shredded wheatand some crisped rice cereals and mueslis. Look at thelabels to choose those that are lower in salt and sugar. (Seepage 120 for details of how to check if foods are high infat, salt and sugar.) Most breakfast cereals can be eaten asa finger food, or they can be eaten with milk, yoghurt,fresh or dried fruit or fruit juice. Fresh fruit juice atbreakfast is recommended, as vitamin C may help ironabsorption (see page 44), but other fresh or dried fruits orvegetables can also be served (eg. tinned tomatoes orbaked beans). For those people who have a good appetitein the morning that recedes as the day continues, breakfastshould be seen as an opportunity to consume a significantamount of energy and other nutrients, and a range offoods should be offered, rather than just traditionalbreakfast foods. Snacks It is important that nutritious snacks are offered regularly topeople who have small appetites and who therefore needto eat frequently or 'little and often', to those who mayneed to eat a greater amount of calories per day, or tothose who are fussy or selective eaters or who are growingrapidly. Snacks should be viewed as mini-meals and shouldbe as varied and nutritious as meals. For those people with learning disabilities who are gainingweight or who have been advised to lose weight, snacksthat are high in fat and sugar (such as confectionery,savoury snacks, soft drinks, cakes, biscuits and ice cream)should be kept to a minimum as these frequentlycontribute significant extra calories to the diet. For many people, snack foods are limited to biscuits andcrisps but snacks can and should be varied and planned for.The best snacks are those which provide useful nutrientswithout adding lots of salt, fat and sugar to the diet. Ideasfor good snack choices are given over the page.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8384 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day Good snack choices The best snacks are low in sugar and salt. Avoidadding sugar to drinks or yoghurts.Examples of good snack choices are: Dairy foods such as cheese or yoghurt. Fresh fruit such as pears, apple slices, satsumas, banana, seedless grapes, slices of melon,mango, pineapple, kiwi, plums, or berries suchas strawberries and raspberries. Choose fruits inseason and those that are grown locally wherepossible. The fruit from canned fruit in juice canbe added to yoghurt or fromage frais. Raw vegetables such as peeled carrots, sweet pepper, tomato, cucumber or celery (all wellwashed) with dips such as houmous,taramasalata, avocado, salsa or Greek yoghurtwith chives. Unsalted nuts and seeds may be suitable for some people, but should not be given toanyone who has eating difficulties. Home-made plain popcorn, home-made oven- baked potato crisps or sweet potato crisps. (Tomake potato crisps, put thin slices of potato ona lightly greased baking tray and bake in a hotoven.) Biscuits such as crispbreads, oatcakes, breadsticks, cream crackers, matzos, ricewaffles or melba toast. Some of these foodscan be high in salt, so choose those that arelower in salt where possible (see page 87). Any type of bread (use a variety of white, brown, wholemeal, granary or crusty breads,including versions whereavailable. Suitable fillings for sandwiches and toast might be meat (for example, cold roast meats,chicken, ham, corned beef or meat paste),cheese, cottage cheese, fish paste, mashedpilchards, sardines, mackerel, tuna, egg,houmous, roast vegetables, banana, salad orcombinations of these. Milky drinks and smoothies can be made from a combination of milk, fruit and yoghurt. Drinks Drinks are essential in the diet to ensure adequate fluidintakes. They can also provide an opportunity tosupplement the diet with additional nutrients. However,drinking too many sweetened or other soft drinks,particularly between meals, can be damaging to the teeth(see page 76). Drinks which contain sugar can also addcalories - but few other nutrients - to the diet. Providing drinks It is important that everyone has access to adequate fluidintakes throughout the day. To ensure people areadequately hydrated it is currently recommended thatadults should have at least 1.2 litres of fluid a day 6(about 6 glasses) but older people or people who are prone toconstipation should be encouraged to have at least 1.5litres a day (about 7 to 8 glasses). 7If someone breathes through their mouth, sweats a lot or has a hightemperature, they will have increased requirements for fluidand should seek advice on the amount appropriate to theirneeds. (For information on excessive fluid intake, see page29.) We get some fluid from the food we eat but it isimportant that drinks of fluid are provided regularly sincedehydration can lead to headaches, confusion, irritabilityand lack of concentration as well as constipation andpotentially urinary tract infections. Free, fresh, chilled tapwater should always be offered with meals and regularlythroughout the day. Milk Milk should be the drink of choice for children and youngpeople where this is tolerated, since milk is safe for teethand contains other essential nutrients. It is important thatappropriate milks are chosen for infants and children andadvice on this should be sought from a health visitor. For most people over the age of 5 years, semi-skimmedmilk should be the milk of choice as this has reducedamounts of fat and saturated fat. For those people whoneed to gain weight, whole milk may be appropriate. Milky drinks before bed can enhance sleep as well asoffering additional calories to those who are underweight. Water Water quenches thirst and should be the drink of choicebetween meals when people are thirsty. Free, fresh, chilledtap water should always be offered with meals andregularly throughout the day and should be widely availablein any places where people with learning disabilities maylive, work or visit. It has been reported that some peopledo not like giving water to children as they think children29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8485 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day will reject it, that it is 'cruel', and that offering water is asign of poverty. 8It is important therefore that family, friends and support staff are positive about water drinking,make sure that palatable water is always available, and actas good role models for water drinking. Providinginteresting and colourful cups and bottles for waterdrinking may encourage some people with learningdisabilities to drink more. Anecdotal evidence suggests thatorganising water drinks in personalised bottles in therefrigerator each day and encouraging these drinks to beconsumed before other drinks are chosen can bemotivating for some people with mild and moderatelearning disabilities. Other practical tips to encourage waterconsumption can be found at www.water.org.uk. Soft drinks There is a wide range of soft drinks available, most of whichare sweetened with sugars, sweeteners (for examplesaccharin or aspartame) and commonly a mixture of both.They include: squashes and other drinks which need to be diluted carbonated soft drinks such as cola or lemonade, and fruit drinks which are drinks that contain a proportion of fruit juice as well as water and some form of sugar and/orsweetener. The amount of soft drinks given to children should belimited since these offer little nutritional benefit and maysuppress appetite and prevent the child eating morenutritious foods. Children can become conditioned at anearly age to the sweet taste of drinks. High intakes of softdrinks have been reported to lead to frequent looser stools,poor appetites and failure to thrive. 9Soft drinks containing sweeteners are generally not recommended for children. Ifsoft drinks (such as squashes) containing saccharin aregiven to under-5s, they should be diluted much more thanthey would be for an adult - for example, a dilution of 1part squash to 10 parts water. Sugary drinks provide additional calories to the diet andthis can be significant over time, since high volumes of softdrinks can often be consumed without impacting onappetite. Evidence suggests that consuming a sweetenedsoft drink every day is linked to increased weight gain anddevelopment of type 2 diabetes. 10One research study estimated that among children the chance of developingobesity increased 1.6 times for each additional sweeteneddrink consumed a day. 11Swapping some or all sugary drinks for drinks of water may be particularly helpful if people aretrying to maintain their weight or lose weight.Soft drinks containing sugar can be harmful to everyone'steeth, especially if they are drunk frequently or stay incontact with the teeth for too long. If sugary drinks aregiven, they should be kept to mealtimes. Soft drinks suchas fruit drinks and fruit squashes should not be given atbedtime or during the night as this practice is highly likelyto contribute to dental decay. Soft drinks labelled 'low-sugar' or 'no added sugar' may stillharm teeth as they often contain some sugar and they mayalso be acidic. Any of the following on the label of a softdrink indicates that the drink has sugar added: glucose,glucose syrup, fructose, concentrated fruit maltose or hydrolysed starch.Sweetened fizzy drinks such as cola or lemonade are bothsugary and acidic. The 'diet' versions of these drinks canalso be harmful to teeth even if they do not contain sugar,as the acidity erodes the dental enamel. Pure unsweetened (100%) fruit juices Fruit juices are most beneficial when given with mealsbecause, if they are a good source of vitamin C - forexample, orange juice or grapefruit juice - this may helpthe body absorb iron. However, fruit juices have also beenshown to be acidic enough to erode dental enamel, so it isbest to avoid giving them between meals. Some fruit juice drinks are available which contain somefruit juice, with added sugar and water. These can often behigh in calories and can be an expensive way to buy fruitjuice. 150ml of 100% pure fruit juice counts as one of the5 fruit and vegetable portions each day and makes a betterchoice. Cranberry juice Women with learning disabilities who are prone to urinarytract infections may benefit from drinking a cranberry juicedrink regularly since there is some evidence that this canbe a useful preventative measure for some people. 12 However, people who take the drug warfarin should avoiddrinking cranberry juice or having cranberry products as itmay increase the potency of the drug and causehaemorrhage. 13 Tea and coffee Tea and coffee are not recommended as a drink for infantsor children as the tannic acid they contain reduces theabsorption of iron. 14However, young people and adults are likely to enjoy tea and coffee as these drinks are importantin our culture at social occasions and offer comfort andwarmth. There is some evidence that, as tea is animportant source of compounds such as flavanols andpolyphenols, drinking tea can protect against cardiovasculardisease, some cancers and osteoporosis when consumed aspart of a healthy diet. 15, 16While caffeine in tea and coffee has a mild dehydrating effect, this effect is negligible29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8586 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day among habitual consumers and is compensated for by thetotal amount of fluid in the drink. 17Sugar added to tea and coffee can damage teeth and contribute to obesity andeveryone should be encouraged to reduce the amount ofsugar they use in hot drinks over time. If appropriate,people could consider using sugar alternatives that are lessdamaging to teeth such as fructose or sorbitol, but caremust be taken not to have these in large amounts as theycan cause diarrhoea. Herbal and fruit-flavoured teas Some herbal and fruit-flavoured teas may contain vitamin Cand can be useful hydrating drinks which might make apleasant change to other hot drinks. Some herbal teascontain 'herbal medicine' which might make claims forhealth benefits (for example as a laxative, as an anti-diabetes agent or to aid weight loss). In most cases theseteas are likely to be harmless but some people may drinkthese in preference to taking appropriate medication andsupport staff should be alert to this possibility. Some herbalsupplements which may be found in drinks can interferewith the effectiveness of some medicines (see page 89).Caffeine Caffeine is a commonly consumed drug which isnot harmful to most people in moderate amounts.Caffeine is commonly found in tea, coffee, colabeverages and chocolate as well as in some painrelievers or 'energy' drinks. In excess, caffeine cancause anxiety, sleep disruption, restlessness,palpitations, dizziness, nausea, diarrhoea andinvoluntary trembling. Excess caffeine intake cancomplicate psychiatric diagnosis and can intensifythe side effects of medication given for treatingmental ill health or interfere with how effectivesome medicines are. Over 600mg of caffeine a dayis considered an excessive amount and it is quitepossible for people to reach these intakes if theydrink a large amount of tea or coffee socially (forexample, more than 6 mugs of coffee a day).Pregnant women are advised to have no more than300mg of caffeine a day. Typical caffeine contentsare shown below. Cup or mug of instant coffee 75mg/100mg Can of cola 38mgCup or mug of brewed coffee 100mg/140mg Can of energy drink 80mgCup or mug of tea 50mg/70mg 50g bar of plain chocolate 50mg Source: www.eatwell.gov.uk 18Frozen drinks People who can swallow safely may be able to managefrozen drinks. These provide variety of texture, can befortified to increase their energy content and can increasefluid intakes. 19For people who find it difficult to handle cups due to tremor or weak muscle tone, frozen drinks assorbets or ice pops served in inedible easy-to-hold conesmay help to promote independence. Fruit and vegetables Eating more fruit and vegetables can significantly reducethe risk of many chronic diseases. 20It has been estimated that eating at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit andvegetables a day (at least 400g a day) could reduce the riskof deaths from chronic diseases such as coronary heartdisease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer by up to 20%. 21 One study of adults with learning disabilities in supportedaccommodation found that about 80% of participants ateless than the recommended minimum of 5 portions a day. 2 It has been estimated that diet might contribute to thedevelopment of one-third of all cancers, and that highervegetable consumption would reduce the risk of colorectalcancer and gastric cancer, and there is also some evidencethat higher fruit and vegetable consumption may reducethe risk of breast cancer. 22Other health benefits of eating enough fruits and vegetables include delaying thedevelopment of cataracts, reducing the symptoms ofasthma, improving bowel function, helping to managediabetes, increasing fibre intake, reducing fat intake, andproviding good sources of folate (for example, in greenleafy vegetables and oranges). 23 The reason why fruit and vegetables are so beneficial isbecause of the array of compounds they contain. As well asvitamins and minerals, fruit and vegetables also containmany complex plant components (called phytochemicals),including flavonoids, glucosinilates and phyto-oestrogens.Some of the vitamins and phytochemicals are alsoantioxidants, destroying free radicals in the body. Thesefree radicals are known to have a role in causing cancer aswell as other harmful effects. It appears that the benefits of fruit and vegetables stemnot only from the individual components, but also from theinteractions between these components. Dietarysupplements containing isolated vitamins or minerals donot appear to have the same beneficial effects as fruit andvegetables themselves. Indeed, in some research studies,supplements were found to cause more harm than good. 2429552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8687 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day What counts towards 5 a day? Any fruit or vegetables: fresh, frozen or canned . 150ml of 100% fruit juice . This counts only as 1 portion a day, however much is consumed.Dried fruit . 1 portion of dried fruit is about a tablespoon of raisins or currants, 3 dried apricots,2 dried figs or 3 dried prunes. Dried fruit countsonly as 1 portion a day. Examples of how to eat 5 a day A portion of fruit or vegetables should be 80g ormore and a glass of fruit juice about 150ml.

It iscurrently recommended that adults have no more than 6gof salt a day and children proportionally less depending ontheir age. 25Advice on salt and health can be found on the Food Standards Agency website at www.salt.gov.uk. How to reduce salt in the diet Three-quarters of the salt we eat is in processed foods suchas soups, sauces, ready meals, meat products such as piesand pasties, bacon and ham, take-away foods, savourysnacks, and foods like bread and breakfast cereals. There isno need to stop eating foods which are higher in salt, but itmay be necessary to eat them less often and in smalleramounts.Think about the amount of salt you use when cooking andat the table. Try not to add salt automatically - peopleshould always taste food first.There are lots of ways to add flavour to food without usingsalt - for example: - Add fresh herbs to dishes.- Use tomato pur\u00e9e to add flavour.- Marinade meat and fish in advance to give them more flavour. - Use garlic, ginger, chilli, lemon or lime to add flavour to meat and fish dishes. - Use spices such as cumin, coriander and turmeric.- Use black pepper as seasoning instead of salt.- Roast vegetables such as red peppers, courgettes, fennel, parsnips and squash to bring out their flavour. - Add fruit to meat dishes to give a naturally sweet flavour (eg. pork and apricots). - Make your own sauces and gravies and avoid using stock cubes and instant gravy mixes. - Use a smaller amount of strong cheese in dishes, rather than a larger amount of mild cheese. There is a lot of practical information on reducing salt inthe diet on www.salt.gov.uk Checking labels Look at the figure for salt (or sodium) per 100g.High is more than 1.5g of salt per 100g (or 0.6g of sodium).Low is 0.3g of salt or less per 100g (or 0.1g of sodium). If the amount of salt per 100g is in between these figures,the food has a medium level of salt.29552_Text:29552_Text 2/11/07 08:53 Page 8788 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day Sugar Diets which are high in sugar contribute to obesity as wellas tooth decay, and very sugary foods may contain fewnutrients. Most adults and children in the UK eat too muchsugar, and people who drink soft drinks regularly or have a'sweet tooth' are likely to be exceeding the currentrecommendations for the amount of sugars in the diet (seepage 39).To cut down on sugar: Have fewer sugary drinks and snacks. See page 84 for other ideas for nutritious snacks. Drink water between meals or unsweetened fruit juice with meals. Fruit juice can be diluted with sparklingwater. Replace cakes or biscuits with currant buns, plain scones, or malt loaf with low-fat spread, or have fresh fruitinstead. If people take sugar in hot drinks, or add sugar to breakfast cereal, gradually encourage them to reduce theamount until they can cut it out altogether. Choose tins of fruit in juice rather than syrup. Choose wholegrain breakfast cereals rather than those coated with sugar or honey. Checking food labels When you are checking food labels, you can use theinformation below as a guide to work out if a food is highor low in sugar, per 100g.Look for the 'Carbohydrates (of which sugars)' figure in thenutrition information panel on the label. High is more than 15g of sugars per 100g. Low is 5g of sugars or less per 100g. If the amount of sugars per 100g is in between thesefigures, the food contains a medium level of sugars. Meat and fish Meat and meat products are a good source of protein andsome vitamins and minerals, particularly iron and zinc. Theiron in meat is more easily absorbed by the body than ironfrom vegetable sources. However, there has been someconcern over a possible link between large intakes of meatand some types of cancer and there is evidence that dietswith less red meat and less processed meat (for example,the meat in pies, burgers, sausages and cold meats) andmore vegetables reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. 22Redmeat should be eaten in moderation, and processed meatsshould be kept to a minimum. There is a lot of evidence that including oil-rich fish in thediet can be beneficial in reducing the risk of heartdisease. 26However, there is as yet no conclusive evidence that oil-rich fish can improve behaviour and learning.People who eat fish should have 1 portion of oily fish eachweek - for example, salmon, trout, mackerel, herring orsardines - as these contain protective mackerel, sardines, herring or sild are also good sources of omega-3 fats.Canned tuna fish does not contain enough fat to beincluded in this category. There is no equivalent food forvegetarians but a diet which is rich in wholegrain cereals,peas, beans and lentils, vegetables and fruit is also likely tobe protective against heart disease. Vegetarian diets Vegetarian diets can vary in the foods restricted and, if aperson says he or she is a vegetarian, it is important to findout what they do and do not eat. Most vegetarian dietsexclude meat, some but not all exclude fish, and some mayalso exclude dairy products or eggs. Vegetarian diets havetraditionally been eaten by many people throughout theworld, particularly in Asia. Vegetarianism is commonamong Hindus and some Sikhs and also among Rastafariansand Seventh Day Adventists. Some people may also chooseto be vegetarian because they believe the diet is healthier,because they are concerned about the environment, foodsafety or animal welfare, or because they dislike the taste ofmeat.A vegetarian diet can provide all the nutrients needed forgood health and it has been shown that vegetarians havediets which are lower in fat and saturated fat and higher incomplex carbohydrates and fibre. 27However, it is important not to assume that vegetarian diets are healthy, as somepeople may remove meat from their diet withoutconsuming suitable alternatives and it is harder to consumesufficient iron and zinc if a good variety of foods is noteaten. Vegetarian diets usually have a high proportion ofcereals and the higher levels of fibre and substances calledphytates in cereal foods make it harder for the body to usethe iron and zinc in foods. The body absorbs iron more easily from animal sources -such as meat - than from non-animal sources such ascereals or vegetables (see page 44). This means thatvegetarians have to take extra care to make sure that theyget enough iron. There is some evidence that vegetarian29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8889 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day women in particular have low levels of iron.28For advice on iron in the diet see page 44.Zinc intakes may also be lower among vegetarians. Eating agood variety of foods ensures that vegetarians haveadequate zinc intakes. Sources of zinc include fortifiedbreakfast cereals, tofu, nuts, peas, beans and lentils, sesameseeds and milk and cheese. When cooking for vegetarians the following are important. Offer suitable meat substitutes at meals (see page 129 for example vegetarian eating plans). Respect the right of those who avoid meat and fish to have a diet free of these foods by ensuring that separatecooking pots, utensils and cooking oils are used for meatand non-meat dishes. Ensure that vegetarians are not given gravies made with meat juices, or soup made with meat stock. Avoid ingredients such as gelatine and animal fats in foods served to people who wish to avoid these foods.(Check the food labels.) Advice on vegetarian diets can be obtained from theVegetarian Society (see page 151). Vegan diets Vegans generally adopt a diet free of all animal productsand will not eat milk, cheese, yoghurt or eggs as well asavoiding meat and fish. It is possible to eat well as a vegan,but care has to be taken and people should always seekadvice on how to ensure that they get all the nutrients theyneed. Vegans need to ensure that they include sources ofvitamin B 12and riboflavin (see page 43) in their diet. Advice on vegan diets can be obtained from the VeganSociety (see page 151). Vitamin, mineral and herbalsupplements Most people can obtain all the vitamins and minerals thebody needs by eating a varied diet. Dietary supplementswhich contain vitamins and minerals may be useful in somecases where intake of nutrients are low (for example, if theamount of food eaten is very small for some reason) orwhere there may be increased needs (for example forvitamin D or iron). Advice should always be sought from amedical practitioner or pharmacist before supplements aretaken, because high doses of certain vitamins and minerals,and also some herbal supplements, can cause adversereactions and may interfere with the absorption of othernutrients. There is no evidence that taking large doses ofvitamin and mineral supplements are beneficial to healthand there is some evidence that they may be harmful. 24 Herbal supplements are often assumed to be safe becausethey are 'natural' but this alone does not imply safety, andadvice should always be sought before taking any type ofsupplement. A number of herbal supplements can interferewith the effectiveness of medicines. For example: St JohnsWort should not be taken by people on some anti-depressants, digoxin, warfarin or the contraceptive pill;ginseng and gingko can interfere with the action ofwarfarin; evening primrose oil should be avoided by peoplewith epilepsy; and betel nut can worsen asthma and causea return of movement disorders where drugs have beengiven to combat these. 29 School lunches Most children with learning disabilities will attend schooland some may receive school meals. Schools will beobliged to follow the standards for school meals specifiedby the appropriate Department for Education in the fourcountries of the UK. In England, advice on achieving schoolmeal standards can be obtained from the School FoodTrust (www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk). It is hoped, however,that a pragmatic, holistic approach to improving the foodavailable to children with learning disabilities in schools isdeveloped in all four countries of the UK. It is particularlyimportant that schools bring in the necessary changesslowly and with thought, so that pupils are notoverwhelmed with new foods and choices. The aim ofimproving school food across the UK is to ensure that allchildren and young people are offered a range of healthyand tasty food at school, that they learn more about whateating well means in practice, and that those children whoare entitled to free school meals in particular are enabledto meet a significant proportion of their nutritional needsthrough their school lunch. As schools for children withlearning disabilities often cater for a range of complexneeds and special diets, it is important that caterers andother staff in these schools are offered tailored training andsupport to meet the needs of the children and to enablethem to work in partnership with families and other carers.For children with complex needs and those with autisticspectrum disorders, it may be very difficult for support staffto fully involve children in school meals, and staff willrequire specific training on how to handle eating difficultiesand in how to support those who are entitled to freeschool meals effectively. For advice on how to managefaddy and selective eating, which may be more common29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 8990 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day among those with autism, see page 108.For more information on important things to think aboutwhen providing food in schools, see the Caroline WalkerTrust report Eating Well at School (details on inside front cover). Packed lunches People may take a packed lunch when they go to school,visit a day care centre, college or other facility, or go on anouting. A survey of packed lunches made for school-agedchildren showed that almost half of lunchboxes surveyed(48%) contained no fruit or vegetables and that one-sixthof lunchboxes (16%) did not contain a starchy food such assandwiches, pasta or rice. In addition, foods high in fat, saltand sugar - such as crisps, fat spreads, cheese products,chocolate bars, biscuits and crisps - were served in about70% of lunchboxes. 30 It is important that a packed lunch provides the samevariety of foods and nutrients as the meal it might bereplacing. A packed lunch should contain: A starchy food . For example, any sort of bread, pitta bread, chapatti, crispbreads, rice cakes, or wraps. Chooselower-salt breads where available. A meat, fish or alternative . Alternatives include, for example, egg, cheese, peanut butter, or houmous. One portion of vegetables . For example, raw vegetables or salad. One portion of fresh or dried fruit or fresh fruit juice. A drink . Water, milk or fresh fruit juice are good choices. The quantity of food provided in a packed lunch willdepend on the needs of an individual, and all the otherprinciples outlined in this report should be consideredwhen planning an appropriate packed lunch. Additionalsnacks such as plain popcorn, breadsticks, unsalted nuts,pumpkin or sunflower seeds, rice crackers or pretzels couldbe added occasionally and a yoghurt or fromage fraisprovides a good source of calcium. For people who havehigher energy needs, some more energy-dense foods mayalso be appropriate. See page 84 for more ideas for snackfoods, and chapter 11 for general information on menusand menu planning,Eating out and take-aways Eating out is an important part of lifestyle for many peopleand offers the opportunity to socialise, meet friends andtake a break from food preparation and clearing up. Whilethere should be no barrier to where people eat out,anecdotal evidence suggests that many people withlearning disabilities, and those who care for them, feelmore comfortable eating out in more anonymous outlets,particularly fast food restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Family, friendsand support staff should think about varying the choiceand variety of foods on offer to the people they support.Habitually eating fast food is likely to mean that intakes offat, saturated fat, salt and sugar are higher thanrecommended and this is often the case if fast food mealsare treated as snacks rather than as meals. The high energydensities of many fast foods challenge human appetitecontrol systems and promote 'passive over-consumption' sothat regular consumers are likely to accidentally consumetoo many calories and therefore gain weight. 31 Take-aways There is anecdotal evidence that take-away foods are verypopular among some people with learning disabilities,particularly when people gain greater freedom to chooseand shop for their own foods. Take-away foods are easy toobtain, the variety of foods on offer is large, they can berelatively cheap to buy and the foods are often very much enjoyed, particularly in social settings, so it isunderstandable that it is tempting for some people to use these outlets regularly. Many foods available in Chinese and Indian restaurants and take-aways are high in fat and salt. For suggestions for healthier take-awayoptions, see Tips on eating out and take-aways on the next page.For anyone who has eating difficulties, particular careshould be taken when ordering take-away food, particularlyrice-based dishes, which can cause choking. Individualadvice needs to be sought regarding suitable take-awayfoods for anyone with swallowing difficulties.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 9091 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day Food allergy and foodintolerance Food intolerance is defined as a reproducible andunpleasant reaction to a specific food ingredient. A foodallergy is a form of food intolerance where there isevidence of an abnormal immunological reaction (areaction of the immune system). Foods that can causesevere reactions include peanuts, nuts, shellfish, sesameseeds, cow's milk, eggs, citrus fruits, soya beans, wheat andother cereals. A minority of people experience adverse effects from somefoods or food ingredients. Between 4% and 10% ofchildren are estimated to have intolerance to one or morefoods, but this is most predominant in the first three yearsof life. 32Among adults it is estimated that about 1%-2% of people have true food intolerance.33There is no data to suggest that food allergy and intolerance are moreprevalent among people with learning disabilities. Food allergies are most likely to occur in children with afamily history of allergies such as hay fever, eczema orasthma. True food allergy should always be taken extremelyseriously and expert advice sought from a medicalpractitioner. If someone has a food allergy it is importantthat everyone understands the importance of avoidingcontact with those foods that may trigger a seriousreaction and that full information on the food allergy iscarefully recorded in care plans, and is communicated toschools, day centres or other places that the person mayvisit regularly. For sources of advice on how to managefood allergies see Resources in Appendix 4. Some people may also have a food aversion which causesan unpleasant reaction in the body due to emotionsassociated with a food. People may become convinced thatthey are sensitive to a food and this can be encouraged bysome popular books and unorthodox practitioners. 34People with learning disabilities, and their family, friends andsupport staff, should be discouraged from attempting torestrict the person's diet due to a perceived allergy orintolerance, as this may make it difficult for them to get allthe nutrients they need. This is particularly true if foodssuch as milk and milk products, or bread and other cerealsare avoided. It is not easy to diagnose food allergies andfood allergy tests sold on the high street or by unqualifiedpractitioners should be viewed with caution.Migraine headaches may be triggered by a number offactors including some foods. Alcoholic drinks, chocolate,cheese and citrus fruits have been reported to bring onmigraine in some people. 34People should seek advice if they think migraine may be triggered by certain foods.Tips on eating out and take-aways Indian meals Good choices: Tandoori chicken or other meat or fish (which is cooked in an oven), chicken or othermeat or fish tikka (meat on a skewer withoutsauce), dry curries, vegetable curries, channadahl, plain or roti breads. High-fat foods to avoid: Papadums and other fried foods such as samosas and bhajias, creamyor coconut-based sauces (such as rices (such as pilau rice), and breads whichhave added (such as naan bread).Chinese meals Good choices: Stir-fries, chicken, vegetable or prawn chop suey, steamed fish, vegetable dishes,boiled noodles and dishes with steamed tofu. High-fat foods to avoid: Avoid batter (for example sweet and sour chicken, battered bananas or applefritters), spring rolls and prawn crackers. Avoid friedrice dishes and fried noodles.PizzaChoose thin-crust pizzas, and pizzas withoutcheese in the crust.Avoid having extra cheese, pepperoni or salami.Add more vegetable or fish toppings instead.Encourage eating a salad with the pizza.Fish and chip shopsFish is a good choice but batter is high in fat andeating less or no batter could be encouraged.Choose small portions of chips. Mushy peas orbaked beans are a good accompaniment. Avoid pies or battered sausage-type products.Burger barsGo for standard rather than 'super-size' options.Choose a plain burger in a bun with a salad. Avoid extra cheese or mayonnaise, thick milkshakes, chicken nuggets or other battered dishessuch as onion rings. Avoid French fries.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 9192 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day Food hygiene and safety Food should always be stored, prepared and presented in asafe and hygienic environment. Extra care is needed whenpreparing food for people who may be vulnerable toinfection, as they may have a lower resistance to foodpoisoning. Most support staff will need to complete a FoodHygiene Certificate course. For more information on this,contact the local authority's environmental healthdepartment.Support staff need to know about storage of food andleftover food, and thorough cooking or heating of foods.Several useful publications are available from the FoodStandards Agency (see Resources in Appendix 4). Support staff should obtain these and follow the advice in them.Some of the main points for support staff are given in thebox opposite.It is also important that children, young people, adults withlearning disabilities and family, friends and support staff aregiven information about the importance of basic hygienemeasures to prevent infections - for example, not eatingfood that has fallen on the floor, and washing hands withsoap and water before eating meals or snacks and aftergoing to the toilet or handling animals. This is particularlyimportant for people with learning disabilities who aregoing to become independent and who may have hadmore limited exposure to food handling in earlier places ofresidence.Children under 5 and anyone who has any form of eatingdifficulty should never be left unattended when eating ordrinking, as they may choke.Food hygiene and safety hints This information is not designed to replaceappropriate training but is here as a reminder ofsome of the important standard practices. Everyone should wash their hands with soap and water before preparing food or helpingpeople to eat. If a handkerchief is used whilepreparing food, hands should be washedbefore continuing. All work surfaces and utensils used in the preparation of food should be clean. Don't leave perishable food at room temperatures for more than 2 hours.Perishable food brought from home, includingsandwiches, should be kept in a fridge or coolplace below 8 oC. Pets should not be allowed near food, dishes, worktops or food preparation areas. Insulated cool boxes, or a cool box with cool packs, should be used for carrying food whentaking people on trips or outings. Eggs should be kept in the fridge. Food stocks should be rotated, and food beyond its use-by date discarded. If food is to be eaten warm, it should be re- heated until piping hot (70oC) for 2 minutes and then cooled down before serving. Avoid keeping food hot for long periods. Cool leftover food quickly, cover and refrigerate, ideally within 1 to 2 hours. Fruit and vegetables to be eaten raw should be washed well. Whole pieces of nut or chopped nuts should not be given to anyone at risk of choking.Ground nuts can be included in foods whereappropriate. Allergic reactions can be very serious. There should be a careful plan for choosing a safeand nutritious diet for any individual with adiagnosed food allergy (see page 91).29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 9293 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day The eating environment and timing of meals and snacks All children, young people or adults with learning disabilities should be respected as individuals and their food preferences and religious and cultural requirements around food should be accommodated. Food should be appetising and attractively served, to ensure that people enjoy their food. This is particularly important if the food has its form or texture changed for people with swallowing difficulties. The timing of meals and snacks throughout the day should be organised to fit around the needs of the individual being supported. Some people may need frequent small meals and snacks throughout the day. It is important to ensure that everyone has enough time to eat and drink and that, where necessary, food is kept warm safely during the meal for those who eat and drink slowly. It is important to ensure that people arrive at mealtimes ready for the eating occasion, for example, having had the opportunity to go to the toilet and wash their hands or collect their hearing aid, glasses or dentures.Where possible, children, young people and adults with learning disabilities should have the opportunity toserve themselves at mealtimes and independence in eating should be encouraged. The appropriate cutlery,crockery, tables and chairs should be available to ensure that everyone is as comfortable and independent aspossible. To make mealtimes a time of pleasant social sharing, and as good practice, staff should sit with the people they support during meals and snacks, and where appropriate share the same foods and drinks. Mealtimes offer an opportunity for support staff to model eating skills and to encourage social interaction and conversation. To encourage this, distractions such as television are best avoided during mealtimes. Breakfast Breakfast is an important meal, firstly because many breakfast foods are a very good source of fibre and other important nutrients, and secondly because, if breakfast is missed, it is more likely that individuals willbe tempted by other snack foods later in the day. For those who have a good appetite in the morning that recedes as the day continues, breakfast should be seen as an opportunity to eat a significant amount of energy (calories) and other nutrients, and a range offoods should be offered, rather than just traditional breakfast foods. Snacks A variety of snacks should be offered and these should be included in menu plans. Snacks provide an opportunity to supplement nutritional intakes between meals and can be particularly important for thosewith small appetites or who are fussy or selective eaters, or who are growing rapidly. However, for thosepeople with learning disabilities who are gaining weight or who have been advised to lose weight, snacksthat are high in fat and sugar (such as confectionery, savoury snacks, soft drinks, cakes, biscuits and icecream) should be kept to a minimum as these frequently contribute significant extra calories to the diet. Drinks It is important that everyone is encouraged to drink a sufficient, but not excessive, amount of fluid each day and it should not be assumed that people will necessarily drink enough fluid without encouragement. Mostadults need at least 1.2 litres of fluid a day (about 6 glasses) but older people or people who are prone toconstipation should be encouraged to have at least 1.5 litres a day (about 7 to 8 glasses). However, excessivefluid (more than 5 litres a day) can be very dangerous and advice should be sought from a medicalpractitioner if there is concern that someone is drinking excessively. Free, fresh, chilled tap water should always be offered with meals and regularly throughout the day and should be widely available in any places where people with learning disabilities may live, work or visit. The amount of soft drinks given to children with learning disabilities should be limited since these offer little nutritional benefit and may suppress appetite and prevent children eating more nutritious foods. If softdrinks (such as squashes) containing saccharin are given to the under-5s, they should be diluted much morethan they would be for an adult - for example, a dilution of 1 part squash to 10 parts water.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 9394 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day If sugary, fruit-based or fizzy drinks are given to children and young people with learning disabilities, they should be kept to mealtimes since frequent consumption of soft drinks is related to tooth decay and tootherosion. Drinks other than milk or water are highly likely to contribute to tooth decay, so they should notbe given at bedtime or during the night. Vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements Advice should always be sought from a medical practitioner or pharmacist before any dietary supplements are taken, as high doses of certain vitamins and minerals and some herbal supplements can cause adversereactions and may interfere with the absorption of other nutrients or with the action of medicines. See also: page 54 for information on supplements for pregnant women; page 53 for information on vitamindrops for children; and page 47 for information on vitamin D supplements. Food allergy and food intolerance If a child, young person or adult with a learning disability has a medically diagnosed food allergy, this needs to be taken extremely seriously. It is important that everyone understands the importance of avoidingcontact with those foods that may trigger a serious reaction. Full information on the food allergy should becarefully recorded in care plans and be communicated to schools, day centres and any other places thatthe person may visit regularly. It is important that food allergies should be medically diagnosed. People with learning disabilities, their family, friends and support staff should be discouraged from attempting to restrict a person's diet due to aperceived allergy or intolerance, as this may make it difficult for the person to get all the nutrients theyneed. This is particularly true if foods such as milk and milk products or bread and other cereals areavoided. Food hygiene and safety It is important to remind children, young people and adults with learning disabilities, and their family, friends and support staff, about the importance of washing their hands with soap and water before eatingmeals or snacks and after going to the toilet. Support staff should always wash their hands with soap and water before preparing food or before helping people to eat, and after they have blown their nose. Support staff should seek information about food hygiene and safety, and requirements for training, from their local authority's environmental health department. Support staff need to ensure they know how to store food safely, handle leftover food, and cook and heat food appropriately. Children under 5 and anyone who has any form of eating difficulty should never be left unattended when eating or drinking, as they may choke.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:07 Page 9495 Chapter 7 How to eat well throughout the day References 1 AskMencap (2006) Diet and people with a learning disability. http://www.askmencap.info 2 Robertson J, Emerson E, Gregory N et al (2000) Lifestyle-related risk factors for poor health in residential settings for people withintellectual disabilities.

Some of the information in this section relates to residentialcare environments and to the role of support staff, but much isalso relevant to other living arrangements and household types.Just as for all members of society, there is no one right way tosupport people to eat and drink well. This section aims to openup debate on some of the issues and to suggest somestrategies that may help. Philosophy of care: rights andresponsibilities It is a fundamental human right that everyone should haveaccess to food and drink that is both nutritionally adequate andculturally acceptable, and it is important to work together toensure that people with learning disabilities are supported tomake choices and understand the importance of eating well.Person-centred care aims to ensure that the individual remainsthe most important person in determining how they aresupported, and promotes the rights of everyone to maximumindependence and choice. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 9798 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating wellMental Capacity Act 2005 A policy of maximising choice is not new in services forpeople with learning disabilities, but has become a centraltheme in all four UK countries over the last 20 years. 1Some people with learning disabilities need information andexplanation of how food choices can impact on their healthand wellbeing, so that they can make a more informedchoice. Others may need greater support in makingchoices or managing food and drink that is appropriate totheir health needs. Some people may at times find itdifficult to make choices at all. The Mental Capacity Act2005, which came into force in 2007, is an important pieceof legislation which will change how decision making maybe handled for some people with more severe learningdisabilities.The terms of the Act are likely to affect everyone involvedin caring for someone with a learning disability, whetherformally or informally, if at some time the person with alearning disability lacks the capacity to make a particulardecision or take a particular action for themselves at thetime the decision or action needs to be taken. The Act setsout a single clear test for assessing whether a person lackscapacity to take a particular decision at a particular time. Itis a 'decision-specific' and 'time-specific' test. No-one canbe labelled 'incapable' simply as a result of a particularmedical condition or diagnosis. Section 2 of the Act makesit clear that a lack of capacity cannot be established merelyby reference to a person's age, appearance, or anycondition or aspect of a person's behaviour.The Act is supported by a Code of Practice which providesguidance to anyone who is working with and/or caring forpeople over the age of 16 who may lack the capacity tomake particular decisions. The Act is underpinned by fivekey principles: A presumption of capacity. Every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be assumed tohave capacity to do so unless it is proved otherwise. Individuals being supported to make their own decisions. A person must be given all practicable help beforeanyone treats them as not being able to make their owndecisions. Unwise decisions . Just because an individual makes what might be seen as an unwise decision, they should not betreated as lacking capacity to make that decision. Best interests. An act done or decision made under the Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity mustbe done in their best interests. Least restrictive option. Anything done for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity should be the leastrestrictive of their basic rights and freedoms. The Act also establishes a new court, the Court ofProtection, a new Office of the Public Guardian and a newIndependent Mental Capacity Advocate service which willemploy Independent Mental Capacity Advocates or IMCAs.An IMCA will be someone appointed to support a personwho lacks capacity but has no-one to speak for them, suchas family or friends. The IMCA makes representations aboutthe person's wishes, feelings, beliefs and values, at thesame time as bringing to the attention of the decision-maker all factors that are relevant to the decision. Moreinformation about the Act and the Code of Practice and aseries of publications have been produced by theDepartment of Constitutional Affairs (see Resources on page 155). Taking responsibility for health People taking responsibility for their own health is now partof most government public health strategies 2, 3, 4, 5and people with learning disabilities should be encouraged totake the same responsibility for their own health as otherpeople in society. However, access to health facilitators isessential for people with learning disabilities, so that peoplewho may be less able to act as 'expert patients' in a systemwhich increasingly expects well informed, articulateconsumers, do not become further disempowered. It isalso important to remember that many people withlearning disabilities may live in poor households and mayexperience inequalities in their environment and theirhealth. It is important that access to services is madeequally available to all, and that all support staff are trainedto support those who may live in poorer households. Helping people make goodchoices During the research for this report, the author met peoplewho worked with learning-disabled people and who hadvery different views on the concept of choice. For some,allowing an individual to drink six cans of cola a day if theychose to do so was seen as 'individual choice and aperson's right'. Others, however, argued that guidance onchoice is needed where the choices made can have anegative impact on health. To restrict food and drinkchoices among people with learning disabilities when theseare not restricted to other members of society would seemunfair. To allow someone to become overweight and ill,and in some cases to put their lives at risk, when they maybe unable to consider the consequences of their actionsmight, however, seem even more unfair. There is achanging mood in terms of free choice of food and drink in29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 9899 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating wellthe UK, as the consequences of unlimited choice impactsignificantly on the nation's health. For example, theGovernment is acting to restrict food choice in schoolssince it has had to conclude that many children and youngpeople fail to make good choices on their own in anenvironment of unlimited choice and that their vulnerabilityto food-related ill health requires legislation. A recent review suggested that among the main factorsinfluencing choice and decision-making around food forpeople with learning disabilities are past experiences, anawareness of the range of choices, and the role of carers insupporting and encouraging choice. 6The authors of that review conclude that directing choice-making around food,without encouraging unhealthy eating, is an essentialcomponent of a duty of care for vulnerable adults. In orderto support people with learning disabilities to make goodchoices around food and drink, it is essential that family,friends and support staff are confident themselves aboutwhat eating well means. We hope that the information inthis report will be useful in helping people to find out moreabout eating well and that appropriate on-going training ofsupport staff will be supported by employers (see page 100).Most people are likely to have strong opinions about foodsand drinks they like and dislike and will have routines andpatterns of eating which they prefer to follow. It is not therole of support staff to dictate what better choices mightbe, but people with learning disabilities have the sameright as anyone else to be given relevant information abouttheir health and the impacts of their choices on theirhealth.A variety of foods and drinks should be made available toeveryone and support staff should be trained andsupported to help people with learning disabilities makeinformed choices. Where there are communicationdifficulties around food and drink choices and eating,support staff should be encouraged to develop skills ininterpreting people's wishes.Each person will have different requirements around foodand drink and therefore it is important to be sensitive toany restrictions that might be necessary (for example infood texture) when talking about dietary change.Family, friends and support staff may find the followingsuggestions useful when considering how to encouragepeople to consider the choices they make: Sharing snack times and mealtimes with other people provides an opportunity for discussion and people maybe more tempted to try new foods and drinks if otherpeople around them are enjoying them. Keep a record with the service user of their typical eating and drinking patterns over a few days and use this to talkabout the foods and drinks they like, the quantities theyhave and their preferred routines, to see if they areactually enjoying their current choices. Use pictures or photographs of different types of foods and drinks, in different portion sizes, to encouragepeople to think about new foods and drinks or thebalance of foods and drinks they have. There are a number of games available, some of which might be suitable for some people with learningdisabilities. These can be a useful springboard fordiscussion. (See page 153.) Small changes over time are likely to be more effective. If people consume large amounts of one particular food ordrink (for example, if they are large consumers of fizzydrinks throughout the day), suggest that one drink isswapped for an alternative to start with. Gentlydistracting someone from a food or drink habit whichmay be harming their health by spending time with theperson and sharing an alternative can be effective. Ensure that food being offered as an alternative is attractively presented. Using colourful plates with goodcontrast to the food can be helpful. If people need to lose weight, consider some of the strategies outlined on page 65. Look at food labels together and explain how to make choices between similar products. There are a number of behavioural learning routes whichmight be helpful in encouraging people with learningdisabilities to make positive changes to dietary habits whichmay be detrimental.Fading involves gradually replacing some foods or drinks with others. This could take the form of slowly reducing theamount of sugar in tea and coffee, diluting squashes moreover time until water becomes the drink of choice, orreplacing some biscuits on a plate with fruit and slowlychanging the proportions offered. Replacement can be used as a method of helping those who have very limited food choices to expand the numberof foods they eat. For example, if someone only likes to eatchips, then other root vegetables can be cut into the sameshape and cooked in the same way and be introducedamong with the chips and, if accepted, the proportion canbe gradually increased.Association can also be used to encourage change. Sometimes people associate pleasant experiences withparticular foods. For example, someone may associateeating crisps with enjoying television-viewing as a child. Itmay be possible to reverse this by introducing other foodsin similar situations to create other positive associations. Role modelling is a powerful social learning tool and family, friends and support staff should be encouraged to29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 99100 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating welleat in a social situation with people with learningdisabilities as much as possible, even when someone mayneed help with eating. Eating together is an important partof social inclusion in most cultures and can also be animportant part of the day for sharing information andnews. Organisational culture In residential care, other supported living arrangementsand day care it is essential that there is a commitment togood nutrition and an awareness of the wider role of foodand drink in contributing to wellbeing and quality of life.Managers and staff at all levels need to demonstrate theircommitment to good nutrition so that it becomes part ofthe organisational culture of the place of residence.Commitment to eating well may mean that staff shifts,staff training and staff support are all reconsidered in thelight of the needs of residents for support in eating anddrinking. In order for an organisation to work effectively asa team to support eating well, it is essential that all staffunderstand why it matters and know how to assesswhether people are eating and drinking adequately. Moreinformation on staff training can be found below. The overall ethos of care should be person-centred andtherefore the accumulation of information from eachperson, and from their relatives and friends, about theirfood and drink preferences, desired meal patterns andchoices around where and when to eat are an essential toolfor all staff in ensuring continuity of care. This informationshould be recorded, shared with all support staff, andregularly updated. For those offering respite care, it isessential that family, friends and support staff, as well asthe person himself or herself, are given the opportunity todiscuss how a change in living arrangement may impact ontheir usual eating and drinking routines so that everyonecan work together to ensure that there is continuity ofcare. Staff training and support It is essential that all staff are valued and that theirsignificant contribution to the support of people withlearning disabilities is acknowledged. The importance ofstaff training cannot be over-emphasised. In order thatpeople with learning disabilities are supported to eat anddrink well, it is essential that everyone who supports them,paid or unpaid, has a clear idea about what eating wellmeans in practice and that appropriate training is on-goingfor all staff regardless of whether they are permanent,temporary, employed through an agency, or are voluntary. It is important that anyone who supports those who needassistance with eating is trained to help in a sensitive andefficient way. Helping someone with eating difficulties toeat and drink well can be complex and stressful and it isessential that staff are given sufficient support fromcolleagues when this is challenging. Support staff may bereluctant to help with eating and drinking if they find thisdistressing, and they may need support from anotherperson, peer group support sessions, or specialist help andsupport.Currently there is insufficient training on nutrition andhealth in the National Vocational Qualifications for Healthand Social Care (and equivalent Scottish VocationalQualifications) typically undertaken by those who work assupport staff for people with learning disabilities. Whilethere is scope within the level 2 NVQ/SVQ for goodpractice to be taught, the modules on providing food anddrink and helping individuals to eat are optional and thelevel of information given is very dependent on the trainingcentre. Ad hoc investigation of a number of trainingcentres found that there was frequently no contribution totraining or assessment by a dietitian or registered publichealth nutritionist. There is no unit on eating and drinkingat NVQ/SVQ level 3 and no specific unit available on eatingand drinking for people with learning disabilities. NVQs,SVQs and other appropriate social care qualifications areimportant training opportunities for support workers andother staff. Qualifications at all levels should contain anappropriate section on nutrition and eating well whichallows students to understand the information in thisreport. Additional on-going training on nutrition should beorganised by employers for all those who support peoplewith learning disabilities in their care, to supplement thetraining they receive elsewhere. Where training in eatingwell is given in a group setting, this should be given or besupported by a registered dietitian or registered publichealth nutritionist. Involving and listening tofamily and friends Food and drink can be an emotive issue and sometimes itcan be difficult to reconcile the wishes of family membersand friends with changes in choices or routines thatsupport staff may wish to put in place to encourage eatingwell. Some family members and friends may have strongbeliefs about the need for particular foods and feel stronglyif access to certain foods and drinks is limited or if changesare made to the types of ingredients or basic foodstuffsused. This can be difficult for support staff who are trying29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 100101 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating wellto make positive changes, and upsetting for families andfriends who believe they have the individual's best interestsat heart. Below are some suggestions which may be ahelpful starting point for staff discussing food and drinkissues with families and friends.Think about making small changes over time. It may be easier to phase in changes to the menus or daily food anddrink routines little by little, discussing and reviewingchanges as you go along and ensuring that the views of theperson with learning disabilities, and of their families andfriends, are taken into consideration.Make change familiar. Talking about the changes you want to make and focusing on the positive aspects - perhaps byoffering tasting sessions, providing leaflets or otherinformation to service users and their families and friendsthat support the changes you want to make - will allow thenovel to become more familiar and less threatening. Listen and allow people to discuss ideas . No-one likes change that is forced on them, yet most people respondfavourably to change they create themselves. Provideenough background information and a forum for people toreflect on and discuss the implications of the changes youdesire, and encourage family and friends to make their ownsuggestions.Ensure everyone in the organisation is on side with thechanges so the messages given are united and everyone shares a clear vision of what you are trying to achieve.Avoid confrontation and keep things in perspective. Eating and drinking well means having a variety of food and drinkover a period of time, so think in terms of the biggerpicture rather than demonising any particular foods ordrinks that may be a source of conflict. Food as a treat or reward Food has a significant role in many people's lives and theuse of food as a treat, reward or consolation, or thewithholding of food as punishment, are measures mostpeople will be familiar with from their own lives and thelives of others. It is of course never acceptable to withholdfood or drink from anyone, but support staff may be lessimmediately aware of how often food and drink are used astreats and rewards. Some support staff offer food and drinkthat they consider as 'treats' to compensate a person withlearning disabilities for what they may consider difficultcircumstances or conditions. This may mean, for example,that some support staff offer sweets and soft drinks morefrequently to people with learning disabilities than theywould to other people they cared for, or that relatives andfriends visiting people with learning disabilities might bemore likely to bring fizzy drinks, sweets, biscuits and cakesas treats to comfort the person. It is important that anyonewho supports a person with learning disabilities considersthe needs of the individual in a holistic way and thinksabout how best to support them to good health. A person with learning disabilities who is overweight orwho has dental health problems may not be bestsupported with sweet treats but might enjoy fruit, fruitjuice or non-food gifts from friends and relatives. It may beuseful for the person with learning disabilities to work witha supporter to come up with a list of treats that they wouldenjoy which are also health-promoting and which theycould ask people to donate instead of sweet treats. Forexample, this could be a trip or outing, music or a film, orhousehold or garden equipment. For people on lowincomes, some types of fresh and dried fruit can beexpensive and supporters could find out the varieties thatwould be particularly enjoyed and offer those as treats andgifts.Rewards are often given to encourage good behaviour orto reward people if they have done well in a particular task.Rather than giving sweets, chocolates and sweet snackssuch as biscuits to reward good behaviour, rewards can begiven in the form of smiles and praise ('soft rewards') or assmall inexpensive items such as stickers or badges ('hardrewards'). Most people enjoy both soft and hard rewardsand it is important to make all people feel proud of theirachievements, however small. Engaging with health andother professionals There are a number of health professionals who are likely tobe involved in the support of people with learningdisabilities. Children with learning disabilities usually havetheir care coordinated by a paediatrician. For adults, mosthealth authorities across the UK have a team providingspecialist health and social care to people with learningdisabilities living in the community. These are commonlycalled Community Learning Disability Teams (CLDT), butnames may differ in some areas. The teams are multi-disciplinary and may include members from social care, thehealth service and mental health trusts. CLDTs employ awide range of specialists including community learningdisability nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists,psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, speech andlanguage therapists, dietitians, hearing and visualtherapists, pharmacists, psychologists, challengingbehaviour workers and psychiatric nurses. However, the29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 101102 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating wellaccess of individuals and families to all these specialistservices is likely to vary across the country and it isimportant that people with learning disabilities remain incontact with their GP throughout their life span. Some of the key personnel in supporting eating anddrinking are outlined below.Speech and language therapists (SLTs) help with eating and drinking difficulties, providing assessment andintervention for those with swallowing difficulties. Thisincludes the development of strategies to enable safereating and drinking developed in partnership with theperson with a learning disability, family, friends and supportstaff and other members of the multi-disciplinary team. Occupational therapists (OTs) offer support and guidance to help individuals maintain independence and have anumber of key roles in supporting eating well. OTs canadvise on the immediate eating environment at mealtimes,and the use of appropriate equipment to aid eating anddrinking. They can also advise on positioning to promotefunction, comfort and safety, support staff on how tohandle mealtimes, and work with individuals to promoteindependence.Dietitians can assess nutritional status and intake and give advice on changes to the diet to improve energy andnutrient intake, as well as offering specialist dietary advicefor specific medical conditions. Dietitians can also adviseon menu planning, recipe development and cookingpractices and offer training to support staff and others oneating well. Dietitians work with other health professionalsto advise on artificial nutrition and texture modification forpeople with swallowing difficulties.Physiotherapists help and treat people of all ages with physical problems caused by illness, accident or ageing.Physiotherapy sees human movement as central to thehealth and wellbeing of individuals. Physiotherapists identifyand maximise movement potential through healthpromotion, preventive healthcare, treatment andrehabilitation and can offer advice on positioning, activityand improving mobility for people with learning disabilities.Community learning disability nurses are involved in planning programmes of care for an individual, skillsdevelopment, and teaching basic skills. They providenursing care in a variety of settings, and offer support andcounselling to family, friends and support staff. Theamount of training on nutrition that nurses will havereceived is likely to be variable and nurses may welcomeadditional up-to-date, on-going training on eating well.Psychologists within learning disability services can support staff and service users in understanding and managingeating and mealtime behaviour, issues around body imageand self-esteem, identity, anxiety and other factors whichmight contribute to disordered eating.In addition social workers have a key role in organising and monitoring services and support, and pharmacists play an increasingly important role in managing medication andproviding advice on interactions between certain drugs andfoods. Who can give nutrition advice? The term nutritionist is not a protected term andtherefore many people offer nutrition advice evenwhen they are not qualified to do so. Advice onnutrition should be sought from a registereddietitian (RD) or a registered public healthnutritionist (RPHNutr). For details of where toaccess these professionals, see page 151 inAppendix 4. Health action plans and annualhealth checks Health action plans A health action plan for each individual should be compiledto explain their health needs. These plans should be drawnup by the individual supported by a health facilitator, whichmay be someone from their community learning disabilityteam, a relative, partner, carer or friend. The aim of thehealth action plan is to provide an accessible, livingdocument. It can be considered as the health section oftheir person-centred plan and should include informationabout nutrition and health. The health action plan shouldbe made as accessible for the individual as possible.Drawings, photos, work books, drama and group work canall be used to increase the health literacy of people withlearning disabilities so they can participate more fully inplanning for their own health. People may also have moreconventional patient-held medical records that they canshare readily with health professionals and take toappointments. For more information on health actionplanning, see page 155. Annual health checks GPs should proactively offer people with learning disabilitiesan annual health check using tools developed as part of the Primary Care Service Framework for the Management of29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 102103 Chapter 8 Encouraging eating wellHealth for People with Learning Disabilities (see www.primarycarecontracting.nhs.uk/204.php). This shouldlook at a range of indicators related to nutritional healthsuch as body weight, weight change, bowel health, oralhealth, specific medical conditions such as diabetes andcoeliac disease, difficulties around eating and drinking, andany other issues that may be related to any of theconditions discussed in this report. Reviewing medication isalso important, particularly where medication impacts onnutritional status (see page 30). Health professionals needparticular skills in assessing the needs of people withlearning disabilities as well as skills in how to communicatewith those with limited communication skills. Good liaisonbetween medical practitioners, specialist learning disabilityteams and other health professionals should be fostered toensure that the annual health check is part of a holisticapproach to health planning for each individual. Children, young people and adults with learning disabilitiesshould also visit their dentist twice a year. Food knowledge and skills ofpeople with learningdisabilities Many people with learning disabilities wish to acquire newskills or improve existing skills. This may be to enhanceemployment prospects, to allow them to lead moreindependent lives or because they enjoy learning purely forits own sake. Opportunities to learn also provide peopleIntroducing material on eating wellas part of assessment and carepathways It is important that social care professionals andthose involved in assessing, planning for andotherwise helping people with learning disabilitiesrecognise that there are stages in the assessmentand care pathway where they can introduce in anappropriate way material about nutritional anddietary needs. There may well be opportunities totalk about eating well during: person-centred planning carer and user assessments case reviews, and day service curriculum. Resources which might be used to discuss issues around food andnutrition can be found on page 153.with new experiences and the chance to meet new peopleand make new friends. The provision of learningopportunities for people with learning disabilities is likely tovary across the UK as different colleges, learning and skillscouncils and local education authorities (LEAs) offerdifferent opportunities to begin, continue and extendlearning. Some areas will provide considerable high-qualityprovision for people with learning disabilities, while othersmay provide very little. It is recommended that all learningand skills councils should accredit courses in nutrition andhealth and basic cookery for all people with learningdisabilities, and make training accessible for family, carersand other supporters where appropriate. Special coursesshould be made available for people with learningdisabilities from ethnic minorities, who are likely to beunder-represented in post-school education. Coursesshould also be made available for those people withlearning disabilities who are parents (or who wish to or arelikely to become parents), to help them understand theimportance of good nutrition in the development of theirchildren and to provide healthy food choices for them. There are a number of activities that may enhance thefood experience for people with learning disabilities anddetails of a number of games and other activities are givenon page 153. Growing clubs and therapeutic horticulture Gardening is an activity that many people enjoy at homeand which can encourage people to spend more timeoutdoors being active. Social and therapeutic horticulture has been defined as theprocess by which individuals may develop wellbeingthrough actively being involved in growing plants. This hasbeen used as therapy and for rehabilitation among peoplewith a range of disabilities. There is evidence that this canbe a useful and effective form of health and social careprovision for people with learning disabilities 7and that people benefit from a break in their usual routines andfrom being outside. Benefits are reported in socialnetworks, education and training, relaxation andrestoration, and self-confidence and self-esteem. Manyservice users also enjoy consuming the food grown and thiscan contribute to better health.

Helping people make good choices A variety of foods and drinks should be made available to everyone and support staff should be trained and supported to help people with learning disabilities make informed choices. Where there are communicationdifficulties around food and drink choices and eating, support staff should be encouraged to develop skillsin interpreting people's wishes. Courses on nutrition and health and on basic cookery for people with learning disabilities, and for their friends and family, should be made available. Special courses for those people with learning disabilities whoare parents should also be made available. Organisational culture In all settings it is essential that there is a commitment to good nutrition and an awareness of the wider role of food and drink in contributing to wellbeing and quality of life. Managers and staff at all levels needto demonstrate their commitment to good nutrition by ensuring everyone receives adequate training andsupport. Efforts should be made to find out about the food preferences and eating patterns of people with learning disabilities - including those who move into new or residential settings, regardless of how long they willstay there. This information should be recorded, shared with all support staff, and regularly updated. People with learning disabilities should be encouraged to include information about food and nutritional health in their health action plan which is compiled to explain their health needs, and in all care plans. Staff training and support The importance of staff training cannot be over-emphasised. In order that children, young people and adults with learning disabilities are supported to eat and drink well, it is essential that everyone involved insupporting them has a clear idea about what eating well means in practice and that appropriate training ison-going for all staff, regardless of whether they are permanent, temporary, employed through an agencyor involved in a voluntary capacity. It is important that anyone who supports those who need assistance with eating is trained to help in a sensitive and efficient way. Helping someone with eating difficulties to eat can be complex and stressfuland it is essential that staff are given sufficient support from colleagues when this is challenging. Involving and listening to family and friends A real partnership between families, friends and support staff is essential so that everyone works together to ensure that each individual eats and drinks in a way that they prefer and which is appropriate, safe andhealth-promoting. In residential and day care settings it is important that adequate notice of, and thereasons for, changes to meals and snacks are given to everyone so that people can comment on anddiscuss the changes before they are introduced.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 104105 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesChapter 9 Monitoringnutritional statusand dealing witheating difficulties This chapter looks at ways of monitoring thenutritional status of people with learningdisabilities. It also looks at how to helppeople maintain independence in eating, andstrategies for dealing with common eatingdifficulties such as extreme faddy or selectiveeating, food refusal, and difficult eatingbehaviours. Monitoring nutritional status Knowing whether someone is eating inappropriately requiressome measure of their nutritional status and this is mostfrequently done by monitoring a person's weight change overtime and recording any changes in food and drinkconsumption. It is not easy to spot malnutrition and often longperiods of insufficient food intake or inappropriate food intakewill manifest itself very late as a sudden illness such aspneumonia or a fracture. Being alert to changing food patternsis essential if poor eating and drinking are to be recognisedbefore malnutrition impacts on health and wellbeing. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 105106 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesThere are a number of tools that health professionalscommonly use to screen the nutritional status of peopleboth in a range of community settings and in hospital.Details of some of these are given on page 154 inAppendix 4. While these have an important place inmanaging assessment of nutritional status in someresidential settings, it is often necessary for staff to havetraining to use them effectively. It is therefore essential thatall support staff are able to make simple assessments thatmight alert them to changes in the nutritional status ofthose they care for. A simple nutrition checklist can be useful in helpingsupport staff to recognise nutrition-related problemsamong people living in the community and an example ofa simple checklist is shown in Appendix 3.If there is concern that someone is not eating well, ask theperson's GP for a referral to a registered dietitian, or consultwith the community learning disability team. Maintaining independence ineating It is generally agreed that help with eating, whilesometimes essential, can lead to a loss of self-esteem and asense of powerlessness and dependency. 1Those who are able to eat independently, even if this is by hand only,should be encouraged to do so to maximise independenceand dignity. If independent eating skills are notencouraged, there may be a rapid decline to dependence. 2 The use of finger foods can help people to maintain andrecover eating skills and has the advantage of boosting self-esteem and independence as well as allowing people to eatat their own pace. 1(For more on finger foods, see page 132.) Practical aids to eating anddrinking There are a number of helpful aids to eating that somepeople with learning disabilities may find useful for feedingthemselves, or which family, friends and support staff canuse to help people to eat and drink more effectively.Occupational therapists can advise on suitable aids whichmight include the following. Different shaped cups, with one or two handles, of different weights, materials, transparencies and designs.Cups should not shatter or break if they are bitten. A transparent cup can be helpful when helping someone to drink so the carer can see how much liquid is taken. Cutlery of differing shapes, sizes, depths and materials. Cutlery should not shatter if it is bitten. Solid plastic cutleryor plastic-coated metal might be better for people whohave a bite reflex when cutlery is placed in their mouth.Shorter-handled cutlery is easier to manage and handgripsor irregularly shaped handles may help someone in using a utensil. Plates and bowls which do not slip, have higher sides to prevent spillage, or which are angled to make access tofood easier. Insulated crockery which keeps food hot if mealtimes are lengthy. Non-slip mats which support crockery. Straws which can help those with a weaker suck or which have different widths. Automated eating systems such as Neater Eater which allow people to feed themselves even when movement isvery limited. For details of sources of specialist eating and drinkingequipment, see page 156. Helping people to eat Staff involvement and commitment to successful mealtimesare critically important factors in ensuring that people withlearning disabilities eat well.While it is essential that those who can fully or partly eatindependently are encouraged and enabled to do so, thosewho need help with eating must be treated sensitively. TheSimple warning signs of changes in nutritional status These include: unexpected weight loss or weight gain (as discussed in chapter 5) changes in eating habits, or drinking or eating more or less than usual food or drinks left over at mealtimes and from between-meal snacks loss of independence in eating difficulties with swallowing observed fatigue, apathy, or disinterest in activities pale skin, thin or sparse hair, spoon-shaped nails, or cracks around the mouth.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 106107 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesperspective of helping people to eat rather than 'feeding'them is essential. Mealtimes should be seen as atherapeutic time for activity involving physical, sensory,emotional and social stimulation. Speech and languagetherapists can recognise and help with eating difficulties(see page 102). Verbal prompting during eating to 'Openyour mouth,' 'Chew,' or 'Swallow' has been suggested asparticularly helpful. 3If direct verbal prompting fails to work, touching food against the person's lips gives a non-verbalcue to open the lips. If someone cannot initiate voluntarymovement, it is better to give indirect encouragement toeat, for example saying 'This meal looks tasty.' Someguidelines for helping a person to eat are given below. It isalso essential for staff to be trained in helping people toeat and to do this in a sensitive and efficient way. Thetraining might include experiencing what it is like to behelped to eat.Other practical suggestions include ensuring that peoplehave an empty bladder before they start eating, and thattheir glasses or dentures are accessible and well-fitting.Suggestions for dealing with particular problems andbehaviour associated with eating are given on page 108.Positioning when people needhelp with eating and drinking The importance of good positioning for eating and drinkingcannot be over-emphasised for many people with learningdisabilities. Family carers may be experienced in achievingthe best position. The normal position for eating is in theupright position. No two people are the same and so theposition best suited to an individual will vary, but it is usefulfor everyone to be aware of some of the basic principleswhen preparing to help someone to eat well. It is difficult to balance and eat and drink at the same time,so whatever positions are used for mealtimes, the advice ofa physiotherapist or occupational therapist can be veryhelpful to ensure that the best and safest positions can befound for each person. The general suggestions givenbelow are designed to open up discussion and make allthose who help with eating and drinking reflect on theircurrent practice and pool ideas for discussion. Eating anddrinking can be hazardous and it is important that anychanges in position or support are reviewed in the light ofhow someone can be helped if they cough or choke. Aim for symmetry and alignment of the body when someone is sitting or standing ready to eat - with thehead upright, the back of the neck elongated and thechin tucked slightly in. Usually, both the person eating and the person helping them should be sitting at the same height so that theycan have face-to-face contact to help communicationduring meals. In some cases people with a visualimpairment might prefer someone to sit next to themand maintain contact side-by-side, but eye contact isgenerally preferred. An extended head, neck and body position makes eating and drinking uncomfortable and potentially dangerous,as the person may be more likely to cough and choke. Soavoid sitting so that the person has to look up. For some people, eating standing up may be preferable. Standing with the help of a frame or prone stander mayhelp with stability. Standing can also ease the descent offluid and food to the stomach and may help to preventgastro-oesophageal reflux. Ensure that people are well supported so that they don't push against tables or hyperextend their limbs to makethemselves feel safer. Headrests and neck supports can be very important for ensuring the head stays upright and the neck stayselongated. Regular review of the position that best suits each person at mealtimes is essential. Guidelines for helping a person to eat The same carer should stay with the person throughout the meal. If the person uses glasses, dentures and/or a hearing aid, make sure these are in place. Make sure the person is sitting in an upright position. The carer should sit at eye level, and either immediately in front of or slightly to one side ofthe person who needs help. Give small mouthfuls but enough for the person to feel the food in his or her mouth. Give adequate time for the person to swallow each mouthful before continuing. Assist but never force. Maintain eye contact with the person who needs help. Do not talk to someone else whileoffering food. Use verbal prompts: talk clearly about the food you are offering (especially if it is pur\u00e9ed), anduse a gentle but firm tone. Discourage the person from distractions (such as talking or laughing with food in their mouth)because of the risk of choking.

Some people may find it easier to stand up orremain standing for a short time after the meal. Forsome people, a period of 30 minutes sitting after a mealmay be recommended. If someone needs help with eating, it is also important that the physical needs of the helper are taken intoconsideration so that they are comfortable and can focusall their attention on the job in hand. Support staff mayalso need cushions to ensure that they are in acomfortable position and do not get neck or back painwhen helping someone to eat. Strategies to deal with eatingand drinking difficulties This section makes some suggestions about how to handleeating and drinking difficulties for people with learningdisabilities. However, it is important to remember thateveryone is an individual and all those who support aperson with learning disabilities should work together tofind strategies that best suit each person. Extreme faddy or selective eating Some people with learning disabilities may be selectiveeaters or have phases of only being willing to choose froma small selection of foods and drinks. This is oftenassociated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). ASDchildren may display strong preferences for foods of aparticular colour, smell, texture, taste or temperature. Theymay also accept only processed foods with familiarpackaging. They may find it difficult to try new foods andmay be distressed in some mealtime environments,resulting in food refusal. They may also accept only foodspresented on a plate in a particular sequence. 6 Food refusal People may refuse food for a number of reasons, andmanaging food refusal can be difficult and distressing forthose who support them. There can be a number ofreasons why people might refuse food and it is importantthat all avenues are investigated to find out why this mightbe the case and that the person is given every opportunityto communicate their feelings and choices around foodand drink. There may be a physical problem such as a sore mouth, painful teeth or gums, or thrush which may requireinvestigation and treatment. Food may be refused because there is an underlying swallowing difficulty (see page 28). Medication may make a person feel nauseous. See the next page for strategies to handle nausea. Medication may have other side effects which impact on eating and drinking. A drugs review may therefore beuseful. Constipation may make a person feel nauseous. Food may be refused because it isn't liked. Make sure that people's food preferences are recorded andconsidered, and that where possible a whole variety offoods of different tastes, textures and temperatures areoffered. People who refuse food may take it from a specific family member, friend or member of the support staff theyknow well. Paranoia can mean people are fearful of food and may think, for example, that it has been poisoned. Paranoiacan also be treated with talking therapy ifcommunication allows, or with medication.Strategies which may help withselective eating Make mealtimes predictable by having a structured eating routine. At the start of each week, prepare 'visual timetables' using picture symbols, photos orwords as appropriate, detailing when andwhere people will eat, what they will eat andthe behaviour expected at mealtimes. Ensure there are no underlying health problems that might make eating some foodsuncomfortable. For example, mouth ulcers mayput people off fruit and fruit juice, orswallowing difficulties might make peoplefearful of food which they previously founddifficult to chew or swallow. Try to identify the specific anxieties for each person and devise a step-by-step programmefor overcoming them, including creating a calm,comfortable eating environment. Use games and stories to talk about new foods, and keep a visual list of foods liked and foodsthey might try. Adapted from Diet and autistic spectrum disorder: Food Fact Sheet from the British Dietetic Association 629552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 108109 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficulties Depression can cause loss of appetite. Depression can be treated with medication or with talking therapies ifcommunication allows. A person at the end stage of life may refuse to open their mouth and accept any food and drink, but it is stillimportant to offer food and drink regularly regardless ofthe outcome at previous eating occasions. Decisions onhow to manage food and drink at the end stage of lifeshould involve doctors, family, friends, support staff andany advocates, including Independent Mental CapacityAdvocates. Holding hands with a person, giving reassuring touches and singing softly have been found to help overcomeresistance to eating among older people with dementia. 7 People who are losing weight and refusing food maybenefit from nutrition support for a period of time whilethe reasons for food refusal are examined and treated (seepage 62). Nausea and vomiting If someone is feeling nauseous or vomiting, it is importantto investigate the cause of this. In some cases nausea maybe a response to essential medication and some simplestrategies may help to alleviate this. Support staff may findsome of the suggestions below helpful, but should ensurethat the needs of each individual are carefully considered. Fresh air before a meal, and a well ventilated room, may help. Make sure people are sitting upright for meals and rest after eating. Aim for five or more smaller meals a day so that people are not 'overfaced' with large portions. Small portions ofattractive food may be more tempting. Avoid foods with a strong odour and keep cooking smells to a minimum if these cause nausea. Dry, savoury foods - such as toast, crackers, rice cakes, bread sticks or plain popcorn - may be tolerated. Somepeople find dry biscuits or toast helpful to relieve nauseaon waking. Cold foods may be easier to tolerate than hot ones: for example, thick and creamy yoghurt, jelly, ice cream oregg custard. Cold drinks drunk through a straw may cause less nausea. Ginger is well known to alleviate nausea: ginger cordials, ginger ale or ginger beer, ginger biscuits or stem/crystallised ginger might be helpful. Peppermint tea mayalso alleviate symptoms.Mouth sensitivity Hypersensitive oral reactions are exaggerated responses totouch in the mouth or around the face. 8An individual may be hypersensitive for several reasons. Neurologicalimpairment may cause an individual to over-respond tosensory information, limited motor capabilities which inhibitsomeone from touching their own face may mean the arearemains sensitive to touch, and being fed via a gastrostomytube may limit someone's exposure to oral stimulation.There is also some evidence that a lack of feedingexperiences during critical periods of weaning in the firstyear of life can lead to oral hypersensitivity. 9 Children or adults with hypersensitive oral reactions maynot let you into their mouth for feeding or toothbrushing.Or they may have problems moving from one food textureto the next, spitting out or gagging on any food but pur\u00e9e.They may gag when a spoon touches the tip of theirtongue and may gag on a tiny lump of food instead ofswallowing it.Some people become so sensitive and emotional that theirreactions become aversion reactions. They may cry, fuss,pull away, push food away, or refuse even to let you neartheir mouths. Gagging may turn into vomiting in anaversive reaction. Fears can develop around feeding or anytouch around the mouth and people may try to control allaspects of a meal in an effort to protect themselves fromuncomfortable situations. For example, they may want onlycertain food textures, certain spoons, certain plates orcertain cups. An excessive reaction to stimulation maytrigger a bite reflex, clamping down in the biting position. What can help? It is important that you work with a speech and languagetherapist and occupational therapist to handle mouthsensitivity. Ensure the person is sitting in a stable, upright position. (For more on positioning, see page 107.) Ensure mealtimes are calm and relaxed, play calming music and reduce other sensory information. Eating involves many different types of touch: the spoon, fork, and cup touch the lips as they bring food to themouth. Try gradually keeping the spoon or cup at the lipslonger each time you help someone to eat, usingfavourite foods for this activity. Providing cues that the spoon is coming may help. Ringing a bell attached to the spoon, stating verbally\"Here comes the food\", or placing the food on a brightlycoloured spoon may provide a cue that the mouth isabout to be touched and reduce unwanted reflexes. Food temperature can often cause overreactions.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 109110 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesRemember that room-temperature foods tend to beeasier to handle. Make temperature changes very slowlyand with foods that are liked. Plastic-coated spoons may be needed if people bite or are hypersensitive to temperature. If people over-react by gagging when you try to switch from strained foods to thicker, more textured or lumpyfoods, you probably need to make the transition moreslowly. Toothbrushing with a regular or electric toothbrush can help, but should only be done with guidance from aspeech and language therapist or occupational therapist. Wipe the face regularly with warm cloths or soft sponges, using deep pressure. This can be calming. Drooling or dribbling The ability to swallow saliva is normally learnt automaticallyand most adults swallow the 1 to 1.5 litres of salivaproduced a day on 1,000 to 2,000 swallows. 10Saliva control depends largely on trunk stability and head control, beingaware of the need to swallow, and factors such aspositioning, fatigue and drugs taken. Dribbling can be acommon problem among people with learning disabilitiesand can lead to sore mouth, dry mouth, eating difficulty,gum or dental problems and dehydration, as well as beingembarrassing. Drooling or dribbling can also be linked toswallowing difficulties (see page 28). Individuals who droolmay need higher fluid intakes. What can help? Good positioning - being well supported and upright with an elongated back of the neck - will help with jawstability. Gently dry the mouth with a small piece of absorbent cloth, explaining what is happening and using small dabsso as not to over-stimulate the mouth. Special clothing or the creative use of scarves which can be frequently replaced may help with embarrassment. Behaviour modification or the development of oral control may be possible among some people.10 Some drugs can be used but these may have side effects such as drying the eyes as well as the saliva, andincreasing thirst. Travel bands designed to alleviate nausea associated with travel sickness have been anecdotally suggested as usefulfor some people with mild dribbling. Bruxism (teeth grinding) Teeth grinding might be related to oral pain or discomfort,or to anxiety, medication or communication difficulties,and dentists should work with family, friends and supportstaff to look at potential causes of bruxism. Bite guardsmay be helpful but should only be used after carefuldiscussion with dentists. Other problem behaviours around foodand drink Some people with learning disabilities may exhibit anumber of other eating behaviours which support staffmay find very distressing to deal with. It is frequentlyreported anecdotally that people with learning disabilitiesmay use behaviour around food to communicate theirdistress - for example, if they have changed carer or placeof residence, or if habits and patterns they are used to aredisrupted. It is essential that routines around food and drinkand mealtimes are respected, that as much information aspossible is gathered from family carers about preferencesand habits, and that care is taken to interpret signs andsignals from the individual about their choices around food.Taking the time and trouble to understand the causes ofpeople's behaviour and address any underlying issues mayprevent considerable distress.The observed behaviours on the next two pages, and thesuggestions for dealing with them, may be useful in dealingwith problem behaviour around food for people withlearning disabilities including those with dementia. Withmore extreme eating difficulties, help should be soughtfrom a GP to exclude any underlying physical ill health, orfrom psychologists and other team professionals withinlearning disability services as well as psychiatrists.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 110111 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesObserved behaviour Style of eating and pattern of intake Incorrectly uses spoon, fork or knifeIncorrectly uses cup or glassUnable to cut meatDifficulty getting food onto utensilsPlate wanders on the tableEats desserts or sweets firstEats too fastSlow eating and prolonged other people's foodEats non-food items Mixes food togetherDrinks excessivelySuggestions for dealing with the behaviour Try verbal cues and show correct use.The person may benefit from additional aids or devices.Consult with occupational therapist.Try verbal cues and show correct use.Offer a cup with handles, or a straw.Provide cut meats, soft meats or finger food.A plate guard or lipped plate may help.Finger foods may take the pressure off cutlery use.Use a no-skid placemat or suction plate.Serve meal components one at a time and keep desserts or sweets out ofsight until the main course is finished.Offer food in small portions. Provide verbal cues to slow down, and model slower eating. Reassure the person that there is plenty of food available and it will notrun out.Serve small portions at a time so the food stays warm, and offer secondhelpings.

Serve smaller portions.Make sure the room is calm and quiet, that the person has everythingneeded for the meal (eg. has been to the toilet, has their glasses, denturesor hearing aid if needed, and is sitting comfortably). Other people modelling eating may help.Use verbal or manual cues to eat: place food or utensils into the person'shands. Model eating and offer encouragement.Make sure that people are not alerted to meals too early, that they areoffered something to eat if they have to wait for a meal to arrive, or thatmeals are served in small courses to minimise waiting times.Make sure that the person is not depressed. Provide meal tickets or vouchers.Make sure that mealtimes are calm and try and encourage people to eattogether. If wandering persists and food intake is compromised, encourage theperson to use finger food while wandering.If there is a time of day when the person will sit for longer periods (forexample, first thing in the morning), ensure a good variety of foods is onoffer.Provide foods that are easier to chew. Check dental health.Liaise with speech and language therapist. Use verbal cues to chew and swallow.Use verbal cues to chew. Pur\u00e9e and thicken food if choking is a hazard.Use a verbal cue to chew. Massage the cheek gently. Offer small amounts of different foods and flavours.Use a plastic-coated spoon.Check that the food is liked, that the temperature is appropriate, and thatthe food is of an appropriate texture. Use a verbal cue to open the mouth. Touch the lips with a spoon. Use straws for drinks. Observed behaviour Suggestions for dealing with the behaviour Consult with a speech and language therapist about these problems. For more detailed information on handling swallowing difficulties, see page 74.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 112113 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesIdentifying distress among people withmoderate to severe communicationdifficulties Difficulties with eating and drinking can cause distress -either because of the eating and drinking difficulty itself, orbecause of the effects of lack of nutrition or hydration.People with a learning disability who have difficultycommunicating can find it hard to make clear the cause oftheir distress, or may not even be able to make it clear thatthey are distressed. This is a major barrier to identifying theproblem and convincing healthcare professionals that aproblem exists. For those who have communicationdifficulties, pain and discomfort may be expressed by arange of changes 11such as: eating less sleeping less or more whimpering, crying or screaming appearing irritable, unhappy or withdrawn, or seeking comfort grimacing, cringing, frowning, clenching or grinding teeth, or thrusting the tongue being less active or more agitated having floppy or tense limbs, gesturing to or protecting the part of the body that hurts shivering, changing colour or sweating. In the late 1990s a combined learning disability andpalliative care team at Northgate Hospital inNorthumberland began to explore the issue of identifyingdistress in people with severe communication difficulties.They made three observations: Family, friends and support staff were skilful at identifying distress, but had little confidence in that skill. This lack of certainty in what support staff were observing made it difficult for them to advocate for theperson with the communication difficulty when facedwith a challenge to their observation. A number of pain score tools existed for people with cognitive impairment, even though there was noresearch evidence that pain produced any specific signsor behaviours. This resulted in the development of DisDAT (DisabilityDistress Assessment Tool). 12, 13DisDAT is intended to help identify distress cues in people who have severely limitedcommunication because of cognitive impairment orphysical illness. It documents the 'cues' people give whenthey are contented and compares these with the person'sdistress cues, thus enabling distress cues to be identifiedmore clearly. It includes a checklist to help identify thecause of the distress. The DisDAT tool is not a scoring tool;it simply documents what many staff have doneinstinctively for many years, providing a record againstwhich subtle changes can be compared. The tool can beused by family, friends and support staff and increases theirconfidence in the observational skills they already have. Itprovides a clearer picture of a person's 'language' ofdistress, but is still only one step in the process ofidentifying the distress. The DisDAT tool is available freeonline, from www.DisDAT.co.uk. 14, 1529552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 113114 Chapter 9 Monitoring nutritional status and dealing with eating difficultiesMonitoring nutritional status All support staff should be able to make simple nutritional assessments that might alert them to changes in the nutritional status of those they care for. Maintaining independence in eating, and helping people to eat Those who are able to eat independently, even if this is by hand only, should be encouraged to do so to maximise independence and dignity. If independent eating skills are not encouraged, there may be a rapiddecline to dependence. Where people need help with eating, it is essential for staff to be trained in helping them to eat and to do this in a sensitive and efficient way.

Nutrient-based standards specify the amounts of nutrients thatshould be provided to a group of people over a period of timeto ensure that the nutritional needs of the majority of people inthat group are met. They are based on the Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the UK1and guidance from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) onsalt intakes. 2Nutrient-based standards provide a numerical but flexible framework around which caterers can plan their menus.The food-based guidance on pages 120-125 makes suggestionsabout the sorts of foods that people are advised to choose toensure that nutritional needs are met. Nutrient-based standardstake this a step further by asking people to account moreclosely for the nutritional quality of foods served and theingredients in recipes, to ensure that food of the right quality29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 115116 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceand quantity is available. Adopting nutrient-basedstandards sends a clear message that policy makers takethe promotion of good nutrition seriously and are willing toinvest in supporting people to eat better. Nutrient-based standards The nutrient-based standards for food and drink forchildren, young people and adults shown on the next pageshould become minimum standards for all residential, daycare and other settings where children, young people oradults with learning disabilities are provided with food anddrink.Government departments should make reference to thenutrient-based standards and practical guidelines in thisreport in all guidance and legislation affecting residential,day care and domiciliary support for children, young peopleand adults with learning disabilities.All those responsible for legislative change to nationalminimum care standards for residential, day care anddomiciliary care should include standards which will ensurechildren, young people and adults are supported in allsettings by staff and managers who are competent inenabling service users to eat well.The information and advice in this chapter is particularlyaimed at those catering for groups of people in caresettings since nutrient-based standards relate to groups ofpeople rather than individuals. However, in chapter 11 wegive some examples of eating plans that would meet thenutrient-based standards. These will be useful for all thosewho support people with learning disabilities to make foodchoices (those who provide food either for groups or forindividuals), as they give an idea of the types and amountsof foods that can provide all the nutrients needed. The nutrient-based standards in Table 2 on the next pagegive figures for the recommended nutrient content - offibre, protein and some important vitamins and minerals -of an average day's food and drink that should be providedover a period of a week or more. The amounts of energy,fat and carbohydrate for each age group have not beenspecified here since there are likely to be significantdifferences among individuals with learning disabilities inthe amount of energy (and therefore fat and carbohydrate)they need each day, as explained on page 118.The nutrient-based standards given in Table 2 show theamounts of nutrients that are recommended for groups ofpeople to ensure that the majority of members of thegroup have sufficient for their needs. The figures give anaverage for a whole day - but typically we calculateaverage daily intakes over a period of at least a week ratherthan on a daily basis, as some foods which might be verynutrient-dense may not be eaten every day. Main meals Adults For adults aged 19 and above, nutrient-based standards aregiven both for 'all day' and 'main meal'. Where main mealsare served, it is suggested that this main meal shouldprovide 35% of the minimum nutrient-based standards.Meals are likely to provide a greater proportion ofmicronutrients than snacks and for this reason it wouldseem prudent to ensure that main meals provide a slightlyhigher proportion of micronutrients than they mightprovide of energy (on the assumption that most mealsprovide about 30% of daily energy intakes). The exceptionto this is for sodium and salt where meals should provideno more than about 30% of the total daily intake. Children and young people Information on nutrient-based standards at mealtimes forchildren aged under 5 can be found in the CWT report Eating Well for Under-5s in Child Care . Children of school age who eat a main meal at school are covered by therelevant school meal guidance in their area (see page 89). Iron For adults, an average iron intake of 12mg a day has beensuggested as the nutrient-based standard. This is likely tomeet the needs of all men, all women over the age of 50years or who do not menstruate, and more than half ofwomen aged 19-50 years. The average iron intake ofwomen in the UK is about 10mg a day from food sources(or 11.6mg a day if supplements are included). 3 Approximately 8% of women are found to have lowhaemoglobin levels (indicating anaemia) and about 11%have low serum ferritin values (indicating that they may beat risk of iron deficiency). 4There is little information available on the iron status of women with learningdisabilities, but for all women lower intakes and lower ironstatus are more frequently reported among youngerwomen. For those women who have higher iron needs(either because they have heavy menstrual losses orbecause they have been found to have low haemoglobin orserum ferritin levels), good sources of iron should beincluded in the diet regularly (see page 44) and, if ironstatus is found to be low, iron supplementation should beconsidered after consultation with a medical practitioner.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 Page 116117 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceZinc Men have a higher requirement for zinc than women, butzinc is an important nutrient that is frequently low in thediets of adults in the UK. Recent data suggests that 43% ofmen and 45% of women fail to achieve the referencenutrient intake (RNI) for zinc. 1(An explanation of RNI is given on the right.) It is therefore likely that many adultswith learning disabilities may also have zinc intakes belowthe RNI. Zinc is important for a wide range of enzymesinvolved in body processes and is particularly important forthe immune system and for wound healing. It is thereforevery important that menus provide adequate amounts ofzinc to meet the needs of those with the greatest needs inthe group. For this reason the RNI for zinc for men (9.5mgper day) is suggested as the nutrient-based standard forgroups of people with a learning disability.

Standards for an average main meal for adultsaged 19+ are also provided. A discussion about intakes of energy, carbohydrate and fat can be found on page 118. Someexamples of how these standards can be achieved are shown on pages 129-131. All children aged 1-4 years should receive a daily vitamin supplement containing vitamins A, C and D (see www.healthystart.nhs.uk). For information on vitamin D supplements, see page 47. For information on folic acid supplements for women who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant, and on vitamin D supplements forpregnant women, see www.healthystart.nhs.uk and page 54.Dietary reference values (DRVs)Dietary reference values are quantified nutritionalguidelines for energy and nutrients. They apply togroups of people; they are not intended forassessing individual diets. Reference nutrient intake (RNI)The reference nutrient intake is the amount of anutrient that is likely to meet the requirements ofnearly everybody in a group. Reference nutrientintakes have been set for protein and for mostvitamins and minerals.Estimated average requirement (EAR)The amount which satisfies 50% of people in agroup.

Adults who arephysically small, and those who are very inactive, will havelower energy needs. (Inactivity is common among peoplewith learning disabilities and this may be due to immobilityof adults with specific physical challenges or due to lack ofsupport for, or disinclination to, exercise. 5) Adults who are larger, and those who walk, pace or shake constantly arelikely to have greater energy needs.The range of energy needs for people with learningdisabilities will therefore vary widely and it is important thateveryone is aware of the types of foods and amounts offoods that are needed by people who are more or lessactive or have greater or lesser needs. Even when energyintakes are lower, the amounts of most micronutrients(vitamins and minerals) required remain the same, and so itis important that caterers are aware that low-energy dietsneed to be nutrient-dense (that is, they need to be high invitamins and minerals). kcals MJ ggggDietary reference value (DRV) EAR No more than 35% of energy No more than 11% of energy At least 50% of energy No more than 11% of energyMAXMAX MIN Table 3 Examples of energy intakes which may be appropriate for population groups with differing energy needs * Some people who are inactive and have very small appetites may need to have a diet which provides a greater proportion ofenergy from fat and sugar in order to prevent weight loss. Thesefigures are for those who do not have special dietary needs.These figures are examples only, to demonstrate the ranges of energy intake that may exist, and are not intended asrecommendations or standards. See Energy above for an explanation of how these figures have been calculated.Sodium (salt) The nutrient-based standards for salt given in Table 2 arebased on current recommendations that the adultpopulation should have no more than 6g of salt per day.This may be difficult to achieve for those with higherenergy needs, since foods such as bread which might beeaten in higher quantities are often high in salt. For thepopulation as a whole, salt reduction will be aided by thegradual reduction of the sodium content of manufacturedfoods and everyone should be encouraged to chooselower-salt foods where possible and to adapt recipes toreduce the amount of salt used. While 6g has been set asthe nutrient-based standard, some flexibility might berequired in menu planning, and caterers should lookholistically at the foods served and the ingredients usedrather than making artificial or unpalatable changes solelyto achieve a 'standard'. DRV = Dietary reference valueEAR = Estimated average requirementSee page 117 for an explanation of DRV and EAR.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 118119 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based and guidanceEstimated energy requirements for adult populations havebeen suggested 6and a range of figures can be estimated for those who are inactive, those who are moderatelyactive and those who have greater energy needs, forexample because they are very active. These differencesare based on variations in the physical activity levels (PAL)for different population groups. The PAL is multiplied by theestimated BMR to give a daily calorie intake but will varydepending on a person's weight, age and gender. To givesome idea of the energy requirements that might beestimated for different population groups, some exampleshave been outlined in Table 3 based on the following: For groups of inactive people of low body weight (for example, someone who is chairbound and of smallstature), PAL has been taken as 1.1 and average bodyweight as 50kg. For groups of people who are moderately active for at least 30 minutes a day and need to maintain theirweight, PAL has been taken as 1.4. Those who need to reduce their body weight are likely to require approximately 800kcals less than the averageenergy requirement (based on an average 1.4 PAL) toreduce body weight by about 1kg per week. For very active groups of people who have higher energy needs (for example, people who are very active,or who pace or shake constantly), PAL has been taken as1.8. It is important to remember that individuals may haveenergy needs that are significantly lower or higher thanthese and anyone who is underweight or overweight orwho has eating difficulties needs individual dietary advice.The figures in Table 3 are examples only, to demonstratethe ranges of energy intake that may exist, and are notintended as recommendations or standards. The figures in Table 3 are based on a population where50% of people are aged 19-29 years and 50% are aged 30-59 years, but these figures are applicable to adults of allages unless they have special dietary needs. For those whomay have very low or very high energy needs, differencesare shown by gender, but for populations of moderatelyactive people and those who may need to reduce weight,average values have been given for mixed genderpopulations.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 guidanceSource: www.eatwell.gov/healthy diet7 For more information about nutritional information on food labelssee www.eatwell.gov.ukFoods high in fat have more than 20g of fat per100g of food Foods high in saturated fathave more than 5g of saturated fat per 100gof foodFoods high in sugar have more than 15g of sugarsper 100g of foodFoods high in salt have of saltper of foodormore than 0.6g (600mg)of sodium per 100g offood Foods low in fat have 3g of fat or less per 100gof foodFoods low in saturated fat have 1.5g of saturated fat or less per100g of foodFoods low in sugar have 5g of sugars or less per100g of foodFoods low in salt have 0.3g of salt or less per100g of foodor0.1g (100mg) of sodiumor less per 100g of food Food-based guidance This section, including the tables on pages 121-125,contains some information about the five food groups andhow to choose foods which will contribute to a healthybalanced diet.It is also useful to look at the nutrition information labelsand ingredients lists on foods, and to choose those that arelower in salt, sugar and fat.The Food Standards Agency provides information on whatis 'a lot' of and 'a little' salt, sugar foods. This isoutlined below. 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 120121 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceFood group Guidance Rationale What's included Bread, other cereals andpotatoesStarchy foods should makeup a third of the daily diet.A variety of breads shouldbe available daily at everymeal.Different starchy foodsshould be offered in mainmeals throughout theweek so that a variety ofstarchy foods are included.Aim to include pasta andrice on the menu once aweek.Wholegrain and wholemealcereal foods are a goodsource of fibre and othernutrients.Starchy foods are a goodsource of energy and themain source of a range ofnutrients in the diet. Aswell as starch, these foodssupply fibre, Tips Serve more pasta and rice and use less sauce. Opt for tomato-based sauces instead of cheese-based sauces. When serving rice and pasta, try to use wholemeal, wholegrain, brown or high-fibre versions. Some breakfast cereals are nutrient-fortified (that is, with added iron, folic acid and other vitamins and minerals). Choose wholegrain cereals or mix some in with other cereals. Offer a variety of breads, such as seeded, wholegrain and granary, and use thicker slices with low-fat options for fillings. If you are making chips or fried potatoes, use large pieces of potato and thick or straight-cut chips as these absorb less fat. Baked potatoes do not need to have butter or margarine added when served with moist fillings or sauces. For people who avoid gluten in wheat, oats, barley and rye, good alternatives to offer are foods made from maize (eg. polenta), rice, rice flour, potatoes, potato flour, buckwheat, sago, tapioca, soya and soyaflour. Cereal foods which are good sources of iron and zinc include fortified cereals, wholegrain cereals, wholemeal bread and flour, couscous and wholemeal pasta.Table 4 Food-based guidance for food served to adults with learning disabilities, aged 19-74 years 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 121122 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceFood group Guidance Rationale What's included Fruit andvegetables Fruit and vegetablesshould make up about athird of the daily diet.It is important to offer avariety. 5 a day is anachievable target.Aim for 1 or 2 portionswith each meal and offerfruit and vegetables assnacks.One portion is about 80gof fresh fruit orvegetables.

Use fresh fruit and vegetables as soon as possible, rather than storing, to avoid vitamin loss. Incorporate fruit and vegetables in snack options. Offer a variety of healthy snack alternatives. Add vegetables and pulses to curries, casseroles or stir-fry dishes and serve at least two types of vegetables with fish, chicken or meat. Baked beans (as a vegetable) should be served a maximum of twice a week. Encourage a daily glass of fruit juice (100% juice, unsweetened) with meals. Add a handful of dried fruit to cereal options and porridge. Offer traditional salads as well as raw vegetables, to increase colour, taste and texture at mealtimes. Add extra vegetables to savoury dishes. Vegetable soups are a useful way of increasing vegetable intake. Avoid dried fruit that has added sugar or vegetable oil. Fruit and vegetables which are useful sources of iron include spinach, broccoli, spring greens, dried apricots, raisins, baked beans, broad beans andblackcurrants. Fruit and vegetables which are useful sources of folate include spinach, broccoli, peas, oranges, melon, green leafy salads and tomatoes. Fruit and vegetables which are useful non-dairy sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables, dried fruit and oranges.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 122123 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceFood group Guidance Rationale What's included Milk and dairyproductsOffer dairy foods such asmilk, yoghurt and cheeseas part semi-skimmed andskimmed milk rely on cheese asthe main protein item forvegetarians.

Some dairy products can contain high levels of salt. Look for lower-salt cheeses and use smaller amounts of stronger cheese. Offer semi-skimmed or skimmed milk and low-fat yoghurts and fromage frais. Use plain yoghurt and fromage frais instead of cream, soured cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in recipes. Try serving frozen yoghurts as an alternative to ice cream. For those on dairy-free diets, serve soya drinks fortified with calcium as an alternative. Restrict sweetened milk drinks to mealtimes as the sugars in these drinks can damage teeth.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 123124 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceFood group Guidance Rationale What's included Meat, fish and meat alternatives Offer a variety of meatand meat alternatives atmain meals.Use lean meat.

Fishproducts such as fish cakesand fish fingers may have alow fish content. Boiled, poached orscrambled eggs, oromelettesBeans and beans,textured vegetable protein,nuts, Quorn, and soyaproducts such as tofu Tips Always choose the leanest cuts of meat and remove visible fat and poultry skin. Roast meat on a rack in order to let the fat run off. Grill, poach or bake meat rather than frying. If you do fry, use clean oil and at the correct temperature to minimise absorption. Note that larger pieces of fish and meat absorb less fat. Do not add extra fat or oil when cooking meat. Use more vegetables, pulses and starchy food to extend dishes further, and to add more texture and flavour. Less meat is also required, reducing the fat content and the cost of the meal. Buy good-quality meat and use smaller amounts. Offer unsalted nuts and seeds as snacks. Reduce the amount of processed meat products served, such as meat pies and pasties, sausages, burgers and coated chicken products. Reduce the amount of processed fish products on offer, particularly those that are fried or coated such as fish fingers or fish cakes. * Liver and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 are very rich in vitamin A and it is recommended that these foods are consumed no more than once a week.

Tips Use fat spreads rich in monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. Use cooking oils high in monounsaturates such as soya, rapeseed or olive oils. Avoid serving pastry dishes frequently. Measure oil for cooking carefully and reduce the amount of oil used in the preparation of soups, stews and casseroles. Vegetables can often be dry-fried, steamed or stewed to form the basis of sauces and otherdishes. Use low-fat yoghurt or non-dairy ice cream to complement puddings or pies. Produce puddings lower in fat and sugar and incorporate fresh fruit, tinned fruit in juice or dried fruit. Offer water, unsweetened fruit juices and chilled milk drinks. Serve wholegrain or plain cereals rather than sugar-coated cereals. When preparing sandwiches, try and avoid using butter or spreads if the filling is already moist.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 125126 Chapter 10 Nutrient-based standards and food-based guidanceReferences 1 Department of Health (1991) Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom.

These fish contain between 5 and 14 micrograms ofvitamin D per 100g. Canned tuna fish can also make a significant contribution to vitamin D intake as it contains about 3.6 micrograms of vitamin D per 100g. Egg yolks are rich in vitamin D, and eggs contain about 2.0 micrograms of vitamin D per 100g. Meat and poultry contribute small but significant amounts of vitamin D.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 126127 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsChapter 11 Menu planningand special diets This chapter contains some example eatingplans which give an idea of the types andamounts of foods which meet the nutrient-based standards given in chapter 10. It alsoincludes information on finger foods, specialdiets such as textured and pur\u00e9ed diets, andon fortified foods and food supplements. The nutrient-based standards shown in chapter 10 provide aframework around which caterers and support staff can plansuitable menus for groups of children, young people and adultswith learning disabilities. It is also useful to have examples ofeating plans for those people with learning disabilities who liveindependently, to show the types of foods and amounts offoods that people typically need over a week. Meeting the nutrient-basedstandards To use nutrient-based standards effectively in group settingsrequires either the support of a registered dietitian or simpletools for use by those who plan menus or provide food forothers. The Caroline Walker Trust pioneered the developmentof computerised menu planning tools which allowed caterersand others to easily and quickly put together menus which29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 127128 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsmeet nutrient-based standards for groups of thepopulation from a detailed database of foods and drinks forwhich nutrient analysis had already been calculated.Suitable computer menu planning tools are available foruse in a number of settings and it would be helpful if a toolwere designed specifically to provide guidance for thosewho cater for groups of adults in residential care settings.Menu planning software can be purchased fromwww.nutmeg-uk.com.Menu planners should ensure that any menu analysissoftware they do use is based on nutrient values for cookedfoods and recipes, and that recipe analysis is provided by aregistered dietitian or registered public health nutritionist. The cost of a good diet There is no evidence that providing the raw materials for ahealthy diet costs any more than for a less healthy diet, butthe amount of time and resources spent cooking may wellbe greater. There is little clear information on the cost offood for people with learning disabilities in residential care,or on how much people may typically spend on their foodif they live independently. The average amount spent perperson per week on food and drink throughout the UK tobe consumed at home in 2005 was \u00a323.56 in 2005 (fromthe Expenditure and Food Survey 1) but costs obviously vary depending on the number of people per household. Theexample eating plans on pages 129-131 have been costedbased on current (2007) supermarket prices and it isestimated that a food budget of \u00a327-\u00a330 is likely to beneeded for an individual to achieve the minimum nutrient-based standards shown on page 117 and to follow thefood-based guidance on pages 120-125. Sustainability Concerns about the environmental impact of foodtravelling long distances, intensive farming and dwindlingstocks of some fish have prompted Government and manylocal authorities to encourage more sustainableprocurement policies for the buying of food. Responsibilityfor food purchasing will vary in different settings, but thosewho are responsible for buying food or helping others toshop are encouraged to buy food that is grown locally andthat is in season. Where possible, people should considerbuying fish with the Marine Stewardship Council logo,which ensures it is from a sustainable source. Food waste is another important issue as this wastes theresources used to grow and transport the food, and foodplaced in landfill sites will emit methane gas. If significantamounts of food are regularly wasted in a care setting thenan audit of what is wasted, and when, might be useful. Reducing the amount of food purchased pre-packed,recycling and composting food packaging and other wasteand growing your own fruit and vegetables where possiblecan all help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Example eating plans The eating plans for adults shown on pages 129-131 act asexamples of the sorts of foods and amounts of foods thatwill meet the nutrient-based standards. For simplicity andclarity these are presented as guides to how foods anddrinks might be consumed throughout the day rather thanas formal menu plans. In many circumstances a choice offoods at mealtimes is required and caterers need to ensurethat any menus they design meet minimum care standardsthat are applicable in their setting. These eating plans maynot be suitable for all individuals and many people willrequire individual advice or support on what a suitable dietmay be for them. We hope people will find the eating plans useful as aguide. Example menus and eating suggestions for childrenunder 5 years and for children and young adults can befound in the CWT reports Eating Well for Under-5s in Child Care, Eating Well for Looked After Children and Young People and Eating Well at School.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 128129 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsExample eating plans These eating plans are just examples of the sorts offoods and amounts of foods that would meet thenutrient-based standards for adults on page 117, andare presented here just to give an idea of some healthydaily menus. Weights in grams have been added to indicate portion sizes, as these may be used when planningmenus with computer software. In many circumstances achoice of foods at mealtimes is required.

Since spills are minimised, they make iteasier to make an accurate assessment of the amount offood eaten by an individual. It is also suggested that theuse of finger foods triggers people's attention andincreases their physical involvement and interaction withtheir meal, which may encourage them to eat more. 4One possible solution for people who are unable to sit stillduring meals is to provide them with a 'brown bag' meal -suitable finger foods in a waist pouch or bag - which theycan carry with them. 5Or, more practically, make sure that snacks are always available. Some examples of finger foodsare given in the box on the right. Finger foods should beeasy to hold while eating. Some foods such as breadedchicken or meat may be too dry for some people toswallow; small, moist finger foods may be mostappropriate. Avoid sugary finger foods unless they are partof a finger food meal.Particular care needs to be taken when planning fingerfood diets to ensure that all nutrients are included, andadvice should be taken if someone has special dietaryneeds. Finger foods are unlikely to be suitable for mostpeople who have swallowing difficulties.

Adapted from Ford, 1996 229552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 132133 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsChanging food and drinktextures The type and consistency of foods served are veryimportant to ensure food is both acceptable and safe.There are some nationally recognised descriptors fortexture modification of food for adults 6which are designed for use by dietitians and speech and language therapists.When texture modification is required, specialist adviceshould always be sought to ensure that the person'snutrient needs are met and the food is of the correcttexture, but some general information is included here onhow menus can be adapted. Fluid texture modification Some people will find it difficult to manage fluids and mayrequire that fluids are thickened. Thin fluids are those suchas water, tea or coffee or squash. There are some naturallythick fluids such as milkshakes and drinks such as Complanor Build-up. Where people with swallowing difficultiesrequire a thickened fluid, these are prepared with acommercial thickener (see box on the right) to one of threeconsistencies:Stage 1 Can be drunk through a straw or from a cup; leaves a thin coat on the back of a spoon.Stage 2 Cannot be drunk through a straw; can be drunk from a cup; leaves a thick coat on the back of a spoon.Stage 3 Cannot be taken through a straw or from a cup; needs to be given on a spoon. Food texture modification The way food is texture-modified will vary depending onthe swallowing difficulty. Descriptors have been designedto categorise food into five types of texture modification.Texture A A smooth, pouring, uniform consistency, the equivalent of tinned tomato soup or thin custard.Texture B A pur\u00e9ed or sieved food that drops rather than pours from a spoon, such as soft whipped cream or thickcustard.Texture C A smooth pur\u00e9ed food that can be eaten with a fork or spoon, such as mousse or smooth fromage frais.Texture D Moist food, mashed with a fork, served with a thick sauce, that requires little chewing, such as flaked fishin thick sauce or stewed apple and custard.Texture E Soft moist food that can be broken into pieces with a fork, but avoids foods that could be a chokinghazard.The requirements of individuals with swallowing difficultieswill be highly varied and specialist advice should always besought when a texture-modified diet is required. Moreinformation on menu planning for special diets can befound in the NACC publication Menu Planning and Special Diets in Care Homes (see page 156).High-risk foods to avoid if a texture-modified diet is required Stringy, fibrous textures such as pineapple, runner beans, celery or lettuce Vegetable and fruit skins including beans, grapes, peas, sweetcorn, flakes and seeds in breads Mixed consistency foods such as minestrone soup, or cereals in milk Crunchy foods such as toast, dry biscuits or crisps Crumbly items: such as pie crusts, cakes or dry biscuits Hard foods: such as boiled sweets, toffees, nuts or seeds Thickeners and soaking solutions Before pur\u00e9ed diets are considered, advice shouldbe sought from a dietitian and speech andlanguage therapist to ensure that the appropriatefoods and products are used.A number of commercial products are availablewhich can thicken food and drink and alter thetexture. Examples of thickeners currently availableinclude Thick & easy (Fresenius), Vitaquick (Vitaflo),Thixo-D (Sutherland) and Nutilis thickener(Nutricia). Information on these products can befound on page 157. Many of these companies willprovide advice and demonstrations on how to usethickeners, use food moulds (which they oftenprovide), and prepare soaking solutions. Soakingsolutions can be made from any non-lumpy liquidwith thickener added, and can be used on foodssuch as some plain bread, sandwiches, biscuits andcakes to provide a pur\u00e9ed texture item whilemaintaining the integrity of the food - forexample, so that is still looks like a slice of cake. 29552_Text:29552_Text 2/11/07 08:53 Page 133134 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsFortified foods The fortification of commonly eaten foods is another wayof increasing nutrient intake and can be valuable if used toenhance foods which people enjoy. Adapting commonrecipes to increase their energy and protein content can beparticularly useful when appetites are reduced but peoplecan eat and drink normally. Advice should be sought onsuitable fortification to meet an individual's needs. Examples of how to fortify foods toincrease calorie content Add dried milk powder to whole milk and use in drinks ('fortified milk'). Add dried milk powder or cream to custard. Make soups with fortified milk, and add cream and/or cheese. Add cream and fortified milk to porridge and serve with honey or maple syrup. Add butter and cream to mashed potato. Add melted butter to vegetables or serve with cheese sauce. Serve ice cream with chocolate or fudge sauce or additional cream topping. Make milk puddings with extra milk powder and/or cream, and serve with jam or syrup.Pur\u00e9ed diets Pur\u00e9ed diets may be required when food of a uniformsmooth consistency is required. Pur\u00e9ed foods require nochewing and can be easily managed in the mouth,therefore reducing the risk of choking. Pur\u00e9ed diets arelikely to be lower in energy and nutrients and less palatablethan soft diets and the decision to move to pur\u00e9ed foodsshould not be made lightly. To ensure that nutrient needsare met and food is of the correct texture takes skill, andanyone who prepares a pur\u00e9ed diet should seek advicefrom a speech and language therapist on how to do thismost appropriately.Adding liquids to pur\u00e9ed foods dilutes their nutrientcontent and should be done with care. Most pur\u00e9ed dietswill require the addition of high-energy and proteiningredients (for example, extra full-fat milk, cream, cheese,butter, oil, mayonnaise or full-fat yoghurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche)but it is important to seek advice for each person aboutwhat is appropriate. Fruits and vegetables do not need tobe, and should not be, overcooked before pur\u00e9eing as thiswill reduce the amount of some vitamins present. It is also important that the pur\u00e9ed food looks attractive.The use of food moulds and food soaking solutions toprepare pur\u00e9es in appropriate shapes can be useful (seepage 157). It is important to pur\u00e9e each food separatelyand as far as possible maintain its original colour and taste. Particular care needs to be taken that pur\u00e9ed foods do notbecome contaminated during preparation (see the Food hygiene and safety hints on page 92). More detailed information on menu planning for specialdiets can be found in the NACC publication Menu Planning and Special Diets in Care Homes (see page 156).29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 134135 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsFood supplements A wide range of commercially produced high-energy (andvitamin- and mineral-enriched) food supplement productsare available and may be prescribed by a hospital doctor ormedical practitioner. These supplements should not beseen as long-term food substitutes, but can be useful forshort-term emergencies after illness or operations, orwhere there has been sudden unexpected weight loss. How to use food supplementproducts safely Check the use-by date on products before you use them. Do not use damaged or distorted packets. Follow the prescriber's instructions for use and manufacturer's instructions for storage. Remember good hygiene practice. Ask for regular review of the prescription to ensurethat these supplements are needed. Adapted from NAGE, 1994 7 Where people need help with eating, it is essential for staff to be trained in helping them to eat and to do this in a sensitive and efficient way. The use of finger foods - foods which are presented in a form that can be eaten easily by hand without the need for cutlery - should be used as a way of preserving eating skills and promoting independence forthose who have difficulty using utensils or who do not recognise the purpose of cutlery. Some people with swallowing difficulties may need to have their food or fluid modified. Specialist advice should always be sought when texture modification is required, to ensure that the person's nutrient needsare met and the food is of the correct texture.KEY MESSAGES 29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 135136 Chapter 11 Menu planning and special dietsReferences 1 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361 2 Archibald C, Carver A, Keene J and Watson R (1994) Food and Nutrition in the Care of People with Dementia.

Similar standards areused: in Wales (see www.csiw.wales.gov.uk/docs/Adult_Placement_Schemes_e.pdf), and in Northern Ireland (see http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Sr/sr2005/20050161.htm). The standards relating to Meals and Mealtimes (Standard17) from the standards for England are given below. Thesestandards are likely to change in 2008 but many of theprinciples in these standards will remain intact so they areprovided here as background information. Meals and mealtimes Outcome Service users are offered a healthy diet and enjoy their meal and mealtimes . Standard 1717.1 The registered person promotes service users' health and wellbeing by ensuring the supply of nutritious,varied, balanced and attractively presented meals in acongenial setting and at flexible times. 17.2 Service users are offered a choice of suitable menus, which meet their dietary and cultural needs, andwhich respect their individual preferences.17.3 Meals are offered three times daily including at least one hot cooked meal; and a range of drinks andsnacks to meet individual needs are available at alltimes. 17.4 Service users are actively supported to help plan, prepare and serve meals. 17.5 Service users can choose where and when to eat, and whether to eat alone or with others including staff. 17.6 The preparation and serving of food respects service users' cultural and religious requirements. 17.7 Mealtimes are relaxed, unrushed, and flexible to suit service users' activities and schedules. 17.8 Service users' nutritional needs are assessed and regularly reviewed including risk factors associatedwith low weight, obesity and eating and drinkingdisorders. 17.9 Service users who need help to eat or are fed artificially are assisted appropriately while maintainingchoice of when, where and what they eat; andassisted to choose appropriate eating aids. An additional standard relates to those aged 16-17 years:17.10 The home seeks medical advice if a service user consistently refuses to eat, and for those who over-eat or have any other eating disorders. Scotland National Care Standards for care homes for people withlearning disabilities in Scotland were amended in 2005 (seewww.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/77843/0018375.pdf)and are outlined below. 2These are written from the perspective of the service user. Eating Well Standard 13 Your meals are varied and nutritious. They reflect your foodpreferences and any special dietary needs. They are wellprepared and cooked, and attractively presented.1 Catering and other staff get to know your food choices and any ethnic, cultural, faith or other preferences youhave. Any special diet (for example, vegetarian, low-fator high-protein) is recorded in your personal plan. 2 You are offered a daily menu that reflects your preferences. The menu varies regularly according toyour comments, and will always include fresh fruits andvegetables. 3 You have a choice of cooked breakfast and choices in29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 137138 Appendix 1 National minimum standards: care home regulations and home care (domiciliary) servicescourses at the midday and evening meals. 4 Meals are nutritionally balanced for your dietary needs, for example, if you have diabetes or poor kidneyfunction or need a liquidised or textured soft diet. 5 You can have snacks and hot and cold drinks whenever you like. 6 If you are unable to check if you are getting enough of the right things to eat or drink, staff will keep an eyeon this for you. If, for any reason, you are not takingenough, staff will explain this to you or yourrepresentative. With your agreement, staff will take anyaction needed, including seeking advice from a dentist,dietitian, speech and language therapist or your GP. 7 If there is anything that may affect your ability to eat or drink, for example problems with your teeth or withswallowing, you are confident that this will be assessedand regularly reviewed. Staff will provide appropriatehelp, for example, adapted cutlery or crockery, aliquidised diet, or someone to assist you with eatingand drinking in a discreet manner, in a way that suitsyou and respects your dignity. 8 If you are unable to take food or drink by mouth, you get these by other means, for example PEG orparenteral feeding, in a way that best suits you andrespects your privacy and dignity. 9 You enjoy meals that are well presented. All food handling follows good food-hygiene practices. 10 You are free to eat your meals wherever you like, for example, in your own room or in the dining room. Youcan take them in your own time.Standards for domiciliary care There are standards for those who organise or work inhome care, supporting service users by giving care topeople in their own homes. England and Wales The Domiciliary Care National Minimum Standards forEngland can be found athttp://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4083671.pdf.Those relevant to food and drink are summarised below.Similar standards are available in Wales. See:www.csiw.wales.gov.uk/legislation/wales/wsi_20063251_mi.pdf. Regulations relating to food and drink indomiciliary care in England Standard 2.3 For individuals who are self-funding a care needsassessment is undertaken (appropriate to the level ofsupport requested) in the individual's own home, by amanager competent and trained for the task, covering thedelivery of the services agreed. Issues that may ariseinclude: Dietary requirements and preferences (if appropriate) Standard 8.1 Personal care and support is provided in a way whichmaintains and respects the privacy, dignity and lifestyle ofthe person receiving care at all times with particular regardto assisting with: Eating and meals Standard 11 The registered person ensures that the agency has systemsand procedures in place to comply with the requirementsof the Health and Safety legislation including:Food Safety Act 1990In addition it is expected that among the health and safetyissues covered in the induction programme will beinformation on food preparation, storage and hygiene.For more information Additional information on catering standards inresidential settings can be found in the followingNACC publications: The National Minimum Standards for Care Catering (Care Homes for Older People) A Recommended Standard for Community Meals The National Minimum Standard for Care Catering (Care Homes for Adults Aged 18-65 Years) For further details see www.thenacc.co.uk.29552_Text:29552_Text 1/11/07 16:08 Page 138139 Appendix 1 National minimum standards: care home regulations and home care (domiciliary) servicesNorthern Ireland In Northern Ireland, domiciliary care is about to beregulated.

Your meals are well prepared and well presented 4 You must be able to eat and enjoy your food. If you need any help to do so, for example, adapted cutleryor crockery or a liquidised diet, your home care workerwill arrange this for you 5 You can expect your home care worker to notice anything that affects your ability to eat or drink, suchas dental health or loss of appetite. If so, she or he willdiscuss these with you and help you to get professionalhelp if you want.

A sample Nutrition checklist .2See page 106 for more details. How to use the weight monitoring chart The aim of the Weight monitoring chart shown on the next page is to provide a simple visual record of weight changeover a two-year period. The chart allows each person'sstarting weight to be recorded as the central point. Theboxes above and below this starting point can beannotated at 1kg intervals. Monthly weight measurementscan then be plotted and recorded on each vertical line asshown in the example on the right.Any significant upward or downward trend in a person'sweight should alert staff to potential weight difficulties.The chart works best if a health professional can also addlines to the chart which suggest a minimum and maximumweight where intervention should be considered. (See thered lines in the example on the right.) These should becalculated very carefully, as everyone is an individual andtheir particular circumstances must be taken intoconsideration. However, for someone who wants tomaintain their weight, we suggest that the 'maximum' lineis drawn at the equivalent to a BMI of 30 and the'minimum' line at -5% of the starting body weight. Forthose who are trying to lose or gain weight, these linesneed to be adapted accordingly.To be most effective, we suggest that the lines should bedrawn for one-year periods at a time and thenreconsidered for the next period to reflect any weightchanges that have occurred. Anyone concerned about anyunexplained weight loss for an individual should alwaysseek advice from the person's medical practitioner. Formore information on managing weight, see chapter 5.
