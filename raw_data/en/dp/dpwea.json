This school has 5 departments, the Rehabilitation and Independent Living Research Centre, over 150 staff, over 100 research higher degree students, and is a key member in the National Centre for Healthy Aging. He has a professional background in physiotherapy and health economics, and has worked in research roles embedded within health services for over 15 years before commencing as the Head of School in 2017. He has previously worked for Eastern Health, the University of Queensland, the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and Monash Health. His primary research interest is in improving the allocation of health care resources to better meet emerging community needs and reducing waste. He currently leads the multiple NHMRC and MRFF funded projects, which focus on identifying the most effective and efficient ways of translating evidence into practice. Professor Haines's research has led to several advances in health outcomes. Notable examples include: - Leading the world's first trial to demonstrate that falls amongst hospitalised adults could be prevented. - Developing a patient education program that led to a 50% reduction in falls and fall injuries when rolled out in a randomised trial amongst geriatric rehabilitation units in Western Australia. His work is identified where routinely provided health care services have been ineffective or inefficient, identifying: - That weekend allied health service provision resources are better spent in sub acute wards than in acute medical/surgical wards. - That removal of falls risk screening tools does not increase the rate of falls in hospitals - approximately 590 million dollars per year is consumed across Australia in the provision of falls prevention practices that do not have evidence indicating that they reduce falls in hospitals. He has also contributed to advances in research methodology. Notable examples include: - Development of a new randomised controlled trial research design for the context of disinvestment from a routinely provided service that has a relative absence of evidence examining its effectiveness or economic efficiency. - Development of a concurrent, multi-group, stepped-wedge design with an embedded parallel, cluster randomised controlled trailed design for the context of disinvestment from a routinely provided service that has a relative absence of evidence examining its effectiveness for economic efficiency, where there are multiple comparators of interest. - Development of another novel randomised controlled trail research design for the context of evaluating the effectiveness of different knowledge translation strategies across multiple context areas. - Development of a new statistical analysis approach for the evaluation of screening tool predictive accuracy where the outcome of interest is a recurrent event. - Identifying design-related bias in evaluations of screening tools that lead to a 20% overestimation of the accuracy individual tools. He has received over $75 million in research funding, published over 330 peer-reviewed manuscripts including papers in journals the calibre of The Lancet, BMJ, JAMA Internal Medicine, PLoS Medicine, and BMC Medicine. He has supervised over 30 Higher degree research students through to completion. He has twice been awarded the NHMRC Excellence Award and has received the SACS Consulting Award for leadership in the Victorian State Government Sector. He has previously served as President of the Australia New Zealand Falls Prevention Society, Chair of the Australian Physiotherapy Association - Physiotherapy Research Foundation Grant Review Committee, and convenor of the inaugural Victorian Allied Health Research Conference (2014) and convenor of the Australia New Zealand Falls Prevention Conference (2016). Teaching Responsibilities - 30 completed PhD supervisions. - Coordinator of PhD (Executive Health Management) program. Fields of Expertise - Gerontology - Rehabilitation - Health economics - Research design and analysis Research Interests - Prevention of accidental falls by older adults - Decision making in health care - Innovative research designs - Research driven by health professionals - Health services research Research Income Prof Haines has attracted over $75 million in research funding since 2005. This includes grants for the NHMRC, MRFF, ARC, Victoria Cancer Council, Beyond Blue, Butterfly foundation, Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, BUPA foundation, Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, HCF foundation, Institute for Safety, Compensation and Recovery Research.
