{"title": "A Case Series on the COVID-19 Vaccines and Possible Immune-Related Adverse Events: A New Challenge for the Rheumatologists", "author": "Vicky Nahra; Mahesha Makandura; Donald D Anthony; Maya Mattar; Donald Anthony", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a prime health issue since December 2019. Consequently, there has been an urgent need to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its associated morbidity and mortality. The currently available vaccines are designed to prevent infection. Their efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials. Yet, given the short duration of the trials and the urgency to start vaccination, adverse events have been reported worldwide in real-life data format. Immune-mediated disease flares or new-onset inflammatory diseases following vaccine administration have recently been reported worldwide. Here, we present three cases of inflammatory arthritis (IA) caused by the BNT162b2 COVID vaccination, including two new-onset cases and one case of a flare of existing disease. The first case is new-onset IA, the second case is new-onset rheumatoid arthritis, and the third case is a flare of existing rheumatoid arthritis. Given the timeline of when our patients developed either a flare of their existing rheumatoid arthritis or new-onset IA or polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (a few days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine), in addition to the currently available evidence of documented similar cases post administration of mRNA vaccines, as well as the link between their mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of those diseases, we can speculate a causal relationship between the vaccine and the triggering of these disease entities. In the future, it is important to consider that autoimmune diseases might be triggered or flared by the administration of vaccines, which appears to be associated with the COVID vaccine as well. Further evaluation of its incidence will provide additional clarity, though the rarity of this occurrence in the setting of more than half of the US population becoming vaccinated indicates that the benefit of the vaccine in terms of protection from COVID morbidity and mortality far outweighs this risk.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-09-27", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
