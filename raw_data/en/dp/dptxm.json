Mind/Body Medicine refers to the interaction between the mind, body, and spirit, specifically the ways in which emotional, mental, social and spiritual factors together can directly affect mental and physical health. This means looking beneath the surface of symptoms and resolving the more fundamental causes for the conditions. By leaving behind the old Western school of thought that illness happens either in the mind or the body, practitioners can achieve a more complete state of optimal health and wellbeing. Mind-Body Program is a mind body connection approach to healing that looks at a person as an integrated whole: mind + body + spirit. In contrast to traditional psychotherapy or \"talk therapy,\" the Mind-Body program incorporates a person's life history, the analysis of thoughts and emotions, and relationship between a person's mental, physical, and spiritual experiences.

Therapy sessions include the combination of traditional talk therapy and biologically based practices, such as: EMD-R, Thought Field Therapy, Neurofeedback, Brainspotting.
