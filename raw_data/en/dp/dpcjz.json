The committee will inform the AACAP of the psychiatric, psychological, medical, developmental, educational and remedial needs of youth in the child welfare system and completed adoptions. These needs include post -placement services, better subsidization of auxiliary services for special needs adoptive families and improving the quality and accessibility of behavioral health services for troubled adoptees and youth in foster care and their families. In doing so, the committ ee will: A. Try to stimulate and support research efforts in the fields of adoption and foster care. B. Support presentations at AACAP meetings and by AACAP members that share clinical and academic information, and inform AACAP members about the needs of these youth and their families. C. Promote the development of professional expertise in these areas, such as trying to develop curricula that training programs can use to teach fellow and trainees about adoption and foster care. D. Work with the ABPN committee o n certification in child and adolescent psychiatry to include questions regarding youth in the child welfare system and completed adoptions. E. Consider related issues of child protection and social welfare, such as family preservation and home -based ser vices. 2. The committee will collaborate with representatives of other organizations and disciplines to share information. In so doing, we will consult with the relevant stakeholders. 3. The committee will help the AACAP develop public policy positions on adoption and youth in the child welfare system, that best serve children and their families. 4.

Status of projects and deliverables: One of our members is on the ABPN Child Psychiatry MOC Committee, and has submitted test items relating to adoption and foster care, which is one of the goals in our charge . A number of our members participate in a listserv for child psychiatrists who consult or provide oversight in public systems of care. We propose d to the Quality Issues Committee that we develop a Practice Paramet er on optimizing psychiatric medications . The Quality Issues Committee tentatively approved developing a De- Prescribing PP, but the Psychopharmacology Committee will sponsor it. However, a number of our members will stay involved, and we propose a section be devoted to youth who may benefit from de -prescribing, such as child welfare system involved youth. One of our members participated in the literature review for the De -Prescribing PP, which found about 100 relevant articles. Two of our members just completed a chapter on Transitioning to Adulthood from Foster Care, for a Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics volume on Transition Age Youth. We submitted, sponsored, or co- sponsored the following submissions for the Annual Meeting: Member Forum on the Practice in the World of Medication Oversight Special Interest Group on Psychotropic Medication Oversight Programs for State Medicaid and Child Welfare Agencies Clinical Symposium on De -Prescribing in Child Psychiatry Media Theater on A Little White Lie Workshop on Managing Psychiatric Medications in Very Young Children One of our members was involved in legislation in Washington State providing oversight of antipsychotics prescribed to youth in foster care . One of our members was appointed AACAP liaison to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. The Children's Bureau is developing an Informational Memo regarding the topic of psychotropics medication oversight. We will work with AACAP to ask that AACAP be included, if we are not already involved. AAP is revising their statement on \"Health Care of Youth Aging out of Foster Care.\" We will work with AACAP to consider participating in this statement revision in order to ensure that youth have access to appropriate mental health services. AAP is drafting a statement on \"Preferred Methods of Substitute Care,\" and will ask AACAP to participate in developing a joint statement.

This included developing a job description and delivering a panel presentation at the Sprin g Assembly Meeting. We are currently reaching out to ROCAP Presidents to promote the AL program and ask that each ROCAP identify an AL . 6. Emily Rohlffs, along with co- chairs Deb Koss and Karen Pierce, have worked closely with ALs in other states to organize grassroots advocacy efforts to address state specific mental health legislation. Examples include: AACAP and the Hawaii ROCAP worked together, and with other physician partners in the state, to stop at the eleventh hour an effort to grant psyc hologists prescribing authority. AACAP and the North Carolina ROCAP sent a joint letter to Gov. Pat McCrory and party leaders in the state legislature asking they immediately repeal HB 2 , the bill that designated multiple occupancy restrooms for use by individuals based on their biologic sex . AACAP worked to activate grassroots opposition to both a Louisiana bill expanding the scope of APRNs and to a Tennessee bill allowing licensed therapists to deny serving patients based on an objection to their sexual i dentity or orientation. 7. With Emily's guidance and the assistance of the Department of Government Affairs team , the Committee is currently working to identi fy advocacy policy gaps. The next step will involve collaboration with the appropriate AACAP Commit tees to develop timely policy statements to address these gaps . These policy statements will serve as essential resources in the development of advocacy strategy at the state and federal level. We will follow the usual policy development process. 8. The Advocacy Committee submitted a proposal to the Annual Meeting Program Committee entitled \"Make Your Voice Heard\": Strategies to Combat th e Allegations of 'Overdrugging' Children.

King, MD CC 11/1/2015 M Pruett, Jr., MD, PhD M 11/1/2015 10/29/2017 Gagan Joshi, MD M 11/1/2015 Kelly Hannah 10/29/2017 David Hong, 10/25/14 10/30/2016 Kathleen Koth, MD M 10/30/16 10/27/2018 CHARGE: Autism and Intellectual Disability Committee Charge 1. To study the role of the child & adolescent psychiatrist in preventive work with treatment of and rehabilitation for children and adolescents with intellectual disability. 2. To study new developments in the classification and diagnosis of intellectual disability and developmental disabilities and to make appropriate recommendations to Council in these areas. 3. To work in collaboration with the Work Group on Training and Education in relation to the optimum means of including appropriate experience and didactic instruction in intellectual disability and developmental disabilities in the p reparation of child & adolescent psychiatrists. 4. To work in collaboration with the Community Psychiatry Committee on the questions of how community mental health centers should address the issues posed by intellectual disability and developmental disabilities. 5. To work in collaboration with the JCAH on issues that bear on standards for facilities for persons with intellectual disability and developmental disability. 6. To work in collaboration with the Inpatient Continuum of Care Committee on issues that bear on the institutional care of children and adolescents with intellectual disability and developmental disability. 7. The Autism and Intellectual Disability Committee is responsible for the George Tarjan Award. This entails the following: The Committee must ensure that there are at least 3 written nominations for the award. If the awards are to be meaningful, there must be some investment in the nominations process and the awards cannot simply be given out. If there are not at least 3 nominations, the award will not be given out that year. The National Office, particularly the Director of Research and Training, is responsible for announcing the awards, but the Committee is to make sure nominations come in. The Committee is responsible for determining procedu res and selection criteria. Statu s of projects and deliverables: 1) Annual meeting working group - This group, led by Gagan Joshi, works to develop Institutes and Symposia / Clinical Perspectives focused on ASD and ID. In particular, we have been working to enrich the focus on ID, which is dramatically under -represented at the annual meeting. At the 201 5 annual meeting, the first ID Institute in about a decade was highly successful (sold out, strong reviews). Unfortunately, the Program Committee rejected a significantly revised ID Institute submission, with more emphasis on work with families and systems, for 2016. This year's ASD Institute was very successful (at capacity of >300 attendees) , as was a Clinical Perspective session that emerged from within the committee. To address the need to present information to members about ID, the Committee has created an additional working group to focus on having more Intellectual Disability programs selected for AACAP's Annual Meeting. 2) Training curriculum working group - Roma Vasa has been leading a working group focused on developing a suggested curriculum on A SD/ID for use in child psychiatry fellowship programs. This curriculum will include lectures, clinical vignettes, reading materials and career planning materials. The working group led a presentation at AADPRT this year to refine the draft curriculum. The goal is to present the curriculum at AACAP 2017. In support of this work, a needs assessment survey was conducted in NY among all of the training programs; results were presented to the Committee at the annual meeting. According to a recent survey 60% of training directors felt they have a strong program but 87% still want more resources made available to them. The top resource request was on -line videos. In addition to this work, the group is also preparing a clinical perspectives article for JAACAP. 3) Training dissemination working group - Frampton Gwynette has been leading a working group focused on getting recommended readings and other teaching materials online in an accessible form in collaboration with the ALLI Committee . This has been a challen ge within the context of the AACAP website. It is noted that these resources would be of tremendous value to training directors. 4) Fellowship working group - Matthew Siegel has handed off leadership of this group to Kelly McGuire. The Fellowship Committee continues to work to promote the Developmental Neuropsychiatry Fellowship programs in Autism and Intellectual Disabilities at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Columbia University, Maine Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford University and University of Missouri -Kansas City. The Committee had a bo oth at this year's exhibit hall where members from these programs were present to discuss potential fellowships. The Fellowship Committee will continue to promote their programs in AACAP News and other appropriate mediums. 5) Genetics working group - A genetics working group, convened by Jeremy Veenstra -VanderWeele but driven by Ernie Pedipati and Rebecca Muhle (non -members, currently), has been meeting to generate a short guidance document on genetic testing in ASD/ID for child psychiatrists. The group is working with the JAACAP to explore publication of the paper as a Clinical Translations piece. 6) Vaccination Statement - at the request of Dr. Fritz, the committee drafted a short statement supporting vaccination and clearly stating that vaccination does not lead to autism risk. This was submitted for Council review. 7) George Tarjan Award - James McCracken received the award for 2016 and gave an outstanding talk highlighting Dr. Tarjan's career and the need for more effort focused on prevention of intellectual disability. 8) Committee Charge - This was revised ~2 years ago, but the revised version was never submitted for review by AACAP because of a transition in staff liaisons. It has now been submitted for review. 9) ID Practice parameters - Kelly McGuire devoted an incredible amount of work on the Practice Parameter for ID and has been assisted by Matt Siegel and others on the Committee . The first draft was rec ently submitted for review and the group is on target to share the parameter with the Committee by the 2017 annual meeting. 10) James C. Harris Developmental Neuropsychiatry Forum - This year's forum was titled \"Understanding Autism in Families: From Leo Kanner to Developmental Neurobiology\" and included Joseph Piven, MD , and Jason Wolff, PhD , as its speakers. The speakers spoke on how an understanding of autism within families impacts clinical practice currently, and how emerging research findings may improve future care of children with ASD and their families. 11) Membership: A request was s ubmitted at the Committee Clusters meeting for additional membership slots (to be filled by members focused on ID). With 54 members in attendance this year (and a trajectory of year over year increases), it is essentially impossible to bring new members o n to the Committee in a timely way and it is a real loss to early career members (and AACAP) in terms of encouraging and supporting their interest in participating in AACAP as the membership queue stretches out for several years. There is virtually no added cost to AACAP associated with this expansion (this Committee does not convene in- person meetings outside of the Annual Meeting) , and there is a precedent for having an ID committee (it actually preceded the Autism Committee) \u2014this action could be viewed as re-constituting the ID committee. Subcommittees wi thin Committee (if applicable): Annual Meeting Working Group (Gagan Joshi); Training Curriculum Working Group (Roma Vasa); Training Dissemination Working Group (Frampton Gwynette); Fellowship Working Group (Kelly McGuire); Genetics Working Group (Ernie Pedipati and Rebecca Muhle); Tarjan Award Selection Subcommittee.

The Committee's functions include: Work with AACAP to develop and promote forensic training and education in child psychiatry, a nd in the evaluation and treatment of youth involved with the juvenile justice system. Serve as a liaison between AACAP and other professional organizations on matters concerning child psychiatry and the law. Develop and assist with position papers and pra ctice parameters for AACAP on issues pertaining to the legal system and children and adolescents. Review requests for AACAP to file or sign on to amicus briefs. When recommending that AACAP author, file, or sign on to amicus briefs, provide the Executive C ommittee with relevant and succinct background information and the longest possible time to review and comment before moving forward with a commitment to add AACAP's name, both at the start and near completion of each engagement. Promote access to comprehensive mental health and substance use treatment services for all youth involved with the judicial system in both juvenile justice and community based settings. Statu s of projects and deliverables: The Committee updated its committee charge with was approved by AACAP leadership Amicus Briefs The Children and the Law Committee worked with the Juvenile Law Center, and the law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP to author a medical amicus brief for AACAP in the case of J.B v Fassnacht . The question being consider in this case was, does a previous court ruling allowing for a policy of strip searches for all adults in correction facilities apply to minors? This brief argued that a policy of allowing strip searches for all minors is inappropriate and m ay lead to trauma and psychological harm. The brief argued that the decision of whether to strip search a minor before entering a correctional facility should be determined on a case by case basis. o We believe, this is the first time that AACAP has been the lead organization on an amicus brief . Please also know that the firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett did all of their work pro - bono. There was no cost to AACAP. The Children and the Law Committee recommended and the EC agreed that A ACAP should sign o n to an amicus brief in the case of Flores v. Jonson. o Background: In 1997, the Federal Government settled a class -wide lawsuit that requires federal immigration facilities to minimize the harm caused to children detained by federal immigration authorit ies. The settlement required federal immigration facilities to hold children in the least restrictive setting, appropriate to their age and special needs. On July 24, 2015, Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California issued an order stating that the Dilley, Karnes and Berks family detention facilities were in violation of this settlement. The Judge order these detention centers to bring their practices into compliance, with the 1997 class action settlement, by October 23, 2015. o Despite Jud ge Gee's order, these facilities continued to employed inappropriat e practices. The m brief that AACAP signed on to asked that Judge Gee's order be enforced. The brief focused on the harmful effects that detention has on youth. The Children and the Law Committee continues to be involved with Amicus Briefs in the case of Wollsclaeger v. Governor of Florida. This case involves a Florida law that restricts a physician's ability to ask their patients about firearm ownership. The Committee continues to review and recommend that AACAP sign on to briefs that protects a physician's 1st Amendment Right to ask their patients about firearm ownership. Policy Statements Dalia Balsamo, MD, a member of the Children and the Law Committee developed a new policy statement on \"Transgender Youth in Juvenile Justi ce and other Correctional Settings .\" This policy statement was recently approved by the EC and Council. The Committee created a policy statement on the Jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court. This statement is currently in the final stages of review and approval . Legislation AACAP and the Children and the Law Committee continues to work closely with Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-CA.) Rep. Cardenas is a passionate advocate for juvenile justice reform. Rep. Cardenas has introduced multiple bills to reform the nation's juvenile justice system. These include bills that would ban solitary confinement of youth in federal facilities, and prohibit the detention of youth for status offenses. In late April Rep. Cardenas re- introduced his At -Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act. This legislation was initial developed with the assistance of committee member William Arroyo, MD. Before reintroducing the legislation, the Congressman's office reached out to AACAP and asked us to review the legislation. Committee member Kayla Pope, MD, JD, provided key feedback to ensure that the legislation does not inadvertently promote the termination or suspension of Medicaid for children who have not yet been adjudica ted. Committee member Louis Kraus, MD, has been working closely with the office of Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL). Senator Durbin is the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and has a deep interest in ending the use of sol itary confinement. Committee co -chair Kayla Pope, MD, JD, working through the office of Rep. Brad Ashford organized a meeting with Congressman Ashford and numerous officials from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the issue of the unjust termination of Medicaid benefits for pre -adjudicated youth and how this violates their 14 th amendment right to due process. The Committee is optimistic that justice reform will be one of the issues that Congress addresses in 2017- 2018 session and is working to develop principles of reform for the juvenile justice system. Subcommittees wi thin Committee (if applicable): NA Are you collaborating with other AACAP committees? If so, how?: When developing the policy statement on Transgender Youth in Juvenile Justice and other Correctional Intuitions we collaborated with AACAP's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Issues Committee How many face -to-face meetings have you had in Current Year?

To be informed and knowledgeable about the standards, requirements as outlined by the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), and conditions and issues associated with the continuing medical education of child and adolescent psychiatrists on national, regional, and local levels. To be actively involved in the ACCME reaccreditation process. 2. To respond to the above information and develop appropriate plans and recommendations to address these issues. 3. To collaborat e with the Program Committee in the review of AACAP sponsored continuing medical education meetings and to ensure that all educational programs meet the appropriate needs and standards. 4. To be responsible for writing self -assessment activity questions for journal CME, select Annual Meeting Institutes, as well as reviewing meeting evaluations to determine additional practice gaps and needs assessments; to address the potential conflicts of interests and resolve issues that arise, among other specific CME co mpliance issues that arise. 5. To collaborate with the CME Collaboration Network (made up of representatives from the CME Committee, JAACAP, Lifelong Learning Committee, Program Committee, and Quality Issues Committee; chaired by the President -Elect), and th e Lifelong Learning Committee in the production of the Lifelong Learning Modules, online CME, and other forms of enduring materials. 6. To review for approval other educationally relevant AACAP proposals requesting CME credit, as designated by the Executive Committee or Council. 7. To serve as the representative of the AACAP Council in working on continuing medical education matters with national, regional, and local bodies concerned with continuing medical education and certification. Statu s of projects and deliverables: Live (meeting) CME 1. The evaluations for live activities providing CME were reviewed at the committee's meeting on April 8, 2016, including the Annual Meeting the Pediatric Psychopharmacology Update Institute, and the Annual Review Course. Quality has remained very high. Annual Meeting evaluations were reviewed, and instances of potential conflict of interest and/or bias were addressed with individual presenters. At the 2015 Annual Meeting there were 73 disclosure violations. This compares to 81 disclosure violations in 2014. There were 19 instances of perceived bias with 2 requiring additional information and review. The Subcommittee on Comment Review reached out the chairs/speakers of these sessions to address and resolve the issue. Dr. Harper presented this information to the Program Committee at their April meeting. There were no instances of perceived bias found in the evaluations for the 2016 Psychopharmacology Update Institute or the 2016 Annua l Review Course. 2. Three Institutes from the 2015 Annual Meeting were selected for a pre/post/follow up test as part of a CME longitudinal outcomes initiative on capturing knowledge and practice improvement. The results of the follow up survey, conducted in March 2016, were reviewed. CME committee members wrote the pre- , post-, and follow -up questions. Institutes included in this initiative are: Institute 4: The Developmental Neuropsychiatry of Intellectual Developmental Disability: Advances in Classification, Diagnosis, and Treatment Institute 5: The Child Psychiatrist's Guide to Pharmacological and Behavioral Interventions for Sleep Disorders in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Institute 7: Treating the Sickest Kids 3. The Committee selected 3 Institutes from the 2016 Annual Meeting to participate in the CME initiative of pre/post/follow up tests. The following Institutes were chosen: Institute 1: Psychopharmacology Update: Focus on Refractory Cases and Longer Term Outcomes Institute 5: Managing Suicide and Violence Risk While Building Resilience: Practical Applications in Clinical, School, and Community Settings Institute 7: Autism- Spectrum Disorder Update: Screening, Assessment, Genetics, and Multidisciplinary Treatment CME committee members wrote the pre -, post -, and follow -up questions. 4. The committee reviewed the evaluations of the 2 self -assessment workshop s presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting that the committee worked on with the Lifelong Learning Committee . The psychopharmacology workshop did very well, and the developmental disabilit ies had a small attendance but content was well received. Due to the high evaluation ratings, the committees decided to plan 1 SA workshop for 2016 on psychopharmacology and increase the ticketed attendance. The workshop at this year's Annual Meeting (held October 26, 2016) features Boris Birmaher, MD, John Walkup, MD, Timothy Wilens, MD as the speakers, and Eric Williams, MD as the moderator. We increased the workshop attendance to 100 compared to 75 last year. The workshop is ABPN approved for self -asses sment credit. This has been very successful, and offers another way for AACAP members to achieve the SA requirement for maintenance of certification. AEPNYA- AACAP 60th Congress - Spain Meeting 5. The CME Committee approved by way of application the gra nting of 22.5 credit hours for the AEPNYA- AACAP 60th Congress meeting which was held June 1 -4, 2016 in San Sebastian, Spain. The committee has been very involved in reviewing speaker disclosures, reviewing content, and marketing the meeting to the membership. The Congress had 637 total people registered, 155 attendees from the US (102 identified as AACAP members). The evaluations were tabulated and distributed to the leadership. Journal CME 6. The Committee has continued to meet with Mary Billingsley, JAACAP Ed itorial Manager, regarding the implementation of CME credit. The Journal office sent out a survey to those who review manuscripts regarding the potential of offering manuscript CME credit. After reviewing the results, we will offer manuscript peer review CME beginning in January 2017. 7. To date, 3,815 certificates have been issued for 2015 activities ; 1,287 certificates have been issued for 2016 activities . JAACAP and the Committee have seen a steady increase in the number of unique participants and certif icates issued. Practice Gaps 8. The Committee reviewed additional global practice gaps to be used for future CME activities, and to be incorporated into the Call for Papers. The revised practice gaps will be used in December when the Call for Papers is open. Submitters will then be able to use one of the practice gaps as it relates to their submission, or they may choose to write their own. Additional activities 9. The Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) annual report was submitted on March 31, 2016. This report details the number of activities in 2015, the number of physicians and non-physician attendees, the credit hours given, and income and expenses associated with the activities. 10. The CME Committee responded to the ACCME's Call for Comment on February 2/16/16 regarding proposed changes to the Accreditation with Commendation Criteria. 11. We worked with the Lifelong Learning Committee to develop the self -assessment exam in conjunction with the Annual Meeting. The exam opened with registration on August 1 st. This exam has been successful for the 4th year in a row, increasing the number of non- attendee/non -members who purchase the exam, the reby increasing the revenue for this exam. This year 1,540 users completed the exam compared to 1,101 last year. An additional 115 users purchased the exam resulting in $12,900 in revenue, an increase from $8,400 last year. 12. We are collaborating with the Lifelong Learning Committee to review and revise the topic categories used for the Call for Papers submissions, CME activities, and SA questions. We are using the ABPN 2016 Content Outline and Core Competencies, as well as our existing list of topic catego ries, as the basis of our review. Subcommittees within Committee (if applicable): 1. Subcommittee on Comment Review: Reviews complaints of bias and conflict of interest 2.

The Program Committee will make final determination over content of the Forum.\" 2) The Committee approved t he Minutes from the June 17, 2016 conference call. 3) The Committee recommended changing the column on the Special Funds \"megachart\" titled, \"Reporting Requirements & Oversight\" to \"Reporting Requirements & AACAP Component Oversight\". 4) The Committee recommends that in all written language used about gifts and endo wments, the term \"oversight\" be reserved for functions of this Committee, and in other places alternate language (i.e., re sponsibility for, etc.) be used . 5) In a Corporate Roundtable update, it is recommended that a survey be used for feedback. Further, a recommendation will be submitted to consider two Roundtable meetings in the spring in Washington, DC - one for pharma companies, one for technology/digital health/insurance companies. 6) The Executive Committee's 2017 funding decisions was shared with the Comm ittee. 7) The Committee recommends that the percent spent from an endowed fund be capped. Thus, a 5% cap would include costs for the award and AACAP administrative costs. So, if $5,000 is spent for the award, administrative costs could be limited to 10% of $5,000, or $500. 8) Program Co -Chair, Boris Birmahe r, and AACAP Director of Meetings, Jill Brafford , presented to the Committee, requesting flexibility in the format when scheduling the Honors Presentations. There are 9- 10 such presentations, and each is 1-hour in length . The request for programming flex ibility is intended to improve attendance by using contemporary formats similar to TED talks. The Development Office will identify which of these Honors Presentations will require speaking with the donor(s) to request this change. Subcommittees within Committee (if applicable): No subcommittees within Gifts and Endowment Committee . Committees collaborating with: Development Committee: S haring SOPs for specific AACAP funds . Also, discussing ways to differentiate the existing and new funds t o expand giving opportunities at AACAP. Additionally, co -chair, Dr. Owen Lewis was appointed to the Task Force on Special Funds and Awards, which was appointed by Council to review the current structure of AACAP funds and awards, and to make recommendations to Council regarding the future administration of these programs.

Walkup, MD M 11/1/2015 10/30/2016 CHARGE: Introduction The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) solicits and receives grant support from private and governmental sources on a regular basis. These grants are used to support specific programs and activities integral to the goals of the Academy. The Grants Oversight Committee shall provide ongoi ng consultation about and oversight of the fiscal, administrative and ethical aspects of all AACAP grants and shall serve to resolve issues as grant mechanisms are developed. These guidel ines now apply to all grants over $100,000. The Grants Oversight Committee shall be composed of a chairperson (a psychiatrist with grant experience), the current Treasurer, the immediate past Treasurer and two members of Council appointed by the President. AACAP grant applications can be initiated in o ne of two ways: 1. AACAP committees, work groups or task forces may develop an application for a grant to support a specific initiative or program. The application must be reviewed and approved by the Grants Oversight Committee before submission. 2. The Presid ent of the AACAP may appoint an ad hoc committee to develop a grant proposal. One member of the committee will be designated by the President to be the Principal Investigator of the grant. An additional Scientific Advisory Committee may be appointed by the President with the advice of the Principal Investigator to act as scientific advisors to any funded activities as necessary. A member of the Grants Oversight Committee shall serve as a n ex-officio member of each Scientific Advisory Committee . Charges to the Grants Oversight Committee 1. The Committee shall review at least annually the fiscal and administrative operation of each AACAP externally funded research, training and service grant and report on a semi -annual basis to the Executive Committee with resp ect to compliance by the Principal Investigator both with policies and practices of the Granting Agency and the Academy. 2. The Committee shall review and approve all grant applications and their renewals prior to submission to the granting agency. 3. The Comm ittee shall provide ongoing guidance and consultation to the Principal Investigator and to Academy staff in order to ensure proper grants management. 4. The Committee will understand that each research, training or service project of the Academy will have it s own internal scientific consultants. The Grants Oversight Committee is not to provide such scientific oversight or consultation. 5. The Committee will provide guidance for the administration of externally funded grants to the Academy, including the appropriate review of applicants for training grants. Guidelines The following procedures and processes are deemed essential for effective oversight by the Committee regarding appropriate application for externally funded research projects and training p rograms and implementation of such externally funded grants. The Committee shall: 1. Review all submissions by the AACAP components for grant applications for external funding in excess of $100,000 in total. These working drafts shall be submitted to the Committee ten working days before the submission date in order to permit a comprehensive review of the complete submission before agency deadlines. 2. Review with assistance of the AACAP National Office all budgets and budget changes regarding AACAP policies and the external grant funding source for compliance with regulations and guidelines. 3. Review any claims of potential conflicts of interest, impropriety or irregular activity which may be raised in regard to such grants. This includes any and all issues concerning ethical and fiscal matters. The President of the AACAP or Principal Investigators shall request such review if necessary. 4. Provide a copy of the Guidelines for all the Chairs of AACAP components or Principal Investigators who are overseeing the dev elopment and/or administration of research, training or service grants for whom external funding is being sought or has been awarded. The Principal Investigators and AACAP National Office staff shall: 1. Administer the externally funded grants in a fiscally prudent fashion, in order to gain maximum use of grant funds for direct benefit of the \"targeted\" recipients (e.g. research trainees, members of participants in continuing medical or other education, subjects of studies or services), and avoid any appeara nce of impropriety in this process. 2. Ensure that investigators and program staff will only evaluate or contract for grant funds with applicants or possible participants in the grant's implementation or whom they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of related decisions concerning potential or real allocation of funds. This includes anyone in whom the investigators, staff or his/her family members may have a financial interest, or for whom the investigator serves, or has served in the past thre e years, as mentor, supervisor, co- worker, close colleague or friend, or with whom the applicant may be negotiating or has an arrangement for prospective employment. 3. Ensure that investigators, National Office or others delegated responsibility for impleme nting the conduct and expenditures of the externally funded grant, should avoid any actions that might give the appearance that a conflict of interest exists or could reasonably be viewed as affecting the requisite of objectivity. 4. Provide the guidelines t o co-investigators, program/project staff and any other individuals for whom potential conflicts of interest might involve the grant and its execution. 5. Institute a process for identifying actual or potential conflicts of interest pertaining to the activities of the grants administered by the Grants Oversight Committee. It is incumbent on the Principal Investigator , when in doubt, to seek guidance and clarification from the Grants Oversight Committee chair in order to eliminate even the appearance of a conf lict of interest. The Principal Investigator, Committee Chair of the proposed grant, or President of AACAP shall request the Grants Oversight Committee to review the situation and render a binding decision within a period of two weeks from the notification and receipt of documentation concerning the situation. In cases where the conflict or potential conflict involves the chair of the Grants Oversight Committee , he or she shall identify the conflict, excuse him or herself and delegate decision -making to the other members of the committee. 6. Submit reports semi- annually regarding the fiscal and administrative operation of the grant. The report should also include any adverse experiences encountered. Status of projects and deliverables: The primary focus of the Committee is monitori ng AACAP's K12 Grant from NIDA. The notice of grant award for the current cohort was announced last May, 2015. The K12 funds six child psychiatry trainees who are carrying out research projects on issues in subst ance abuse. The Executive Committee of the K12 Grant frequently communicate with each of the scholars, and have filed progress reports indicating that, in general, the scholars are moving forward to reach their goals. The Committee met in NYC during the Annual Meeting . They were presented with an overview of the K12 NIDA grant from Paula Riggs, MD, K12 Principal Investigator, and Kevin Gray, MD, K12 Advisory Committee Chair. Also joining the call was Heather Gerth, K12 grants consultant. The notice of grant award was received from NIDA on June 8, 2016. This award notice is for the period of June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017 and represents the 2 nd year of this 5 -year grant. During the first year of the grant, only 2 of the 6 scholars started their aw ards and those 2 scholars didn't start until March 2016. The remaining 4 scholars started in year 2. Thus, there is a significant variance between the budget and the actual expenses. Thus, all 6 scholars have been selected. This is a more diverse cohort this year, than in prior years. There are 2 males, 2 African American's, 1 female Middle East, and 1 Caucasian female. AACAP will need to request a carry forward of the $1,042,503 balance so that the scholars can use the money from year 1, in a no cost extension year at the end of the grant period, if needed. The final annual report for the budget year ended May 31, 2016 was submitted timely on August 31, 2016. We do not anticipate any problems with the submitted report. The June 30, 2016 quarterly report was submitted with a slight delay due to the change in the payroll system. The next quarterly report will be due at the end of October. A co -chair still needs to be identified and nominated. Subcommittees within Committee (if applicable): None Are you collaborating with othe r AACAP committees? If so, how?

It is the responsibility of child psychiatry to design promotion and prevention programs aimed at helping children and families stay well, develop resilience, and recover from developmental psychopathology. Our basic premise is that all health emerges from emotional behavioral health. Chi ld psychiatry should be central to health promotion, prevention interventions and evidence -based family -based intervention. The role of child psychiatry is to develop programs that promote health by providing families the wellness knowledge to prevent the development of psychopathology in families in which children who are currently at risk. The committee will work towards this mission by: Educating and emphasize to AACAP members the advances made in evidence - based health promotion and prevention in child psychiatry. Educating the public on the important role that child psychiatry plays in health promotion and prevention for families. Disseminating information on advances in evidence -based health promotion and prevention. Advocating for implementation and f unding of health promotion and prevention programs in policy initiatives.

Status of projects and deliverables: The HCAE Committee, including its subcommittees on CPT Coding and Health Information Technology, has had a productive year. Its work has been focused on the following goals: 1. Promoting the alignment of child and adolescent psychiatry practice with the shifting orientation of the health care system towards population health through the following activities and deliverables: a. Sponsored numerous annual meeting submissions related to collaborative and integrated practice models. b. Developed liaison relationship with Patient- Centered Primary Car e Collaborative, representing large health systems and professional organizations. c. Worked with APA and other groups in coding initiatives towards development of collaborative care and telemedicine codes (see below on CPT coding subcommittee work). d. Involvem ent with Presidential Initiative Work Group on Integrated Care. 2. Promoting increased participation among AACAP members in insurance networks: a. Development of liaison relationship with the Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness to provide a platform for advocacy on behalf of children and families and promote dialogue regarding mutual interests. b. Coordination with APA Council on Healthcare Finance for advocacy regarding compliance with parity regulations c. Finalizing membership survey of network participation and other practice variables among AACAP members in order to measure outcomes related to this goal. 3.

Promoting the incorporation of quality measurement in child and adolescent psychiatry practice: a. Clinical measurement tools: collaboration with SOC Committee regarding electronic version of C ASII, exploring development of registries The CPT Coding subcommittee has achieved significant progress on the following initiatives: 1. Care Collaboration Codes: AACAP worked with APA on a version that has passed the CPT Editorial Panel and is now before the RUC for the valuation phase. Temporary Medicare \"G\" codes, which are mimic the (hopefully) future CPT codes, go into effect on Jan 1, 2017; the Coding Subcommittee is working on interpreting these codes and later explaining them to AACAP members. In addi tion, these codes primarily target the care of adult patients and so, once they are eventually accepted by the RUC and CMS, the next step is to propose codes that work well for pediatric collaborative care. 2. Neurofeedback Codes: Upon the request of the AAC AP Committee on Complementary and Integrative Medicine, AACAP began working with the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research to draft a proposal for the CPT Editorial Panel, targeted for presentation at the September 2016 Panel meeting. The Pa nel postponed decision on the codes to give time for AACAP to bring together all neurofeedback and biofeedback stakeholders. 3. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Codes: AACAP is working with 4 ABA/Autism societies as well as other stakeholders to draft a revisi on of the current Category III (temporary) ABA CPT codes to present to the CPT Editorial Panel as proposed Category I (permanent) codes, targeted for presentation at the September 2016 Panel meeting.

Telepsychiatry: AACAP is a member of the CPT Telehealth Services workgroup and has assisted in vetting several pr oposals from this ongoing group. Our representatives work closely with the AACAP Telepsychiatry Committee. A Telemedicine modifier (\"95\") for synchronous real time audio/video encounters will be in operation as of January 2017. 5. Code maintenance and new dir ections: AACAP representatives attend meetings of the CPT Editorial Panel and AMA RUC, each three times per year, to protect the interests of AACAP members. AACAP is a member of the CPT/RUC Emerging Issues Workgroup. 6. Member education: Two presentations hav e been accepted for the October Annual Meeting, covering basic and intermediate coding issues. The CPT Coding Subcommittee regularly answers members' questions electronically. The HIT subcommittee has been focused on the following initiatives: 1. Finalizing w hite paper entitled Best Principles for Utilizing EMR Applications for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice. This document will help members to adapt EMR technology for improving efficiency of practice, preventing the technology from degrading the ther apeutic alliance with patients, leveraging the technology for incorporating quality measures into clinical practice, and improving communication with other providers. The document is expected to be completed by October 2016. 2. Development of online resource to help members to navigate and assess quality of Clinical and Practice Management mobile apps. 3.

Mian, MD CC John Fayyad, MD M MAS M Alamiri, 10/30/2016 Daniel S. Fung, MD M 10/25/2014 10/30/2016 CHARGE: International Relations Committee Charge To promote and facilitate an international perspective to Child and Adolescent Psychiatry within the AACAP through the following measures: 1. To identify areas for collaboration between the AACAP and other international related organizations. 2. To promote an international perspective to initiatives within AACAP and its various committees through liaison and the facilitation of international collaborations. 3. To facilitate the needs and requirements of AACAP members who are interested in international work through networking and assisting with international connections. 4. To develop and maintain a database at AACAP on the observerships/electives and fellowship programs available in th e United States for international trainees seeking training in child and adolescent psychiatry. 5. To elicit internationally focused submissions for the AACAP newsletter and assist both national and international authors with the submission process. 6. To liaise with other relevant AACAP committees to produce submission with an international focus for the AACAP annual meeting. 7. To develop guidelines and oversee the selection process for recipients of the AACAP International Scholarship. Statu s of projects and deliverables: Facilitate CAP electives, observerships for International medical students in US based CAP training programs: An in -depth conversation took place between leadership in the IRC with a plan to reach out to applicable organizations like AADPRT , AADCAP and ADMSEP to get a list of medical schools that allow international student electives/ observerships. The role of IRC in helping develop MOU's between medical schools was discussed, justified due to the acute short age of trained child mental health physicians across the globe. A list of US -based programs that offer 3 -6-month training for international psychiatry or CAP residents and early career psychiatrists, will also be explored . The co -chair (WJ Kim) sent out a question via AADCAP listserv and also discussed with the AACAP representative (G Fox) to ADMSEP but came to a co nclusion that IRC's hope of developing a database is unrealistic as programs would not wish to publicize such an exchange program due to logistic problems, not enough training sites for their own students, residents and fellows. Some have affiliations with specific regions, e.g. University of Pittsburgh and programs in Spain, between Georgetown University and University of Valparaiso in Chile . The only publicized program is Children Hospital in Boston that charges significant amounts for a short term CAP observation. It was recognized that many programs have provided opportunities to foreign CAP scholars for research training based on their institutional relationship, scholarly collaboration or even personal relationship between leaders. Therefore, the commi ttee determined that AACAP's role is very limited in creating widely publicized information on such CAP programs. Annual Meeting Submissions : IRC is committed to bringing a global perspective into the submissions made for the annual meeting. This year, t he following submissions were made in collaboration with other AACAP committees. Treatment Resistance and Failures: A Closer Look at the Factors that Interfere and Enhance Treatment - Resilience; Examining the Mental Health Supports for LGBT Youth Across the Globe International Clinical Perspectives Submission : School -Based Resilience Building Interventions for Youth Exposed to Tr auma in Resource Poor Settings Political Violence and Religious Extremism: What can b e done to help children in need Addressing the Mental Health Needs of Youth Aff ected by Political Violence Disaster Events: How can CAPS respond across Diverse Communities and Disaster Response Systems?

The exam opened with registration on August 1st. This exam has been successful for the 4th year in a row, increasing the number of non- attendee/non -member s who purchase the exam, thereby increasing the revenue for this exam. This year 1,540 users completed the exam compared to 1,101 last year. An additional 115 users purchased the exam resulting in $12,900 in revenue, an increase from $8,400 last year. 10.

Submitted By: Sigita Plioplys MD and Pao MD Date: 11/07 /2016 1 November 6 , 2016 2016 Program Committee Report Boris Birmaher , MD, Program Chair James J. McGough , MD, Deputy Program Chair AACAP's 63rd Annual Meeting was held October 24- 29, 2016 at the New York Hilton Midtown and Sheraton New York Times Square in New York, NY. The following report includes the final numbers. Registration Registration history for the Annual Meeting is as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Chicago Honolulu New York Toronto San Francisco Orlando San Diego San Antonio New York 247 220 267 256 343 266 299 Total 3,847 3,372 5,356 3,703 4,411 3,676 3,958 3,646 5,430 Online registration for the Annual Meeting opened August 1 for Members Only for one week. This is the seventh year AACAP has offered this member benefit and 784 members registered during this period, compared to 706 in 2015 and 737 in 201 4. This continues to be a significant benefit as members had the first opportunity to register for ticketed events, which often sell out. Of the 784 members, 175 were Monitors; this members only registration period continues to be a great way to recruit monitors to sign up for the meeting. In the end, we had 379 total monitors, the most ever. 5,430 attendees registered for the meeting the largest meeting ever! Attendee make- up includes 2,922 members representing 34% of AACAP's total membership. It also includ es 931 international attendees from 62 different countries , which is more than double compared to 2015 and the second highest ever after the 2010 Annual Meeting. We attribute this to the attractiveness and ease of travel to New York from many international destinations. T he Conference Enrichment Package (session recordings synced with slides) was purchased by 425 registrants , the most ever and a significant source of additional revenue . In addition, sales of the audio recordings made about $45,000 in onsite sales and AACAP will receive 70% of that revenue. On October 19, the first online -only Annual Meeting supplement to the Journal of the American Academy of Chil d and Adolescent Psychiatry was released with a joint letter from Dr. Martin and Dr. Birmaher. P ublication of the proceedings in JAACAP provides unique benefits, ensuring that the Annual Meeting abstracts are archived and citable as scholarly journal content, and allowing for greater dissemination and discoverability. Like all JAACAP articles, each abstract receives a digital object ident ifier (DOI), a unique and persistent alphanumeric identification code that is guaranteed never to change and that can be used to cite and link to the content. The Annual Meeting abstracts continue to be available to meeting attendees as a printable PDF and via the AACAP App , and are now also available to AACAP members and JAACAP subscribers like any other JAACAP issue, via the Journal's website, mobile options, and other Elsevier portals, such as ScienceDirect and ClinicalKey. We are very proud of this new benefit to our Annual Meeting presenters and hope that it will encourage additional submissions in the future. Technology Resources AACAP App The Annual Meeting portion of AACAP's App was available on October 10. Annual Meeting where attendees were able to: Access the program schedule, abstracts, speakers listing, session room locations and maps, handouts, exhibit hall floor plan, and local tourism information; Create their own personal schedule for the meeting; 2 Complete individual session evaluations th at saves AACAP staff from having to manually enter session comments; For exhibitors, scan attendee badges to capture contact information; Communicate with each other without sharing personal contact information; Track sessions they attend for CME credit; Receive messages from AACAP about updates from the meeting or changes to the schedule. As of November 6, 2,271 attendees used the AACAP app to navigate the Annual Meeting (44%). In 2014, 2,455 (68%) attendees downloaded the app, with the vast majority usi ng an A pple device . In 2015, 38% of attendees logged into the app. We were hoping a larger percentage of attendees would have used the app, but were happy to see an increase since 2015. We will carefully look at the feedback from the evaluations about the App to make improvements for 2017. Itinerary Builder Attendees have access to an online customized Itinerary Builder that allows them to create their own personalized Annual Meeting schedule with proceedings abstracts and speaker handouts. All of this information is printable and downloadable to O utlook calendars or PDAs and allows people to print only the information they specifically need. Itinerary Builder launch ed October 10 . Usage of Itinerary Builder has been declining as more people move to the App and we will continue to evaluate the utility of this tool. Only 108 people logged in. It is likely that we will discontinue this service. Speaker Handouts and Online New Research Posters A major benefit of the Itinerary Builder and the App is the ability for speakers to upload their slides and handouts; attendees can access them before, during, and after the meeting. The Program Committee recognizes the value of these materials and has send multiple emails to presenters encouraging them to upload materials. The App has been enhanced to make it easier for attendees to download these handouts to various devices. I n addition to speaker handouts, New Research Poster presenters are encouraged to upload electronic versions of their posters to AACAP's website for members and attendees to access after the Annual Meeting. Presenters could start upload ing handouts on Septe mber 15 and can continue to upload handouts and posters until November 14. W e see the largest percentage of uploads just before and during the meeting. As of November 6, 284 out of 469 posters have been uploaded (61%) and 132 sessions out of 262 sessions have uploaded handouts (50%). This compares to 57% and 48%, respectively, in 2015, so we are happy to see a small improvement. Evaluation Forms After the Meeting , attendees will be emailed a link to the General Evaluation Form and once completed, will be able to print or download their CME certificate. Response rates have been high in the past and we expect them to be high again this year. In addition, we're increasing our efforts to encourage attendees to complete the session evaluation forms via the App. O ur goal is typically to get over 50% of attendees to complete the general evaluation form . 419 individuals used the App to complete session evaluations, which is higher than the last two years and we are pleased with this number. Conference Enrichment Package and Session Recordings Again , this year we offer ed the Conference Enrichment Package, which is audio recordings synced with slides of Clinical Perspectives, Honors Presentations, Symposia, and Other Programs. In addition, when people purchase the package before the meeting, they also receive one free Institute recording and are entered into a drawing to win a complimentary registration to the 201 7 Annual Meeting. AACAP receives a royalty from all sales, so this is substantially more income. For the fourth year, the Program Co mmittee is planning to offer 2 sessions on psychopharmacology for free after the meeting to encourage members to u tilize these valuable resources. We will try some different marketing tactics to try to increase usage of these free programs. International Attendance There were 931 international attendees from 62 countries registered this year. This is comparable to the number of international attendees that we had in 2012 in San Francisco and a very positive sign of diversity for this meeting. There was a marked increase in the number of international Call for Papers submissions this year, as we ll. The International 3 Relations Committee will sponsor 8 programs during the meeting in addition to the International Reception on Tuesday night. The meeting ha s 258 international speakers , over 100 more than in 2015, making it a truly global event. The following countries have 10 or more representatives at the Annual Meeting: Country # of attendees Canada 177 Australia 82 Sweden 70 Brazil 63 Spain 61 United Kingdom 45 Netherlands 43 Mexico 35 Korea, Republic of 33 Finland 29 Switzerland 21 Austria 20 Turkey 18 Israel 17 Iceland 16 Ireland 15 New Zealand 13 Germany 12 Norway 12 France 11 Japan 10 Programming While reviewing hundreds of submissions, the Program Committee strived to keep an optimal balance in program selection to serve the multiple needs of the membership. We are always working to improve the quality of the program and assist members with improving their submissions. After the Committee's review, the Annual Meeting program consists of 13 Clinical Case Conferences, 18 Clinic al Consultation Breakfasts, 52 Clinical Perspectives, 8 Institutes, 15 Media Theatre, 469 New Research Posters, 1 4 Special Interest Study Groups, 53 Symposia, and 46 Workshops. This compares to previous years, as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Chicago Honolulu New York Toronto San Francisco Orlando San Diego San Antonio New York Clinical Case Conferences 8 10 10 12 12 11 14 14 13 Clinical Consultation Breakfasts 13 15 15 18 18 18 18 18 18 Clinical Perspectives 20 16 33 29 38 43 56 65 52 Institutes 8 8 9 8 8 9 9 9 8 Media Theatre 8 11 12 13 13 14 13 15 15 New Research Posters 350 331 411 340 334 307 284 311 469 Special Interest Study Groups 12 10 12 14 15 13 17 16 14 Symposia 40 47 55 50 50 39 46 40 53 Workshops 37 36 42 40 48 48 43 48 46 4 With the high number of submissions for both Call for Papers deadlines, the Program Committee had to make very difficult decisions this year and far more submissions were rejected. On the positive side, the Committee also noticed a marked increase in the q uality of the submissions, particularly the New Research Posters and Symposia. Under the leadership of Timothy E. Wilens, MD, Chair of the New Research Subcommittee of the Program Committee, the committee reviewed a total of 511 New Research Poster submissions that were received for the June deadline of the online Call for Papers. Call for Papers submission totals compares to previous years as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Submission Deadline Chicago Honolulu New York Toronto San Francisco Orlando San Diego San Antonio New York February 15 302 326 437 350 401 361 360 395 575 June 15 320 321 433 379 386 307 290 284 511 Total 622 647 870 729 787 668 650 679 1,086 The New Research Poster Subcommittee accepted a total of 469 New Research Posters between the two deadlines, which will be presented during six New Research Poster Sessions. The New Research Posters were posted on the online program schedule in early Augus t. Saturday's session will be an extra- large session to accommodate as many posters as possible. Under the leadership of Barbara J. Coffey, MD, MS , the Institutes continue to serve a major educational role at the Annual Meeting. Institute ticket sales history is as follows: Year 2008 Chicago 2009 Honolulu 2010 New York 2011 Toronto 2012 San Francisco 2013 Orlando 2014 San Diego 2015 San Antonio 2016 New York as of 10/1/16 Total Institute Tickets Sold 1,795 1,653 2,093 1,740 2,002 1,692 1,728 1,730 2,183 These programs generate significant revenue for the Annual Meeting and the Meetings Department will continue to allocate large rooms for the Institutes to maximize the number of people able to enroll in the courses. This is the highest number of Institute tickets ever sold and included two sold out Institutes. Registration totals for each Institute are as follows (Institutes 4 and 7 did sell out onsite ): Title Registration 1 Psychopharmacology Update: Focus on Refractory Cases and Longer Term Outcomes Timothy E.

Dr. Fritz's Task Force will specifically be reviewing evaluations from these programs. The Annual Meeting had a focus on \"wellness\" this year, both for patients and Annual Meeting attendees. Special activities include d: yoga each morning and meditation each afternoon, a walk, run, and bike in Central Park, some \"kick -off\" activities for Break the Cycle, healthier food options at various events, and scientific programming about wellness and prevention. These were very po pular events and in particular, the meditation was over full each day. The Program Committee would like to continue these activities in 2017. The Committee on Community -Based Systems of Care presented its Special Program on Monday, October 24 entitled Mee ting the Needs of Children and Youth With Complex Behavioral Health Problems in an Integrated Healthcare World. The Local Arrangements Committee sponsored two Clinical Practica, entitled Integrating Mental Health, Substance Use, and Educational Services in High Risk Adolescents , on Tuesday, October 25 at Mount Sinai and Intensive Outpatient Care: Decreasing Risk and Promoting Rapid Recovery on Thursday, October 27 at the Child Mind Institute.

H e'll remind them to disclose verbally at the beginning of their presentation as well as in their slides. The email also remind s presenters of the rule that presenters must disclose if they are receiving any honoraria to present at this meeting and/or if travel is covered. AACAP's official guidelines for disclosure as well as a sample PowerPoint slide, also available on the AACAP website, will be distributed with the email. Once the evaluation results have been compiled, the Program Committee and CME Committee will review the list of speakers who did not disclose and will remind them of AACAP's disclosure policies for the future. Ongoing Challenges and New Ideas Some other topics and ideas that the committee is working on for 201 7 include: Presenting the Honors Presentations as short 20 minute \"TED -Like\" talk s to hopefully increase attendance. This proposal is being reviewed by the Gifts and Endowments Committee. Commissioning a forum on gun violence with children including expert researchers in the field. Day-Long Extended Workshop s to provide a forum for more thorough training on various therapies. Improveme nt of the review process for Institute Notebooks. Continuation of the Wellness Programming if it is successful in 2016. Programming at various museums in Washington, DC. Programming at the National Institutes of Health. Continuation of our evaluation of the ways we use the recorded sessions. Conference calls with all Committee Chairs to gather feedback. New entertainment for the Welcome Reception. Inviting speakers to present on social psychology topics. 2016 is the tenth year that the Program Commi ttee has issued Travel Scholarships to select speakers at the Annual Meeting. This year, only the senior researcher scholarship will be offered, but the Program Committee received approval for more funds to support these speakers, compared to 2015. A senior researcher is defined as a non -child psychiatrist doing seminal scientific research in areas related to the mission of AACAP. The following criteria were used to select the awardees: Whether the person's attendance will generally enhance the meeting or AACAP; Whether the person lacks sufficient financial resources to attend; Whether they are an expert in their field or have recently published/done very important ground breaking work in the area, or they are an individual affected by a priority illness and can greatly facilitate members' understanding of the lived experience of the disorder; Whether they are addressing an area that is a priority for AACAP members (usually a disease or treatment area) or a scientific area that is likely to be critical to advancing diagno sis, prevention, or treatment of childhood psychiatric illnesses; 7 Whether they have had prior AACAP scholarship support; The distance from the Annual Meeting location. The committee received 69 requests for Senior Scholar Awards and selected the following 15 recipients. The recipients have been very grateful for this funding and their participation greatly improves the overall diversity of the Annual Meeting Program. The Program Committee is grateful to Council for providing these funds.

Future Annual Meetings Contracts for 2022 and 2023 are expected to be signed in 2017 . AACAP's future Annual Meeting schedule is as follows: 64 th Annual Meeting October 23 -28, 2017, Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and Omni Shoreham, Washington, DC 65th Annual Meeting October 22 -27, 2018, Washington State Convention Center and Sheraton Seattle, Seattle, WA 66th Annual Meeting October 14 -19, 2019, Hyatt Regency Chicago, Chicago, IL 67th Annual Meeting October 19 -24, 2020, Hilton San Francisco Union Square and Hotel Nikko San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 68th Annual Meeting October 25 -30, 2021, Hyatt Regency Atlanta and Atlanta Marriott Marquis, Atlanta, GA 2016 Psychopharmacology Update Institute Melissa P. DelBello, MD, MS and Laurence L. Greenhill, MD, co -chaired the 2016 Pediatric Psychopharmacology Update Institute in New York, NY. The Institute was entitled Translating Evidence -Based Studies Into Clinical Practice and was held January 29 -30, 2 016 at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel. Institute speakers include Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD, Harold E. Carlson, MD, Laurence L. Greenhill, MD, Jess P. Shatkin, MD, MPH, Jeffrey R. Strawn, MD, Jeremy M. 9 Veenstra -VanderWeele, MD, Karen Dineen Wagner , MD, PhD, John T. Walkup, MD, and Timothy E. Wilens, MD. Registration for this meeting opened in September 2015 and brochures were mailed to AACAP members and nonmembers shortly thereafter. Registration history for the Pediatric Psychopharmacology Upd ate Institute for the last 5 years is as follows: Year Location Chair(s) Registration 2016 New York, NY Melissa P. DelBello, MD, MS and Laurence L. Greenhill, MD 824 2015 Brooklyn, NY Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD and Laurence L. Greenhill, MD 856 2014 New York, NY Jean A. Frazier, MD and Laurence L. Greenhill, MD 742 2013 Washington, DC Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD 595 2012 New York, NY Barbara J. Coffey, MD, MS and Laurence L. Greenhill, MD 621 This year's Institute was the second largest to date and filled to capacity. This Institute continues to grow each year and earns significant income for AACAP; registration revenue was almost $40,000 better than the budget. Key findings from the evaluatio n results include: 98.1% of attendees indicated that no commercial support influenced the content of the meeting. Of the 1.9% who said there was influence, 8 people indicated it was the speaker's discussion of treatment that influenced the content. This rating compares to 96.8% last year. This has been one of the highest rated items of previous Institutes. It continues our trend of having a strong focus on conflict of interest and disclosure issues. The top three reasons for attendance at the Institute are CME, topics/content, and a general review. These reasons have been consistent in the past 6 years. With CME and the content high on the list, it is evident that education is still the driving force for attendance. There were 76 nurse practitioners (NPs) in attendance this year. This compares to: o 122 NPs in 2015 o 44 NPs in 2014 o 32 NPs 2013 o 63 NPs in 2012 o 5 NPs in 2011 In addition, 87 general psychiatrists attended this year, compared to: o 73 in 2015 o 77 in 2014 o 59 in 2013 o 21 in 2012 o 17 in 2011 We will continue to monitor attendance/interest from these demographics and will make appropriate decisions regarding future marketing. As we have seen in the past, the speaker ratings are good, with the lowest average score being 4.19 out of 5.0 (1=poor, 5=excellent) and the highest being 4.89. We will continue to emphasize the high quality of speakers on this Institute in promotional efforts. The top 10 requested topics that should be offered at future Institutes include: 1. Clinical psychopharmacology 10.0% 2. Autistic disorder/PDD 7.3% 3. Gender identity disorder 4.1% 4. Pharmacology 4.1% 5. Anxiety disorders 3.5% 6. Cognitive behavioral therapy 3.0% 7. Disruptive behavior disorders 3.0% 8. Eating disorders 3.0% 10 9. Mood disorders 3.0% 10. Personality disorders and traits 2.7% Clinical psychopharmacology has remained the highest requested topic for the past four years. It is interesting to note that gender identity disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders and traits are new topics ma king their way into the top ten this year. Substance use disorders and ADHD are not in the top ten, as they have been for several years. In the general evaluation, this year's Institute was rated the highest in all categories compared to the psychopharmaco logy Institutes from the last three years. In general, the presentations were well received. Several comments stated that attendees would like to have more clinically relevant information, more examples including case studies, discussion about complicate d cases, and covering more topics with less basic review and more advances. We will continue to encourage speakers to focus on the clinical relevance of their topic. A sampling of Institute questions written by the presenters are provided to attendees to complete. The purpose of the Institute questions is to aid AACAP in evaluating its CME program and how well the material presented is understood. The average score on the test was 82%, indicating that presenters conveyed their key points and attendees un derstood the topics discussed. The impact on patient care is an important aspect of CME. We asked how information from the Institute will change one's practice and provided a drop -down menu of choices that indicate a hierarchal response as follows: o 43.8% Acquired new knowledge, skills, and techniques. o 36.7% Enhanced clinical decision making. o 11.0% Improved potential clinical outcomes for my patients. o 8.4% The meeting confirmed what I already know and currently practice o 0.2% N/A An open -ended follow -up question to this was to state anticipated changes to one's practice. The responses are varied, but it confirms that the Institute will change the way child and adolescent psychiatrists provide patient care. 2017 Pediatric Psychopharmacology Update Institute Chaired by Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD and Manpreet Kaur Singh, MD, MS The 2017 Institute in San Francisco is entitled, Psychopharmacology Treatments From Childhood Through Transitional Age, and will be held January 20 -21, 2017 at the Westin St. Francis San Francisco on Union Square. In addition to the chairs, confirmed speakers include: Boris Birmaher, MD , Kiki D. Chang, MD, Antonio Hardan, MD, James Lock, MD, MPH, Devanand Manoli, MD, PhD, and James J. McGough, MD. Registr ation opened and brochures were mailed to AACAP members and nonmembe rs in September. As of November 6 , 215 people have registered for the meeting, about the same as what we had at this point for the 2016 meeting, but we don't have as big of a room, so we a nticipate another sold out meeting. 2016 Douglas B. Hansen, MD Annual Review Course Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD and James J. McGough, MD, were the co -chairs of the Douglas B. Hansen, MD Annual Review Course in Long Beach, CA. The Hansen Review Course was held March 12 -14, 2016 at the Hilton Long Beach. In addition to the co -chairs, speakers include Eraka Bath, MD, Michael Enenbach, MD, Robert L. Hendren, DO, Shafali S. Jeste, MD, Bennett L. Leventhal, MD, Kathleen McKenna, MD, Derek Ott, MD, Bradley S. Peterson, MD, Vernon A. Rosario, MD, PhD, and John T. Walkup, MD. Registration opened on December 1, 2015 and two brochure mai lings were sent. The Course featured two lunchtime roundtables, one focusing on Board Review and the other on Maintenance of Certific ation. Registration history for the Hansen Review Course for the last 5 years is as follows: Year Location Chair(s) Registration 2016 Long Beach, CA Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD and James J.

Galanter, MD and Moira Rynn, MD 226 11 2012 Pittsburgh, PA Boris Birmaher, MD 152 Though registration was a little lower this year, it's still fairly close to the last three years and due to the significantly less expensive hotel costs, the meeting will be profitable. Key findings from the evaluation results include: 98.2% of attende es indicated that no commercial support influenced the content of the meeting. Of the 1.8% who said there was influence, 2 people indicated it was the speaker's discussion of treatment that influenced the content. This rating is comparable to previous ye ars, and has been one of the highest rated items of previous Institutes. It continues our trend of having a strong focus on conflict of interest and disclosure issues. The top three reasons for attendance at the Institute are CME and general review (tied) , prepare for recertification, and topics/content. While CME and general review are the same top reasons as last year, recertification and topics/content are rated higher this year. 61.8% are first time attendees, which is down from 70.1% in 2015 and 7 6% in 2014. It is interesting to note that this course has seen more repeat attendees over the last 3 years. 35% of attendees have been in practice for over 20 years. This compares to 39% last year and 28% in 2014. The second highest percentage of attend ees is those in practice for 11 -15 years, which is a shift from last 2 years which showed 0 -5 years at 18.7% and 21.2% respectively. We have seen an increase in the mid to late career psychiatrists attending this course for the overall review it offers. We also continue to have a challenge in balancing the expectations of both the early and late career psychiatrists who are attracted to the course. 36.5% of attendees plan to take the board certification exam. This compares to 34.2% in 2015, 43.2% in 201 4, and 56% in 2013. While this is just slightly higher than last year, it is interesting to note the general decline in people planning to take the board certification exam. This may correlate to the revised focus and marketing of the Annual Review Cours e as not a focus on board -preparation. We continue to see a few comments about aligning the course to board -prep, and it illuminates the need for additional marketing for an overall review, not a board -specific course. As we have seen in the past, the spe aker ratings are good, with the lowest average score being 3.85 out of 5.0 (1=poor, 5=excellent) and the highest being 4.84. We will continue to emphasize the high quality of speakers of this course in promotional efforts. The top 2 presenters are Eraka Bath, MD with 4.84 and John T. Walkup, MD with 4.80. The impact on patient care is an important aspect of CME. We asked how information from the course will change one's practice and provided a drop -down menu of choices that indicate a hierarchal response as follows: o Acquired new knowledge and skills 46.5% o Enhanced clinical decision making 32.9% o Improved potential clinical outcomes for my patients 7.6% o The meeting confirmed what I already know and currently practice 11.8% o N/A 1.2% An open -ended follow -up question to this was to state anticipated changes to one's practice. The responses are varied, but it confirms that the course will change the way child and adolescent psychiatrists provide patient care. In general, the presentations were well received. General comments about the Neurology presentation indicated it is a much -needed topic and to continue to include it. Several comments stated that attendees would like to have more clinically relevant information, more examples includ ing case studies, discussion about complicated cases, and covering more topics with less basic review and more advances. We will continue to encourage speakers to focus on the clinical relevance of their topic. A sampling of Institute questions written by the presenters are provided to attendees to complete. The purpose of the Institute questions is to aid AACAP in evaluating its CME program and how well the material presented is understood. The average score on the test was 84.9%, indicating that presen ters conveyed their key points and attendees understood the topics discussed. Responses of how the course can be improved addressed increasing the time allotted for specific topics. In addition, there were several comments about having a better distribution of topics for the ABPN board exams. While the course is not geared toward board -prep, we will look at the distribution of topics addressed at future courses. This is the 2 nd year where the format consisted of 2.5 days and a blend of \"marathon\" presentations, nationally - known speakers mixed with local speakers worked well. It seemed to work well, and for 2017, we will look at 12 keeping relatively the same number of topics, look ing closely at the requested topics from this year. 2017 Douglas B. Hansen, MD, Annual Review Course in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Chaired by Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD and Mary Margaret Gleason, MD The 2017 Hansen Annual Review Course will be held March 18 -20, 2017 at the Royal Sonesta New Orleans. The chairs are in the process of confirming local speakers, but will include the same expert speakers giving longer talks as last year: Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD, Bennett L. Leventhal, MD, James J. McGough , MD, and John T. Walkup, MD. Registration is expected to open in early December . 60 th AEPNyA Congress in Donostia / San Sebastian (Spain) AEPNyA's 60th Congress, June 1 -4, 2016 in Donostia / San Sebastian, Spain was a shared initiative with AACAP. The President of the meeting was Joaquin Fuentes, MD and Vice President was Bennett L. Leventhal, MD . AACAP accredited the meeting for CME and assisted in marketing the meeting. Members of AACAP's Program Committee sat on the Program Committee for this Congress for oversight. The Congress had 155 attendees from the US. The total attendance breakdown was as follows: 637 total people registered for the Congress. They are classified as: From Spain: 349 (103 identified as AEPNYA members) From the USA: 155 (102 identified as AACAP members) From the European Union countries (excluding Spain): 78 From other countries: 55 (13 identified as AACAP members) Below are some points of interest from the evaluations: 100% of attendees indicated that no commercial support influenced the content of the meeting. This has been one of the highest rated items of AACAP meetings. It continues our trend of having a strong focus on conflict of inte rest and disclosure issues. The top three reasons for attendance at the Congress are location, learn about current topics in child and adolescent psychiatry, and discuss professional topics with colleagues. CME was fourth, whereas it has typically been in the top three reasons for previous AACAP meetings. 83.8% were first time attendees, which is positive for the first shared meeting of AEPNYA and AACAP. The top 10 requested topics that should be offered at future meetings include: 1. Post -traumatic stre ss disorder (PTSD)/dissociative disorders 9.1% 2. Clinical psychopharmacology 8.1% 3. Biological Science 4. Genetics 5.1% 5. Prevention 5.1% 6. Abuse/neglect 3.0% 7. Anxiety disorders (PDDs) 3.0% 9. Comorbidity 10. Diagnostics 3.0% In previous AACAP meetings, clinical psychopharmacology has been the highest requested topic for the past several years. It is interesting to note that these top requested topics vary fro m what we see at meetings based in the United States.

Statu s of projects and deliverables: 1. Annual meeting education efforts - Our committee sponsored 7 submission proposals , with 2 accepted for the meeting in New York in October 2016. The Clinical Consultation Breakfast was well - attended; this event being held for the 18th consecutive year. It was co -led by Mary Lynn Dell, MD, DMin, Margaret Stuber, MD, and Lisa Fortuna, MD, MDiv. Dr. Richard Camino Gaztambide presided at a media theater event , co -sponsored by the Culture and Diversity Com mittee, \"Kinyarwanda: Stories of Trauma, Forgiveness, and Hope\". Several submissions that members believed to be of good quality were declined for the 2016 due to the overall number of submissions the program committee received, which all members of the religion and spirituality committee present at the 2016 committee meeting understood and respected. The committee discussed that this presents us with the opportunity to resubmit some of those proposals with improved quality, in addition to proposals with newer, more contemporary focuses. 2. Religion and spirituality web page - incoming committee member Dr. Lisa Fortuna has agreed to serve as the leader of our effort to accomplish this endeavor. She will be in touch with AACAP webmaster and Dr. Michael Houston to coordinate our committee's efforts with the form and goals set by the AACAP. 3. Our committee has discussed the possibility of authoring practice parameters or guidelines on religion and spirituality in clinical practice. This process is being revi ewed by AACAP at large. When the new process/standards are released to the AACAP committees and membership, our committee will discuss how we will proceed with this endeavor. 4. Case collection for teaching purposes - Dr. Dell has assembled several cases so far. This project was discussed again at the annual meeting. The decision was made to remind committee members again of the project in various email communications, but at this point in time completing the webpage will take priority. 5. Continuing to establis h working relationships with APA Caucus on Religion and Spirituality and other groups within mental health disciplines working on the interface of medicine, mental health and religion/spirituality. Drs. Dell and Camino distribute all announcements they rec eive about academic programs, meetings, submission, and collaboration opportunities to committee members and a larger list serve of individuals who are interested in this area. Subcommittees wi thin Committee (if applicable): NA Are you collaborating with other AACAP committees? If so, how?: Collaborations continue, primarily in the form of joint presentations at the annual meeting. Current collaborations include Culture and Diversity, Native American. In addition, Dr. Camino is active participant on the Hispanic Caucus. Our ongoing collaboration with the Culture and Diversity committee is a natural fit and relatively strong, with both Drs. Camino and Dell collaborating on numerous AACAP annual meeting presentations with that committee's members over the years. At our October 2016 committee meeting in New York, we discussed revisiting and strengthening p ast collaborations with other AACAP components according to the interests of our committee members. These have included: Family, Ethics, Substance Use, Sexual identity and Gender Concerns, and Native American. We also discussed the value of establishing a collaborative relationship with the Systems of Care group. How many face -to-face meetings have you had in Current Year? When? Our annual face-to-face meeting was at the 2016 annual meeting in New York , with the next face -to-face committee meeting scheduled for the 2017 annual meeting in Washington, DC . How many conference calls have you had in Current Year? When? One conference call was held on January 11, 2016 - a 90-minute call for annual meeting submissions planning. This call was preceded and followed by numerous email collaborations and phone calls at members' initiative and e xpense to ensure that the AACAP -sponsored conference call was as productive and efficient as possible.

The availability of all awards is contingent upon adequate funding. Statu s of projects and deliverables: Research Awards and Funding Update Since 1993, we have awarded over 2 million in research award funding. Most of this money was originally funded from Lilly, but these funds have significantly decreased. Today, the majority of the money funding the awards is coming from internal AACAP funds , including Campaign for America's Kids. Pilot Award The Pilot Award offers $15,000 in research funding for each awardee to encourage interest in beginning a career in child and adolescent mental health research, and potentially even continuing a career i n academic medicine. As part of the award requirements, recipients can submit a poster presentation on their research for the AACAP's 64th Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, October 23- 28, 2017. The award also includes additional travel reimbursement up to $2,000 for the cost of attending the AACAP Annual Meeting for five days. This year, AACAP was approved to fund a total of 10 awards (totali ng $170,000 in funding). We received 61 submissions, and 41 completed applications, making this year the most competi tive application cycle we have had. - AACAP's Pilot Award Selection Committee consists of 4 reviewers: o Daniel Dickstein (Brown University) o Manpreet Singh (Stanford University) o Bonnie Zima (UCLA) o Moira Rynn (Columbia) o 2016 Pilot Awards recipients from the Elaine Schlosser Lewis Fund for ADHD or Learning Disabilities (7 applications received - 2 awarded) Naser Ahmadi, MD Trial of Positive Psychiatry in Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder with Posttraumatic Stress Diso rder Ryan Sultan, MD Trial of Positive Psychiatry in Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 2016 Pilot Research Award for CAP residents and Junior Faculty supported by CFAK and the Endowment (23 applications r eceived - 5 awarded) : Danielle Baribeau, MD Biological Correlates of Social Processing Across Childhood- onset Neurodevelopmental Disorders Anthony Deo, MD, BDNF and cognition in individuals at clinical high- risk for psychosis Kelli C.

The Committee is pleased that funding has been secured for a new Junior Investigator Award recipient in 2017. Potential Research Funding AACAP is continuing to consider potential research funding sources to attract new child and adolescent research opportunities such as NIH and private foundations . The Committee would like to create significant opportunities to network for awardees. Annual Meeting Events Planning has begun for AACAP's 63rd Annual Meeting, October 24- 29, 2016 in New York, NY. Committee meetings will be held Tuesday, October 25- Friday, October 28 during the week of the Annual Meeting. The team is expecting approximately 18 people. This fluctuates based on the number of committee members and guests and research award recipients. We budgeted for 18 people in New York. The committee meeting is expected to last 2 hours, from 7:00 to 9:00 pm . The event is a closed by invitation only meeting . The committee has expressed interest in setting up an exhibit booth and agree with the responsibility to have two committee members representing the committing and manning the booth during their allotted appointmen t time. The committee's submission for the Research Institute was approved for AACAP's 63 rd Annual Meeting on 05/12/2016. The Research Institute's Learning Objectives include d: Understand, at a basic and clinically meaningful level, the basic epigenetic mechanisms that connect environmental experience with changes in child outcomes. Learn how other physician- scientists and clinical researchers have integrated epigenetic approaches to understand the connections between environmental risk and child outcomes .

Faran, MD M 10/26/2014 10/30/2016 CHARGE: Schools Committee Charge Approved by AACAP Council June 2015 Preamble CAPs are providing increasingly more consultation to non- specialty mental health sectors of care. The school setting provides CAPs an opportunity to support students across the broad age range of children and adolescents and to support the level of service s needed from prevention and early intervention services to treatment of severe psychiatric illnesses. In the context of a public mental health framework within the education system, CAPs can provide leadership and work along -side other school mental healt h providers and educators to improve access to mental health services through consultation, expanded detection, and early treatment of psychiatric disorders on school campuses. The AACAP has established the Schools Committee to provide expertise in facilit ating and supporting collaborations with educational settings. Charge The charge of the Schools Committee is the following: 1. The committee will address the psychiatric needs of children in the schools, will advocate for needed school based services, and will provide consultation to educators and other school personnel to improve understanding of the mental health needs of students. 2. By improving access to mental health services on campuses, CAPs will provide mental health awareness to and reduce mental hea lth stigma in the school community. 3. The committee will help define roles of CAPs as consultants to the schools (consulting with students and classrooms, school systems, as a provider in school - based clinics), and as a contributor to a comprehensive, coordinated school health program. 4. The committee will foster training for CAPs to fulfill roles in schools, by making this information available through articles and reviews published in the AACAP Journal and AACAP News , on the AACAP website , and through presentations at the AACAP Annual Meeting. 5. Since most schools involve other professionals in addition to CAPs, the committee will address the complex issues that arise when psychiatrists collaborate as part of a multidisciplinary school- based team (e.g. confidentiality, HIPAA/FERPA, billing, competing goals). 6. The committee will disseminate information regarding how CAPS can support schools in preparation for and following school crises and violence and trauma in the school setting (such as bull ying, threats), and in the child and adolescent's environment (community and domestic violence, abuse, disasters). 7. The committee will nominate at least 3 individuals each year for the Sydney Berman award and will administer the selection process. 8. In the process of addressing these components of the charge to the committee, the committee will interface with the AAP Council on School Health (COSH), the Center for School Mental Health, American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AAD PRT), National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), and other components and structures within AACAP (Assembly, Disasters, Training and Education, Systems of Care, etc.) and other youth- serving agencies. Statu s of projects and deliverables: 1. Practice Parameter for School Consultation: We have nearly completed a draft of the Practice Parameters and will be submitting this draft to the CQI Committee. 2. Task Force on School Violence: Dr. Brad Stein is the official liaison to this Task Force. He reported that the task force is developing resources for AACAP members on such topics as threat assessment in schools. The Schools Committee will continue to collaborate with the TF on development of tools and materials for members. 3. Berman Award Selection Committee: The Berman Award was presented to Dr. Shashank Joshi for his exemplary work in schools, especially in the area of suicide prevention amongst a culturally diverse student body. We have a subcommittee who will now solicit nominations to be review ed for the 2017 award. 4. AAP COSH (Committee on School Health) Liaison: Sheryl Kataoka is serving as the AACAP liaison to COSH . She and Dr. Shashank Joshi attended the AAP National M eeting and presented at the COSH H- Session on school mental health, which w as well -attended. Dr. Kataoka i s also collaborating with COSH on resources for general pediatricians on school mental health, which will be made available on the AAP website. She is also collaborating with them on COSH policy statements, including one on s chool attendance and health and another on suspensions, both of which have important mental health components. 5. AACAP Annual Meeting: The Schools Committee sponsored several symposia, workshops, or clinical perspectives on school topics for the 2016 Annua l Meeting. We also participated in the AACAP Systems of Care Special Program, \"Meeting the Needs of Children and Youth with Complex Behavioral Health Problems in an Integrated Healthcare World\" by discussing integrated care in the context of schools . 6. AACAP News submissions this past year included an article by Kristie Ladegard and Meg Benningfield on Substance Abuse Prevention in School Settings and one by our MIT member Aileen Lorenzo on Bullying. We discussed several ideas for new submissions for thi s coming year, including one on Trauma- Informed Schools. Subcommittees wi thin Committee (if applicable): 1. Berman Selection Committee. 2.

VII. New Policy Statement on Conversion Therapy: A t the annual meeting in NY, we identified a new area in need for a policy statement - related to defining conversion therapy across development so that AACAP can outline its stance based on the existing evidence and literature. VIII. Outreach: Our committee had a lengthy discussion at the NY annual meeting related to being in contact with other professional organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics. Several documents have been published by the AAPincluding those with mental health content and policy - and we believe that a child and adolescent psychiatry voice would enhance the quality of how the delicate issues of gender identity are addressed in youth. We are aiming to reach out and make more meaningful connections with organizations like the AAP (through the help of AACAP's leadership) and the ACLU. 3 Subcommittees within Committee (if applicable): 1.

The goals of this committee will include: 1. To support women CAPs throughout their careers by providing various settings for networking and communication about common concerns, such as transitioning through stages of career development while maintaining work -life balance. For example, participating Annual Meeting and Regional Organization events. 2. To promote recruitment, retention, and mentorship of women medical students, resident members in training, and early career psychiatrists. Opportunities for mentorship will reflect the diversity of career paths pursued by women in chil d and adolescent psychiatry. 3. To promote increased participation of women child and adolescent psychiatrists in AACAP, including activities that support recruitment to committee membership, leadership development, and mentorship. 4. To make policy and procedure recommendations that support the identification of women who are making an impact on the field of child and adolescent psychiatry; by either being involved in the field or being leaders in the field. 5. To work in collaboration with other AACA P committees and components to identify and promote opportunities for women child and adolescent psychiatrists to become involved in AACAP activities, to further advance the field, or for leadership development opportunities. 6. To liaison with similarly focused organizations and committees outside of AACAP, such as the American Psychiatric Association Office of Women's Issues and Career Development and the Association of Women in Psychiatry, to share resources and identify opportunities for collaboration to meet the needs of women in psychiatry. 7. To support the Virginia Q. Anthony Outstanding Woman Leader Award through writing an article for AACAP News every year on the recipient. Statu s of projects and deliverables: We submitted three proposals for the 2016 Annual Meeting. Two were accepted, including a work shop on \"Contract Negotiations: Specific Concerns for Women Psychiatrists Throughout Their Careers\" and a media theatre called \"Ponette: A Preschool Child's Grief .\" Both were very well attended with strong audience participation. We are in the process of working with the IT Department and the Web Editorial Board to develop a web- based toolkit for Women CAPs, including topics such as Work- Life Integration, Contra ct Negotiations, Developing a Competitive CV, and Mentorship. We have appreciated the help of the Early Career Psychiatrist Committee in this regard in terms of format ideas and some resources to include. We are currently looking toward cost - effective ways to include videos of our members presenting some of the material in a more accessible way than with a lot of text. We have received a quote of $2200 for professional assistance with the videos and submitted a budget request of $2000 to the Executive Commi ttee for this. We are hopeful that this will be approved as we plan to allow our website to be public and feel this would be a great marketing and recruitment tool for the Academy, and feel that professional assistance will be more effective in this regard . AACAP News Articles: An article on Contract Negotiations was published as well as the Virginia Q Anthony Leadership Award article on Gabrielle Carlosn. We are currently in the process of drafting one on Work/Life Integration and are hoping to follow wi th an article on Issues Related to bein g a Pregnant Child Psychiatrist as well as Gender Bias within Career and Intersectionality. We are in the process of reaching out to other Committees to identify opportunities for collaboration and active liaison b etween committees. We identified several committees and caucuses that we would like to target. We have also developed a sub -committee to improve our networking with other organizations with similar goals and have liaisons to the Association of Women Psychi atrists and the American Psychiatric Association. We also discussed building relationships with the American Medical Women's Association, the World Psychiatric Association, and the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Pr ofessions. The committee remains interested and committed to developing a Forum for Communication among Women Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists. We have asked the Web Committee for ideas regarding possibilities for a forum off of the AACAP website. It was suggested that we utilized a listserv, but the committee continues to be interested in exploring other options. A new idea is to collect questions and choose which one is most appropriate and post our responses on the website so that the info provided there could be officially approved by AACAP. We are in the process of developing submissions for next year's annual meeting in Washington D.C. Since the program committee is proposing daylong workshops, we are exploring cooperating with the MIT and ECP committees to develop a day long workshop including skills to be utilized in contract negotiations as well as leadership skills targeted for women psychiatrists. We also discussed separate presentations on Work/Life Integration and Leadership as well as the idea of a presentation on implicit bias. We have also begun discussion with joint submissions for the Committee on Diversity and Culture. We are also interested in submitting another media theatre since this year's was so well attended. Finally, the committee members are highly interested in expanding the committee charge to include issues related to female development across the lifespan, extending beyond women child and adolescent psychiatrists. We are in the process of drafting points to be added to our charge and once, our committee is comfortable with the wording, we will submit to the Executive Committee for approval. Subcommittees wi thin Committee (if applicable): Creating a Forum for Communication Relationships with Organized Psychiatry AACAP News Articles Are you collaborating with other AACAP committees? If so, how?: We have collaborat ed with the ECP Committee to develop a contract negotations workshop and have used their support for our website.

We collaborated with several committees (Adolescent, Diversity and Culture, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Issue Committee ) to develop a third submission on Cultural Development in Girls, which was not accepted this year. Recently, the Diversity and Culture Committee has reached out to us to collaborate around advocacy for girls who have undergone female genital mutilation. We plan to continue to collaborate with the ECP committee as well as the MIT committee to develop a workshop on contract negotiations and leadership for women as these topics are relevant to all of our populations. We are also in continued discussion with Diversity and Culture Committee about collaborative projects. How many face -to-face meetings have you had in Current Year? When? Our budget allows for one face -to-face meeting per year whi ch occurs at the Annual Meeting. How many conference calls have you had in Current Year? When?
