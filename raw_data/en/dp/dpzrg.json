A Idaho naturopath is a practitioner of naturopathy, a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the body has an innate capacity to heal itself. Idaho Naturopaths improve health by treating the person holistically, tapping a person's own internal body, mind, and spirit resources. Naturopathy comprises a blend of different therapies, all attempting to restore the body to health in the most natural, noninvasive way possible by stimulating the body's own healing powers.
