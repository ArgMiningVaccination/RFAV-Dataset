Overview If you have [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm), you've likely seen remedies on store shelves that claim they can help. Many people take these [over-the-counter](https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm) [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) for [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm) and [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm). But, do they work? Certain [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm) may help a little with mild to moderate [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm). But in most cases, the evidence is slim. So don't expect a miracle cure. And even though you can get them without a prescription, [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) can come with risks or side effects. So proceed with caution. Be sure to talk to your doctor first, especially if you are taking prescription meds. What the Evidence Says [Supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm) include herbs as well as [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm), [minerals](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm), and other ingredients. Here's a list of popular remedies and what we know or don't know so far about whether they help. [Kava](https://www.medicinenet.com/kava_piper_methysticum-oral/article.htm). You can find [kava](https://www.medicinenet.com/kava_piper_methysticum-oral/article.htm)in various forms, including capsules, powders, and liquid extracts. It's often labeled as a [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)reliever, and some evidence suggests it may have a small effect on [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm). However, kava can cause serious [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm)damage. Researchers had to stop a clinical trial of kava because of this concern. - Passionflower. You can get this supplement dried for making tea or as an extract, capsule, or tablet. Some small studies suggest passionflower may help with [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety_tips/article.htm). But experts say there's not enough evidence to know for sure. If you want to try it, it's generally safe. But it can make you drowsy. [Valerian](https://www.medicinenet.com/valerian_valeriana_officinalis-oral/article.htm). Some people report less anxiety and [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm)when they take [valerian](https://www.medicinenet.com/valerian_valeriana_officinalis-oral/article.htm), which comes from a pink flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. Study results are mixed though. You can get a tea or tincture of the plant's dried roots and capsules or tablets of the dried plant. It may cause [headaches](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm), [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm), and drowsiness. - Chamomile. Extract from the daisy-like flower may help with anxiety according to small clinical studies. You can get it in teas, extracts, tablets, or capsules. Note that some people are [allergic](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm)to this herb. - Lavender. People take lavender capsules or inhale their vapor to help with anxiety, [depression](https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm), and trouble sleeping. Study results about its effects on anxiety are mixed. [Lemon Balm](https://www.medicinenet.com/lemon_balm_melissa_officinalis-oral/article.htm). Medical use of this lemon-scented herb dates back more than 2,000 years. But there's not a lot of evidence of its benefits. In at least one small study, [lemon balm](https://www.medicinenet.com/lemon_balm_melissa_officinalis-oral/article.htm)extract relieved [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)in people with mild to moderate anxiety. - Amino Acids. A small trial in Japan showed that a combination of two amino acids -- 2.64 grams each of L-lysine and L-arginine daily -- helped to reduce stress and anxiety. Both amino acids are available in tablets and capsules. - Magnesium. Several studies suggest that magnesium may improve anxiety. But experts consider the evidence poor. That doesn't mean that magnesium doesn't have benefits. It simply means the studies don't necessarily prove that. Magnesium is available in tablets. [Fish Oil](https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids/article.htm). Better known for its potential [heart](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_how_the_heart_works/article.htm)health benefits, this \"good fat\" might reduce anxiousness. In a small trial, medical students taking [omega-3](https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids-oral/article.htm)fatty acid supplements had lower anxiety. These gel capsules are easy to find in supermarkets. - Antioxidants. One study showed people with anxiety had low levels of [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm)A, E, and C. These are antioxidants that help reduce damage to your cells. Taking these [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm)for six weeks helped reduce anxiety. What About CBD Oil? You might have noticed CBD oil popping up in stores or online lately. CBD stands for cannabidiol. It comes from [marijuana](https://www.medicinenet.com/marijuana/article.htm) plants, but it won't get you high. People are taking CBD oil for many conditions, including But there's no good evidence to support these uses. Are Supplements OK With My Prescriptions? If a doctor diagnosed you with an [anxiety disorder](https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm), there's a good chance you're taking a prescription drug. Many people with anxiety or [depression](https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) take [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) known as SSRIs that work by changing their brain chemistry. [Celexa](https://www.medicinenet.com/citalopram/article.htm), [Lexapro](https://www.medicinenet.com/escitalopram/article.htm), [Prozac](https://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm), and [Zoloft](https://www.medicinenet.com/sertraline/article.htm) are common SSRIs. You should be aware that herbal remedies are not harmless. Adding them to other [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) might cause serious problems. Those problems may include Taking [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm) is often OK. To be on the safe side, don't take any supplements before asking your doctor. If you are taking supplements or any [over-the-counter](https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm) medications, make sure to tell your doctor about them. General Warnings About Supplements for Anxiety Before you take supplements for anxiety, here are some things to consider: - The evidence for supplements varies. You may feel more relaxed or less anxious when taking certain herbal remedies or vitamins. But [clinical trials](https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm)haven't proven that they can treat an [anxiety disorder](https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm). - The supplements you buy online or in stores may differ from the ones researchers have used in clinical studies. - Supplement makers must label their products correctly. But federal rules for [dietary supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm)aren't as strict as they are for prescription drugs. [Dietary supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm)can have serious side effects, including [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm)damage. - Researchers haven't tested supplements on [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm)women, [nursing](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm)mothers, or children. If you are struggling with anxiety, see a doctor for help.
