REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission -1 (REACT-1) Covid is now so infectious that it can bypass immune systems and vaccines that previously could damp it down.

Covid is now so infectious that it can bypass immune systems and vaccines that previously could damp it down. (vaccines still help, but less and less) The evolutionary pressure to keep evolving toward a milder disease is gone. This is very scary. We need an UPDATED vaccine with a modern spike protein. Not the protein from a virus that hasn't been seen in 2 years. The current pfizer and moderna vaccines do lower symptoms which is a start, but what is taking so long moving forward with better technologies? The gov just keeps giving pfizer and moderna millions of dollars for doing nothing. The shift to more cold- and flu-like symptoms may explain in part the increased infectiveness of the various Omicron variants. A sneezing carrier or one with a runny nose is certainly more likely to spread Covid than an asymptomatic carrier or a carrier whose only symptom is loss of taste and smell.Overall, key symptoms of an infection with the ancestral strain, alpha, and delta tended to be a loss or change of taste and smell, but these symptoms were less associated with omicron infections. Instead, BA.1 and BA.2 symptoms were more likely to include cold- and flu-like symptoms. Specifically, BA.2 was linked with chest pain, severe fatigue, runny nose, muscle aches, sneezing, fever, chills, tiredness, blocked nose, and headache. We need an UPDATED vaccine with a modern spike protein. Not the protein from a virus that hasn't been seen in 2 years. Also, we need intranasal vaccination. This would elicit muscosal immunity, giving protection from INFECTION, which could slow, or even stop the spread of the virus, if the vaccine works well enough. The current pfizer and moderna vaccines do lower symptoms which is a start, but what is taking so long moving forward with better technologies? The gov just keeps giving pfizer and moderna millions of dollars for doing nothing. It's time to again push that money to DEVELOPMENT of a new, better, more effective vaccine. The mRNA vaccines came fast and relieved a lot of strain. But if the work is put in, we can develop a vaccine to actually stop this virus rather than temporarily make it slightly less severe.

The resulting vaccine turns out to not be any better at preventing illness than the original. We have and the vaccines were not more effective than the original vaccines.We need an UPDATED vaccine with a modern spike protein. Not the protein from a virus that hasn't been seen in 2 years.

It's not 'slightly' less severe, it drops mortality by 42x for those with a booster. I'd love for there to be a magic bullet that stops the virus cold, but at least for now they are by far the most effective tool we've got.We need an UPDATED vaccine with a modern spike protein.

Yes, of course there is pressure to become milder. Always. That pre symptomatic transmission you were going on about? Guess what, if covid were milder there would be even more time without symptoms. The ideal virus is very mild and has pre symptomatic transmission for your entire life. Indeed, you have viruses like that- the 8 human herpes viruses.Covid is now so infectious that it can bypass immune systems and vaccines that previously could damp it down. (vaccines still help, but less and less) The evolutionary pressure to keep evolving toward a milder disease is gone. This is very scary. Was there ever an evolutionary pressure to evolve towards milder disease? Covid-19 started with presymptomatic transmission. Milder symptoms help transmissibility if the pathogen only spreads once symptoms begin (because a bedridden host comes into contact with fewer people than one who struggles into the office with the aid of a couple of tylenol) If infected hosts are walking around normally spreading the disease for a week, it doesn't really matter if they all spend the next 3 weeks being kept alive by mechanical ventilation - they've already passed on the infection far more effectively than the person struggling into the office.

Dead comes to mind as a possibility for many unfortunate souls.Just got COVID for the first time on Sunday and after a couple of bad nights of high fever, very painful sore throat and cough, things have gotten better. I'd shudder to think what it could have been, had I not gotten my three doses of vaccine.

Nah, accurately representing the findings always has to take a back seat to clickbait.

So if I'm reading this correctly, the study does not suggest that the vaccine's protection (\"VE\") against BA.2 is waning, correct?It's a shame you didn't consult with senior researchers from the university that did the research prior to publishing this stuff. \"Thanks for picking up on our study, but this is not what we conclude.

And the finding held up when the authors adjusted for time since a booster dose in people who were triple vaccinated, suggesting that waning vaccine protection could not explain the increase in symptom reporting. Make it three weeks or more. It does take time for the booster to become fully effective. Two weeks isn't long enough.I think I'm going to get my second booster about 2 weeks before the younger kid returns to school and get him boosted at the same time. Hopefully that will keep us best protected from first likely exposure through the seemingly inevitable fall wave between November and December. "}
