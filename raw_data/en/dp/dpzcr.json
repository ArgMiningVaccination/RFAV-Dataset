To overcome these constraints, social policy needs to move beyond conventional social service approaches to-ward development's goals of equitable opportunity and social justice. This series has been created to promote debate among the development community, policy makers, and academia, and to broaden understanding of social policy challenges in developing country contexts. The books in the series are linked to the World Bank's Social Devel- opment Strategy. The strategy is aimed at empowering people by trans-forming institutions to make them more inclusive, responsive, and ac-countable. This involves the transformation of subjects and benefi ciaries into citizens with rights and responsibilities. Themes in this series include equity and development, assets and livelihoods, citizenship and rights-based social policy, and the social dimensions of infrastructure and cli-mate change.

As societies around the world have become more culturally diverse, and the role culture plays in the formation of identity has become better understood, governments are beginning to pay greater attention to the management of cultural diversity and are becoming more sensitive to issues of cultural exclusion. This book explores how taking cultural diversity into account can affect the delivery of services both positively and negatively, and how local governments can respond to the challenge of programming for and around diversity. Background and De nitions Cultural diversity\u2014the mingling of groups of different ethnic and religious backgrounds in a society\u2014is becoming increasingly prevalent in countries around the world. According to the 2004 Human Development Report , about 5,000 ethnic groups live in nearly 200 countries around the globe; in two-thirds of these countries, one or more ethnic or religious groups account for at least 10 percent of the population (UNDP 2004). This mul-ticulturalism is a product of several globalizing trends, including enhanced mobility. Alongside this increasing diversity is a growing need on the part of many groups to assert or reassert their identity in a rapidly homogeniz-ing world. Bringing these factors into alignment with the move toward a global society understandably creates a major challenge for national gov-ernments, local governments, and the providers of public services charged with designing social policies and ensuring social cohesion and integration. 2 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES (See box 1.1 for defi nitions of these and other terms used in this book; see the appendix for a discussion of the concept of cultural identity.) Cultural diversity has of course always existed, but three broad phe- nomena underlie and defi ne cultural diversity as experienced in today's world. Mobility. The rate of contemporary migrations,1 both international and national, has created many mixed communities of differing origins and cultures living in the same territory and under the same local adminis-tration. However, unlike earlier generations of immigrants, today's migrants can maintain much stronger ties to their country or De nitions Culture refers to the values, norms, and institutions that regulate social life and the in- teractions among members of a society that shape their collective vision of the world. A culture evolves and constantly adjusts to internal and external infl uences. As noted social anthropologist Mary Douglas wrote: \"In reality, the connected meanings that are the basis of any given culture are multiplex, precarious, complex and fl uid. They are continually contested and always in the process of mutual accommodation. The dialogue leads to a concentration of meanings. It is the process of self-understanding, the way the community explains itself to itself and others\" (Douglas 2004, p. 88). Hybridization is the process by which a culture adopts aspects of other cultures. This process occurs on a smaller scale when individuals of one culture assimilate traits of another. Social cohesion refers to the way a group, community, or society reacts collectively to internal or external challenges. A cohesive society\u2014which does not have to be culturally homogenous\u2014minimizes internal confl ict, and its members collaborate ef- fectively to resolve problems or combat external threats. Social integration refers to the ability of individuals or groups to participate eco- nomically, socially, and politically in a broader community or society. It assumes that members of the group or society share at least some of the same values and vision. Social inclusion also refers to the ability of individuals or groups to be part of a broad- er community, but it places less emphasis on shared values and vision, and focuses instead on access to basic rights and functions.BOX 1.1INTRODUCTION: CULTURE AND SERVICES 3 community of origin, in large part because of technologies that have made it easier and less expensive to communicate with those left behind. This ease of connection to their native culture reinforces migrants' sense of belonging to that culture and somewhat mitigates the desire to inte-grate fully into the new community. Demand for recognition of cultural identity. Around the world, ethno- cultural minorities are demanding greater recognition and accommoda-tion of their cultural practices and identities. Migrants and members of minority groups are today less likely to adopt automatically the domi-nant culture and to discard their own cultural practices or keep them private. Nations and societies are responding to this shift. In this regard, political philosopher Will Kymlicka notes: In the last forty years, we have witnessed a veritable revolution around the world in the relations between states and ethnocultural minorities. Older models of assimilationist and homogenizing nation-states are in-creasingly being contested, and often displaced, by newer multicultural models of the state and citizenship. This is refl ected, for example, in the widespread adoption of cultural and religious accommodations for immi-grant groups, the acceptance of territorial autonomy and language rights for national minorities, and the recognition of land claims and self-gov-ernment rights for indigenous peoples (Kymlicka 2007, p. 3). Changes in models of self-identifi cation. Traditional bases of identity, such as profession and family, are changing dramatically and conse-quently losing some of their social, cultural, and emotional appeal (Dubar 2000). Labor markets are becoming more fl uid and fl exible, with people changing jobs and careers more frequently. Families are being transformed as marriage becomes less important to social recogni-tion. In explaining these trends, which are primarily seen in the devel-oped world but are also evident among the middle classes of the devel-oping world as well, French sociologist Alain Touraine (2005) develops the idea that the last two centuries were \"social,\" in the sense that human beings thought of themselves as members of society and subscribed to the concept of citizenship. Today, people tend to reject the idea of self-determination by social structure and an identity defi ned by a social model. Contemporary identities are more narrative, with people defi n- ing themselves by their personal story and culture. This phenomenon has a major impact on identity formation and social organization. It also poses a severe challenge to social cohesion and inclusion, as indi-4 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES viduals cannot and do not rely on family and professional networks as they once did for support and direction. Purpose and Organization Much social scientifi c research has been conducted on issues and policies that deal with economic and political integration at the national level; this research has addressed the political and institutional mechanisms that are set up to ensure that various groups can live together cohesively and share resources equitably. Numerous studies have addressed, for instance, the integration of African-American communities in the United States; the problem of recognizing new rights for the indigenous communities of Can-ada; and the challenge of integrating new migrant populations in England, France, and Germany. Until recently, the idea of looking at cultural as well as economic and political inclusion has received relatively little attention from either academics or public policy makers. A further shortcoming in the attempt to understand and address cultural diversity is the fact that studies have focused on the national level, whereas evidence shows that much of the demand for recognition of cultural identity occurs at the local level, specifi cally, in municipalities and local communities. Information at this level is scarce, particularly in terms of helping to formulate a commu-nity response to this demand while delivering basic services. This book looks at ways in which culture infl uences access to services and attempts to show some possible directions to follow in making the delivery of services more sensitive to cultural diversity. A lack of source material prevents an exhaustive treatment of the topic of cultural diversity in service delivery, but it does permit the identifi cation of key trends and issues. The following chapter presents the current debate on the role of gov- ernments\u2014at all levels\u2014in managing cultural diversity. It examines why cultural diversity is recognized as a legitimate fi eld for policy making and demonstrates the increased international interest in recognizing minority and cultural rights. It also identifi es the risks and benefi ts of accepting cul- tural diversity as an issue for social policy and presents the context for current policies that deal with cultural diversity. Chapter 3 takes a more in-depth look at specifi c areas in which the demand for recognition of cultural practices in the delivery of services is strongest: INTRODUCTION: CULTURE AND SERVICES 5 Education , mostly related to the issue of instruction in native languages Health care , including the recognition of specifi c medicinal practices Cultural services , such as the provision and promotion of cultural cen- ters, religious and national festivals, and traditional forms of cultural expression The chapter then looks at the role of traditional local governance in service delivery and the implications of that role for policy development. Chapter 4 examines policies pertaining to basic service delivery that can address and support cultural diversity. Developing such policies is challeng-ing for two reasons: Impact analysis of policies and programs that support cultural diversity remains limited. Diversity is a relatively new focus for governments and international organizations. Actions that support cultural diversity must be integrated into general social and economic policies in order to be effective. The answer is not to develop parallel policies, but to make cultural diversity a mainstream priority for government policies and programs. Chapter 5 summarizes the lessons learned from the design of culturally sensitive policies for delivering services to a diverse population. Improved inclusion will, in most cases, require policies that support recognition of minority groups' cultural specifi city and that can directly improve their socioeconomic status. Failure to recognize the connection between culture and economy can push groups into further exclusion and poverty even while supporting their demand for cultural recognition. Note 1. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2009), the number of international migrants in 2005 was estimated to be 195 million, or 3 percent of the world's population that year; these fi gures would be even higher taking national migrations\u2014those that occur within a country's borders\u2014into account.7CHAPTER 2 Cultural Diversity and Public Policy Today, about 190 independent states are home to about 5,000 ethnic groups and 600 living languages; two-thirds of the states have at least one ethnic or religious minority that makes up at least 10 percent of the population (UNDP 2004). These groups are increasingly mobilizing along religious, ethnic, and cultural lines, demanding that their particularities be recog-nized by broader society. In Latin America, grievances over an increasingly unequal society tend to be based in ethnic divisions. In the Arab world, reli-gion has replaced the secular and socialist Arab nationalism of the 1960s as the major political force. In parts of Asia, the push toward ethno-cultural self-identifi cation is resulting in rising ethnic and religious violence and confl ict. Migrants around the world are increasingly rejecting the notion that their culture of origin should be a private matter and are resisting majority society pressure to publicly adopt the dominant culture. Minor-ity cultures are fi ghting not only for increased political participation but also for offi cial recognition of their languages, religions, and festivals. As a result, governments across the world are increasingly engaged in fi nd- ing ways to manage the diverse societies and groups that form part of the countries they govern. Nondemocratic countries tend to rely on repres-sive approaches; but in more open societies, managing cultural diversity is becoming a focus of public policy, and policies aimed at social inclusion and social cohesion are becoming more pervasive. This chapter fi rst reviews how the migration and movement of popula- tions have contributed to an increased recognition on the part of govern-ments worldwide of the need for better public policies to manage cultural diversity. It then reviews the progress toward an international framework on the issue of cultural rights, and looks at how the concept of multicul-tural citizenship is taking root in many countries. Finally, the chapter looks 8 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES at how public policy aims to manage cultural diversity and to address this diversity in achieving overarching societal goals. Migrations, Minorities, and the Demand for Cultural Recognition According to the United Nations, the number of international migrants grew from 75 million in 1965 to 150 million in 1990. In 2005, there were 195 million international migrants, and the average annual increase in their number was greater than overall world population growth itself (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2009). Many of these migrants moved from developing to developed countries, but migration from poor developing countries to developing middle-income countries is also on the rise. In 2005, two out of every fi ve migrants resided in a devel- oping country (Ratha and Shaw 2007). The Gulf countries have always received large numbers of migrants from other Arab countries as well as from Asia. Argentina has absorbed sizable fl ows of migrants from Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru. The Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela has long been a migration destination for Colombians and Ecuadorians. There are about a million illegal workers from Indonesia in Malaysia. More than 1 million Mozambicans are in South Africa, a country whose mining sector, which has always used migrant workers from neighboring countries, is now esti-mated to be 300,000 persons strong. In the mid-1990s, one-quarter of the population in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire came from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and other neighboring countries from the north. Africa's many political crises and civil wars have prompted refugees to move across borders. Migration between high-income countries is also increasing, refl ecting the trend toward a global labor market. Rapid progress in technology sec-tors, as well as the opening of new economic opportunities in places such as the European Union, further facilitate the movement of human resources. Migration is generally associated with the crossing of national borders; however, internal migrations account for large numbers of migrants, and such movements are increasing. Close to 140 million people were estimated to have migrated internally in China in 2008, compared to about 500,000 international migrants from China the same year (Sheineson 2009). Rural-to-rural migrations continue to be signifi cant in developing coun- tries. In India, rural migration accounted for roughly 62 percent of all movements in 1999-2000. These migrants are mostly rural poor looking for work as laborers in richer agricultural areas. Similar migrations take CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 9 place in Senegal around groundnut cultivation. Rural-to-urban migration is also on the rise in many countries. Interestingly, urban-to-rural migra-tions are not rare either. Many Chinese migrants go back to their village of origin after working in urban centers for some time (Ping and Shahau 2005). Urban-to-rural migration also occurs during economic crises or political upheavals. In countries of the former Soviet Union, many workers returned to rural areas to survive the economic collapse that followed the union's dissolution. Urban-to-urban migration is the predominant form of migration in Latin America. In Mexico, half of the interstate migrations made between 1987 and 1992 were between urban areas; this percentage had increased to 70 percent between 1995 and 2000 (Deshingar and Grimm 2005). Most urban-to-urban migrations involved a move from a smaller center to a larger center. In Albania, for instance, the strategy adopted by most migrants is to move from villages, especially in the north, to the capital city of Tirana in incremental steps. They move fi rst to a small regional center, then to a bigger one, then to Tirana, and then eventually abroad. Such migrations are in large part attributable to inequalities among regions and countries. Such inequalities are not only income based, but also opportunity based\u2014that is, the result of inequitable access to basic services and security. They also refl ect inequalities in freedom of choice (Sen 1999). The greater autonomy available to individuals in Western economies or even in developing country urban centers is very attractive, especially to youth. The pressure to conform to ancestral collective norms and habits is often cited by young migrants in developing countries as a reason to move to urban centers or abroad. 1 The exponential increase in population movement throughout the world makes for constant confrontations of different lifestyles and values, since many of these migrations involve people of one culture settling in a community with a majority population of another culture. The impact of migration on the awareness of cultural differences is strong. Very little quantitative data are available on the impact of migration on ethnic identity and culture, but many qualitative assessments reveal this to be an impor-tant issue for individuals' well-being (Brettell 2003; Benmayor and Skotnes 2005). For instance, indigenous populations (see box 2.1 for defi nitions of terms related to minority populations) comprise many of the rural-to-urban migrants in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru; these people are moving to urban centers populated by a Hispanic majority. Many migrants to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are poor Muslims from the Sahelian cultural area to the 10 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES north moving into southern forest lands largely populated by animist and Christian populations. In China, tensions and cultural clashes commonly result from migrations of the dominant Han population into Tibet and Xinjiang. In France, Islam has become the second largest religion in the country after Catholicism, a change that has created its own set of tensions. Migrants are increasingly less inclined to renounce their cultural norms and values when moving abroad. Although drawn to a particular country because it offers opportunities or security, they feel little need to give up their native culture in exchange for these benefi ts. Trying to maintain one's cultural identity when moving across boundaries is not a new endeavor, but it has become more legitimate of late. Numerous authors, anthropolo-gists, and sociologists argue that today, as part of the globalization process, Minority Group Designations and De nitions An ethnic group is one that self-identi es or is recognized by others (the majority) as different because of its historical or biological particularities. An ethnic minority might or might not share customs and values with the majority population, but its differences often result in a split from the main population and can create strong dif-ferences in identity. A cultural minority is a group that self-identi es or is recognized by others as having different values, customs, and social practices from the main population. It can be differentiated ethnically, religiously, or linguistically or in terms of certain prefer-ences and practices that diverge from those of the main population. Indigenous peoples are those that have inhabited a territory longer than other groups in the general population (which have, in most cases, colonized the indig-enous population's territories) and that have strong economic, social, and spiritual collective connections with this territory which are embedded in their customs, beliefs, and local institutions. Indigenous people are dependent on these connec-tions for their survival as a particular group and are thus often vulnerable to rapid external changes. A national minority is a group that differs from the majority population by virtue of its symbolic and historic connection to a territory and a collective shared history. It usually shares a speci c symbolic identity (such as a fl ag, national anthem, or set of recognized holidays).BOX 2.1CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 11 the link between territory and culture has weakened, in that people retain their own culture and its particular way of life, values, and beliefs even when living among others, making less of an attempt to integrate into the larger society (Tomlinson 1999). The massive unilateral fl ows of migration of the 18th and 19th centuries\u2014such as the Irish emigration to the United States in the wake of the potato blight or the move of the Basques, Gali-cians, and Italians to Argentina\u2014were experienced as a major economic, social, and cultural uprooting and a clear break with the community of origin. This is no longer the case. Modern migration is often temporary or, when longer term, accompanied by many back-and-forth moves to and from the region of origin. Over the last 50 years, technological progress, along with more affordable transportation and communication develop-ments, has kept migrants better connected to their communities of origin. This technological revolution has had an enormous impact on the identity of migrant communities. The failure of the majority system to adequately reward adoption of the dominant culture, either economically or socially, has also played into migrants' reluctance to give up their culture. It is clear that becoming cul-turally French, British, or German, for example, does not guarantee eco-nomic equity. Australia, Canada, and the United States are among the few countries where becoming part of the mainstream culture is believed to bring economic benefi ts, and where, to some extent, it does. (This is gen- erally true of countries in which people of migrant origin make up the majority of the population.) Migrants also tend to hold fast to their native culture when confronted with a disconnect between their own values and those of the culture of the host country, especially regarding issues related to gender and family. Demand for recognition of cultural specifi city and diverse cultural iden- tity comes not only from migrant populations: it also comes from minority groups that have been part of particular nations for many generations, but now believe their values and culture are facing specifi c threats. This too is not a recent phenomenon, but it has increased with globalization. Today, even the most remote communities have contact with other cultures via radio, television, fi lm, the Internet, the telephone, new goods and ser- vices, or simply stories imparted by members of the community who have migrated. Such contact can increase a group's fear of being swallowed up by and lost in a majority or global culture. Subcultures within a society may also seek recognition of their iden- tity. Youth subculture is a relatively familiar phenomenon in this regard. 12 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Subcultures tend to be local, related to some specifi c territory (such as a ghetto), but they can also cut across geographic boundaries, creating global cultural connections through fashion, music, and dance (for example, rap, hip hop, or\u2014among North African youth\u2014rai). These subcultures often create connections among various ethnic groups. The French fi lm La Haine by Mathieu Kassovitz, which tells the story of three young people search-ing for meaning in their lives after violent uprisings in poor suburban Pari-sian neighborhoods, illustrates how subcultures are created across ethnic boundaries. In this case a Jew, an Arab, and a Sub-Saharan African fi nd commonality in their sense of isolation from mainstream French people. Additionally, subcultures are increasingly being built around sexual prefer-ence. This is a phenomenon mostly of rich industrialized countries, but is also occurring in the urban centers of developing countries. Members of these communities are asking to be accepted not only for their behaviors, but also for a certain subculture they have created; gay pride parades are a good example of this phenomenon. A Growing International Recognition of Cultural Rights In 1966, the United Nations (UN) adopted two important international treaties based on the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A new era of inter-national recognition of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic, religious, linguistic, and other minorities was thereby ushered in, 2 and a series of further declarations and conventions were crafted by way of systematically including issues relating to the cultural and other rights of these peoples in the international human rights agenda (box 2.2). In November 2001, at the 31st session of the United Nations Educa- tional, Scientifi c and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Con- ference, the representatives of participating governments unanimously approved the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. The fi rst of the declaration's 12 articles characterizes the world's rich cultural diversity as a common heritage of humanity that \"should be recognized and affi rmed for the benefi t of present and future generations\" and notes that \"as a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature\" (UNESCO 2002). The UNESCO declaration highlights the important role cultural diversity can and should CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 13 play in informing government social inclusion, civil society participation, and development policies. Articles 4 through 6 underscore the relation-ship between human rights and cultural diversity, especially in terms of the \"rights of persons belonging to minorities and those of indigenous peo-ples,\" focusing on the role of cultural rights as an enabling environment for cultural diversity. In 2004, the United Nations Development Programme took on the topic of cultural liberty as the theme of its annual Human Development Report , reviewing policies dealing with cultural diversity and making recommendations on how countries could establish strong partici-pation and recognition of minority cultures. UN Recognition of Ethnic and Racial Rights Since 1966, the United Nations and a number of its specialized agencies have taken de n- itive action to promote more favorable treatment of ethnic minorities and racial groups. In 1978, the United Nations Educational, Scienti c, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) issued a special Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice, as follow-up to the 1965 In-ternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In 1989, the International Labour Organization approved Convention 169, Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. In 1992, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 47:135, which became the rst international Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic Minorities. Article 1 calls upon states to \"protect the existence and the national or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities with-in their respective territories and encourage conditions for the promotion of that identity.\" Article 4 establishes that states shall take measures to \"ensure that persons belonging to minorities may exercise fully and effectively all their human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination and in full equality before the law\" and \"create favourable conditions to enable persons belonging to minorities to ex-press their characteristics and to develop their culture, language, religion, traditions, and customs.\" In 1988, UNESCO launched the World Decade for Cultural Development, which aimed to foster greater international awareness of the critical role recognition of living cul-tural heritages and more positive cultural policies could play in development. BOX 2.214 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Concurrent with these UN initiatives, the European Union also looked to address the issue of cultural diversity and minority rights. Through the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe and its predeces-sor agency, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the earliest specifi c principles on minority rights in European space were estab- lished. The broadest spectrum of minority rights is provided by the 1990 Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and was followed up by the creation of the Offi ce of the High Commissioner on National Minorities in 1992. Additionally, the Council of Europe has produced two treaties dealing with issues of minorities and cultural recog-nition: the Charter on Regional or Minority Languages of 1992 and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 1995. Although the former does not establish individual or collective rights for the speakers, it was established to protect and promote languages. The council claims it is the fi rst multicultural treaty of its kind. 3 These treaties and principles have become benchmarks for accessing the European Union and have contributed to noteworthy legislative changes in the region. Despite this progress in establishing an international framework for the recognition and management of cultural diversity, ratifi cation of these treaties by national governments has been slow, and their application in countries even more so. This being said, some countries have made timely progress in this area. New Zealand, for instance, has made substantial and impressive efforts toward including its Maori population while simultane-ously recognizing its individuality. Canada has found ways to accommo-date its various cultures into a multicultural nation, successfully surmount-ing the constitutional crisis of the 1970s. And countries with contexts as diverse as Colombia, Ecuador, Hungary, and Malaysia have put the rec-ognition of cultural diversity at the forefront of their legislative and con-stitutional reform agendas. Overall, however, much work remains to be done, and major discrepancies exist between national legislations and the frameworks established by international organizations. A New Paradigm: The Concept of Multicultural Citizenship Because very few countries are ethnically homogeneous (only Iceland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea are considered such), the question of how a government should manage CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 15 cultural diversity is not new. States have dealt with clashes over languages, political participation, land claims, local autonomy, and access to services by various ethnic or cultural groups for millennia. With the rise of nation-states in the 19th and 20th centuries, however, governments' dominant approach shifted toward trying to build a unique citizenship that would become the prime identity of the inhabitants of the given country. It was believed that various ethnic and cultural identities, along with their specifi c histories, languages, customs, and beliefs, would disappear over time or be totally confi ned to the private realm. Modernity was seen as an integrating force that would accelerate this process, rendering various practices and beliefs obsolete as they hindered both the improvement of living standards and efforts to evolve into a technocratic society (Giddens 1990). From the French Revolution, with its centralized emphasis and violent imposition of a revolutionary citizenship, through the various totalitarian models of the 20th century and \"comrade citizenship\" of the Soviet Union, a vision of unity and integration was promulgated. After World War II and the concomitant demonstration of the extreme to which the concept of a nation's ethnic purity could be pushed, the model of a unique culture that supplants or excludes all others began to be con-tested. Democracies realized that cultural diversity needed to be recognized, but many liberals thought that defi ning universal human rights would adequately deal with this issue. Rather than protecting vulnerable cultural groups directly (by granting special rights for them), cultural minorities would be protected indirectly by guaranteeing basic civil and political rights to all individuals regardless of group membership (Kymlicka 1995). Guided by this philosophy, the United Nations deleted all references to the rights of ethnic and national minorities in its 1948 Universal Declara-tion of Human Rights. Countries were nonetheless left to deal pragmati-cally with cultural diversity. In Europe, Belgium, Spain, and Switzerland are among the countries that have instituted political arrangements that clearly recognize the cultural diversity of their citizenry. Minority rights have since returned to prominence, and today's policy makers and academics believe that, to avoid confl icts and support social cohesion and inclusion, governments need to supplement traditional human rights with minority and cultural ones (Kymlicka 2007). The French political scientist Michel Wieviorka (1993) presents four models of social inclusion for culturally diverse democracies: the communitarian approach, the assimilationist approach, the integrationist approach, and the multiculturalist approach. 16 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES The communitarian approach. This approach focuses on the impor- tance of considering the culture of various social groups. It does not require the different groups to adopt a national culture, but rather establishes a legal and institutional framework that allows these various communities to keep their values, institutions, habits, and way of life while living in the state. For example, a communitarian organization would employ separate legal and judicial systems for different groups (as in Israel, where Arab Israelis and Jewish Israelis each have their own separate legal and judicial systems) or offer different forms of local gov-ernment (as in some indigenous communities in Colombia). In some cases, separate education systems might be established. This approach is often criticized for keeping communities \"inward looking\" and for fail-ing to create a common development dynamic. The assimilationist approach. This approach promotes just one culture in the public sphere. It can be a new culture created to integrate all other cultural groups, as in the republican and secular concept of citizenship best illustrated by the French model which was established during the 1789 revolution. It promotes a single offi cial language for national com- munication and interaction. Proactive policies encourage all members of society to adopt the dominant culture and drop their other identities. This approach claims that adopting a unique culture guarantees all members of society true equity, while recognizing other cultures under-mines social cohesion and creates bias. The integrationist approach. The goal of this approach is to encourage different cultural groups to live harmoniously under a unique public system. This system respects various cultural and social identities so long as they strive for integration in one broad culture in public life and keep their other identities private. In other words, a singular culture and national identity prevail, but others are tolerated as long as they do not undermine social cohesion. This is the model employed in the United States. As employed there, the model strongly emphasizes patriotism and public recognition of the original values of American society, but tolerates the existence and expression of other identities and cultures in the private realm. The multiculturalist approach. This approach stresses that maintaining and practicing one's culture is important for identity and agency (box 2.3). It recognizes that people tend to contest a unilateral model of integration, and also that they might want to belong to two or more cultures simultaneously. The model does not support a return to the idea CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 17 that the state should be comprised of various communities that have no interaction with each other. Rather, it supports a system built around a concept of citizenship based on universal rights shared by all members of society. It encourages some commonly shared core values and a sense of connectivity among all people, but recognizes specifi c minority and cultural rights. The multiculturalist model is, in practice, one toward which many democracies are starting to move, even if the political dis-course continues to be, in many cases, integrationist. Kymlicka has developed a theory of multicultural citizenship that is winning wide acceptance among contemporary academics and policy mak-ers. In Multicultural Citizenship , he writes: I believe it is legitimate, and indeed unavoidable, to supplement tradition- al human rights with minority rights. A comprehensive theory of justice in a multicultural state will include both universal rights, assigned to indi-viduals regardless of group membership, and certain group-differentiated rights or \"special status\" for minority culture (Kymlicka 1995, p. 6). Multicultural citizenship preserves a central core of common human rights that are extended to all citizens, but complements these rights with specifi c ones for minority groups. These specifi c cultural rights ostensibly allow minorities to exercise their universal rights because they will thus be less discriminated against. \"A liberal view requires freedom within the minority group, and equality between the minority and majority groups,\" Kymlicka (1995, p. 152) notes, and this is what multicultural citizenship aims to achieve.Agency: A De nition Human agency is the capacity to make choices and to impose those choices on the world. Agency is not a purely utilitarian notion about the ability to change one's material situation. Rather, it is much broader, encompassing the satisfaction of being what one wishes to be. This sense of achievement increases the well-being of the individual, even if it might not have an immediate impact on one's ability to act and increase one's rev-enue. Economist Amartya Sen (1999) argues that freedom and choice have a value in and of themselves, independent of the effect they have on one's material condition; he sees culture and values as fundamental to agency.BOX 2.318 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Managing Cultural Diversity through Public Policy Many countries have dealt with managing diversity for centuries\u2014Spain has tried to fi nd a balance between various regions, Switzerland has attempted to manage three linguistic groups, and the United States has struggled to integrate its African-American minority. Despite these efforts, viewing the management of diverse cultures as a legitimate public policy concern is a relatively new conception. For a long time, states have resisted such an approach, seeing efforts to legitimize cultural diversity as a direct attack on the integrity of the nation-state and the concept of citizenship. With a few notable exceptions, it is only in the last 20 years that these ideas about and efforts at managing cultural diversity have been developed into policies. Policies recognizing the specifi c cultural rights of a particular group are usually justifi ed on the basis of a perceived perception of inequity between sociocultural groups in accessing resources/services and/or in their respective political participation. Usually this inequality results from discrimination or unfairly shared resources and assets owing to a variety of historical, regional, or other reasons. In this context, the rights involved are not cultural, but universal\u2014that is, of an economic, social, or political nature. The issue of cultural rights\u2014having the freedom to express one's cul- ture\u2014is a separate consideration, but one which is increasingly being regarded as having as much legitimacy as universal rights. The 2004 Human Development Report directly links the management of cultural diversity with the recognition of cultural rights: Cultural liberty is a vital part of human development because being able to choose one's identity, who one is, without losing the respect of oth-ers or being excluded from other choices is important in leading a full life. People want the freedom to practice their religion openly, to speak their language, to celebrate their ethnic or religious heritage without fear of ridicule or punishment or diminished opportunity. People want the freedom to participate in society without having to slip off their chosen cultural mooring (UNDP 2004, p. 1). To ensure these universal and cultural rights, public policies supporting cultural diversity usually have the following objectives: Supporting political participation Fighting discrimination Reducing cultural exclusionCULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 19 Supporting Political Participation Political participation policies usually aim at ensuring the political partici- pation of different groups. Much literature exists on this topic. Ghai (1998) classifi es these policies into two main categories: spatial devolution and cor- porate decentralization. Spatial devolution policies are applied when cul-tural differences correspond to a territory, while policies relying on corporate decentralization and some form of cultural autonomy are used to provide a framework for the political participation of a minority group independent of the territory in which they live. Such decentralization can take the form of federalism, as when a given territorial community within a central state is granted special status or autonomy. In developing countries, federal states were created at the time of decolonization, and were seen by the colonial power as a way to ensure some form of cohesion in multiethnic states: On the whole, colonially devised or inspired federations were not dis- tinguished by their longevity (Indonesia, Burma [Myanmar], Eritrea-Ethiopia, East and West Pakistan, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda). They were introduced at the terminal stages of decolonization, superimposed on centralized and bureaucratic systems, and it proved easy to claw back, de jure or de facto, regional powers (Ghai 1998, p. 43). However, there have been more successful cases, such as India, Malay- sia, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea. These various arrangements have given rise to a variety of systems that ensure political representation at the national and state levels. Decentralizing to smaller units of government without establishing autonomous regions is often seen as the best way to ensure participation of various groups. The decentralization approach complements a general trend that encourages devolution of responsibilities to lower levels of gov-ernments independently of the issue of cultural diversity. This devolution is usually accomplished to increase citizens' involvement in their own deci-sions, and to improve the quality of service by bringing the provider closer to the client. This trend is supported by international organizations, which have encouraged states to provide a greater voice to various minorities in the management of their territories. In Latin America, for example, many countries have recently modifi ed their constitution to provide some degree of territorial autonomy to their indigenous population. The constitutional reforms in Colombia in 1991, in Bolivia in 1995, in Ecuador in 1998, and in the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela in 2000 all clearly provide rights to indigenous populations in managing the territories in which they live.20 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Corporate devolution consists of providing special representation to some groups independent of their territorial affi liation. These policies usu- ally consist of reserving special seats in parliaments for groups that tend to be excluded in the normal political process. In this way, the recognized tribes and castes in India, for instance, have seats reserved for them in the parliament. Some groups are also charged with the responsibility of man-aging their communities, especially in the area of justice. Israel, for exam-ple, has separate judicial systems for Jews and for Arab Israelis. Similarly, in Egypt, Christians have different common laws than do Muslims. Con-sultation mechanisms on policies also involve representatives of minorities or religious institutions. Fighting Discrimination Policies that deal with cultural diversity usually seek to ensure some form of equity between groups. As such, their goal is to fi ght both overt and hid- den discrimination. These policies have social inclusion as their objective and, to some extent, social cohesion as well. The 2004 Human Develop- ment Report (UNDP 2004) distinguishes three different subpolicies: Addressing unequal social investments to achieve equality of opportunity Recognizing claims to land and livelihoods Implementing affi rmative actions in favor of disadvantaged groups Addressing unequal social investment is usually not very different from poverty targeting (discussed later in this chapter), as this is an issue in regions where minorities are overrepresented among the poor and this action might be taken independently of any recognition of a specifi c cul- ture. However, in some cases, ensuring equal benefi t of social investments will also require recognizing some specifi c cultural rights. For example, certain sanitation regulations might go against particular religious beliefs, therefore depriving minorities of the benefi t of this infrastructure. The preparation of kosher food for Jews, for example, might require changing laws that pertain to slaughterhouses. Minorities have often been excluded from land ownership for historical reasons. Policies addressing this problem have two components. One is linked to land reform, by which unequal distribution of land is addressed through reform of land ownership. The other component involves recog-nizing collective land claims, mostly submitted by indigenous communities, and returning land to them under their collective management. This latter course of action is not without confl ict, especially when these lands are the CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 21 site of valuable national resources, such as oil. Returning land to collective ownership will, in many cases, also require specifi c legislation. Affi rmative action attempts to counteract discrimination that is based on negative stereotypes\u2014a complex endeavor, particularly in societies where the sociocultural groups rarely interact, thus leading to self-confi rming stereotypes. In this regard, Loury (2001) has used economic reasoning to deconstruct the process by which African Americans are discriminated against in the United States. He clarifi es the differences between stereotypes, stigma, and actual discrimination. Stereotyping is the way in which people use what they have heard, read, or experienced about a certain group of people to judge and identify the potential behavior of a specifi c person from that group. People do \"a statistical generalization,\" in Loury's words; this generalization can have a negative, neutral, or positive impact. In a world of limited information, everyone uses stereotypes to some degree. Stigma exists when a negative stereotype is systematized so that people are unable to escape being negatively assessed by others. Stigma can also exist for purely cultural reasons, with no specifi c stereotypes attached. For example, if a person is from a lower caste in India, they are directly stigmatized. Discrimi- nation is when this stigma is acted upon, depriving a person or group of the same opportunity or treatment enjoyed by the rest of the population. Stereotypes are built over time and passed from generation to generation. They are diffi cult to modify, and, because they are often embedded in cul- ture and attitudes, tend to be very powerful. In addition, many stereotypes tend to be self-confi rming, in the sense that the group being stereotyped will anticipate these and act accordingly. This behavior then confi rms to outsiders that the stereotype is true. 4 Discrimination based on stigma is very diffi cult to deal with and usually does not disappear until affi rmative action policies can ensure that people are able to exercise their rights and change stereotypes. Affi rmative action allocates access to services, assets, housing, and politi- cal participation on the basis of membership in a disadvantaged group. The legacy of affi rmative action is a contested one. Affi rmative action has suc- cessfully reduced intergroup inequalities in places where it has been effec-tively implemented, but a number of studies have shown it has not reduced inequalities among individuals. Nonetheless, in a country where there are very strong stigmas associated with some groups, affi rmative action might be the only way to change stereotypes and reduce informal discrimination. India, for instance, has implemented very active antidiscrimination policies in line with Gandhi's vision of a more tolerant and open society. These poli-cies have resulted in tremendous changes to the nature of India's middle 22 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES class and its political processes. Even if everyday discrimination still exists against lower castes and tribes, their participation in the administration and in politics has changed Indian society. 5 Reducing Cultural Exclusion This area of policy is most directly linked to cultural rights. A person's behavior and way of life are infl uenced by his or her culture. In a multicul- tural democracy, living this culture is a right as long as it does not infringe on others' individual rights or on members of the concerned group. Social exclusion based on one's culture can deprive individuals of the sat- isfaction of asserting their identity, which is in itself an issue. Moreover, such exclusion can prevent people from accessing services, employment, or jus-tice. For instance, if a Bolivian Quechua Indian is barred from a municipal building because he is wearing a traditional outfi t, he is thereby deprived of his basic right to access services. Similarly, nomads are prevented from par-ticipating in the political process if they are required to have a fi xed home and mailing address in order to cast a vote. This premise can be extended to areas such as respecting customary laws or freedom of religious affi liation. Examples of policies that fi ght cultural exclusion include allowing nomadic populations to have an address in a municipality without actually residing in that municipality; allowing certain groups to use customary law to resolve small offenses, so they do not spend time and money trying to access the formal justice system; and allowing people to practice certain livelihoods that might be forbidden to the community at large (such as hunt-ing on reservations), because it is closely associated with their livelihood. An overriding concern of policies addressing cultural exclusion is to ensure that an individual's choices are respected, and that no one is forced to participate in cultural practices. The groups should have, for instance, the freedom to adopt or abandon their religion, to practice or ignore festi-vals and various rituals, to teach or be taught languages, and so on. Ensur-ing this autonomy and individual freedom can be problematic and must be approached thoughtfully. Signi cance of Cultural Diversity in Making Public Policy for Development and Poverty Reduction The literature on culture and cultural diversity cites several reasons recog- nizing cultural identity is important. This section focuses on three of the CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 23 main arguments: its role in poverty targeting, its positive impact on agency, and its ability to reduce the risk of confl ict. Poverty Targeting Cultural minorities are often among the poorest in a given society (but not always, as discussed in box 2.4). Notably, the 8 million Roma in Cen-tral Europe are signifi cantly represented among the poorest peoples of the region. A recent survey found that nearly 80 percent of Roma in Romania and Bulgaria were living on less than $4.30 per day. Even in Hungary, one of the most prosperous accession countries, 40 percent of Roma live below the poverty line (Ringold, Orenstein, and Williams 2003). To improve the well-being of such minorities, their cultural specifi city must be recognized and antipoverty programs tailored to their needs and culture designed. A recent study by the World Bank on indigenous populations (Hall and Patrinos 2009) estimates that of a total of about 300 million indigenous people and recognized ethnic minorities around the world, 100 million are considered poor in terms of being under the national poverty line. The study fi nds that indigenous and ethnic minorities are poorer than the average population in all the countries assessed and that the poverty gap between indigenous and nonindigenous populations has increased over the Dominant Minorities There are well-known cases in which the minority population in a given country is actu- ally better off than the majority. The Chinese in Malaysia, for example, are better off than the Malay, which is the main reason large-scale policies of positive discrimination exist in the country: they are an attempt to improve the Malay majority's access to op-portunities. Similarly, the Hungarian minority in Romania is often seen as better off than the majority Romanian population, despite past policies that have not always provided the Hungarian-populated region with its fair share of infrastructure. The Bamilekes in Cameroon are often considered better off than the rest of the population as a partial result of the very effective social capital that interconnects these traders, allowing them to use a wide range of social networks. Most familiar of all, of course, is the situation in South Africa, where colonial rule followed by the strong apartheid system left the white minority population better off than the majority African population.BOX 2.424 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES last 10 years, with the single exception of China, where the gap is closing for the Han population. In Latin America, about 30 percent of the population is of African origin or indigenous to the continent. These groups are disproportionately repre-sented among the poor and comprise the large majority of people living in extreme poverty. In the middle of the 1990s, the national poverty rate in Guatemala was about 64 percent; this fi gure was 87 percent for the indig- enous population. Similarly, in Peru, the general poverty rate was about 50 percent, but close to 80 percent for the indigenous population. The disproportion is particularly striking in Mexico, where the rate of poverty for the general population is a relatively low 18 percent, but is 81 percent among indigenous groups. These trends from the 1990s persist (Hall and Patrinos 2009). In Asia, where ethnic minorities are numerous, many are worse off than the majority population, although supporting statistical data are scarce; this has sometimes led, as in Myanmar, to open confl ict with the central government. In Vietnam, several poverty analyses conducted by donor agencies and the government over the last 10 years show that 14 percent of the population is comprised of members of 53 offi cially recognized ethnic minority groups, which account for 29 percent of the nation's poor. The poverty rate for these minorities is being reduced, but at a slower rate than for the Hink majority population. 6 A variety of historical factors partially accounts for why minorities tend to be poorer than the majority population. Many minorities have been colonized or conquered. They have endured purposeful policies of oppression and attempts to destroy their culture and economic livelihoods. These factors are in many cases still discernible in the form of voluntary or involuntary discrimination. Such discrimination can be related to the mar-ginal status of the population or cultural prejudice; it can also stem from a majority group' s efforts to retain control over national assets and resources. Whatever the reason for discrimination, it is often manifested through stig-mas linked to morphology (in particular, skin color), to cultural habits and practices, or simply to the minority's ethnicity or religion itself. Another reason minorities are often overrepresented among the poor may derive from the diffi culties of practicing a different culture than the majority. For instance, if the minority speaks a different language than the majority, minority students are at a disadvantage when learning to read and write in school; they may also feel disconnected from the history and geography presented in the curriculum. These barriers might also prevent CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 25 them from getting support from their parents, who may have been edu- cated in a different school system or no system at all. In some ways, these are examples of involuntary discrimination on the part of society at large. To be effective, any poverty reduction policies that deal with these issues will require not only a formal recognition but also a solid understanding of cultural factors. Impact on Agency Taking culture into account in public policy making can have a positive impact on collective and individual agency (see box 2.3 for a defi nition of this term). Few systematic studies have been undertaken on the impact of active cultural recognition on a population's well-being, given that the intrinsically subjective nature of the issue does not easily lend itself to mea-surement. However, philosophy professor Charles Taylor provides a clear articulation of how cultural recognition affects agency: The thesis is that our identity is partly shaped by recognition or its ab- sence, often by misrecognition of others and so a person or a group of people can suffer damage, real distortion, if the people or society around them mirror back to them a confi rming or demeaning or contemptible pic- ture of themselves. Non-recognition or misrecognition can infl ict harm, can be a form of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being. Within this perspective misrecognition shows not just a lack of due respect. It can infl ict a grievous wound saddening its victims.... Due recognition is not just a courtesy we owe people. It is a vital human need (Taylor 1994, p. 25). This view is very much in line with recent social and anthropological studies that underscore the importance of society's recognition of a per-son's identity in enabling positive interactions with others (Jenkins 2008). 7 Although it is diffi cult to measure the relationship of recognition to social inclusion and positive agency, a number of cases offer evidence of such a relationship. In New Zealand, a country with demonstrably suc-cessful integration policies, the recent improvement in the minority popula-tion's standard of living is closely correlated with an important renewal of interest in the Maori culture (Ringold 2005). It should be noted that it is not just the Maori who are experiencing a renewed interested in their own culture, but also the national majority as well. Culture is also important to agency because of the infl uence it has on social capital. Interactions among people are strongly infl uenced by their culture. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (2001) uses the notion of 26 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES habitus to describe how the cultural environment in which one is born and raised will strongly defi ne, among other things, the network of relation- ships in which a person lives and interacts over the course of his or her life. The study of social capital shows to what extent it is embedded in a culture. Many of the mechanisms that help people deal with security at the informal level are very often part of a local culture. The African tontine (rotating saving scheme) is another example of a system that usually works among people of the same cultural group. 8 Culture can also in some cases reduce agency if, to use social capital terminology, it gives preference to bonding relationships and does not form relationships with other groups or formal institutions. This type of social capital can isolate the group and reduce choice and opportunity. Confl ict Reduction Understanding and promoting the cultural attributes of minority groups can reduce confl ict. Group identity is defi ned in large part by the identi- fi cation of similarities with and differences from others. This process of identifi cation brings sociocultural groups together, reinforcing their inter- nal cohesion. At times, groups of people will play out their differences to reinforce their identity, which is not necessarily negative. Sporting events, for example, elicit such behaviors, while at the same time\u2014in most cases\u2014reinforcing social cohesion. Confl ict between different sociocultural groups should be seen as part of normal social interactions as long as it does not result in violence, discrimination, or exclusion. Both the state and civil soci-ety should help manage these confl icts so they do not erupt in any major way. To this end, it is useful to reinforce the commonalities among vari-ous groups, encourage respect and tolerance for differences in society, and emphasize the positive aspects of multiculturalism. These actions cannot be accomplished by negating the differences between groups, but rather by understanding these differences and providing a positive outlook on what they offer society as a whole. Identity confl icts are often triggered by economic or political factors (power and control). They very rarely occur simply for cultural reasons. The Risks of Taking Culture into Account in Developing Public Policy Many policy makers and academics have cited the potential risks of taking culture into account in public policy, even if it is increasingly accepted that CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 27 the benefi ts of culturally sensitive policy making outweigh the negatives. The potential drawbacks include the following: Reduced autonomy and freedom of choice for some subgroups. This argument is often made when discussing gender issues. It is argued, and rightly so, that some cultural practices favor the subordination of women. Polygamy, excision, the failure to send girls to school, or the failure to consult women on important decisions are often cited as nega-tive aspects of some cultures. These practices keep women subordinated inside a group and go against principles of equity and freedom. Some cultures also support a strong age-based hierarchy (for example, coun-cils of elders) and thus exclude youth from decision making, thereby reducing their capability. In some cases, hierarchical class structures embodied in local cultures encourage social exclusion. Examples include the caste system in India and in some African societies. 9 Perpetuation of unfair and ineffective institutions. Acknowledging and cooperating with local institutions that are part of a community's cul- tural tradition (as discussed in the next chapter) can perpetuate ineffec-tive and unfair structures. Some cultural institutions, while important for maintaining social cohesion inside a group, do not promote behav- iors that are conducive to economic or social development. For exam- ple, in Sub-Saharan Africa, entrepreneurs often complain that they can- not save money or resources because the pressure to share and redistribute these resources inside one's community is extremely strong. Because local institutions such as councils of elders or religious and traditional fraternities reinforce this pressure, they reduce an individu-al's ability to save and reinvest in a business. In Latin America, the use of traditional forms of indigenous government in communities has been criticized in some cases for supporting nepotism and corruption (Recondo 2007). Isolation of communities from majority culture. Critics charge that rec- ognizing cultural practices and institutions when designing public policy tends to isolate specifi c groups from the majority population and there- fore reduces the opportunity group members have to interact with the larger society. The practice can favor strong social networks specifi c to one group and embedded in one's culture and undermine the ability of this group to create networks and social interactions with other groups which are essential to reduce the risk of confl ict and increase economic opportunities. It is also argued that recognizing cultural differences in 28 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES the public sphere will weaken the concept of citizenship, which is the main integrating factor in nation-states. The risks represented by these arguments can be mitigated so that the benefi ts of taking cultural diversity into account in public policy will far outweigh them. To this end, public policy developers should keep the fol-lowing points in mind: Culture and tradition are not set in stone. Even in the most closed soci- eties, culture evolves and changes with the experience of the individuals in the community or through contact with other societies. L\u00e9vi-Strauss found, even in highly isolated indigenous populations such as that of the Brazilian Matto Grosso and Amazon provinces, evidence of cultures infl uencing and borrowing from each other. He saw evidence too of diversifi cation from inside a culture and found that the more a culture involves a large population, the more it will diversify (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1952). Thus, culture can change, societies can adapt, and some will in the process give greater voice to youth and women. 10 Failure to recognize culture will not obliterate negative institutions. Ignoring the negative systemic practices of minority cultures does not make the problem go away. Rather, these institutions will continue to operate informally in parallel, which could be even more detrimental for its members as they are isolated even further from mainstream society. For example, in many Sub-Saharan African countries, polygamy has survived and is even spreading, despite the fact that the countries do not offi cially recognize the practice. Here, the fi rst marriage is considered the offi cial one, but the following marriages are not civilly recognized, thus depriving these wives and any children they produce of formal legal protection. Notes 1. Semb\u00e8ne Ousmane, the Sengelese \"father of African fi lm,\" vividly depicts the attractiveness of urban centers in distancing oneself from the pressure of local communities in his fi lms Xola (1974), Ceddo (1977), and Moolaad\u00e9 (2004). 2. For instance, article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reads: \"In those states in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language.\"CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PUBLIC POLICY 29 3. For a detailed discussion of European recognition of cultural diversity, see Thomberry (2001). 4. According to Loury (2004, p. 26) self-confi rming stereotypes are formed through the following sequence of events: (1) rational statistical inference in the presence of limited information, (2) feedback effects on the behavior of individuals due to their anticipation that such interferences will be made about them, and (3) a resulting convention \"equilibrium\" in which mutually con-fi rming beliefs and behaviors emerge out of this interaction. Loury offers the example of taxi drivers who do not pick up black passengers because they are stereotyped as criminals. As a result, blacks stop trying to hail taxicabs. After a while, the only blacks that continue to hail taxis are criminals, and therefore the stereotype is self-confi rming. 5. For more on the Indian experience with affi rmative action, see Sabbagh (2003). 6. For more information, see CIE (2002), Guewardena and Van de Walle (2000), and Hall and Patrinos (2009). 7. See the appendix for a defi nition of cultural identity. 8. Tontine effectiveness also seems to be linked to gender; the system works much better among women than among men. 9. Certain African societies are strongly hierarchical, with rigid class structures. The Mauritanian society is strictly divided into warriors, religious leaders, ar-tisans, and slaves; these categories determine lifelong opportunity and choice. A similar situation exists in various Sahelian cultures (Touareg, Peulh, and Goran, for instance, or some societies of South Africa). For more on the infl u- ence of the caste system in political participation, see Jaffrelot (2005). 10. In this regard, it should be noted that not all values of minority cultures are at odds with those of the majority. For example, despite its rigid class structure, Mauritanian society allows women great autonomy. In fact, a Mauritanian woman is more likely to be fully accepted by society following a divorce than her counterpart in many European countries.31Cultural Diversity and Service Delivery This chapter seeks to highlight the numerous, complex, and nuanced connections between cultural diversity and services delivered at the community level so that these can be taken into account when design-ing culturally sensitive policies and programs. Of the many services delivered at the community level, this chapter focuses on education, health, and cultural services, because these are strongly infl uenced by culture. This does not mean that other services should not be considered when designing policies that support cultural diversity: values, habits, and customs can affect the use of water, slaughterhouses, and roads, to name just a few. The chapter also looks at how traditional governance systems (councils of elders, traditional courts, religious fraternities) can be used to deliver services. Education School is where a child's social identity is shaped and where future citizens are formed. It is therefore no coincidence that demands for recognizing cultural diversity are strongest in the fi eld of education; the response has been the promotion of multicultural education. Multicultural education is a broad term that includes teaching in lan- guages other than the majority one, adapting curriculum to refl ect the his- tory and culture of minority groups, offering support to minority students when they are facing challenges that result from their cultural specifi cities, and making pedagogy more in step with cultural considerations. The sup-porters of multicultural education argue that it is consistent with today's CHAPTER 332 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES efforts to improve the outcome of education systems across the world. \"The accommodation of diversity in the educational system is also fully consistent with the 'outcome based' educational practices that researchers agree are needed if societies are to achieve sustainable social and economic development in our globalized world\" (Smith 2006). In multicultural edu-cation, the main challenge is to create structures that support the develop-ment of a student's group identity while fostering common ground among groups that are part of the broader society. At the same time, it must effi - ciently instill in students skills that are useful in the labor market. In the last decade, multicultural education has become increasingly pop- ular, with notable expansion in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In Sub-Saharan Africa, multicultural education is still limited, even though the majority of children have a native language other than the offi cial tongue. 1 Asia has also experimented with multicultural education, with notable results in Papua New Guinea (box 3.1), the world's most linguistically and culturally diverse nation. It is important to understand both the nature of the demand for mul- ticultural education and what forces drive it. Multicultural education usually has a strong ideological appeal and is often pushed by elites for political reasons. This may not be considered negative, as elites have often been at the forefront of social change; however, such reforms need to be understood and accepted by the intended benefi ciaries at the local level. Moodley (2001), in considering multicultural education in Canada, main-tains that it often overlooks the prime goals of equality of opportunity and Success of Multicultural Education Reform in Papua New Guinea In 1993, the Department of Education of Papua New Guinea implemented educational reforms that introduced native language instruction for the rst year of school. By 2001, 369 indigenous languages were introduced in the program, and a third of elementary schoolchildren began education in their native tongue. Although the success of the pro-gram is largely anecdotal at this point, it has demonstrably increased educational access and resulted in a lower dropout rate, particularly among female students. Lower second-ary school enrollments have doubled, and upper secondary numbers have quadrupled over the decade following the introduction of the reform (Litteral 2004).BOX 3.1CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 33 equality of condition. She emphasizes that competence, not culture, is the main concern of minority parents, who often prefer to see their children learn a curriculum of basic skills in subjects needed to survive in the nation, rather than being taught fragmented versions of their culture by people with very little knowledge and understanding of it. 2 As a result, the study of multicultural education often tends to be overly politicized and some-times ideologically driven, which makes evaluation of its impact diffi cult. This section attempts to provide a brief overview of the various issues and debates surrounding multicultural education. Native Language Instruction It is diffi cult to discuss education without examining a country's language policies and how it relates to nation building and the formation of citi-zenship. Language is arguably the most important vehicle of a culture. As Kymlicka and Grin point out, ... when a language group fi ghts to preserve its language, it is never just preserving a tool for communication: it is also preserving certain political claims, autonomous institutions, cultural products and practices, and na-tional identities. Conversely, of course, when the state attempts to impose a dominant language on minorities, it is never just imposing a language: it is also imposing a set of political and cultural claims about the primacy of the state, the need for common rules and centralized institutions, the need to learn new history and literature and the construction of new nation-state loyalties and identities. Language disputes are never just disputes over language (Kymlicka and Grin 2003, p. 11). It is clear that people have a wide range of interests in language, and, at least in a democratic society, it is necessary to accommodate these interests. At the same time, it is legitimate to want all members of a nation to be able to communicate easily with each other and to enable the state to interact with its citizens effectively. Language policies touch on another highly important national inter- est: security, particularly for countries with weak national integration (as in Africa), or with contested borders and a history of strong central con-trol (as in Eastern Europe and China). In such countries, both the gov-ernment and the majority population often fear that granting language rights will reinforce cultural identity and encourage minorities to request autonomy or secede, thereby depriving the majority population of such benefi ts as, for example, access to natural resources or a particular ter- ritorial advantage. 34 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES From an educational viewpoint, instruction conducted in a student's native language has largely been recognized as an effective strategy in terms of cognitive development and the ability to learn other topics. A World Bank study concluded that, when learning is the goal, including learning of a second language, the child's fi rst language should be used as the medium of instruction in the early years of schooling. The fi rst language is essential for the initial teaching or reading and for comprehension of subject matter. It is the necessary foundation for the cognitive development upon which acquisition of the second language is based (Dutcher and Tucker 1997). Similarly, Mehotra (1998) fi nds that bilingual education, particularly at the early childhood level, supports cognitive development that aids in all aspects of later learning. Other evidence (UNESCO 2003) suggests that learning in one's native language increases interest in school participation and encourages school enrollment and attendance (box 3.2). Adapting the Curriculum to Refl ect Various Cultures Teaching local languages at school is only one aspect of multicultural education. Another important component is the introduction of minor-ity cultures in the broader school curriculum. Minority achievements and contributions should be taught in history, geography, and literature as well as with regard to music, art, and trade skills. How curriculum should be adapted to best refl ect the various cultures of a country is a matter of debate, especially in nations with a history of confl ict between these Maori Immersion Education and Education Outcomes The New Zealand government's 1982 introduction of Maori Immersion Education (educa- tion in the Maori language) has been successful in a variety of ways. First, it has grown to the extent that it is now possible for students in New Zealand to attend Maori language education from preschool through primary and secondary schools. In addition, it has created an incentive for other schools to start teaching Maori. It is estimated that 80 per-cent of Maori children learn their native language to various degrees and in various forms at the primary and secondary levels of education (Ringold 2005). According to evalua-tions carried out in New Zealand, the extension of Maori language education seems to have strongly affected students' ability to perform in class; no in-depth assessments on this nding have yet been carried out.BOX 3.2CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 35 cultures. Some argue that incorporating minority culture into a curriculum can actually increase the sense of \"otherness\" regarding that culture; for example, drawing attention to a particular group through separate books and classes may tacitly reinforce the idea that this group does not belong to the majority. Such an outcome would undermine rather than strengthen social cohesion. For this reason, books and curricula that actually integrate the geography, history, arts, and achievements of a nation's various groups are preferable (Greaney 2006). Curriculum adaptation is linked to a debate over pedagogy, as many spe- cialists argue that culture informs not just the way a person learns, but also what a person is better suited to learn. Pedagogical concepts are embedded in culture and guided by the specifi c educational priorities and goals of a given society. They are refl ected in models of generating and transmitting knowledge and skills, and in teaching methods and learning styles (King and Schielmann 2004). Ringold (2005) mentions that during her fi eld vis- its in New Zealand, teachers commented that Maori students are more active and visual learners, and hence need to be treated differently in the classroom. This argument is also often made in the case of Roma children in Eastern Europe. However, teaching strategies that assume that certain students are predisposed to visual, tactile, or other types of learning also have the potential to increase segregation in the classroom by differentiat-ing teaching methods and materials according to the cultural background of the student. This issue requires more study and analysis. Taking Cultural Differences into Account in the Classroom Successful multicultural education needs to center on the classroom because this is where social interactions occur among children, between children and teachers, and\u2014especially\u2014among children of different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Different options exist for supporting the integration of children from minority cultures: Minorities could be taught in separate schools at the primary level to facilitate the teaching of their specifi c culture and avoid in-class dis- crimination. All students could be housed in the same school but taught in separate classrooms. All students could be taught together and learn the same things. Which of these options is best is a matter of heated debate among special- ists of multicultural education. 36 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Hungary, which has made aggressive efforts in the area of multicultural education, supports three types of schools: schools in which classes are taught entirely in the minority language, bilingual schools in which both the national offi cial language and the minority language are taught, and schools in which the native language is taught as a foreign language. The Hungarian system of education is quite decentralized, and many schools have room to adapt the noncore curriculum (that is, the curriculum that is not centrally defi ned by the Ministry of Education). Because the develop- ment of multicultural education is still relatively new, it is diffi cult at this stage to assess the merits of these different approaches. There is serious debate regarding whether separate schools actually ben- efi t minorities. In some countries\u2014including Australia, New Zealand, and Slovak Republic, as well as several Latin American countries\u2014minorities have historically attended separate schools or been made to attend special schools because language barriers made it diffi cult for them to follow les- sons in majority schools. Such was the case for the Roma population in Eastern and Central Europe, for example. However, the schools Roma are made to attend were originally created for children with disabilities, thereby reinforcing the stereotype of Roma intellectual inferiority (box 3.3). More-over, separate schools around the world are frequently second-rate (or worse) institutions, characterized by poor fi nancing, isolation from main- stream education, and lower quality teachers, making learning of any kind Institutionalized Discrimination: Segregated Schooling for the Roma On November 13, 2007, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled, by a vote of 13 to 4, that segregating Roma students into special schools is a form of discrimination that violates fundamental human rights. The decision is the culmination of an eight-year legal battle between parents of children who were enrolled in special schools for children with mental disabilities and the Czech state. The judgment may have the same signi cance for Roma children as the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case had for the integration of African-American children in U.S. schools. The European judgment is signi cant because it ruled that an education system can be discriminatory and in violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, even if there were no speci c acts of discrimination by any individual (Roma Education Fund 2007).BOX 3.3CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 37 diffi cult (Rossell, Armor, and Walberg 2002). Consequently, the idea of spe- cial schools for minorities is today often regarded very skeptically. Other schools, especially primary schools, have had more success in sup- porting the education of minorities and catering to their specifi c cultural needs. The Maori language immersion schools in New Zealand resulting from the Kohanga Reo movement are an example of such success. The movement began with the goal of preserving the Maori language, teaching cultural traditions, transferring knowledge across generations, and provid-ing education within a Maori cultural context. This experience has been met with at least some success, even if a real evaluation can be made only in the long term. The preferred approach to multicultural education is to teach diverse groups of students together, but to use facilitators, teaching assistants, and special classes to address culturally sensitive curriculum. This method has been shown both to recognize that minority students have special needs and preferences and to ensure that they are not educated differ-ently from the mainstream student body. It is helpful to offer after-hours sessions where students can receive help with specifi c curriculum related to minority culture and receive support to better keep up with in-class demands. Bringing Cultural Diversity to Preschool Preschool is seen as vital to socialization and helps prepare children for pri- mary education. If approached as a transitional experience, preschool can play an important role in creating a peaceful and accessible bridge between minority and mainstream culture (box 3.4). For example, preschool edu-cation is seen as the most effective way to ensure that Roma children are successfully included in the European education system. Maintaining Quality in Multicultural Education The objective of multicultural education is to ensure quality education for minority languages and other curriculum. Such an endeavor is fraught with challenges. Delivering quality multicultural education usually requires funding additional teachers and textbooks, fi nding qualifi ed teachers with a solid understanding of minority culture, coordinating between central and local authorities to implement the new curriculum, helping parents and children of the majority population understand the need for and pur-pose of the curriculum, and establishing a monitoring system to facilitate assessment of the curriculum's impact.38 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES The situation varies considerably by case. Very often, the more isolated and marginalized a community, the more diffi cult it will be to introduce a new curriculum into the classroom. The effort will usually require com-prehensive approaches that involve reforming or adapting many aspects of the educational system. In 2001, the Romanian government adopted a set of programs to focus exactly on these shortcomings. It included affi rma- tive action to support Roma university enrollment; measures to increase the number of Roma-qualifi ed teachers; outreach programs to stimulate interest in Roma studies; the design of curricula, textbooks, and didactic materials for the study of Roma language, history, and traditions; and the recruitment of Roma school inspectors to monitor the quality of Roma education and assess the implementation of the program. Some circumstances will affect both the cost and quality of such pro- grams\u2014for example, whether the minority is geographically concentrated or dispersed throughout the country. Countries usually require a minimum concentration of children to start a bilingual education program. In Bul-garia, for example, a minimum of 13 students is required to appoint a teacher to a language class. If a minority is well organized, and has the sup-port of neighboring nations (as is the case for the Hungarians in Romania, for instance), these obstacles become less challenging. Experience shows that motivated nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) can help in this area. In fact, the successful language immersion program of the Maori in New Zealand started with support from an NGO and then spread with the help of government funding.Social Inclusion and Preschool in Albania and Kosovo The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a local nongovernmental organization jointly launched a preschool program in Albania and Kosovo. The project was scaled up with nancing from the World Bank and is focused on organizing community centers for mothers and their children of preschool age. The program was meant to bene t children who live in relatively isolated communities and are often con ned to their homes due to violence and blood feuds (especially in northern Albania). The program has succeeded in getting mothers to accept the idea of schooling and socializing their children with those from other communities within the security of their mother's presence.BOX 3.4CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 39 All too often, the groups most in need of multicultural education\u2014those that are marginal and poor with high illiteracy rates\u2014are also the ones for which it is the most expensive and diffi cult to implement multicultural edu- cation. On the one hand, the German, the Hungarian, and, to some extent, the Turkish minorities in Eastern and Central Europe can access bilingual education fairly readily in most areas where they live. On the other hand, the Maya and Gayrani peoples of Latin America, the Roma in Europe, the San in southern Africa, and the Batwa in central Africa have more diffi culty in accessing bilingual education. Parent participation is a key to the success of multicultural education, largely because all education continues at home through the interest and support of parents. Mechanisms that facilitate parent involvement, such as school boards, monitoring committees, and parent-teacher associations, are all essential to quality multicultural education. Several evaluations of Bolivia's bilingual education program identifi ed organized participation as critical to the program's success because it has given meaning to and mobilized action in bilingual education in the country. The Educational Councils of Indigenous Peoples, defi ned by the Bolivia educational reform law of 1994, have demonstrated great potential in creating commitment at the local level. In New Zealand, the strong community ownership of the Maori language immersion program is seen as one of the most important ingredients in its success. Parent participation is particularly important in places where it is dif- fi cult to persuade municipal governments and the majority population that multicultural education benefi ts the whole community. Sometimes, the benefi ciaries themselves might be skeptical of the benefi ts of multi- cultural education and what it can offer their children (box 3.5). A close dialogue between school management and educational staff is essential so that implementation of reforms can take into account the perceptions and reactions of the local population. The participation of stakeholders other than parents is useful in devel- oping multicultural education as well. Local governments and teachers can feel intimidated by education reform, especially when it has the potential to change a community's power structure. In Latin America, for example, teacher unions have often opposed multicultural education; they see the recruitment of indigenous and local minority teachers as a threat to both their job stability and control. Strong parent and community support for reforms usually helps counterbalance the reluctance of conservative teacher unions.40 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Health Care Recent literature attributes the poor health of indigenous populations and some minorities partially to a lack of awareness by the medical establish-ment of cultural issues and partially to the cultural environment in which the patient understands the illness and the cure. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London argue that address-ing the indigenous health crisis requires a more holistic vision of health research and interventions. Health services, they say, should be integrated with an indigenous view of health and well-being. They also advocate con-tinued research on the health status of indigenous peoples, especially on incorporating indigenous perspectives on health into the design of health policies (Stephens and others 2005). In designing health care policies, cultural considerations go beyond rec- ognition of a country's specifi c minority and indigenous populations. In the United States, the concept of \"cultural competence\" was fi rst developed in the 1980s by mental health researchers to deal with the lack of attention given to culture in treatment. They defi ned this concept as a set of congru- ent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system or agency or among professionals that enables systems, agencies, and profes-sionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. This basic concept has since been adopted throughout the medical community and promoted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Considerations in Bilingual Education When assessing the impact of bilingual education, one must take into account how inter- ested a child is in learning a second language. This interest depends on issues of identity and the relevance of the second language. If the second language is seen as the language of the invader, as was the case for Russian in Baltic states under the Soviet Union, then not much energy will go into learning it (especially if a person can get by in society with-out mastering it). This will also be the case if a person doubts the second language will improve their livelihood. In Romania, members of the Hungarian minority often imagine themselves migrating to Hungary or another European Union country at some point in time\u2014these goals, understandably, do not encourage families to teach their children Romanian.BOX 3.5CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 41 The concept of cultural competency goes beyond cultural awareness or sensitivity. It represents the institutionalization of efforts to provide appro-priate programs or policies for diverse populations. A number of cultural competency techniques have been identifi ed in the United States that could potentially be used to decrease racial and ethnic disparities in health care; these include interpreter services, recruitment and retention policies, train-ing, coordinating the use of community health workers with traditional healers, culturally competent health promotion, the inclusion of family/community members, immersion in another culture, and administrative and organizational accommodation. Health care policies that take cultural diversity into account have two main components. The fi rst consists of measures aimed at recognizing the cultural background of a patient; the second consists of recognizing the value of a population's traditional curative practices. These components can be combined, but usually health care programs designed to reach minority groups with strong cultural specifi cities focus on the fi rst compo- nent alone. Taking cultural diversity into account in the health care context is consistent with recent trends in public health that emphasize favoring preventive approaches over curative medicine, and outreach and general practices over hospital care. Recognizing the Cultural Background of Patients Recognizing the connection between health and culture\u2014the way values and social norms inform the way people see their physical health\u2014is seen in many reforms of health care systems as essential for effective outreach and acceptance of medical care, and to make prevention and cure more effective. Many surveys show that lack of trust in the Western health care system, together with the high cost of treatment, is an important issue in the developing world (Bhopal 2007). Experience indicates that policy makers and practitioners need a better understanding of the relationship of wellness and illness to the body and mind in a specifi c culture. Many cultures do not view the mind and body as separate, as in Western medicine. Accounting for these philosophical dif-ferences entails both hiring health care workers who come from that par-ticular culture and ensuring that other public health specialists and person-nel understand what cure and wellness mean in specifi c cultural contexts. Because language can be a prohibitive barrier to health care, it is also essen-tial that health care personnel speak the language of the minority group, especially in areas where knowledge of the national language is limited.42 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Respect for the cultural particularities that inform a person's relation- ship with his or her body should be integrated into the public health sys-tem. Notably, such integration should take gender issues into account. In some societies, for instance, it is not acceptable for a woman to see a male doctor, and vice versa. Other cultural dictates, such as being separated from one's family, eating food prepared outside the home, and being unable to perform prayers, can be major obstacles to accepting a health care system. A corresponding problem faced by health care systems is that some of these practices might violate the health care industry's hygiene standards; in such cases, some trade-off needs to be made. Australia has made important inroads in adding cultural awareness to the training of doctors and nurses who work in aboriginal health care (Beaton 1994). Similarly, in 2001, the New Zealand Ministry of Health launched its Maori Health Strategy (He Korowai Oranga). The strategy identifi es a range of factors beyond simple health services that determine health outcomes, including socioeconomic conditions, environment, social and community infl uences, diet, risk factors, gender, and culture. One of the main innovations of the strategy is the introduction of Maori health providers, who are contracted to deliver services to the Maori population under the framework of the Maori governance and management structure; these personnel take Maori values and culture into account in service pro-vision (Ringold 2005). In Romania, the government has taken several measures to increase access to health care for Roma residents (box 3.6). These include actions that increase Roma participation in health insurance programs and pro- Roma Health Mediators in Roma Communities One of the most successful efforts aimed at improving the health care of Roma com- munities has been the introduction of Roma health mediators. This effort was started in 1997 by the Roma Center for Social Intervention and Studies NGO and was of cially adopted by the government in 2001. The health mediators help ease communication and understanding between Roma patients and medical staff. They are also charged with informing Roma communities about their rights regarding access to health care. In 2005, health mediators were active in 150 communities and facilitated access to health care for 38,000 Roma (Andreescu 2005).BOX 3.6CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 43 mote intercultural education for all categories of medical personnel. The government has also adopted affi rmative action measures (such as scholar- ships and training programs) to benefi t Roma in the health education sys- tem, hoping this will result in increased opportunities for Roma to become health care providers themselves. Recognizing the Importance of Traditional Medicine It is only recently that Western medical institutions have begun to pay attention to the important role traditional forms of medicine have played, and continue to play, in various parts of the world. It is now recognized that some practices, such as acupuncture, the use of medicinal plants, and manual therapies, can be very effective in the treatment of certain illnesses. Even some psycho-symbolic curative systems\u2014such as shamanism in Asia, traditional healing in Africa, and exorcism in Europe\u2014have been found to be effective in treating certain psychological disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses that traditional healing remains a vital part of the health care strategies of indigenous communities (WHO 2002). The report suggests that, as such, traditional healing should either be recog-nized as a parallel system, equal but separate (as in India), or be integrated into the education for and practice of mainstream medicine (as in Bhutan, China, and Vietnam). Many studies have documented how associating tra-ditional healers with Western medical practices has helped facilitate patient healing, in part because of the effectiveness of treatments but also because traditional methods offer a psychological and symbolic support Western medicine usually lacks (Yoder 1982). The WHO adopted a traditional medicine strategy for 2002-05 (WHO 2002). The strategy recognizes that traditional medicine is widely used and rapidly growing. The WHO estimates that in Africa, 80 percent of the pop-ulation uses traditional medicine; in China, traditional medicine represents 40 percent of delivered health care. In Malaysia, an estimated $500 million is spent annually on traditional health care compared to about $300 mil-lion on allopathic medicine. In Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Zambia, the fi rst line of treatment for 60 percent of children with malaria is herbal medi-cines administered at home (WHO 2002). The WHO concludes that two main reasons underlie the popularity of traditional medicine: it is accessible and affordable (compared with Western medicines), and it is embedded in wider belief systems. In Africa, the recognition of traditional medicines and healers has been linked in part to the emergency created by the AIDS epidemic. 3 Effective 44 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES outreach campaigns are hampered by the limited reach of the Western medical system in rural areas and the population's lack of trust in its cures, which are often seen viewed as foreign. In contrast, traditional healers are seen as effective promoters of practices that could decrease the AIDS epi-demic. What is needed is strong collaboration between traditional healers and Western medical practitioners. In 2000, an African Regional Strategy on Traditional Medicine was adopted to respond to this challenge. The strategy was followed by a plan of action for the Decade of Traditional Medicine, which was adopted by the African Union in 2005. The plan clearly mentions the potential role traditional healers can play in the battle against AIDS (African Union 2005). Ministers of health further confi rmed the role that traditional medicine can play in terms of health promotion, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, and declared 2001-10 the Decade of African Traditional Medicine. Supporting Collaboration between Traditional and Western Medicine The WHO traditional medicine strategy identifi es several challenges for states in recognizing and collaborating with traditional medicine: the weakness of national policy and regulatory frameworks, poorly under-stood safety considerations, management of effi cacy and quality issues, problems of access, and problems related to the rational use of traditional medicine. These challenges (and a variety of others; see box 3.7) must be taken into account in developing policies on the use of traditional medicine. Encouraging collaboration between traditional and Western medicine raises many issues, not least of which involves differing perceptions about the nature of a human being and a human's relationship to sickness and disease. Traditional medicine views the human being as embedded in a symbolic and cultural environment; it tends to favor treatments that focus not on the body per se but on the relation of the patient to the environment. Traditional medicines seek an equilibrium of the mind, the body, and the environment and emphasize health rather than disease. Practitioners tend to focus on the overall condition of the patient rather than on any particu-lar ailments or diseases from which he or she is suffering (WHO 2002). In contrast, the Western medical establishment has historically avoided such a holistic approach, and most medical school programs do not cover holistic medicine. Additional proof of the value of traditional medicine is currently being sought, although a number of good studies have already demon-strated its effi cacy in specifi c circumstances. The WHO strategy supports CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 45 an increasing effort to further research traditional medicines by putting them through serious medical trials.4 Another major concern involves the credibility and legitimacy of tra- ditional healers, especially in urban centers where acculturation is strong. Traditional healers are usually known in the community and are under some sort of collective control. People know who healers receive their knowledge from, how effective they have been in curing members of the community, and how legitimate they are according to local tradition and institutions. However, people may appoint themselves as healers for eco-nomic or political reasons, without any community control or input; this is particularly true in urban centers where community control is often reduced, and community checks and balances have been eroded. Traditional medicine can be effective in the fi eld of psychiatry because of the highly symbolic and cultural nature of some psychological illnesses. However, some approaches to healing can have a negative impact on society, particularly those that involve or invoke witchcraft or ostracize affected individuals. Such confl icts tend to be worse in environments where Traditional Medicines, Contemporary Issues U.S. and European pharmaceutical laboratories are actively involved in the study of tra- ditional medicinal plants in Latin America and Asia, often in collaboration with national research institutions. Many governments have signed collaborative agreements on this type of research, but little attention has been paid to the property rights of those communities knowledgeable about these plants. In response, a number of associations have been created to organize the preservation of traditional medicinal knowledge. For example, the Organizaci\u00f3n de Medicos Ind\u00edgenas del Estado de Chiapas de Organizaciones de Medicos y Parteras Ind\u00edgenas de Chiapas in Mexico ac-tively promote recognition of the rights of traditional medicine. In the last decade, similar associations have developed around the world to further facilitate relations among traditional healers, the state, and the private sector. Interest in medicinal plants has implications for biodiversity conservation as well. Many of these plants are rare and are grown in very circumscribed environments, and overharvesting can quickly result in extinction. For this reason, many research institutions are conducting detailed inventories of medicinal plants and creating informal policies of protection along with environmental safeguards.BOX 3.746 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES acculturation is stronger, such as large urban centers. In the Republic of Congo, for example, street children have recently been accused of practic-ing witchcraft. In many countries, referral systems are weakened by the lack of commu- nication between Western caregivers and traditional healers. Without an effective system of referral, people might be dissuaded from using Western medicine, even when it is available. In contrast, when Western medicine is unreliable or of very low quality, some traditional medicine can be effec-tive; again, referral is usually lacking. Ideally, practitioners of both types of medicines should coordinate with each other to offer clients reliable refer-rals. Medical doctors and nurses should be understanding and respectful of what traditional medicine can offer, and vice versa. To achieve this, more research is needed on both medicinal plants and practices that accompany the prescription of these plants by traditional healers. Some university and medical school curricula address traditional practices, as is the case in China, where acupuncture is studied in medical programs. In practice, the traditional and Western medical communities more often ignore each other rather than collaborate. This is an area where much more effort is needed, especially in organizing primary health care and outreach. Cultural Services Being able to express one's culture in collective manifestations such as fes-tivals, dances, and religious and musical ceremonies, as well as through the preservation of local knowledge and cultural patrimony, is important for strengthening identity. Festivals are particularly important in this regard by providing a symbolic representation of a culture rooted in actual events and celebration. These various activities create bonds among members of a community, strengthen social capital, foster a sense of pride, and help achieve a collective recognition of one's identity. Local governments can do much to support such cultural services, and indeed can benefi t economically through their provision (for example, in terms of tourism generated). Local provision of cultural services to support collective identity is thus far an understudied subject. Most assessments have examined the effi cacy of community participation in preserving cul- tural heritage and in the development of community-based tourism. Yet the nature of demand for cultural services at the local level, and how local gov-ernments answer these needs, is rarely studied. The literature review carried CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 47 out for this book has shown that, with the exception of some NGOs that try to document this demand, very little has been done.5 How Local Cultural Services Can Strengthen Identity The types of activities usually supported are (1) festivals, celebrations that feature music, dances, processionals, traditional sports, religious activities, and concerts; (2) exhibitions and shows; (3) classes in traditional dance, music, art, traditional sports, and local industries; (4) preservation of local heritage and monuments through museums displays, collections, local knowledge (such as tales and oral traditions), culinary traditions, local medicinal traditions, small traditional trade, crafts, cooking, and dress; and (5) local radio and television stations aimed at preserving a culture and specifi c identity. These activities are often promoted by associations, small development projects, and NGOs, but are best when they remain a living activity in the community. Others can be added, but these fi ve categories cover the bulk of demand for cultural services. These activities have an important economic element. Cultural industries can be highly lucrative, especially for isolated communities with few devel-opment options. The explosive popularity of tourism around the world\u2014and in particular, of ecological and cultural tourism\u2014has generated strong interest in cultural industries that come from remote regions, along with a fascination for \"exotic\" items produced in the developing world. Global-ization has placed traditional craft trade among the world's fastest growing industries, providing millions of dollars in earnings to developing countries. For example, Kenyan and Burkina Be baskets can now be found all over Europe. Similarly, Morocco's growth has been fuelled by a sharp increase in demand for native craft items, resulting in a boom in cities such as Fez and Marrakech. Indian crafts are being sold everywhere in the world, cre-ating huge opportunities for the poorer communities that produce them. But this increase in trade raises signifi cant property rights issues. For example, Navajo baskets are produced in Pakistan to be sold to tourists near the Navajo reservation in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Pakistan's produc-tion costs are half those of a Navajo artisan. Similarly, traditional Mayan pots are produced in a factory in Mexico City. A different property rights issue is illustrated by the case of the traditional Taiwanese indigenous music which was featured as part of an anthem for the Atlanta Olympic Games\u2014without the musicians' knowledge. Livelihood sustainability is another major issue that accompanies increased tourism. For example, tourists have fl ocked to Masai villages in 48 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Kenya; as a result, the Masai have stopped taking care of their cows and fi elds because they can make much more money from posing for photos than they could earn from farming. This example shows in a small way how external interest in a culture has the potential to weaken that culture very quickly. Several countries have proactively developed local-level cultural ser- vices. In Guatemala, for example, a national congress on cultural policies was organized following the election of President Alfonso Portillo Cabrera in 2000. Participants included all major NGOs, associations, and local and central governments. The conference produced guidelines for developing the country's cultural policies; it also defi ned cultural policy as that which is rooted in the cultural values, cosmologies, modes of behaviors, beliefs, and actions of the various peoples of Guatemala. The guidelines put forth a variety of recommendations for increasing local participation in cultural policies and programs (Davis 2004). Another example comes from Australia, where the Ministry for the Arts and the Ministry for Local Government produced cultural planning guidelines to help local governments recognize the signifi cance of culture in the community. The cultural planning tool stresses the value dimen-sion of culture: relationships, shared memories, experience and identity, diverse backgrounds, values, and aspirations (Government of New South Wales 2006). In Albania, one of the strongest demands heard from Roma associations during poverty assessment consultations was the creation of Roma cultural centers, places where Roma could organize activities around education, folk dance, music, festivals, counseling, and other cultural activities. The government discussed these demands in 2002, at the country's fi rst large consultation on Roma issues (De Soto and others 2002). Supporting Community Initiatives Local government can play a strong role as facilitator and supporter of community initiatives, and as manager of potential confl icts that can arise when other cultures view these manifestations as too intrusive. Providing space, helping with logistics and organization, and providing a supportive legal and administrative environment are often the most necessary services a government can offer. Commercializing a living culture is a risky endeavor that requires careful management. Here again, central\u2014and local\u2014governments have a key role to play. A fi rst priority is to protect cultural property rights. CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 49 Governments should adopt a policy that ensures communities are entitled to a substantial share of the profi ts or other proceeds reaped from their traditions. Private sector involvement is positive when it brings know-how and a network of connections and markets. If this involvement is not prop-erly managed, however, it can deny the local population their share of economic benefi ts. This issue has been increasingly raised to government authorities and the private sector by community groups, associations, and local NGOs. People are at risk of missing out on the economic benefi ts their culture may reap if cultural property is not actively protected. 6 An even greater risk for a local community is to face rapid acculturation under the pressure of tourism and to be irrevocably changed by the con-sumerist needs of the growing tourist industry. Tourists are often genuinely interested in the culture of the region they visit, but tend to lack awareness of the damage their visit can do. Craftsmanship is often eroded very rapidly by the strong commercial pressure to adapt to the demands of a different culture and the need to sell goods cheaply. Tourism can also generate abuse of, or a lack of respect for, sacred spaces and customs, and contribute to anti-foreigner feelings. Local government has an important role to play in knowing what pieces of the local culture to share with tourists and which pieces to preserve for the local community only. An example of this comes from the Hopi Indian mesas in Arizona. While tourists are welcome, a large part of the village is off limits to them. Furthermore, tourists may only visit with a guide and are not allowed to be present for the most important ceremonies and rituals. Tourists are also banned from communities after a certain time of day. This is a good example of how local governments can ensure their community collectively benefi ts from cultural expression and assets, and how the nega- tive effect of commercialization can be minimized. Delivering Services through Traditional Local Governance Systems Delivering services in multicultural environments usually raises the ques-tion of how to tap local community-based institutions and existing com-munity-level traditional governance systems. On the one hand, making use of institutions that are embedded in the local culture helps preserve the cohesion of the group at the community level because people already understand and trust them; on the other hand, these systems might not 50 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES be accepted by everyone in the community, might not be effective, and might be infl uenced by evolving power structures within their communi- ties. Additionally, they might exclude some groups, as they tend to be patri-archal and to marginalize women, young people, and those who belong to lower castes or social groups. The world has many examples of such institutions and systems, which serve such functions as delivering justice, mediating confl icts, organizing community work, organizing festivals and religious celebrations, and orga-nizing and regulating trade. They are often used by central and local gov-ernments to administer small rural communities, distribute humanitarian assistance, ensure security, and manage certain basic services. Bolivia, along with several other countries, recently attempted to give a much larger role to these institutions in service delivery and to involve them in the imple-mentation of large national programs (Waters 2007). This section looks specifi cally at local community councils to illustrate both the advantages and risks of involving local institutions in service delivery. The Role of Local Community Councils One of the most common forms of local governance is the council of elders, which is generally charged with managing community life and essential services. In Albania, the fi s\u2014the council of elders who administered villages and, in some cases, urban communities\u2014took on an increasingly important role to compensate for the collapse of such formal institutions as collec-tive farms and municipal governments after the fall of the communist state (box 3.8). It also became responsible for administering justice and managing local confl icts in many areas of the country. In Madagascar, the fokonolona , a village council made up of elders and other local notables, became so important it was given constitutional recognition in 1975. In Indonesia in 1999, the provincial government of West Sumatra issued a regulation that reinstated the nafgari as the basic governing unit. Before being disbanded by Soeharto, the nafgari system had operated as the basic governance unit of the Minangkabau society in that region. The system's structure and function are quite democratic and clearly delineated; it reg- ulates and implements both formal and traditional systems of gover-nance through its general assembly of traditional authorities. CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 51 Over the course of the 1990s, many Latin American countries recog- nized traditional governance mechanisms for indigenous municipalities. The system is based on the principle of duties of offi ce (sistema de cargo ). The most important decisions are made in village assemblies, and those responsible for various religious and civil functions are nomi-nated by the assembly after deliberation. Council members are not usually elected but rather are nominated after community discussions that are more or less open to all community mem-bers (the participation of women and youth varies greatly according to local custom). Nomination can refl ect a person's importance in a clan or subgroup of the community, or important contributions to the community the person has made or can make. In many places, council members are also part of the community's religious life. In rural Africa, for example, many elders are part of secret religious societies. In Muslim countries, the local mullah will usually play a very important role on the council, as will the shaman and main offi cials representing local religions in Latin America. Today, many councils have added new structures that permit the increased participation of women, youth, and important economic actors. In some cases, these take the form of new committees. In other cases, new The Return of the Kanun and the Fis in Albania An interesting case that illustrates reliance on local institutions and local customary law is the return of the s and of the Kanun in northern Albania following the fall of the Albanian communist regime. Local communities there faced a massive collapse of state structures, and so resurrected the use of the Kanun, a body of customary law that had been partly collected and written down in the 14th century. The law is aimed at regulating relations among members of communities. The Kanun is implemented by the s, which is comprised of the most respected and experienced men in the community. The Kanun has helped restore order and some economic activity, but has a major gender and age bias. Also, because it recognizes the right of revenge, it has actually led to the rise of blood feuds between some families and has fostered a culture of fear and suspicion, with many negative impacts on local development. Now that the state has regained its authority and some of its legitimacy, the Kanun is used less often but has not completely disappeared.BOX 3.852 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES members may be added to the council of elders under the infl uence of dynamic members of the community, government, or development agen-cies. Sometimes, these changes are introduced by development programs and are either rejected or slowly integrated by the communities. The Keca-matan Development Program in Indonesia, for instance, uses local informal councils for making decisions on the use of funds it provides to the com-munities, but has encouraged the creation of parallel women's groups that decide on the use of some of the funds for projects that are a priority for women (Guggenheim and others 2004). This approach was successfully replicated in the Afghanistan National Solidarity Program, the largest com-munity-based program implemented in Afghanistan (World Bank 2009). Sometimes, the traditional structure adapts and becomes a hybrid. In his analysis of electoral systems in Mexican communities, David Recondo has shown how traditional, custom-based governance systems can integrate the electoral principle of modern democracies: The constant exchange between traditional voting, in which consecra- tion takes precedence over selection, and universal suffrage, secret and individual, proves to what extent election modes are neither instrumental techniques devoid of inherent values, nor the product of an ontological otherness that would make it impossible to embed them in differing cul-tural contexts (Recondo 2007, p. 178). The confi guration of village councils has certainly changed over time, even if rigid structures that are embedded in the culture\u2014for example those in the Pacifi c islands\u2014are not evolving as fast. Newly powerful religious groups, such as the Pentecostals in Latin America or Islamist groups in the Middle East, can further infl uence how local governance is structured and operates\u2014in some cases, these emergent groups have even hijacked them. This is the case as well with political parties, such as the Partido Revolu-cionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico that has, through its clientelist net-work, managed to control nominations at public functions in self-govern-ing villages. In some cases, local governance systems have also been used by dictatorial regimes to bypass national democratic institutions. Because of the large spectrum of local governance mechanisms, it is diffi cult to draw more precise generalizations about their roles and structure. Involving Local Councils in Service Delivery In some cases, the state does not have much choice but to recognize tradi- tional governance systems, especially if it cannot afford to develop a new CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 53 bureaucracy in a remote region. Often, using local governance mecha- nisms to manage the needs of small communities is the safest and most cost-effective option when the government does not have the means to develop a new local apparatus. In countries where a large section of the population has limited access to basic services, using local institutions that have established credibility and proven functionality is the most cost-effective way of governing. Many states, such as Ethiopia, are not able to offer outreach to the whole country and therefore must rely on local systems. If the traditional structure offers some continuity and at least some form of local checks and balances, it is more effective to use it than to create new structures, even if the government has the fi nancial means to do so. Many English-speaking countries in the developing world, for instance, have continued the indirect rule tradition put in place by the British colonials of letting local matters be managed by local institutions. Ghana, for instance, has maintained the chieftain structure and has rec-ognized it in its constitution even as it has strengthened local govern-ment structures. When the government has more effective services, as in Mexico, the use of local governance systems is seen as a way of ensuring fuller participation of groups with cultural specifi city\u2014that is, mostly indigenous communities. Using local governance structures requires an understanding of the philosophy that underlies the management structure . Local governance systems are the organizational expression of societal values and, as such, represent a certain vision of power sharing by assigning specifi c roles to different members of society. They usually emphasize individual duties toward the community, which can be a very different emphasis than that of the nation-state system, which focuses on links between an individual and society at large (box 3.9). It is often a mistake to assume that, once in place, local management structures will ensure the full participation of citizens and shield them from political and other external interests. There are many cases in which a com-munity has been manipulated by outside forces, such as the state, political parties, religious groups, or other institutions that were not historically part of the community. When the local culture experiences rapid change, the community is often not strong enough to counteract such manipula-tion. Using local councils to deliver services to the population usually requires a good political/economic assessment of the councils to determine 54 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES how representative they are of the community members\u2014in particular, their representation of women, youth, migrants, and lower caste and other social groups; the types of decisions and activities the local community entrusts to them; the alignment of their role, functions, and decision-making process with existing national legal systems and institutions (box 3.9 clearly illus-trates the problems of a lack of alignment); their capacity and ability to understand the technical aspects of the activities they might be required to assume. Notes 1. African languages are usually used as the medium of instruction in lower pri- mary schools; several countries (Botswana, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Lesotho, Mada-gascar, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda) have reportedly extended African language instruction to middle and upper primary levels.Local Governance versus National Citizenship in Totontepec, Mexico In her study of management practices in Totontepec, a small Mexican town inhabited by the indigenous Mixe people, Morales (2005) describes an event that illustrates how local governance principles can clash with national citizenship. In 1982, Pascacio, a member of the Totontepec community, was nominated by an assembly of citizens to take responsi-bility for the village water committee, but he refused the job. According to the custom-ary rules of local governance, the responsibilities are not remunerated; members of the community are obligated to donate their time. In a general assembly, the community decided that because Pascacio refused to ful ll his duties, he should be banned. Pascacio was denied access to his house and his land. He protested to the governor, pointing out that his treatment was in violation of his constitutional right to protect his individual property. When the head of the community was summoned by the regional governor and asked to let Pascacio reenter his house, the head refused; he said that the law al-lowed his community to self-rule, and Pascacio was in violation of custom. The issue was resolved, more or less, when Pascacio went to live in another community.BOX 3.9CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SERVICE DELIVERY 55 2. For a more in-depth understanding of the debate on multicultural education, see Banks (2001) and Webster (1997). 3. See Gibbal (1984) on the rapid development of traditional medicine in Africa. 4. In this regard, the WHO (2002) highlights a study undertaken by Peru's Na- tional Program in Complementary Medicine and the Pan American Health Organization, which compared traditional medicine and allopathic medicine practices through systematic follow-up of 339 patients for one year. Treat-ments of the following pathologies were analyzed: moderate osteoarthritis, back pain, anxiety-based neuroses, asthma, peptic acid disease, tension mi-graine headache, exogenous obesity, and peripheral facial analysis. The overall cost-effectiveness of traditional medicine was 53 to 63 percent higher than that of conventional treatments for selected pathologies. 5. Traditions for Tomorrow is one such NGO. It is a Swiss organization, with French and U.S. subsidiaries, which fi nances projects aimed at strengthening the cultural identity of local communities, mostly in Latin America. It was created in 1986 and fi nances small projects around the continent, responding to the needs of local groups and communities. According to its statutes, Tradi-tions for Tomorrow works to improve dignity, self-esteem, and confi dence in communities that will consequently be better positioned to take an active role in their own development. 6. For more on the topic of property rights and cultural traditions, see Posey and Dutfi eld (1996) and Coombe (2005).57CHAPTER 4 Designing and Implementing Policies That Support Cultural Diversity in Service Delivery It is diffi cult to come up with clear-cut policy recommendations for incor- porating cultural diversity into service delivery. Impact analysis of the poli- cies and programs that support cultural diversity is still very limited; also, this is a relatively new topic for governments and international organiza- tions. Consequently, the best way to nurture cultural diversity at the local level while at the same time preserving cohesion, striving for equity, and avoiding confl ict is still open to debate. The nascent theory of multiculturalism states that recognizing and acknowledging cultural diversity will help achieve cohesion and equity, and its negation will do the reverse. This recognition must be carefully managed by governments, political authorities, and community members themselves. Culture and identity are highly volatile and must be handled with care. Actions that support cultural diversity must be integrated into general social and economic policies in order to be effective. The strategy is not to develop parallel policies, but to make cultural diversity a mainstream priority for government policies and programs. In short, cultural diversity is handled best when integrated into overall social and economic policies. Countries are increasingly approving international treaties aimed at rec- ognizing cultural diversity and are actively introducing the concept into their constitutions and overarching legal frameworks. These actions have been taken at the prodding of international organizations such as the UN, and have been guided by success stories emerging from such countries as Canada, New Zealand, and Spain (Kymlicka 1995, 2007). However, transforming these broad legislative frameworks into effective policies and programs for basic service delivery has proven problematic. This chapter 58 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES provides some recommendations for the design of policies and programs regarding the delivery of basic services that take cultural diversity into account with the goal of increasing social cohesion and inclusion. A Conceptual Framework to Guide Policies When designing policies that nurture cultural diversity, it is important to make sure everyone involved has a common understanding of what culture is. As noted earlier, culture is not static; rather, it is always in a process of change and hybridization following contact with other cultures. These changes may occur quickly or slowly, but they are always ongoing. Global-ization has accelerated cultural change, and this has affected all cultures. Today, it is impossible to completely isolate one culture from another, and increasingly, people tend to consider themselves cultural \"hybrids.\" It is therefore essential to see individuals as being under the infl uence of mul- tiple value systems rather than a single one. But it is also clear that people do not just adopt the culture they like. Culture is in large part a legacy of one's family and of the social structure under which one lives. A particularly important aspect of a culture is how it defi nes relations between individuals (that is, the individual dimension of a human being) and others (that is, the collective dimension of a human being). Sociology teaches that a human being aspires both to stand alone, to be the master of his or her own destiny; and to be part of a larger group, to be in tune with others, to recognize and be recognized by others. These confl icting aspirations shape the inherent tensions inside a society: a person wants to be an individual, and yet wants to be part of others. All cultures offer ways to manage this tension, providing institutions that help balance these aspirations. Some focus more on the collective/group dimension, favoring the integrating factors; others focus more on individual aspirations, such as the freedom to choose and actualize one's own life. A culture may move between these two poles over time, but cultures tend to differ with regard to how they relate individual with collective aspirations. The relationship between the individual and the collective has changed in recent history. The community, or collective, has been replaced by a much broader society in which most interactions between the group and the individual take place. This shift has accelerated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In a community, there is a direct relationship with all members of the group; people can actually have contact with every DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 59 one in the community and can communicate one-on-one. Group mem- bers' individual aspirations are in large part defi ned by these interactions. When societies grow to the state or nation level, interactions with oth-ers in society change. Yet the collective dimension remains internalized in people's imaginations because, in practice, members of a society can never all meet together, and because power relationships are not personifi ed but expressed in broad institutions. This type of social organization has unleashed the individual aspira- tions of its members. Roles and positions are not set by others but are reached through competition, and in a much less personalized way than in a community. The European enlightenment philosophy has been an impor-tant milestone in this shift, formalizing key concepts such as human rights, democratic representation, and the nation-state in both its symbolic and pragmatic aspects. These concepts defi ne the governments and policies that are now in place in most countries. The enlightenment philosophers went far in thinking through the legal and institutional framework establishing a new relationship between indi-vidual aspirations and the group. The group is no longer the community, but has morphed into a society. As a result, the traditional symbolic events that brought community members together are replaced with symbolic events that create a collective imagination. This process gives the nation-state a reality of its own. Today, the nation-state is increasingly considered just one societal refer- ence for its people, who experience their symbolic references outside of this structure, even if the nation-state remains the defi ning framework for many policies, at least legally. This evolution has been described by some psychol-ogists and sociologists as individuation\u2014 the growing importance of indi- vidual (human) rights, the freedom to shape one's own destiny within one's own lifetime, and the ability to decide what part of a group one wishes to join. Such thinking informs the movements that support, for example, equality between men and women, increased recognition of youth, and the recognition of minority rights. These ideas may seem abstract, but they have strong relevance for policy making. Assessing how collective and individual aspirations are going to interact when institutions or practices from a specifi c culture are integrated in the delivery of services is an important fi rst step for policy making. Understanding how these institutions and practices infl uence the power structure in a community\u2014and, more broadly, the functioning of existing institutions\u2014is critical.60 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES The second step is to understand how different systems that express a society's cultural diversity will work together. Usually, these are not all based on the same set of values. The cases reviewed here show that contradictions often arise because some practices are not based on nationally shared val-ues and visions of society. Social assessments can offer some understanding of these issues, but must go far beyond simply asking for opinions\u2014they should also use observations to arrive at an understanding of the internal dynamic of a group and its interaction with the majority culture. No Universal Solutions Only the most incurably visionary analyst would claim that foolproof, universally applicable formulas for accommodation of ethnic diversity exist. Policy experiences resemble balance sheets, rather than triumphant lists of accomplishments; in all spheres we investigate, there are liabilities as well as assets. The cultural circumstances of given polities vary widely; the many small, localized ethnic identities of Papua New Guinea, for in-stance, bear little resemblance to the intensely mobilized ethno-national collectivities in former Yugoslavia (Young 1998, p. 7). Crawford Young expresses a view that has been confi rmed in the experi- ences reviewed here. World situations are too varied to establish a detailed universal framework for taking cultural diversity into account when deliv-ering services. However, certain basic rules seem to apply: Culturally diverse policies should not be pursued from the top down only; they require a bottom-up approach as well. Policies cannot be driven solely by elites. The intended local benefi cia- ries, especially the poor, need to understand how these policies seek to improve their day-to-day lives. Cultural diversity cannot be solely a matter of law and its implementa- tion; deep institutional changes are also required. Like any institutional reform, recognizing a minority culture is a process that must be managed over time. Cultures adapt and change, and fl exible policies allow corrections and adaptations to be made along the way. Understanding Political Motivations When a country decides to recognize different cultures and shape its ser-vices accordingly, there are undoubtedly political motivations in play. DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 61 There are many reasons why political forces might want to support such an agenda, and some can be motivated by interests that actually go against those of the group(s) in question. For example, cultural diversity is often the target of populist agendas: because such policies touch on symbolic identities, they can create strong political division. It is therefore important that political motivations be clear, at least in the mind of the technocrats who design the policies. A country's sense of itself in the world and in history can often provide a clue as to its political receptivity to cultural diversity policy development. Hungary, for instance, has moved aggressively to recognize the specifi c cultural identities of its minorities in terms of both service delivery and political representation. Its motivation has stemmed less from any internal problems encountered with its minorities, which are few in number and generally well integrated, but rather from a desire to protect and support Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries. Hungary could not advo-cate the case of Hungarian minorities abroad without providing a positive example of leadership in this regard in its own country. Turkey, on the other hand, has strongly resisted recognition of its minorities, which include not only Kurds but also Greeks, Jews, Orthodox Christians, and Alevists. This attitude is a legacy of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which fell apart mostly as the result of uprisings by its many minorities, supported more or less effectively by European nations. This context makes cultural diversity and the recognition of cultural rights a very diffi cult political issue in that nation. It is important to see the problem of cultural diversity in terms of its political signifi cance. An example comes from Guatemala, where under- neath the issue of recognizing cultural differences lies the very delicate mat-ter of inequitable repartitioning of land. Many Indian communities view this as straightforward spoliation. Trying to resolve the tensions among indigenous populations, whites, and mestizos by recognizing cultural diver- sity will not be suffi cient. Policies that support more equal distribution of assets\u2014in particular, land\u2014will be essential. Understanding political factors requires knowing the specifi c source of the demand for adapting services to local culture. Even though smaller, minority groups are no more homogenous than a given majority culture. In some instances, those advocating for cultural diversity may not represent the will of the community. An urban elite of a minority group may cham-pion instruction in native languages on the basis of cultural continuity and tradition, while the main population is usually more pragmatic. Field 62 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES surveys have revealed that parents want children to learn what is useful in the labor market and are skeptical of whether it is valuable to teach native languages in school (Moodley 2001). Policy makers should not assume that minority advocates are in tune with all members of their group. Recognizing cultural diversity can create political opportunities for elites of a minority. This is not always a negative effect, but it can be so in political systems that tend to encourage nepotism and corruption. The PRI in Mexico has co-opted much of the indigenous leadership in this way. PRI behavior very rarely benefi ts the development of the population it rep- resents. Solid analysis of the political economy of cultural diversity at the local level is thus essential prior to implementing cultural diversity pro-grams; this is particularly true when using local governance systems for service delivery. Integrated and Multisectoral Approaches Making and implementing policies that effectively recognize cultural diver-sity spans multiple sectors and requires multiple products and programs. To take a simple example, creating educational environments that support a native language does not make much sense if the students will never use this language outside of narrow family circles; conversely, asking health workers to speak a local language that is not taught in schools is similarly futile. It is illogical to recognize customary law, but not the language in which the law is expressed and applied. Consequently, recognizing cultural diversity usually means working on a package of policies and services. To be effective, cultural diversity must be integrated into comprehensive sectoral policies. For example, teaching the language, history, geography, and arts of a specifi c cultural group should be included in overall educa- tion policy and programs. Recognizing elements of customary law should be included in broader legal reforms, and recognizing local governance systems should be included in decentralization policies. All of these policies and programs must be coordinated so they work together for the benefi t of the local population. This coordination is not easy, as some sectors move faster than others, or some might experience more resistance than others. All too often, policies and programs aimed at recognition of cultural diver-sity and cultural identity are designed in a piecemeal fashion. When policies have been effective, they have usually been multisectoral and coordinated at the highest level of government. New Zealand is an DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 63 interesting example of a government that has considerably improved the living standards of its indigenous population through an integrated and multisectoral approach. It has provided this support by combining policies that promote positive cultural recognition and active political participation with more traditional policies aimed at increasing access to social services and employment. As for political representation, in 1996, New Zealand reformed its electoral system to introduce a \"mixed-member\" proportional system. Consequently, the Maori have representation in the parliament, and are in fact today better represented on a per capita basis than the majority population. Efforts in the fi eld of education have had similarly impressive results. By 2003, 88 percent of Maori students entering primary school had attended some form of early childhood education or child care. In 1986, an esti-mated 47 percent of 16-year-old Maoris were in school; this increased to 63 percent by 2003\u2014infl uenced also by an increase of the age at which students left school (from 15 to 16) in the early 1990s. In 2003, the share of Maori who left school without qualifi cations fell to 30 percent, down from 38 percent in 1990. Finally, tertiary education participation has expanded exponentially from 7 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in 2003. The active labor market policies also proved fruitful, as Maori employ- ment has rebounded from the recession of the early 1990s. More Maori are participating in the labor force, and unemployment has reached a record low of 8 percent. This was closely correlated with a revitalization of Maori culture. It has included increased support for Maori language and cultural development: today, 42 percent of Maori adults have some level of com-petency in Reo, the Maori language. Participation in Maori immersion schools and bilingual programs has increased, and, across the board, many local traditions have experienced renewal. It is very diffi cult to show how each of these policies has contributed to the improvement of living standards for the Maori population. But it is clear that where the combinations of these three policies were imple-mented, between 1997-98 and 2003-04, the share of Maori with no or low incomes declined while the share with incomes above a peak level of $550 per week increased (Ringold 2005). In Guatemala, where the 2002 peace accords enabled consideration for the fi rst time of the indigenous population as a whole, the country tackled the issue by integrating virtually all relevant sectors (even if some were more contentious than others) and thereby created a set of improved and coherent policies to support the indigenous population. 64 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Establishing National Frameworks for Managing Cultural Diversity It would be a relatively simple matter to pilot demonstration programs addressing cultural diversity in service delivery at the local level. Yet such programs would not be effective without a clear policy and legislative framework in place at the national level to lend legitimacy and provide a solid basis to the initiative. Numerous organizations\u2014including the UN, the Council of Europe, and the Organization of American States\u2014have, as discussed in chapter 2, developed various treaties and conventions on cultural diversity. These provide a rationale, a set of reasons, for signatory countries in developing and adopting multicultural policies within a coher-ent and comprehensive framework of their own. Such a framework signals the national government's commitment to cultural diversity and provides an organizational tool for coordinating sectoral policies. The issues involved in cultural diversity policy making\u2014efforts to rec- ognize customary law, introduce native language classes in public schools, recognize local governance systems, and so on\u2014often require fundamental legal changes. These changes can be so sweeping that countries have had to modify or adapt their constitutions to accommodate them. 1 For example, Romania, under pressure from the European Union and the Council of Europe, in 1989 launched a process for establishing a national framework to recognize cultural diversity. Various offi cial docu- ments were developed to establish directions for the government to contribute to the development of ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguis- tic identity; fi ght discrimination and promote tolerance; stress cultural diversity values; stimulate interethnic dialogue; eliminate any form of extremism, chauvinism, and anti-Semitism; improve the situation of the Roma population and continue to imple- ment policies aimed at reducing social exclusion. The government has been working on an overall legal framework to effectively support national minority institutions, along with a law to ensure that Romania is in line with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is also working to create a legal framework for the use of local languages in decentralized state structures (Andreescu 2005). Adaptation of a national legislative basis is rarely suffi cient to ensure its implementation. In most cases, national institutions also need to be DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 65 changed. To this end, some countries have created ministries or a state secretariat to oversee issues relating to minorities. Hungary, for example, has a state secretary for minority issues; New Zealand has a ministry for Maori development. Experience has shown, however, that issues related to recognizing cultural diversity seem to be best managed by the relevant sectoral ministries. For their part, specialized secretariats and ministries dedicated to minority affairs can be effective in developing multisectoral programs. They are also often better positioned to establish participatory mechanisms and interact with civil society and associations charged with minority issues. Some countries have established permanent commissions to design multicultural policies in accordance with an overall vision; this is the approach taken by the Peace and Reconciliation Commission in Guate-mala. These multicultural institutions work best when they have the ability to assess the impact of policies on benefi ciaries and report problems to the central government in a timely manner. Establishing Clarity in Decentralization Frameworks It is generally accepted that policies for cultural diversity are better imple-mented in countries with some degree of decentralization (Kymlicka 1995). However, without a strong push from central government, decentralization alone is likely insuffi cient to support cultural diversity, particularly as expe- rience also shows that it is at the local level that stereotypes, stigma, and discrimination tend to be the strongest because this is the level at which day-to-day confrontations between cultures occur. For example, opposi-tion to discrimination against lower castes in India was initiated and pro-mulgated with major involvement from the central government, especially through civil service employment and rules on political representation in national assemblies. Regions built on this foundation, following up with effective local projects dealing with access to services. The classic problems with decentralization need to be taken into account in making services more responsive to cultural diversity. These drawbacks include the lack of separation of responsibilities across vari-ous levels of government, the tendency to devolve problems to the local government without providing suffi cient fi nancial and institutional sup- port for their resolution, and absence of local municipal management. Major bottlenecks at the local level in program implementation frequently derive from a lack of clear understanding of what is needed, along with 66 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES little if any institutional support in terms of communication, advice, train- ing, guidelines, capacity building, and fi nancing. The World Bank's public expenditure review in Guatemala, for example, found that decentralization has helped services adapt to variations in local needs, tastes, and cultural traditions but has also led to increased inequality in the distribution of public services because poorer jurisdictions lack the institutional capacity and fi nancial resources to manage new responsibilities effectively (World Bank 2005). Another common problem is the lack of clear political will to imple- ment national multicultural policies at the local level, especially when these aim to change the balance of community power. Where various communi-ties live in the same territory and under the aegis of the same municipal or regional authority, some groups strongly resist the recognition of the cultural specifi city of other minority groups. For example, many policies regarding Roma integration are blocked at the local level. Involvement of Concerned Sociocultural Groups Because policies and programs that support cultural diversity directly affect societal norms, values, and local power structures as well as infl uence relations between the individual and the group, stakeholder participation is essential to their successful introduction. There must be commitment to and support for these changes, and any communities that might be nega-tively affected by such policy changes should be compensated. Involve-ment of the relevant socioeconomic group can occur at a variety of levels throughout the process of making and implementing policy: The target benefi ciaries can be consulted early on to determine their view of the service and delivery mechanisms; this can be performed through a variety of mechanisms including polls, surveys, and meetings. The target group can be engaged in a discussion aimed at reform of the service and its delivery, with various options presented and debated. This information can be gleaned through the same mechanisms as above or through referendum. Communities can be engaged in service implementation through tradi- tional governance systems or various other mechanisms for participa-tion. The relevant communities can be involved in the monitoring and evalu- ation of services once implemented. They can provide their feedback DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 67 and rate service delivery through such mechanisms as score cards, opin- ion surveys, or focus groups. Their input should be elicited regarding how to use the results of the fi ndings. The stakeholders that need to be involved in policy/program prepara- tion include representatives from various levels of government and from different groups. At the national level, political representatives of various organizations, NGOs, and associations that represent minority interests must establish an active and ongoing dialogue. Countries that have devel-oped a framework for multicultural policies usually also have established mechanisms that encourage participation and consultation at the national level. The Romanian constitution, for example, recognizes the right of eth-nic minorities to be politically represented in the parliament. Similarly, in New Zealand, a quota of seats is reserved for Maori representatives. At the local level, processes that encourage participation will need to be intro-duced to draw in the relevant communities, NGOs, and governments. Different forms of consultation can be used, as outlined above; many of these methods can be employed to ensure that all members of a community are involved. Also, traditional institutions and community groups can be used as a forum for these consultations. However, as discussed in chapter 3, many traditional institutions consider certain subgroups as not having equal status, with the result that women and younger community mem-bers are often denied a voice in local governance systems. Therefore, in using traditional consultative mechanisms to discuss multicultural policies and programs, efforts must be made to prevent women, youth, and other subgroups from being excluded. This might require using an institution in which they have a stronger voice, such as a women's or youth society; or ensuring that the community council becomes more receptive to the opinions of marginalized groups. In many cases, a new focus group will be needed to assess the views of marginalized groups. Balance between Citizens' Rights and Cultural Rights Designing policies and programs that nurture cultural diversity is a deli-cate process. It requires carefully balancing the protection of individual human rights with the recognition of collective cultural ones. A number of approaches can be followed to achieve this aim. To begin with, the par-ticipatory process and social assessments mentioned in the preceding sec-tion should be used to identify areas in which the recognition of cultural 68 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES rights could result in a major barrier to individual rights. Participatory processes should also be used to determine how much people are willing to accept trade-offs when they exist. For instance, if customary law recognizes corporal punishment, it might be possible to substitute another kind of punishment without compromising some positive impact of the traditional practice while respecting human rights. In principle, a democratic society has some hierarchy of values that should prevail with regard to members' rights and obligations, and no one should be forced to adopt or follow a certain culture against his or her will. In this regard, cultural rights are just that\u2014rights; they are not obligations. Community-oriented rights, on the other hand, entail duties and obligations and provide protection and support: it is not possible to enjoy one without accessing the other. The inherent contradiction between cultural rights and community rights means that, at times, group members will have to give up individual freedoms in order to receive the benefi ts of group cohesion. Understanding the intricacies of this trade-off should be guided by information that makes all available choices, and their conse-quences, clear. The provision of such information is often easier said than done, because the free circulation of such information might not be accept-able in some cultures. Choosing to implement cultural practices might not always be possible. Regarding native language instruction, it is a relatively simple matter for a society to offer the instruction and for parents to determine whether they want their children to be taught in the language of their community or in the majority language. Regarding customary land ownership, however, it is diffi cult\u2014if not impossible\u2014for individuals to claim ownership of land when the rest of the community collectively owns this land. Conversely, recognition of customary land ownership is not possible in a system based on individual rights. The situation becomes still more complex where a people\u2014minority or majority\u2014attribute their legal and institutional sys-tems to an unseen higher power, which prevents their being modifi ed or adapted. Such views of culture often result in violent confl icts or the com- plete marginalization of certain groups. Recognizing cultural rights is thus a careful balancing act, and entails intricate negotiation and in-depth understanding. Further, it is not suffi - cient to merely recognize traditional practices and apply them in parallel with societal laws and institutions. Bridges between the two must be built to ensure that traditional practices have a minimum level of harmonization with mainstream values and practices. As discussed in chapter 2, avoiding DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 69 confl ict and marginalization among societal groups requires fi ne-tuning, but experience shows that it is possible\u2014many cultures actually integrate such fl exibility. Marginalization is not always an issue; the example of the Amish in the United States shows that a group can live in relative isolation from mainstream society without creating confl icts. These cases are rare, however, and concern mostly religious communities supported by very spe-cifi c practices. Socioeconomic Conditions Policies that focus on recognizing culture but do not take into account the social and economic situation of the concerned group are unlikely to succeed, particularly if they are aimed at reducing social exclusion. As dis-cussed earlier, most indigenous people tend to be much poorer than non-indigenous people; consequently, any policies that support their inclusion need to take economic opportunity into account while recognizing their culture. The fi rst negative connection between a culture and its socioeconomic positioning in society is often related to prejudice and discrimination. A certain ethnicity and the culture associated with this ethnicity often trig-ger open or tacit discrimination. 2 Such discrimination can be manifested at school, in the labor market, while accessing basic services, as part of political participation processes, and so on. Other policies will not work if economic discrimination is not dealt with fi rst. Many countries have thus chosen to adopt affi rmative action policies as a means of breaking the cycle perpetuated by prejudice and discrimination (box 4.1). Because many minority groups are poor, they are at risk for the pov- erty traps implicit in various short-term survival strategies. Encouraging a strong sense of cultural identity through public policy will not help in evading these traps and may, in some cases, actually create new traps. For example, introducing culture in the school curriculum can sometimes rein-force school segregation, which can in turn lower the quality of education and thereby set a serious poverty trap. Poverty traps can be addressed through the creation of a safety net that allows the poor minimum economic security so they may better plan their lives. Access to such a safety net must be ensured for poor minority groups; this may entail fi ghting specifi c cultural prejudices on the part of the domi- nant group that can deny minorities the benefi ts to which they are entitled.70 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Cost of Multicultural Programs The costs of recognizing cultural diversity in service delivery must be taken into account, especially in poor countries. These costs can be substantial. For example, introducing culturally sensitive policies and programs can require institutions to make several long-term changes in their outreach, commu-nication, capacity-building, and monitoring processes. Such changes can be expensive, and their costs are often underestimated by government and development organizations. Another cost category involves the implemen-tation of effective communication strategies addressing not only intended program benefi ciaries but also aimed at helping other members of society understand why some sectors of the population receive special treatment. When value changes are involved, communication has an extremely impor-tant role to play. Outreach is necessary to make sure concerned individuals participate fully. Also, capacity building and training are often required; these costs can be extensive (box 4.2). To implement a new curriculum, for example, teachers, administrators, and school management must undergo training that helps them understand how to present the curriculum, how to avoid stigmatization, and how to avoid school segregation. Typically, the costs associated with implementing cultural diversity policies can be high, but many are one-time, upfront costs that decrease after a few years. When these costs do decrease, multicultural policies can result in signifi cant savings. For example, a Human Rights Watch study in The Vicious Cycle of Stereotyping Too often, prejudice and discrimination feed a vicious cycle. The inability of group mem- bers to nd work, for example, reinforces stereotypes about them and gives rise to the idea that the group is unsuitable for work; this in turn pushes the group to look for other\u2014perhaps less societally condoned\u2014ways to survive. A recent study by the World Bank on the employment of Roma in the Czech Republic shows that, while the unemployment gure for the Roma is low and actually quite close to that of the majority population (which was 5 percent in 2007), their level of participation in the labor force is extremely low\u2014about 54 percent. One reason identi ed for this disparity is that many Roma simply believe they have no chance to nd work in the formal labor market (World Bank 2008).BOX 4.1DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 71 Guatemala estimated that $5 million\u2014or the cost of educating 100,000 primary school students each year\u2014was saved in the state budget by introducing bilingual education and thereby reducing repetition of classes (UNDP 2004). Some policies might not entail upfront costs, especially when govern- ments recognize practices that already exist or foster community-funded and -organized initiatives, such as cultural services. The key is to identify all costs involved, explore opportunities for piggy- backing and cost mitigation, and conduct a thorough cost-effectiveness assessment that takes into account both the material and nonmaterial ben-efi ts a population will gain from the policy/program. Long-Term Investments and Strategies Recognizing cultural diversity should not be seen as a \"one-shot\" mea- sure, but rather an ongoing process that must be nurtured and adapted. As programs develop over time, institutions will need to respond to chang-ing community needs and correct and reorient programs as necessary. The underlying plans must be strategic and fl exible to ensure that the result- ing programs have a long-term vision and suffi cient scope to adapt and change in response to realities in the fi eld. Introducing local languages in the curriculum and adapting the curriculum to include a minority culture may seem to be straightforward objectives, but experience shows that fi ne- tuning is needed along the way to improve capacity building, institutional development, and communication. Also, introducing multicultural policies may require various types of support as the minority culture adapts to Lack of Financing Undermines Bulgarian Native Language Policy Bulgaria recognized the right to be taught in one's native language as early as 1992. In 1999, the government passed a law that speci cally required that the local language be taught at the primary and secondary school levels, if requested by a suf cient number of stu- dents. In practice, however, local governments were given no additional nancing with which to do this (Gyurova 2001). Because the cost of implementing the law was never properly accounted for, the reform had little if any impact at the local level.BOX 4.272 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES its offi cial and recognized status and the majority culture copes with the ramifi cations of having an additional culture legitimized. Mechanisms to manage confl ict and ensure adaptation of policies and programs are gener- ally needed. Implementation of cultural diversity policies requires long-term invest- ments to ensure the availability of appropriate human and other resources. Such investments might involve employing doctors from a minority group who are conversant in the local language and understand local medical practices; training enough teachers from a minority group to teach in the local language and offering incentives to entice minority students to move to the relevant areas; and hiring judges trained in customary law and able to assess cases that deal with such non-mainstream customs as witchcraft. To ensure this last, for example, means not only including this topic in the university curriculum, but also targeting and encouraging students with the requisite understanding and sensitivity to enroll in the fi eld. Policy makers must understand that the demand for recognizing cul- tural practices can vary over time. Demand for studying in a minority lan-guage can suddenly increase or decrease in response to changing situations. This does not mean that the relationship between people and their culture is erratic, but rather that external circumstances play a role in infl uencing the demand for individuated culture. Evaluation Information is limited on how policies and programs that support cultural diversity have affected communities. There is more analysis of education than of other sectors, but that research focuses mostly on the impact of introducing local languages and teaching in native languages. Overall, the fi ndings of these assessments are positive, with the caveats that investments in training and institution building are often underestimated, and the qual-ity of teaching remains a real issue for languages that are very specifi c or marginalized. In the area of health care, the WHO has conducted some solid case studies on the impact of traditional medicine and how health services have been adapted to fi t the cultural context, but these are limited to just a few regions. On the topics of customary law, local governance, and cultural services, assessments are extremely limited and consist mostly of descriptive case studies. Furthermore, many assessments are not compa-rable and are based on small individual communities.DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CULTURAL DIVERSITY 73 More must be done in evaluating the impact of policies and programs on overall sectoral outcomes, social cohesion, and social inclusion. Col-lecting best practices and deriving a better understanding of the relevant political, economic, and institutional issues are critical in moving forward. Cost-effectiveness analysis is vital; but this entails a number of chal- lenges. The costs of putting cultural diversity policies related to service delivery into effect vary widely, based on whether the involved population is poor, how well it is integrated in mainstream society, the capacity and institutional development of the local civil society, and so on. For example, teaching Hungarian to Hungarian minorities in Romania does not incur the same costs as teaching in the Roma language. There are many teachers of Hungarian descent, and Hungary has textbooks and established meth-odologies that can be made available free of charge to Hungarian com-munities in other countries. Teaching in the Roma language, on the other hand, requires teacher training, new textbooks, identifi cation of appropri- ate pedagogical methods, implementation of a communication campaign aimed at helping parents understand the benefi ts of such education for their children, development of strategies to avoid discrimination toward children who study the Roma language in school, and so on. Similarly, having doctors of Mayan origin work in Mayan areas in Mexico is much more diffi cult and costly than having Maori doctors work in Maori areas in New Zealand. There are many Maori doctors, and the living conditions of the involved areas are of suffi cient quality to attract many of them to the assignment. Mexico, on the other hand, has very few Mayan doctors. Training them is expensive, as is creating the basic infrastructure to make Mayan areas attractive to external professionals. This stark differentiation in initial conditions is only one example of the diffi culty of carrying out cost-effectiveness comparisons among countries. Finally, politics can have a signifi cant impact on cost-effi ciency. This is true for most types of projects, but cultural issues tend to be much more politicized because of their link to identity issues. More analysis is needed, preferably on the impact policies and programs have had on communities in Ghana, South Africa, and Uganda in Africa; Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam in Asia; Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in East-ern Europe; Bolivia, Guatemala, and Mexico in Latin America; and Aus-tralia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and many of the smaller Pacifi c islands in Oceania\u2014all of which have tried to implement multicultural policies and programs for a relatively long period of time. Such an analy-sis should include a mix of political and institutional data with outcome 74 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES measurements wherever possible. Communities where such policies have not yet been introduced can be used as control groups. This kind of com-prehensive analysis would offer a better understanding of the practical issues involved in the implementation of multicultural policies. Sectoral analysis should also be increased in the fi elds of education, health care, customary law, and customary dispute resolution mechanisms. Notes 1. Some countries have refused to take such a step, arguing that it would alter the very nature of the state itself. France, for instance, sees recognition of cultural diversity in the public sphere as a threat to the Republican principle of equal-ity. For this reason, France has not ratifi ed a number of important treaties related to teaching minority languages in public schools. 2. According to the Minorities at Risk data set created by researchers at the University of Maryland's Center for International Development and Confl ict Management, some 750 million people in the world today belong to groups that face socioeconomic discrimination or disadvantage (or both) as a result of their cultural identity; for about 68 million of these people, this treatment is the result of directly discriminatory government policies.75CHAPTER 5 Adapting Services to a Diverse Society Since the late 1980s, policies and programs that support cultural diversity have acquired a new visibility in the international arena. The end of the Cold War witnessed the rise of a new global society that many fear threat-ens to homogenize the world. As a result, culture has become increasingly important for identity formation around the world. There is also increas-ing evidence that recognizing at least some level of cultural diversity can reduce confl ict and increase collective agency. Moreover, recognizing cul- tural diversity and fi ghting poverty are seen as complementary activities: inequality continues to be strongly correlated with ethnic and cultural dif-ferences, and it is now quite clear that recognizing cultural differences can reduce inequality. The growing demand to recognize cultural diversity raises a number of important issues for countries around the world. Policies supporting cultural diversity can at times be at odds with the principle of homogenous citizenship that promises similar rights and obligations for all. With some variation, this principle has been one of the pillars of the European and North American nation-state since the French and American revolutions of the 18th century. Recognizing cultural diversity therefore often requires important changes in the legal and institutional frameworks of many coun-tries as well as in the political culture. In numerous countries, international recognition of the importance of multicultural policies is moving faster than their actual implementation, driven by the UN, the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States, and various human rights organiza-tions and other multilateral institutions. A critical component of multicultural policies is making sure that basic services are adapted to fi t the practices and values of groups that comprise a nation. Such policies and programs need to be anchored to local realities 76 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES and institutions, such as the school, the health center, the local government and its administrative organization, and festivals and other cultural events. All of these entities and activities are important in both identity build-ing and collective agency. But adapting services to the cultural reality of various groups must be undertaken with the overall objective of improving social cohesion, lest further social tension and exclusion be created. Many countries have experimented with designing policies that support cultural diversity. Early evidence indicates that the majority of these efforts have positively affected the societies in which they've been instituted. There have been places in which multicultural policies have negatively affected communities, but these have most often been the result of poor planning or execution. For example, where policies have lacked the proper means, sup-port, training, funding, or attention, they have contributed to the exclusion of some social groups, such as women or youth. Despite the attention given to cultural diversity in recent years, thor- ough analysis regarding the impact of cultural diversity policies is lacking. Moreover, because many efforts are new and ongoing, their long-term social impacts remain to be seen. Quantitative assessments are usually limited to the fi eld of bilingual education and learning in the native lan- guage; most of the assessments in other areas are still qualitative or quan-titative only with regard to small and limited samples. The international development community should strive to conduct systematic assessments and analyses of policies and programs that support cultural diversity in service delivery. Some impacts have been identifi ed. Broad evidence indicates that teach- ing the curriculum in local languages and incorporating various cultures into curricular materials on history, geography, and art reduce tensions, improve social integration, and enrich the cognitive performance of chil-dren in their lifelong educational endeavors. However, these outcomes result only when a program is properly outfi tted with teacher training, teacher assistants, community outreach, and communication. In the health care sector, the recognition of cultural diversity has been shown to have a positive effect on the health of ethnically diverse populations. The expe-riences to date with service delivery through local governance systems underscore the importance of ensuring full participation of diverse ethnic communities but raise issues about protecting individual rights and sup-porting participation of all members of a community. In all of these areas, more analysis is needed; such efforts should be accompanied by the collec-tion and description of best practices.ADAPTING SERVICES TO A DIVERSE SOCIETY 77 Experience clearly shows that governments should not dictate multi- cultural policies in a top-down manner, but should instead foster an envi-ronment where local and majority cultures can interact peacefully and productively. It is essential to respect the diversity of, and even the contra-dictions in, human aspirations. Recognizing local cultures in public policy and service delivery is an ongoing process, not a single one-time action. Governments must avoid taking a piecemeal approach to the promotion of cultural diversity and be prepared to meet the additional requirements of capacity building and institutional development. As globalization progresses, it is less expected that all citizens be strongly integrated into a nation-state and adopt a homogeneous central culture. Refusing to acknowledge this trend only delays the process of social inte-gration, which further reduces social cohesion. In a world where change is often viewed as a source of anxiety instead of an opportunity, it can help to admit our cultural differences. As long as some of a society's core values can be respected and preserved, admitting cultural differences helps people fi nd a meaningful identity while remaining, or becoming, engaged citizens. Policies that recognize cultural diversity should therefore be seen as impor-tant components of the social response to globalization, and ultimately be integrated into new social policies in countries around the world. 79APPENDIX What Is Cultural Identity? The concept of identity as used by psychologists describes a sense of being and belonging to a community that is essential in managing interactions with others. The concept of culture is generally applied by anthropolo- gists to communities or societies\u2014that is, to the \"collective\" dimension of human beings. Cultural identity lies at the intersection of these terms, as both a psychological and social construct. Identity is a central constitutive element in the psychology of a human being. It is identity that makes us feel that we are an agent of our own development, and identity that helps us see ourselves both as an individual human being with a unique existence and, at the same time, as an inte-gral part of a collective or societal body. The concept thus has a strong \"existential\" quality and is central to agency, which is the ability to act in society, and especially in one's own life. People cannot operate normally in society without an identity, or with a weakened one. George Mead, one of the fathers of social psychology, describes identity as the integration of social norms expressed in the \"self,\" and the spontaneous and personal expressed in the term \"I\" (Mead 1934). Identity therefore varies by society and culture, depending on the space available for individual autonomy. Modernity is sometimes described as the evolution of identity from collec-tive and group-based to more individual and autonomous (Morin 2004). Identity is made up of several components. The fi rst component is linked to a sense of being in existence, which in turns makes one feel that life is worth living. Psychiatrist Eric Erikson describes identity in his 1968 book Identity, Youth and Crisis as \"something that comes upon you as a recognition\" (p. 20). This is primordial identity, the type of existential experience described by philosophers such as Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.80 DELIVERING SERVICES IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES But identity is also linked to a sense of sameness and differentiation. This is the important collective dimension of identity. People reinforce their sense of being by identifying with some and differentiating from others. The individual human being in society needs to look for similarities and differences with the \"other.\" This means that identity cannot exist without a consciousness of the other and of the vision the other has of oneself (Levinas 1981). The sense of being can be understood by the \"me\" and the \"you\"\u2014that is, by one's recognition of the other and one's recognition by the other (Ricoeur 1994). Recognition is thus an essential ingredient in the experience of being a personal and social entity. People also need to adopt the characteristics that will allow them to be accepted by others and to have a sense of sameness as well as of difference. The way identity is built varies by society. In societies in which the indi- vidual has very little autonomy, it is more important to preserve the group identity. The collective (expressed through rituals and rigid sets of rules) tends to dictate to the individual his or her identity, and therefore the simi-larities with and differences from other members of the same group. In societies that value more autonomy, the individual has more choices for establishing an identity independent of the group. However, along with choice comes an increased anxiety and strong existential fear of being responsible for deciding one's identity, which is often considered one of the more fragile aspects of the human being in modern societies. The formation of identity corresponds strongly to age (Erikson 1968). Humans relate to their identities differently at various points in their life. An infant experiences a sense of being that is undifferentiated from the surrounding world; this sense of being is strongly embedded in the child's physical and emotional relationship with its mother and is central to the development of its psychology. A feeling of differentiation from the sur-rounding world begins to appear between the ages of one and three; at this point, relations are established by the child with the father and with other members of the child's family and group. The child becomes aware of a separation between \"I\" and the rest of the world, and begins to assume various identities. From the ages of three to seven, the child starts to recog-nize multiple identities. He or she becomes conscious of various social roles and integrates a sense of belonging to various groups. This is the stage at which culture becomes directly infl uential. Adolescence is a time of very strong collective identifi cation, when the young person leaves a system of reference still very much linked to his or her family and others and assumes a social autonomy independent from APPENDIX: WHAT IS CULTURAL IDENTITY? 81 those with whom he or she is close. Adolescence is recognized in all cul- tures as a central life stage when an individual acquires autonomy. In many traditions, this period is marked by elaborate rites of passage. Identity con-tinues to change during adult life, but in a less dramatic fashion than dur-ing youth and adolescence. Identity formation is situated at the juncture of the real and the imag- ined. Each individual and group is part of a tangible reality, but this reality is structured and plays as an identity through a mental construct built as a synthesis between individual and collective imagery (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1952). For instance, a fl ag is a piece of textile, but it creates a sense of national identity\u2014and it is what the fl ag evokes in someone that is important for identity. The mental representation constitutes an interpretative and ethi-cal framework for the individual which will dictate and justify his or her actions in society. Collective identity is important in cultures that promote both individual autonomy and group cohesion. Collective identity has many positive ele-ments in terms of creating group cohesion, supporting internal solidarity, and establishing rules that aid in social transactions, but it can also be a source of conservatism, and a means of maintaining cultural barriers that hinder the progress of the group as a whole and the root of violent confl ict between groups. In and of itself, however, collective identity is neither nega-tive nor positive, but a societal characteristic that requires acknowledg-ment rather than judgment.83BIBLIOGRAPHY African Union. 2005. \"Plan of Action of the Decade of Traditional Medicine (2001-2010).\" CAMH/15.

The increasing cultural diversity of societies, along with the important role culture plays in forming identities in these societies, creates major challenges for national and local governments in ensuring social cohesion and social inclusion. Delivering Services in Multicultural Societies reviews recent approaches to recognizing cultural diversity when delivering basic services. It rst discusses how supporting cultural diversity can help achieve social inclusion and social cohesion. It then considers the debate over multiculturalism from various perspectives and discusses the risks and bene ts of policies that support cultural diversity. Also examined are policies and programs that support cultural diversity in the delivery of basic services, such as education, health care, customary law, traditional governance systems, and cultural services. For each of these services the author reviews main challenges and describes best practices. Finally, the book offers a synthesis of what has been learned about taking cultural diversity into account in service "}
