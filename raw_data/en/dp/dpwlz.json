Among Americans of reproductive age, 11% of women and 9% of men encounter fertility problems. In about 33% of cases, the challenge stems from issues with male fertility. Some infertility problems in men require medical intervention, but others may resolve with lifestyle changes, such as taking a male fertility supplement. Unfortunately, not all supplements boast the same effectiveness, and finding the best male fertility supplements can be tricky. To help you decide which natural fertility product is right for you, we've reviewed the best supplements for male fertility. Each of the men's fertility supplements below were evaluated based on their ingredients, user reviews, price, and product guarantee. 5 Best Male Fertility Supplements [Semenoll](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/semenoll-dallas-fertility)(Best male fertility supplement overall) [Fertility Factor 5](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/fertilityfactor5)(Best value) - Beli Men Vitality Multivitamin - Male Preconception+ - Fertilaid for Men Review of the Top Rated Fertility Supplements for Men #1. [Semenoll](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/semenoll-dallas-fertility): Best Male Fertility Supplement Overall Semenoll comes from Wolfson Brands, a well-known supplement brand based in the United Kingdom. Men searching for safe male fertility supplements should look to this product for a natural boost in sperm count, motility (movement), and volume and improved libido and sexual performance. This fertility supplement especially suits men looking to enhance semen quality and volume to boost their chances of conception. The Semenoll formula contains several natural ingredients shown in studies and clinical testing to positively affect sperm parameters. For example, this male fertility supplement includes 1,107 milligrams of Tribulus terrestris, an herb commonly used in Asia and Europe to help men with erectile dysfunction. [ Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871152/) support this ingredient's ability to enhance sperm production, motility, and viability by increasing testosterone levels in the body. Semenoll also contains 900 milligrams of maca root, a root vegetable that grows in Peru's Andes Mountains. A [ 12-week study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4569766/) of this plant's effects on sperm quality shows promising benefits to boost male fertility. After 12 weeks, the men given maca showed a 21% boost in sperm morphology (shape), a 20% increase in sperm count, an 18% boost in the count of progressively motile sperm, a 14% boost in motile sperm quantity, a 14% increase in sperm concentration, and a 9% improvement in semen volume. This male fertility product offers an excellent alternative to expensive, prescription-based fertility treatments. If you want to try a natural supplement to improve your fertility with a minimal chance of side effects, Semenoll may provide your best option. Many reviews from individual Semenoll users report noticeable increases in volume, libido, and sexual performance in as little as a week. Pros and Cons of Taking Semenoll In addition to improving male fertility through increased sperm quality and volume, this male fertility supplement offers the following benefits: - Free shipping in discreet packages - 60-day money-back guarantee - Customer support is available 24/7 - Buy two, get one free deal - Buy three, get two free deal The primary disadvantage of Semenoll stems from the formula, which includes smaller doses of some ingredients than those used in supportive studies. This means you're less likely to experience side effects using this product, but the low ingredient amounts may affect how well the fertility supplements work for some men. For example, Semenoll contains 45 milligrams of muira puama extract, whereas supportive studies often use doses of 45 milligrams per 1 kilogram of body weight.

[Fertility Factor 5](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/fertilityfactor5): Great Men's Fertility Pills for Sperm Health and Semen Volume Men looking for the best male fertility supplements to boost sperm motility, volume, and other parameters should consider Fertility Factor 5, a relatively new product from trusted company Leading Edge Health. This male fertility supplement uses five powerful ingredients to improve sperm quality, volume, count, motility, and overall sexual health. It suits men struggling to conceive due to inadequate sperm count, poor morphology, or low motility. The Fertility Factor 5 formula uses clinically proven, natural ingredients to support male reproductive health. Here's a quick overview of some effective ingredients found in these male fertility pills: LJ100, a patented Tongkat Ali extract designed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been shown in [ studies](https://www.fertilityfactor5.com/clinical-studies/) to improve male fertility in as few as three months. In a double-blind 12-week study, participants given LJ100 experienced a 44% boost in sperm motility, an 18% improvement in volume, and overall increases in erectile function. Another LJ100 study with couples trying to conceive for an average of five years saw 11 natural pregnancies during the trials. Panax ginseng, also called Asian ginseng, is common in Asian medicine as a treatment for sexual dysfunction. [ Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3861174/) indicate many exciting benefits of taking Panax ginseng, including increased serum testosterone, sex drive, sperm count, and sperm concentration. The costs of medical fertility treatments inspire many men to seek natural male fertility supplements that provide a more affordable option for improving reproductive and sperm health. Fertility Factor 5 easily makes our top five for its research-backed formula. Pros and Cons of Taking Fertility Factor 5 Like any other male fertility supplement, Fertility Factor 5 has pros and cons. The advantages of choosing this product include the following: - 67-day, no questions asked return policy - Free shipping in the U.S. (lower 48 only) - 24/7 customer support via live chat - Great savings for bulk purchases - Results in three months (half the time of other supplements) The main con of this male fertility supplement is the need for some reviews on the official website. Most dietary supplements include customer reviews on their sites to show potential customers what users have to say. The lack of reviews likely stems from the supplement's newness, but many shoppers want to read reviews before making a purchase, especially as internet shopping becomes the norm.

Beli Men Vitality Multivitamin: Highly Rated Men's Prenatal Vitamins This multivitamin by Beli, a U.S.-based company, offers a comprehensive formula to support healthy sperm production, improve sperm count and quality, improve egg penetration, and provide other health benefits that can help relieve male infertility issues. Any man who wants to increase his odds of conceiving and enjoy a boost in overall vitality should try Beli's multivitamin. This product contains a thorough list of beneficial vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamins B6 and B12, vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, zinc, selenium, and more. Oxidative stress can lead to poor sperm quality, which is why antioxidant ingredients like vitamin C and vitamin E are essential in the best male fertility supplements. We'll dive deeper into the benefits of some of these ingredients and how they protect sperm from free radical damage later in the article. The ingredient we really want to highlight here is Shilajit, a mineral pitch used in Himalayan folk medicine to improve the health of the urinary tract, kidneys, and immune system. It can help boost testosterone and restore energy balance for less fatigue and mental fog. Shilajit has also been shown in studies to improve male fertility. In [ one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20078516/), men struggling with infertility consumed 200 milligrams of processed shilajit daily for three months. The results noted a decrease in the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde, sperm count increase of 61.4%, sperm motility boost between 12.4 and 17.4%, and serum testosterone increase of 23.5%. Pros and Cons of Taking Beli Men Vitality Multivitamin Men who choose the Beli Men Vitality Multivitamin benefit in the following ways: - Gluten allergen and soy-free - Non-GMO formula - Keto and vegan-friendly - Free shipping - 30-day refund policy Like Fertility Factor 5, this male fertility supplement doesn't have reviews on the official website. This isn't a make-or-break factor, but today's consumers often look to customer reviews for insight into the supplement, and some shoppers may opt for other options that provide it. This product also requires a subscription to buy, where customers pay $50 a month. Subscription models don't offer the same bulk-buying discounts as other supplements. However, some users may see this as a pro if they prefer to avoid having to remember to order more dietary supplements when they run low. #4. Male Preconception+: Popular Sperm Supplement for Male Fertility Male Preconception+, from U.S. brand Molecular Fertility, is an excellent option for men seeking ways to increase sperm count, motility, morphology, and production. This formula combines a long list of male fertility vitamins, minerals, and extracts that provide a holistic solution to improved male reproductive health. It suits any man who needs a thorough method to boost male fertility. At $70 a bottle, this male fertility supplement costs more than other options on our list, but an impressive variety of ingredients may make the higher price worth it. The formula contains tons of vitamins, including vitamin E, vitamins A, C, and D, vitamin B6, and others. It also includes selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, and other minerals that can help support male fertility. In addition to the vitamins and minerals, Male Preconception+ contains clinically proven extracts, amino acids, and enzymes like ashwagandha root, L Arginine, and CoQ10. The last ingredient on that list, CoQ10 (coenzyme Q10), has undergone many studies to investigate its effectiveness in helping male infertility due to its antioxidant properties. This [ review of dozens of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226917/) offers excellent evidence of this ingredient's effectiveness in improving semen quality. One study described in the review gave subjects 200 milligram daily doses of CoQ10 for six months (the same dose as Male Preconception+) and noted an increase in forward sperm motility and sperm count. We'll further explore the benefits of CoQ10 for male fertility later in the article. For now, let's explore the pros and cons of Male Preconception+. Pros and Cons of Taking Male Preconception+ The benefits of selecting this male fertility supplement include the following: - 30-day returns (fees included for full product returns) - International shipping available - Buy three bottles, get 50% off the third - Free shipping on orders of $100 or more (continental U.S. only) - Vegetarian capsules The main drawback to Male Preconception+ stems from the price, which exceeds the costs for the other male fertility supplements on our list so far. However, Molecular Fertility offers bulk buying discounts to help with affordability, and $70 per bottle isn't bad compared to some supplements or expensive medical fertility treatments. #5. Fertilaid for Men: Good Supplement for Supporting Male Reproductive Health The final product we wanted to feature on our list of the best male fertility supplements was easy to choose. Fertilaid for Men from the Fairhaven Health brand has been helping men improve sperm motility, count, and morphology since 2003 and remains a popular and trusted male fertility supplement. Any male consumer who wants to increase the chances of conception by supplementing preconception vitamins, minerals, and natural extracts should try this supplement. Like Preconception+, Fertilaid for Men includes a long list of ingredients to support optimal fertility and overall health. The formula contains vitamins A, C, D, E, K, and B6, thiamin, folate, zinc, and other ingredients to encourage healthy sperm cells. It also includes a proprietary blend of maca root, Panax ginseng, CoQ10, and L-carnitine. L-carnitine is an amino acid known to support fertility in men. [ Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8812460/) show that supplementation of carnitines boosts sperm motility by at least 10.72% and sperm morphology by at least 2.41%. Men who want to customize their supplement regimen to support a healthy sperm count or improved motility may take one or both of Fairhaven Health's stacking supplements, CountBoost and MotilityBoost. Consumers take these stackable supplements with Fertilaid for Men for extra help increasing sperm count and motility. CountBoost contains effective ingredients and Panax ginseng. MotilityBoost contains extra B vitamins, several amino acids, and CoQ10. Pros and Cons of Taking Fertilaid for Men There are several benefits of taking Fertilaid for Men as your male fertility supplement: - Stackable products for boosting sperm count and motility - Customer service is available via phone and online form - Free shipping on orders over $35 - Free two-day shipping on orders over $69 - More than 650 customer reviews The primary disadvantage we came across in our research was the official website. Although not the worst we've seen, it could offer better user-friendliness. However, we understand that this brand has been around for decades, and the Fairhaven Health team probably spends more time ensuring they provide high-quality supplements than they do, making sure the top menu on the website doesn't interfere with reading the rest of the page. Best Vitamins for Male Fertility Male infertility occurs due to low sperm quality, which refers to sperm count, motility, and morphology. Let's quickly define some male fertility terms, so you can better understand how the following vitamins, minerals, and extracts support healthy sperm production: - Sperm count refers to the total number of sperm in a single ejaculate. - Sperm concentration is the quantity of sperm present within one milliliter of semen. - Sperm motility depends on how well the sperm can swim. - Sperm morphology refers to the shape of the sperm. Now that you understand the basic terms, let's explore the best vitamins, minerals, and other natural substances that may help support male fertility: Zinc [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472207/) have established a connection between oxidative stress and reduced sperm motility, sperm DNA damage, and other outcomes that negatively affect fertility. Zinc is an antioxidant essential for optimal sperm count, morphology, and function. Seminal fluid contains 30 times more zinc than blood, which has inspired researchers to explore the connection between zinc levels in semen and sperm quality. [ Preliminary research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003818/) supports the theory that increasing zinc levels can help support sperm health. [ Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9720838/) show that zinc improves sperm motility, count, and fertilizing capacity, so you'll find this ingredient in all the best fertility supplements. Vitamin C You may automatically think of Vitamin C as the closest thing to a cure for the common cold anyone has gotten, but it can also help boost fertility. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that protects semen from oxidative stress. [ Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9996255/) show promising results for increased sperm count, motility, and morphology through vitamin C supplementation. Consider [ this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17004914/), which included 13 infertile men between the ages of 25 and 35. After twice daily supplementation of 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C for two months, the mean sperm count sexrose from 14,300,000 per milliliter to 32,800,000 per milliliter. The study also noted increased sperm motility and normal sperm morphology. Selenium The body uses [ selenium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0946672X14001345?via%3Dihub) for many vital processes, and deficiencies can cause various health problems like cardiovascular disease, carcinomas, and of course, infertility. Many of the best male fertility supplements include selenium in their formulas due to scientific research supporting its role in reproductive medicine. For example, [ this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0946672X14001345?via%3Dihub) gave participants 200 micrograms of selenium in combination with vitamin E for at least 100 days. Of the 690 infertile men tested, 52.6% of cases experienced improved motility, morphology, or improvements in both parameters. Vitamin E The study linked above about infertility treatments using selenium and Vitamin E may also indicate this vitamin's effectiveness in fertility supplements. Many of these products include Vitamin E for its antioxidant properties to further protect sperm cells from oxidative stress. However, some [ studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666334120300775) indicate no statistical relevance between improved sperm health and Vitamin E supplementation. CoQ10 We discussed the benefits of CoQ10 (also called ubiquinol) in some detail in the section dedicated to Male Contraception+, where we told you about one study in this extensive [ review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226917/). This coenzyme is a powerful antioxidant believed to maintain efficient energy systems in spermatozoa and protect sperm cell membranes from lipid peroxidation, which occurs when free radicals attack lipids. The massive number of studies using CoQ10 with positive sperm health outcomes makes this a powerhouse ingredient for any male fertility supplement. Related Content: Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is a plant that grows in Asia and Africa that has been used in traditional medicine to treat infertility and sexual dysfunction for millennia. Scientists have conducted some promising research that supports claims that this plant can help improve sperm count, motility, and morphology. For instance, consider [ this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863556/), which compared the effects of 675 milligrams of ashwagandha per day versus placebo treatment. After 90 days, the researchers noted impressive results in the participants given ashwagandha with a sperm count boost of 167%, a 53% volume increase, and a 57% increase in motility. Folate If you have any background in prenatal vitamins, you may recognize folate as one of the most essential vitamins for pregnancy health, but folate is also important in male fertility. Many manufacturers of male fertility supplements include folic acid or methylfolate in their formulas because [ research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11172823/) has associated low seminal folate levels with lower sperm count and sperm DNA damage. However, some [ studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31910279/) have found no statistically significant connections between folate and increased sperm health. Carnitine We briefly discussed L-carnitine in the above section for Fertilaid for Men, but here's a bit more about this amino acid used in the best male fertility supplements. Carnitines help facilitate energy production by transporting long-chain fatty acids into cells' mitochondria. [ Researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4163266/) have linked this cell energy connection to sperm motility and found that supplementing L-carnitine and L-acetyl-carnitine can significantly improve sperm motility. This review also noted an improvement in sperm chromatin quality, which has to do with the overall health of the sperm's DNA. Fish Oil Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help form sperm membranes. [ Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561409001587) have linked low levels of omega-3 fatty acids with abnormal sperm morphology, deficient sperm count, and poor sperm motility. [ This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21219381/), which investigated the effects of omega-3 supplementation, found an increase in sperm count, concentration, motility, and morphology. [This review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/andr.12649) of 16 examinations of this ingredient's influence on sperm quality found positive results or associations in 14. Tips for Boosting Male Fertility Naturally If you're trying to conceive, you may not want to immediately see a doctor after a few months of trying. Luckily, you may be able to support sperm count, motility, and morphology improvements by making some changes to your lifestyle. Consider the following tips for boosting male fertility naturally: Eat a healthy diet: Research suggests a connection between infertility and diets high in simple carbohydrates and processed food and also links sperm improvements to diets high in antioxidants, healthy fats, and other substances. Prioritize lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Get regular exercise: Staying active helps maintain balanced testosterone levels and encourages better overall sperm health. Keep it moderate to prevent too much exercise from lowering your sperm quality. Shed excess body weight: Healthcare professionals suggest shedding extra body weight if you struggle while trying to conceive. Having excess weight can result in lower sperm counts and motility. Get some sunlight: Some researchers suggest that vitamin D can impact male and female fertility, although this is debated. However, increasing vitamin D intake can help with other necessary lifestyle changes to improve male fertility, including improving sleep quality and reducing stress. Stop smoking: When offering advice on improving sperm count and motility, all doctors will start by telling you to quit smoking. Men should generally stop at least three months before trying to conceive. Limit drinking: You should also limit how much alcohol you consume to prevent poor sperm quality and low counts. Get plenty of sleep: Supporting fertility, just like any other bodily function, means avoiding sleep deprivation and getting good quality sleep. Reduce stress: Excessive stress may affect quality as sperm develops. Men with high-stress levels may experience low sperm concentrations and total counts. Perhaps you'll take up meditation or yoga. Treat your testicles right: To encourage healthy sperm production, avoid applying too much pressure or heat to your testicles. Avoid hot tubs and saunas, don't use seat warmers or work with your laptop over your groin, and avoid too much cycling, which can put pressure on your testicles. Frequently Asked Questions About Men's Fertility Pills How long should I take men's fertility supplements?
