It is usually performed in an outpatient facility and usually requires several hours to complete. In some clinical situations, plas ma exchange may be performed daily for at least 1 week. Adsorptive Cytapheresis: A therapeutic procedure in which blood of the patient is passed through a medical device, which contains a column or a filter that selectively adsorbs activated monocytes and granulocytes, allowing the remaining leukocyte s and other blood components to be returned to the patient. B2 Microglobulin Column : The B2 microglobulin apheresis column contains porous cellulose beads specifically designed to bind to B2 microglobulin as the patient's blood passes over the beads. Erythrocytapheresis : A procedure in which blood of the patient o r donor is passed through a medical device which separates red blood cells from other components of blood. The red blood cells are removed and replaced with crystalloid or colloid solution, when necessary. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) : A therapeutic procedure in which the buffy coat is separated from the patient's blood, treated extracorporeally with a photoactive compound (e.g., psoralens) and exposed to ultraviolet A light then subsequently reinfused to the patient during the same procedure. Apheresis Page 6 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Filtration Selective Removal : A procedure which uses a filter to remove components from the blood based on size. Depending on the pore size of the filters used, different components can be removed. Filtration -based instruments can be used to perform plasma exchange or LDL apheresis. They can also be used to perform donor plasmapheresis where plasma is collected for transfusion or further manufacture. High -Volume Plasma Exchange (HVP) : HVP is defined as an exchange of 15% of ideal body weight (representing 8- 12 L); patient plasma was removed at a rate of 1 -2 L per hour with replacement with plasma in equivalent volume. Immunoadsorption (IA) : A therapeutic procedure in which plasma of the patient, after separation from the blood, is passed through a medical device which has a capacity to remove immunoglobulins by specifically binding them to the active component (e.g., Staphylococcal protein A) of the device. Low- density lipoprotein ( LDL) Apheresis : The selective removal of low -density lipoproteins from the blood with the return of the remaining components. A variety of instruments are available which remove LDL cholesterol based on charge (dextran sulfate and polyacrylate), size (double -membrane filtration), precipitation at low pH (HELP), or immunoadsorptio n with anti -Apo B-100 antibodies. Leukocytapheresis (LCP) : A procedure in which blood of the patient or the donor is passed through a medical device which separates white blood cells (e.g., leukemic blasts or granulocytes), collects the selected cells, an d returns the remainder of the patient's or the donor's blood with or without the addition of replacement fluid such as colloid and/or crystalloid solution. This procedure can be used therapeutically or in the preparation of blood components. Platelet Aph eresis: A procedure in which blood of the donor is passed through a medical device which separates platelets, collects the platelets, and returns the remainder of the donor's blood. This procedure is used in the preparation of blood components (e.g., apher esis platelets). Red Blood Cell ( RBC) Exchange: A therapeutic procedure in which blood of the patient is passed through a medical device which separates red blood cells from other components of blood. The patient's red blood cells are removed and replaced with donor red blood cells and colloid solution. Rheopheresis : A therapeutic procedure in which blood of the patient is passed through a medical device which separates high- molecular-weight plasma components such as fibrinogen, a2-macroglobulin, low -dens ity lipoprotein cholesterol, and IgM to reduce plasma viscosity and red cell aggregation. This is done to improve blood flow and tissue oxygenation. LDL apheresis devices and selective filtration devices using two filters, one to separate plasma from cells and a second to separate the high - molecular-weight components, are used for these procedures. Thrombocytapheresis : A therapeutic procedure in which blood of the patient is passed through a medical device which separates platelets, removes the platelets, and returns the remainder of the patient's blood with or without the addition of replacement fluid such as colloid and/or crystalloid solution. Clinical Evidence Sickle Cell Disease Red blood cell exchange or erythrocytapheresis is being increasingly use d for transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD). Many of the studies performed to evaluate this therapy are retrospective studies with small patient population. Wade et al. (2022) performed a retrospective review of pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) patients receiving chronic red cell exchange (RCE) over 3 years to determine the frequency of adverse events (AEs) and identify procedural and patient AE risk factors. AE incidence, AE rate, incident rate ratios (IRRs), and relative risks (RR) were calculated based on various procedural and patient characteristics by univariable (UV) and multivariable (MV) analyses. In 38 patients receiving 760 procedures, the re were 150 (19.7%) AEs, of which 36 (4.7%) were symptomatic AEs. The rate of AEs was 20.2 per 100 person-months [95% CI 17.2, 23.6], and the rate of symptomatic AEs was 4.8 per 100 person -months [95% CI a baseline Hct 30% experienced more total AEs and symptomatic AEs. Pre -procedure initial systolic BP < 50th percentile and patients with Apheresis Page 7 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. severe CNS vasculopathy and non SCA phenotype (i.e., HbSC or S\u00df+ thalassemia) were associated with an increase in total AEs. IHD depletion was not associated with an increased incidence of AEs or symptomatic AEs. The authors concluded that SCD patients with HCT 30%, systolic BP < CNS vasculopathy and possibly non -SCA genotype may be at higher risk f or RCE -related AEs. The effect of isovolemic hemodilution (IHD) on AE risk is likely minimal. Individualized AE risk assessment should be performed in all SCD patients undergoing chronic automated RCE. A systematic review and meta -analysis by Mukherjee et al. (2022) was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of automated red cell exchange (aRBX) procedure over manual red cell exchange transfusion (MET) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients . A standard meta -analysis protocol was developed, and after performing a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from nine re levant studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size calculated from the mean difference in hemoglobin S (HbS) percentage, serum ferritin level and risk ratio for the adverse events. Quality assessment was done using the risk -of-bias assessment tool, and a summary of observations was prepared using standard Cochrane methodology with GradePro GDT. The random -model analysis revealed mean difference 4.10 (95% CI: -3.29 - 11.49; Z = 1.09; P HbS percentage, mean difference of 435.29 (95% CI: 1.68; p = 0.09) ferritin and pooled risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.63 -2.87; Z = 0.77; P = 0.44) for adverse events. The authors concluded that this meta -analysis did not reveal any benefit of aRBX in reducing HbS percentage and attenuating the serum ferritin level when compared with MET. There was also no significant increased risk of adverse events detected in association with aRBX. Hequet et al. (2021) completed a prospective analysis to evaluate the clinical safety of the red blood cell (RBC) exchange (RCE)/RBC -primed procedure in 12 sickle cell anemia (SCA) low -weight children under either a chronic RCE program or emergency treatment over 65 sessions. The authors monitored grade 2 adverse events (AEs ) such as a decrease in blood pressure, increase in heart rate, fainting sensation, or transfusion reactions and identified the critical times during the s essions in which adverse events (AEs) could occur. Post -apheresis hematocrit (Hct) and a fraction of cell remaining (FCR) values were compared to the expected values. We also compared the impact of automatic RCE (n = 7) vs. RCE/RBC- primed (n = 8) on blood viscosity and RBC rheology. A low incidence of complications was observed in the 65 RCE sessions with only seven episodes of transient grade 2 AEs. Post -apheresis Hct and FCR reached expected values with the RCE/RBC- primed method. Both the automatic and priming procedures improved RBC deformability and decreased the sickling tendency during deoxygenation. Blood rheological features improved in both RCE/RBC -primed and automatic RCE without priming conditions. The authors concluded that RCE/RBC -primed procedure provides blood rheological benefits, and is safe and efficient to treat, notably in young children with SCA in prophylactic programs or curatively when a SCA complication occurs. Cochrane has published systematic reviews for the use of transfusion therapies, including simple or exchange transfusions, fo r the treatment of complications of sickle cell d isease including chronic chest complications (Estcourt et al ., 2019) and intrahepatic cholestasis (Mart\u00ed- Carvajal and Mart\u00ed-Amarista, 2020). In both of these systematic reviews, the authors could not find any published randomized controlled trials to evaluate the use of transfusion therapies in these instances. The authors recommend randomized controlled trials looking at the safety and efficacy of transfusion therapies compared to current standard therapies for these complications of sickle cell disease. Wahl et al. (2012) compared alloimmunization rates between patients receiving simple or exchange chronic transfusions with erythrocytapheresis (ECP). Data were retrospectively collected for 45 SCD patients (N = 23 simple, N = 22 ECP) who received blood transfusion of 10 to 15 ml of red blood cells (RBCs)/kg with eac h transfusion every 3 to 4 weeks on a chronic transfusion program to determine the rate of antibody formation (antibodies formed per 100 units transfused). The 45 patients received 10,949 units and formed 6 new alloantibodies during the study period; there fore, the overall alloimmunization rate was 0.055 alloantibodies per 100U. The ECP group received significantly more blood. The rate of antibody formation (auto plus allo) was 0.040 antibodies per 100U in the ECP group and 0.171 antibodies per 100U in the simple transfusion group. The alloantibodies formed per 100 units was 0.013 in the ECP group and 0.143 in the simple transfusion group. The authors concluded that chronic ECP should be considered in patients requiring optimal management of HbS levels and iron burden. The authors stated that concerns about increased alloimmunization with ECP may be unjustified. In a single center retrospective case series, Venkateswaran et al. (2011) performed chart reviews on 93 patients to evaluate the incidence of allo - and auto -immunization to red cell antibodies in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who were started on chronic red cell transfusion (RCT) . Each patient received RCTs every 3 -4 weeks for a minimum of 6 months with a total of 4,472 packed red blood cell units being administered. The authors reported that 9 patients (9%) had red cell antibodies prior to the initiation of chronic RCT and 23 patients (24%) developed one or more red cell antibodies during chronic RCT . The authors Apheresis Page 8 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. concluded that limited red c ell antigen matching is effective for reducing the incidence of allo - and auto- immunization in chronically transfused children with SCD and that RCE does not appear to increase the risk of allo - or auto- immunization, despite exposure to more red cell units . Velasquez et al. (2009) retrospectively reviewed red cell exchange (RCE) for the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in 44 patients with SCD. Clinical Respiratory Score (CRS) was assigned retrospectively to assess respiratory distress (0 = no distress, > 6 = severe). Median admission CRS of 2, progressed to 4 before RCE and declined to 2 within 24 hr. afterwards. Median day of RCE was day 2 (IQR 1 -3) and the main indication was worsening respiratory distress. No patient developed venous thrombosis, alloantibodies or other complications from RCE. According to the authors, RCE appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with SCD and ACS. The small study population limits the validity of the conclusion of this s tudy. Turner et al. (2009) evaluated the efficacy of exchange transfusion (XC) versus simple transfusion (ST) for treatment of SCA ACS. Twenty patients who received XC for ACS were compared with 20 patients who received ST. Cohorts were similar with regard to age; sex; prior ACS epi sodes; echocardiogram results; and antibiotic, bronchodilator, and hydroxyurea use. Maximum temperature recorded was higher in the XC group, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), WBCs, and indirect bilirubin comparable. levels were higher for XC (XC 8.6 g/dL vs. ST 7.4 g/dL, P = 0.02) and XC had higher peak Hb levels during hospitalization. No differences were demonstrable in post -procedure length of stay (XC 5.6 days vs. ST 5.9 days) or total length of stay (XC 8.4 days vs. ST 8.0 days). A tot al of 10.3 +/ - 3.0 units were transfused for XC compared to 2.4 +/ - 1.2 units for ST. Based on post procedure length of stay or total length of stay, the authors could not detect a difference in the efficacy of XC compared to ST in populations despite red blood cell product usage fourfold higher in the XC group. According to the authors, there is a need for an adequately powered, randomized trial to examine the true risk-benefit ratio of XC in ACS. Hulbert et al. (2006) conducted a retrospective cohort study of 137 children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and strokes to test the hypothesis that exchange transfusion at the time of stroke presentation more effectively prevents second strokes than simple transfusion. Children receiving simple transfusion had a 5 -fold greater relative risk of second stroke than those receiving exchange transfusions. Interpretation of these findings is limited due to the retrospective design of the study. Desensitization for Renal Transplants Plasmapheresis has been used prior to renal transplants in highly sensitized patients to remove human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. Desensitization protocols use high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or low dose IVIG with plasmapheresis to convert a positive crossmatch to a negativ e crossmatch and allow for transplantation. Plasmapheresis may continue after the transplant or be reserved for posttransplant treatment of acute antibody mediated rejection (AMR). Clinical trials have demonstrated that living or deceased donor kidney reci pients treated with plasmapheresis and IVIG have beneficial outcomes. In a single -center retrospective study, Campise et al (2019) evaluated their experience with prophylactic and therapeutic plasmapheresis in a cohort of 21 deceased- donor kidney transpla nt recipients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The analyzed ten patients who received post-transplant prophylactic plasmapheresis only with eleven who received both pre - and post -transplant prophylactic plasmapheresis. The also compared these groups to a historical control group of transplant recipients with FSGS who did not receive plasmapheresis prophylaxis. The authors observed that response to treatment was only seen in patients who received a more intensive prophylactic plasmapheresis regimen and that half of the recipients with FSGS recurrence did not respond to plasmapheresis and developed graft failure, a quarter of the recipients showed complete response and the remaining 25% became plasmapheresis dependent. While therapeutic plasmapheresis is still a valid treatment option for first- line treatment of relapsing FSGS, the authors concluded that there is no benefit from prophylactic plasmapheresis in deceased -donor kidney transplant recipients with FSGS and recommended that prospective randomized trials comparing alternative preemptive strategies be done. They acknowledged the limitations of this study including the retrospective view, the small, homogeneous sample size, and the differences in follow -up between the treatment groups. Montgomery et al. (2011b) used mathematical simulations verified by actual data from several national kidney -paired donation (KPD) programs to evaluate which donor/recipient phenotypes are likely to benefit from each transplant modality. They found that pairs that are easy to match are likely to receive compatible kidneys in a KPD. Those who are hard to match may be bette r served by desensitization with high -dose IVIG or plasmapheresis and low -dose IVIG. The phenotype which is both hard to match and hard to desensitize due to board and strong HLA reactivity are most likely to be transplanted by a hybrid modality utilizing desens itization after identifying a more immunologically favorable donor in a KPD. The authors state that recent outcomes from desensitization in which starting donor- specific antibody strength is low have been very good. For broadly Apheresis Page 9 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. sensitized patients with a h igh-strength cross match, searching for a better donor in a KPD pool can facilitate a safer and more successful desensitization treatment course. Montgomery et al. (2011a) used a protocol that included plasmapheresis and the administration of low -dose IVI G to desensitize 211 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -sensitized patients who underwent live -donor renal transplantation (treatment group). The rates of death were compared between the group undergoing desensitization treatment and 2 carefully matched control groups of patients on a waiting list for kidney transplantation who continued to undergo dialysis (dialysis -only group) or who underwent either dialysis or HLA -compatible transplantation (dialysis -or-transplantation group). In the treatment group, Kaplan -Meier estimates of patient survival were 90.6% at 1 year, 85.7% at 3 years, 80.6% at 5 years, and 80.6% at 8 years, as compared wit h rates of 91.1%, 67.2%, 51.5%, and 30.5%, respectively, for patients in the dialysis-only group and rates of 93.1%, 77.0%, 6 5.6%, and 49.1%, respectively, for patients in the dialysis -or-transplantation group. The authors concluded that live -donor transplantation after desensitization provided a significant survival benefit for patients with HLA sensitization, as compare d with waiting for a compatible organ. By 8 years, this survival advantage more than doubled. According to the authors, plasmapheresis does not result in a durable reduction in HLA antibody unless the patient undergoes transplantation within several days after th e last treatment. This factor accounts for the paucity of reports of protocols that use plasmapheresis to desensitize patients who are on the waiting list for a transplant from a deceased donor. Yuan et al. (2010) evaluated the efficacy of plasmapheresis plus low -dose IVIG in highly sensitized patients waiting for a deceased -donor renal transplant. Thirty -five highly sensitized patients (HLA class I panel reactive antibody greater than 50%) received plasmapheresis, plus low -dose IVIG treatme nt. In 25 patients (group 1), a positive T - and/or B -cell cytotoxicity crossmatch became negative by plasmapheresis plus low -dose IVIG treatment. Two patients did not receive renal transplants due to persistent positive crossmatch. Eight patients already h ad a negative crossmatch before desensitization. During the same time, 32 highly sensitized patients (group 2), without desensitization, had a negative crossmatch and received deceased- donor renal transplants. Group 1 showed a numerically higher rate of ac ute rejection (32.0% vs 21.9%) and AMR (20.0% vs 9.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Comparable mean serum creatinine levels at 24 months were observed. No difference in Kaplan- Meier graft survival was found between group 1 and group 2 after follow -up of 52 +/ - 26 months. The authors concluded that desensitization with plasmapheresis plus low -dose IVIG enables successful deceased - donor renal transplant in highly sensitized patients with a positive crossmatch. AMR occurred predominan tly in recipients with donor-specific antibodies of high titers. Meng et al. (2009) determined the percentage of panel reactivity and specificity of anti -HLA immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies in 73 presensitized renal allograft recipients who underwent cada veric renal transplantation compared with 81 unsensitized recipients who received cadaveric renal transplantation (control group). Sensitized patients had higher rates of graft reject ion and graft loss. A total of 20 out of the 73 patients received pre -transplantation plasmapheresis (PP) and/or Immunoadsorption (IA) and of these, 10 achieved negative panel reactive antibodies (PRAs). Graft rejection rate was 18% in unsensitized group, 41% in non -PP and/or IA sensitized group, and 20% in PP and/or IA sensiti zed group. Graft loss rate was 5% in unsensitized group, 21% in non -PP and/or IA sensitized group, and 15% in PP and/or IA sensitized group (20% positive PRA at transplant and 10% negative PRA at transplant). The authors concluded that pre -transplant PRA p reparations might improve the access of presensitized patients to renal donors. Pediatric ABO -Incompatible Heart Transplantation Issitt et al. (2021) completed a retrospective analysis and first case series of patients transplanted with ABO -IA to compare outcomes with those undergoing plasma exchange facilitated ABO -incompatible heart transplantation (ABO-PE). Data were retrospectively analyzed on all ABO -incompatible heart transplants undertaken at a single center between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2020 . Data included all routine laboratory tests, demographics and pre -operative characteristics, intraoperative details and post -operative outcomes. Primary outcome measures were volume of blood product transfusions, maximum post- transplant isohemagglutinin titers, occurrence of rejection, and graft survival. Secondary outcome measures were length of intensive care and hospital stay. Demographic and survival data were also obtained for ABO -compatible transplants during the same time period for comparison. Thirty -seven patients ages 7 months to 8 years old underwent ABO -incompatible heart transplantation, with 27 (73%) using ABO -PE and 10 (27%) using ABO -IA. ABO -IA patients were significantly older than ABO -PE patients ( P < 0.001) and the total volume of blood p roducts transfused during the hospital admission was significantly lower (164 [126- 212] ml/kg vs 323 [268-379] ml/kg, P < 0.001). No significant differences were noted between methods in either pre- or post-transplant maximum isohemagglutinin titers, incid ence of rejection, length of intensive care or total hospital stay. Survival comparison showed no significant difference between antibody reduction methods, or indeed ABO -compatible transplants ( P = 0.6). The authors concluded that this technique appears t o allow a significantly older population than typical to Apheresis Page 10 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. undergo ABO -incompatible heart transplantation, as well as significantly reducing blood product utilization. Furthermore, intraoperative anti -A/B immunoadsorption does not demonstrate increased early post-transplant isohaemagglutinin accumulation or rates of rejection compared to ABO -PE. Early survival is equivalent between ABO -IA, ABO -PE and ABO - compatible heart transplantation. Issitt et al. (2012) performed a retrospective analysis of all elective ABO -incompatible heart transplants performed at a single center from January 2001 - January 2011. Data included underlying conditions and demographics of the patients, the isohemagglutinin titer before and after plasma exchange, and survival figures to date. Twenty -one patients (ages 3 -44 months) underwent ABO -incompatible heart transplantation. All patients underwent a \"3 times\" plasma exchange before transplantation, requiring exchange volumes of up to 3209 mL. Isohemagglutinin titers that were as high as 1:32 preoperatively were reduced to a range of 0 -1:16 post transplantation . One patient expired from causes unrelated to organ rejection. The authors concluded that through the use of a combination of adult reservoir/pediatric oxygenator and extracorpore al circuit, ABO -incompatible plasma exchange transfusions can be undertaken safely using a simplified \"3 times\" method, reducing the circulating levels of isohemagglutinins while providing minimal circuit size. This allows ABO -incompatible heart transplant ation in a broader patient population than reported previously. Dipschand et al. (2010) conducted a non -randomized prospective observational single institution study comparing clinical outcomes over 10 years of the largest cohort of ABO- incompatible recip ients. ABO -incompatible (N = 35) and ABO -compatible (N = 45) infant heart transplantation recipients ( < 14 months old, 1996-2006) showed no important differences in pretransplantation characteristics. In 7 patients, donor- specific isohemagglutinin titers w ere elevated at the time of transplantation but were significantly reduced using intraoperative plasma exchange. Only 2 of the 7 required treatment for AMR (which occurred early post -transplantation, was easily managed and did not recur in follow -up). Occurrence of graft vasculopathy (11%), malignancy (11%) and freedom from severe renal dysfunction were identical in both groups. Survival was identical (74% at 7 years posttransplantation). The researchers concluded that ABO -blood group incompatible heart transplantation has excellent outcomes that are indistinguishable from those of the ABO -compatible population and there is no clinical justification for withholding this lifesaving strategy from all infants listed for heart transplantation. Further st udies in to observed differing responses in the development of donor -specific isohemagglutinins and the implications for graft accommodation are warranted. Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) and Sydenh am's Chorea Sigra et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review of published peer reviewed literature which addressed treatment for PANDAS and related disorders. Twelve studies ( N = 529) as well as 240 case reports were identified. Treatments evaluated in th ese studies included IVIG, TPE, antibiotics, cognitive behavior therapy, and tonsillectomy. The authors determined that the studi es generally had a high risk of bias and the results were inconclusive. Further rigorous research is needed. Eighteen patients were entered into a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to determine if IVIG or plasma exchange would be superior to prednisone in decreasing the severity of chorea. Mean chorea severity for the entire group was significantly lower at the 1 -month f ollow -up evaluation (overall 48% improvement). Although the between -group differences were not statistically significant, clinical improvements appeared to be more rapid and robust in the IVIG and plasma exchange groups than in the prednisone group (mean chorea severity scores decreased by 72% in the intravenous immunoglobulin group, 50% in the plasma exchange group, and 29% in the prednisone group). According to the authors, larger studies are required to confirm these clinical observations and to determine if these treatments are cost -effective for this disorder (Garvey, 2005). Rheumatoid Arthritis In a single institution observational study, Kitagaichi et al. evaluated the efficacy of treatment on 85 individuals with rhe umatoid arthritis (RA) using leukocytapheresis (LCAP) and drug therapy initiated between 2006 and 2015. Participants received LCAP once a week for up to 5 weeks. The clinical response was evaluated at the completion of the series and again 4 weeks later using the American College of Rheuma tology (ACR) criteria and the 28 -joint disease activity score (DAS28) of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Marked decreases were seen in tender joint count, swollen joint count, and CRP level, and the DAS28 -CRP was significantly improved from before to after LCAP. The authors concluded that LCAP is a safe and worthy therapy for individuals with intractable RA where there is drug allergy or other complications. ACR20 response was 61% , and efficacy persisted to 4 weeks after LCAP completion (201 6). Apheresis Page 11 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Roth (2004) conducted a noninterventional prospective study on 91 patients with RA who qualified for Prosorba column apheresis therapy (PCT) per the package insert and completed the 12 prescribed treatments. An initial baseline assessment was performed prior to first treatment and then up to 4 additional assessments were performed at weeks 9, 16, 20, and 24. Criteria from the ACR (ACR20) were noted in order to assess response rate, and commercial adverse event (AE) reporting was used to record serious/unanticipated AEs. There was a ACR20 (or greater) response rate of 53.8% in these patients with previously refractory RA. The individual criteria showed a much greater improvement than reflected by ACR20; for example, this response included a 52% improvemen t in joint tenderness, 40% improvement in swelling, 42% improvement in patient's pain, 38% improvement in patient's global response, and 48% improvement in physician's global scores (76% of responders had measured ACR20 by Week 16 and 100% by Week 24). Som e patients stated that they felt improvement began closer to the 6th week. Most responders were concurrently taking biologics or DMARD, e.g., methotrexate and etanercept, despite previously inadequate RA response to those medications. The author concluded that this post marketing study of PCT used commercially in 59 rheumatology practice settings supports the safety and efficacy of this treatment regime in selected patie nts with refractory RA and compares favorably with the initial sham controlled clinical trial. PCT is a relatively underutilized choice for the management of active, aggressive RA. Furst et al. (2000) conducted a double -blind, placebo RCT to determine the efficacy of the Prosorba Immunoadsorption Column in patients with refractory RA. Ninet y-nine patients received 12 weekly procedures after being randomized to the active treatment arm or to the sham treatment arm (apheresis only). Evaluations were double -blinded and occurred at baseline and periodically for 24 weeks thereafter. Primary effic acy was assessed at 7 and 8 weeks after the completion of 12 treatments (at trial weeks 19 and 20) using the ACR definition of improvement, and results from the assessments at weeks 19 and 20 were averaged. Analysis of patients who completed all treatments and follow -up indicated that 15 of 36 (41.7%) Prosorba -treated patients responded compared to 5 of 32 (15.6%) sham -treated patients. Common AEs included joint pain, fatigue, joint swelling, and hypotension. There was no significant increase in AEs in Pros orba -treated patients compared to sham -treated patients. The authors concluded that immunoadsorption therapy was proven to be a new alternative in patients with severe, refractory disease. Cardiovascular Disease A 2020 ECRI health technology assessment fo cuses on the effectiveness of LDL apheresis for treating steroid -resistant nephrotic syndrome associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS.) The conclusion of four small studies reported that LDL apheresis treatment may delay progression to end -stage renal disease and complications associated with chronic kidney disease. Additional studies and long -term follow up would be useful to confirm findings. All studies identified were conducted in Japan and results may not be generalizable to other countries and healthcare systems. Luirink, et al. (2020) performed a n observational multicenter cohort study on data from an international registry on the execution and outcomes of lipoprotein apheresis (LA) in children with homozygous familial hyperchole sterolemia . Their analysis included 50 children aged 0 -19 years who were treated at 15 sites in nine countries and who were on medication and LA for hoFH. The median age at diagnosis was 5.0 (3.0 - 8.0) years , and in 46 (92%) patients, the diagnosis of hoFH or compound heterozygous FH (heFH) was genetically confirmed . The median untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) level was 19.2 (16.2 - 22.1) mmol/L and the total cholesterol was 22.0 (18.4 -24.4) mmol/L for the study participants. On medication, the median LDL-C level was 14.4 (10.8 - 16.7) mmol/L showing a median reduction of LDL-C on medication of 19.3% (11.6 - 37.6). The children were started on apheresis on average at 2.8 (1.0-4.7) years after their diagnosis . The frequency of treatment ranged from two times per week to once every three weeks with most patients (n=21; 43% ) being treated weekly or once every two weeks ( N = 18; 37%) with most patients ( N = 35; 71%) having been treated for more than two years . Their analysis showed that the medial LDL -C in patients on LA for longer than 3 months dropped to 4.6 (3.8 - 7.2) mmol/L with the LDL- C being lower on average the more frequently patients were treated with LA . They reported that 7 (17%) patients reached mean LDL- C levels < 3.5 mmol/ , all of which were treated either once a week ( N = 4) or twice a week (N = 3). The authors concluded that the results show that LA may lead to a significant and relevant reduction of LDL -C in children with hoFH and that twice a week LA was significantly more effective in lowering mean LDL-C . They noted that the study had several limitations including the potential for variability in the data being entered and that the results might not be representativ e of the entire population of children with hoFH since the registry was not open to all sites treating all children with hoFH around the world. The authors recommend further studies with long -term follow -up data of the effect of LA on CVD or surrogate mark ers for CVD. Khan et al. (2017) conducted a single- blinded RCT to determine the clinical impact of lipoprotein apheresis in 20 patients with refractory angina and raised lipoprotein(a) > 500mg/L. Participants received 3 months of blinded weekly lipoprotein apheresis Apheresis Page 12 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. or sham, followed by crossover. The primary endpoint was change in quantitative myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR). Secondary endpoints included measures of atheroma burden, exercise capacity, symptoms, and qu ality of life. MPR increased following apheresis compared with sham, yielding a net treatment increase of 0.63. All secondary endpoints showed improvements as well. The researchers concluded that lipoprotein apheresis may represent an effective novel treat ment for patients with refractory angina and raised lipoprotein(a). They state that a larger study in these patients incorporating the impact of apheresis on major cardiovascular AEs would help to validate the findings. Low levels of high -density lipopro tein (HDL) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Researchers theorize that plasma selective delipidation converts alpha- HDL to pre -beta -like HDL, the most effective form of HDL for lipid removal from arterial plaques. However, there is a paucity of clinical evidence regarding HDL delipidation for various cardiac disease indications, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A search of the peer -reviewed medical literature identified one placebo - controlled RCT (N = 28) (Waksman et al., 2010). This study sought to determine whether serial autologous infusions of selective HDL delipidated plasma are feasible and well tolerated in patients with ACS. Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomized to either 7 weekly HDL selective delipidated or control plasma apheresis/ reinfusions. Patients underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) evaluation of the target vessel. All reinfusion sessions were tolerated well by all patients. The levels of prebeta -like HDL and alphaHDL in the delipidated plasma converted from 5.6% to 79.1% and 92.8% to 20.9%, respectively. The IVUS data demonstrated a numeric and non-significant trend toward regression in the total atheroma volume in the delipidated group compared with an increase of total atheroma volume in the control group. Study results demonstrated that serial autologous infusions of selective HDL delipidated plasma is clinically feasible and well tolerated. Study limitat ions included small study population and lack of appropriate blinding meth ods. The study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect differences between treatment and controls. Additional well -designed studies are necessary to determine the ability of HDL delipidation and plasma reinfusion to improve patient -relevant clinic al outcomes, such as the reduction of cardiovascular events and increased overall survival. A prospective, multi -center, international, two -arm matched -pair cohort study known as MultiSELECt is in progress, evaluating the clinical benefit of lipoprotein apheresis on cardiovascular outcomes.

(Accessed August 9, 2022 ) Light Chain Nephropathy In a multicenter retrospective study from 10 plasmapheresis centers in Turkey , Kalpakci et al (2021) observed that Therapeutic Plasma Exchange ( TPE) reduced all biochemical markers related to cast nephropathy (CN) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) when TPE was performed for up to seven days until improvement was seen in patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. A means Mean: 3.3 (median: 3) sessions of TPE were performed in newly diagnosed MM, mean: 4 (median: 4.5) sessions of TPE were performed in relapsed refractory disease, and 22 patients received concomitant chemotherapy containing bortezomib. According to the authors, the overall response rate was 83.6 % ( N=51) with statistically significant differences observed in serum levels of all clinically relevant biomarkers before and after treatment. The authors stated that TPE also contributed to the clinical improvement in 40 of 50 multiple myeloma patients with CN. The incidence of side effects associated with TPE was reported by the authors to affect 4 patients (6.6 %), with no severe side effects that required termination of the procedure. These results were noted one week after TPE was added to standard medical treatment. The authors noted that the main limitations of their study were the small sample size and the absence of a comparative control group, Premuzic et al. examined whether plasmapheresis in combination with chemotherapy could significantly remove free light chains (FLCs) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), ultimately improving renal recovery and patie nt survival in a single center study. During the study period, 29 patients with MM and AKI were treated with two different t herapy modalities (plasmapheresis with chemotherapy or bortezomib). At the end of treatment, a significant decrease of FLCs was present in the group treated with plasmapheresis compared to the bortezomib group. While overall survival was similar between groups, there was a significantly higher decrease of FLCs and longer survival in patients treated with > 3 plasmapheresis sessions than in patients treated with two sessions. The authors concluded that plasmapheresis therapy still remains a useful and effect ive method in the treatment of AKI in MM patients. Plasmapheresis significantly reduces FLCs compared to bortezomib, especially with higher number of plasma exchange sessions, but it must be combined with other chemotherapy agents in order to prolong renal recovery and therefore patient survival (2018). Yu et al. (2015) conducted a meta -analysis to quantitatively evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy with or without plasmapheresis in the treatment of MM patients with renal failure. Three RCTs were selected and analyzed. A total of 63 patients received chemotherapy only and 84 patients were given both chemotherapy and plasmapheresis. No difference was Apheresis Page 13 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. observed in 6 -month survival rate between plasmapheresis and control group (75% vs. 66.7%). The 6 -month dialysis-dependent ratio was significantly lower in patients treated with both chemotherapy and plasmapheresis than chemotherapy alone (15.6% vs. 37.2%). The authors concluded that plasmapheresis used as an adjunct to chemotherapy had a benefit in the management of dialysis-dependent MM patients with renal failure. A systematic review covering 56 articles regarding survival benefits, recovery, and improvement in renal function after extracorporeal removal of sFLCs did not suggest a benefit of plasmaph eresis independent of chemotherapy for MM patients with acute renal injury (Gupta et al., 2010). Inflammatory Bowel Disease A retrospective observational study was completed by Fukuchi et al. (2022) to examine the long -term maintenance rate after inducing remission by intensive granulocyte/monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) without use of corticosteroids (CS) and GMA re -treatment efficacy in the same patients upon relapse with ulcerative colitis. Patients who achieved clinical remission and mucosal healin g (MH) by first -time intensive GMA (first GMA) without CS were enrolled. The cumulative non- relapse survival rate up to week 156 was calculated. Patients with relapse during the maintenance period underwent second -time intensive GMA (second GMA) without CS . Clinical remission and MH rates following second GMA were compared to those following first GMA in the same patients. Of the 84 patients enrolled, 78 were followed until week 156 and 34 demonstrated relapse. The cumulative non -relapse survival rate by we ek 156 was 56.4%. Clinical remission and MH rates after second GMA did not differ from those after first GMA in the same patients (week 6: clinical remission, 100% vs 88.4%, P = 0.134; MH, 100% vs 84.8%, P = 0.074). The authors concluded for the goal of MH in UC patients, intensive GMA prior to use of CS and biologics can be a suitable choice. Such cases generally have a favorable clinical prognosis, including a sufficient rate of clinical remission maintenance, as well as superior re -induction rate of clin ical and endoscopic remission by GMA re -treatment even when disease relapse occurs. In a systematic review and meta -analysis on the role of granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) in the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in ulcerative colit is (UC) , Kiss, et al. (2021) analyzed 11 studies that included a total of 589 patients . The studies consisted of 11 RCTs with one study with minimization. Eight of the studies reported on patients with active UC and three contained data on patients with UC who were in clinical remission. In the studies on patients with active UC, 350 patients received GMA and 248 were in control groups . With regard to the th ree studies reporting on patients with UC who were in clinical remission, there were 71 participants , of which , 36 received GMA and 35 were in the control groups. Risk of bias was assessed as high risk for three of the studies due to the unblinded design of the studies, four studies were assessed as high risk due to the lack of a description of the blinding process and two others were assessed as high risk of bias for other biases. The authors noted that their results were limited by the relatively low numb er of patients and the heterogenous reporting of adverse events . The study was also limited by the heterogeneity of the study designs such as the treatments rendered , the length of the studies , and the number of participants. The authors concluded that GMA appears to be more effective as an adjunctive treatment in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with UC than conventional therapy alone (low certainty ). The authors recommend further RCTs to justify the role of GMA for inducing remission in patients with UC. A large -scale, prospective, observational study was performed by Yokoyama et al. (2014) which enrolled patients from 116 medical facilities in Japan with active ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with LCAP. Out of 847 patients, 623 were available for efficacy analysis. 80.3% of the patients had moderate to severe disease activity, and 67.6% were steroid refractory. Concomitant medications, 5 -aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids, and thiopurines were administered to 94.8%, 63.8%, and 32.8% of the patients, respectively. In addition, infliximab and tacrolimus were concomitantly used in 5.8% and 12.3%, respectively. Intensive LCAP ( 4 sessions within the first 2 weeks) was used in > 70% of the patients. AEs were seen in 10.3%, which were severe in only 5 patients. Any concomitant medications did not increase the incidence of AEs. The authors concluded that that LCAP, including intensive procedure, is a safe and effective therapeutic option for active UC. However, t his study did not translate research data into clinical guidelines that can be used to improve physician decision -making and patient care. Clinical Practice Guidelines American College of Rheumatology (ACR) In their 2021 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis the ACR focused their guidance on the pharmacologic management of rheumatoid arthritis. Although they initially intended to include Apheresis Page 14 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. nonpharmacologic treatment approaches in this guideline, th e ACR stated that the use of vaccines and nonpharmacologic treatment approaches will be included in future ACR treatment guideline publications. American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) The ASFA (Padmanabhan et al., 2019) has reviewed therapeutic apheresis o utcomes and published practice guidelines. The guidelines included analysis based on the quality of the evidence as well as the strength of recommendation derived from the evidence. ASFA categorizes disorders as noted below: Category I: Disorders for which apheresis is accepted as first -line therapy, either as a primary standalone treatment or in conjunction with other modes of treatment. Category II: Disorders for which apheresis is accepted as second -line therapy, either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other modes of treatment. Category III: Optimum role of apheresis therapy is not established. Decision making should be individualized. Category IV: Disorders in which published evidence demonstrates or suggests apheresis to be ineffective or harmful. IRB approval is desirable if apheresis treatment is undertaken in these circumstances. ASFA recognized that categories alone are difficult to translate into clinical practice. Thus, they adopted a system to assig n recommendation grades for the rapeutic apheresis to enhance the clinical value of ASFA categories. The grading recommendations are adopted from Guyatt et al., 2008, Szczepiorkowski et al., 2010, Schwartz et al., 2016, and Padmanabhan et al., 2019: Grade 1A: Strong recommendation, high -quality evidence Grade 1B: Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence Grade 1C: Strong recommendation, low -quality or very low -quality evidence Grade 2A: Weak recommendation, high quality evidence Grade 2B: Weak recommendation, moderate quality evide nce Grade 2C: Weak recommendation, low -quality or very low -quality evidence Regarding sickle cell disease, ASFA states: Red blood cell (RBC) exchange is an option for patients with acute stroke, severe acute chest syndrome (ACS), or other complications i ncluding but not limited to multiorgan failure. RBC exchange is also recommended as a prophylaxis for primary or secondary stroke. Studies have shown automated RBC exchange results in a more efficient removal/replacement of HbS RBCs than manual exchange or simple transfusions. Long -term RBC exchange has the advantage of preventing or markedly reducing transfusional iron accumulation (Padmanabhan et al., 2019). American Society of Hematology (ASH) The ASH published a clinical guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in children and adults with sickle cell disease that includes the following as strong recommendations (DeBaun et al. 2020): For children with HbSS or HbS 0 thalassemia (ages 2 -16 years), the panel recommends: o Annual Transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening (strong recommendation). o Regular blood transfusions for at least a year (vs no transfusion) with the goal of keeping maximum HbS levels below 30% and maintaining hemoglobin levels .9 .0 g/dL to reduce the risk of stroke for children with abnormal TCD velocities who live in a high- income setting where regular blood transfusion therapy, typically every 3 -4 weeks, is feasible (strong recommendation). o Blood transfusion goals for secondary stroke prevention of increasing the hemoglobin above 9 g/dL at all times and maintaining the HbS level at ,30% of total hemoglobin until the time of the next transfusion if the child has a history of prior ischemic stroke. For children or adults with SCD and acute neurological deficits, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), the ASH guideline panel recommends prompt blood transfusion given immediately upon recognition of symptoms within 2 hours of acute neurological symptom presentation. The type of tr ansfusion (simple, modified exchange, or apheresis) is dependent on individual patient factors and local transfusion resources. Apheresis Page 15 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. The ASH guideline also includes the following conditional recommendations: For children who have compound heterozygous SCD oth er than HbSC and have evidence of hemolysis in the same range as those with HbSS, the ASH guideline panel suggests: o TCD screening o Regular blood transfusions for at least a year (vs no transfusion) with the goal of keeping maximum HbS levels below 30% to re duce the risk of stroke if the child has an abnormal TCD velocity, and lives in a high- income setting where regular blood transfusion therapy is feasible For children with SCD (ages 2 -16 years) and abnormal TCD results who have been receiving transfusion therapy for at least 1 year and are interested in stopping transfusion, according to the clinical trial risk stratification with an MRI and magnet ic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain, the ASH guideline panel suggests that hydroxyurea treatment at th e maximum tolerated dose can be considered to substitute for regular blood transfusions. For children (ages 2 -16 years) with HbSS, HbS 0 thalassemia, or compound heterozygous SCD who have abnormal TCD screening and live in low -middle -income settings where regular blood transfusion therapy and chelation therapy are not available or affordable, the ASH guideline panel suggests hydroxyurea therapy with at least 20 mg/kg per day at a fixed dose or the maximum tolerated dose. For children or adults with SCD and acute neurological deficits including TIA, the ASH guideline panel suggests exchange transfusion vs simple transfusion. When exchange transfusion is not available within 2 hours of presentation for medical care and hemoglobin is #8.5 g/dL, simple transfusi on can be performed to avoid delays in treatment while a manual exchange transfusion or an automated apheresis is planned. For adults and children with SCD, moyamoya syndrome, and a history of stroke or TIA, the ASH guideline panel suggests evaluation for revascularization surgery in addition to regular blood transfusion For all patients, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should not delay prompt simple or exchange blood transfusion therapy for adults with SCD presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who are being evaluated for IV tPA (age 18 years, no hemorrhage on computed tomography [CT] scan, within 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms/signs and without contraindications for thrombolysis). The ASH also published guidelines for transfusion support for patients with SCD which includes the following suggestion s regarding transfusion and transfusion modalities in patients with SCD who require chronic therapy (Chou et al., 2020): The use of automated red cell exchange (RCE) over sim ple transfusion or manual RCE : o In patients with SCD (all genotypes) receiving chronic transfusions o In patients with SCD and severe acute chest syndrome o In patients with SCD and moderate acute chest syndrome Either RCE with isovolemic hemodilution (IHD -RCE ) or conventional RCE in patients with SCD (all genotypes) receiving chronic transfusions Either prophylactic transfusion at regular intervals or standard care (transfusion when clinically indicated for a complicati on or hemoglobin lower than baseline) for pregnant patients with SCD (all genotypes) Preoperative transfusion over no preoperative transfusion in patients with SCD undergoing surgeries requiring general anesthesia and lasting more than 1 hour. Iron overload screening by MRI (MRI; R2, T2*, or R2*) for liver iron content every 1 to 2 years compared with serial monitoring of ferritin levels alone in patients with SCD (all genotypes) receiving chronic transfusion therapy Not adding routine iron overload screening by T2* MRI for cardiac iron conten t compared with serial monitoring of ferritin levels alone in patients with SCD (all genotypes) receiving chronic transfusion therapy National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines on acute myeloid leukemia indicate that leukapheresis is not reco mmended in the routine management of patients with a high WBC in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) because of the difference in leukemia biology . However, in life threatening cases with leukostasis that is not responsive to other modalities, leukapheresis can be considered with caution (2022). The NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline for Multiple Myeloma indicates that plasmapheresis should be used as an adjunctive therapy for symptomatic hyperviscosity . The Guideline also notes that supportive management of renal disease in multiple myeloma includes plasmapheresis for the mechanical removal of Free Light Chain s (FLCs ) with a goal of removal of 50% as a category 2B recommendation (2022). Apheresis Page 16 of 20 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) The NHLBI published a clinical guideline for the management of SCD that includes the following recommendations relative to therapeutic apheresis (2014): In children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA), screen annually with Transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening according to methods employed in the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) studies, beginning at age 2 and continuing until at least age 16. In children with conditional (170 -199 cm/sec) or elevated (>200 cm/sec) TCD results, refer to a specialist wit h expertise in chronic transfusion therapy aimed at preventing stroke. In children and adults with SCD with confirmed acute hepatic syndrome (AHS) or severe acute intrahepatic cholestasis (AIC), perform simple or exchange transfusion In all persons with SC D, perform urgent exchange transfusion \u2014with consultation from hematology, critical care, and/or apheresis specialists\u2014when there is rapid progression of ACS as manifested by oxygen saturation below 90 percent despite supplemental oxygen, increasing respira tory distress, progressive pulmonary infiltrates, and/or decline in hemoglobin concentration despite simple transfusion. In consultation with a sickle cell expert, perform exchange transfusion in people with SCD who develop acute stroke confirmed by neuroi maging. Initiate prompt evaluation, including neurologic consultation and neuroimaging studies, in people with SCD who have mild, subtle, or recent history of signs or symptoms consistent with transient ischemic attack. In children and adults who have had a stroke, initiate a program of monthly simple or exchange transfusions. In people with SCD and multi-symptom organ failure (MSOF), immediately initiate either simple or exchange transfusion in consultation with a sickle cell expert or hematologist. In adu lts and children with SCA, transfuse red blood cells (RBCs) to bring the hemoglobin level to 10 g/dL prior to undergoing a surgical procedure involving general anesthesia. In adults and children with Hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) or Hemoglobin SB+ (beta) thalassemia (HbSB+ -thalassemia), consult a sickle cell expert to determine if full or partial exchange transfusion is indicated before a surgical procedure involving general anesthesia. Administer iron chelation therapy, in consultation with a hematologist, to patients with SCD and with documented transfusion -acquired iron overload. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) The Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) information page states that relapses and attacks of NMO (also known as Devic Syndrome) are often treated with corticosteroids and plasma exchange (National Institutes of Health, July 2022). National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) In the clinical pathway for managing familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), NICE (2021) made the following recommendations regarding clinical indications for low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis: Lipid -modifying drug therapy be considered before LDL apheresis in patients under 16 years of age; LDL apheresis should be considered for adults and children/young people with homozygous FH depending on factors such as the person's response to lipid -modifying drug therapy and the presence of coronary artery disease; LDL apheresis should be considered for people with heterozygous FH in exceptional circumstances, such as when there is progressive, symptomatic heart disease that does not respond to maximal tolerated lipid -modifying drug therapy and optimal medical and surgical therapy. NICE clinical guidelines on the management of MS in adults do not address any type of therapeutic apheresis ( 2022). NICE also recommended that Extracorporeal Photopheresis should not be used outside the context of research for Crohn's disease for both adults and children (2009).
