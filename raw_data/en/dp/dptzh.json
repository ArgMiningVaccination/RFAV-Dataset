Read on to learn what these healing stones can do for you! We typically think of arthritis as something our grandparents complain about - creaky, stiff joints and limited mobility. But that's far from the story of arthritis. Arthritis refers to hundreds of different musculoskeletal ailments that can affect people of all ages. It presents as inflammation, pain, and stiffness in our joints where the cartilage at the end of bones has begun to wear. The forms of arthritis we hear about the most are osteoarthritis (which often comes with age or injury) and rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic disease with an early age onset). By 2040, the number of U.S. adults with doctor-diagnosed arthritis conditions is predicted to [increase by 50 percent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27015600/) from its current number, which will be an estimated 78.4 million adults or a quarter of the U.S. adult population. And that's just doctor-diagnosed cases and adults. That's the thing. Arthritic conditions often go undiagnosed. We dismiss our achy knees and sore back as overworked or a result of stress. Our mental, emotional, and physical health greatly impact our likelihood of developing arthritis. Part of it is genetics, too. However, we can take care of our body, mind, and soul to balance our reactions to arthritic pain and find relief from physical discomfort. By incorporating crystals for arthritis into your pain management plan, you can experience the relief you need to live a happier life. Best 12 Crystals for Arthritis One of the most important actions to take for arthritis pain relief is to find mental stability and emotional peace.

With clear, tranquil thoughts, you can gain the energy for physical rehabilitation and therapy. Check out these 12 crystals to include in daily treatments for arthritis... Fluorite To hear from a doctor that you have arthritis can bring mixed feelings and emotions. On the one hand, it's somewhat of a relief to know where your pain is coming from.

How to Use These Arthritis Crystals In order to find relief from arthritis with these crystals, you need to incorporate them into your daily lifestyle. Try these three methods for using crystals for arthritis... Maintain a Physical Connection to Crystals You can wear [crystal jewelry](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/jewelry) to maintain the healing energy of crystals within your aura. There are many styles of rings, bracelets, pendants, necklaces, and more to unconsciously reap the benefits of crystal vibrations. If you don't typically wear jewelry, placing a [small tumbled stone](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/tumbled-stones) in your pocket will maintain the energetic field against your body. When you remember it during the day, you can place it in your hands and harness mental thoughts of healing. Regularly Practice Chakra-Balancing Meditation A strong core and spine go a long way to keep us active and pain-free. Our [chakra system](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/chakra-system) runs along the vertical pole from the crown of the head to our pelvic root. Doing a balancing meditation once a week can help you tune in to your pain management. While arthritic pain may reside in many parts of your body, using crystals for arthritis in conjunction with a [chakra-balancing meditation](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/chakra-meditation) can bring balance to the pain and strength we need. If you feel emotional or depressed one week, use crystals associated with your heart or crown chakras. If you feel an imbalance in pain, focus on your root and sacral chakras. By taking time to bring all seven [chakras into alignment](https://cosmiccuts.com/pages/chakra-alignment), you build a solid axis from which to focus energy on healing. Use With Therapeutic Treatments A doctor will have many methods to help you find relief from arthritis pain. Often, this will include spending time resting your joints. You may be told to apply heat or ice to your arthritic joints to calm inflammation and pain. This is a great way to invite crystals into your [physical healing](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crystals-for-physical-healing) processes. While applying a warm or cold pack on your body, you can place crystals on top or between the pack and your skin to let their healing vibrations help. Or try a steamy crystal bath. Steep your crystals for arthritis as you fill your tub with water. Add any essential oils or epsom salts. Carefully remove the crystals - they will be hot to touch - and set them around your tub as you soak and breathe in relief.
