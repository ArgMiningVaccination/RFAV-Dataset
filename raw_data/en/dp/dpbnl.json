The Amazonian Shipibo-Konibo tribe shares with all indigenous medicine traditions a deep understanding of the interconnectedness between human beings and the natural world and the knowledge that true healing encompasses a holistic set of tools, which address the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of a human being. Liana is deeply grateful for being called to this medicine path, which offers unparalleled opportunities for personal and collective growth and transformation. Liana remains a humble lifelong student of Maestro Don Enrique, as well as of her many wise plant teachers. Within sacred ceremony, Liana creates and maintains a compassionate, safe, wise and loving container. Springtime Sacred Medicine Retreat Lost River, WV April 20-23, 2023 Please join Liana and Itzbeth for an intimate springtime retreat on unceded territory of the Shawnee and Ohio Valley tribes in Lost River, West Virginia. Liana Brooks-Rubin is an acupuncturist, herbalist, yoga teacher, and curandera in the Shipibo-Konibo Amazonian Plant Medicine Tradition. Itzbeth Menj\u00edvar serves as a time and wisdom keeper in her own recently-reclaimed Mayan lineage, as well as a thought leader in the fields of racial healing and justice, cross-cultural leadership, and peace-building for justice. The two met a decade ago in Liana's acupuncture clinic and reconnected in 2021 after discovering their joint passion for individual, collective and earth-based holistic healing grounded in indigenous spirituality and holistic medicine traditions. Indigenous and spiritual traditions throughout the planet share the understanding that we human beings carry a spark of divine life force, which also runs through the stars, planets, soils, plants, animals and minerals with which we share the planet. We are of the stars and all of the elements of the earth, interconnected with one another and All-That-Is. Yet through personal, familial, ancestral and collective trauma and the intersecting systems of oppression in which we live, many of us have forgotten that we are interconnected within (body-mind-spirit-emotions) and without (me with you, you with the wild rivers, stars, and forests). This retreat is designed to support a deep, embodied remembrance of who we are and how to be in right relationship with ourselves, one another and Mother Earth. We do this through sacred ceremony, plant medicine, song, aligned movement, meditation, rest and time in nature. We are delighted to co-create this experience with you!
