It is for you that the BC Cancer Agency has created Forward . Now in its fourth issue, this magazine was developed specifically to provide information, support and inspiration. In our last issue, we included a readership survey to get your responses to the content of the magazine to date and to elicit your ideas on future subjects that might be of interest or value. I' d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who responded to the survey. Y our feedback has been invaluable and will help us to bring you even more great stories in the future. Once again, this edition of Forward brings a real-life perspective to life after cancer treatment. In our cover story (page 10), former BC MLA (now organic farmer) Corky Evans speaks with remarkable honesty and candor about his experience with prostate cancer. His story reminds us that no one said the journey would be easy.Linda Day of the Oneida First Nation (page 8) speaks about her journey with breast cancer and how she called upon her aboriginal heritage to help her heal - knowledge which she now shares with other aboriginal cancer patients. Cancer treatment, while healing, can also create changes. In this issue, we answer some of the most-asked questions about coping with changes in body image. We also look at approaches to dealing with insomnia (page 18) and managing the roller coaster of emotions that sometimes lingers long after treatment has ended (page 16). In addition, we're pleased to introduce a new nurse practitioner program that has been developed to provide primary care to patients after cancer treatment (page 5). True to its name, Forward is always looking ahead. In that vein, we're pleased to highlight some of the exciting BC Cancer Agency-led advances in the treatment of lymphoid cancers using new drugs and drug combinations (page 13). I hope you enjoy this issue, and that you feel the hope, joy and optimism with which it was created. www.bccancer.bc.ca @BCCancer_AgencyDr. Nick Foster Interim Head BC Cancer Agency, PHSAspring 201 5 FORWARD | 5Living Well A 2013 survey published in a Health Council of Canada report states that between three and 15 per cent of Canadians don't have a primary health-care provider (usually a family doctor) depending on the province where they live. In BC alone, it is estimated that more than 100,000 people who would like a primary care provider don't have one; instead, they access health services through walk-in clinics or emergency departments. However, establishing a long-term relationship with a health professional is important, especially for people who have had cancer and often need to navigate issues resulting from their cancer. That's where the BC Cancer Agency Provincial Survivorship Program plays a key role. \"Oncologists have a very particular function for a person dealing with cancer, \" explains Jill Matheson, a nurse practitioner (NP) with the Provincial Survivorship Program, who is based at the Jim Pattison Outpatient Care and Surgery Centre in Surrey, BC. \" As primary care providers, NPs offer patients services that include diagnosing, treating, screening, monitoring, prescrib-ing medications, specialist referrals and overall health education, while working closely with oncologists and other health-care professionals, \" says Matheson. \"We provide people without a family doctor a way to access the health services they need, ensuring patients get the followup care required after cancer and enabling oncologists to focus on their specialty. \" The program, which also provides NP care to the family members of cancer survivors, is located in Vancouver and Surrey, and plans to expand throughout the province. \"We are well equipped to help people in various stages of dealing with cancer and their families by offering resources, specific support and care to help them enjoy a better quality of life, \" says Matheson. NPs with the Survivorship Program have extensive training, including graduate degrees and post-graduate training. They have also completed the BC Cancer Agency's Lecture Series in Oncology Education for Primary Care Practitioners and have spent numerous hours working in patient clinics. \"People live a long time now with cancer and we can beat it like never before, yet there are many health issues associated with that, \" says Matheson. \"Our training and experience enable us to deal with both the physical and emotional aspects that result from cancer, along with the everyday ailments and issues people face. \" PHOTO BY CHUCK RUSSELLHow to access the BC Cancer Agency Provincial Survivorship Program Nurse practitioners are available in Vancouver and Surrey for oncology patients of all ages.

The nutrition recommendations include eating more whole grains and non-starchy plant foods that are high in nutrients and dietary fibre, such as green leafy vegetables, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes and carrots. While fruits are also good for you, evidence suggests that vegetables are even more healthful. \"The key is to eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables because each brings something different to the table, \" says Sekhon. \"The best choice is fresh, local and in-season, followed by frozen. \" (Canned fruits and vegetables are often high in sugar or salt.) Baby steps to better nutrition Another step on the road to wellness is limiting or eliminating processed foods that are high in fat and nitrites (chemicals used to cure meat), which may increase cancer risk, as well as sugary drinks; too much of both can lead to obesity, which increases the risk for certain cancers. It's also important to eat less red meat (beef, pork, lamb and goat) which, in large quantities, has been linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Alcoholic drinks should be kept to two a day for men and one for women: \"If you can eliminate alcohol altogether, it's even better, \" says Sekhon. That's because alcohol consumption has been linked to cancers of the head, neck, esophagus, breast, liver, colon and rectum. For the record, alcohol includes beer, wine and liquor or distilled spirits, such as gin, rum, vodka and whisky. If all of these steps sound daunting, start by making small changes. Sekhon offers this simple solution: \"Take your favourite chili recipe, cut the meat by 25 per cent and increase the vegetables and kidney beans - that way it's still a familiar Living Well PHOTOS: GETTY IMAGES (BASKET), iSTOCKmeal but more nutritious. \" For more information, you can consult with a registered dietitian through the free HealthLink BC service by calling 8-1-1. On weekdays, a dietitian specializing in cancer care can assess your eating habits and suggest improvements. For the most part, it's common sense: \"Nutrition guidelines for cancer survivors are similar to general good nutrition guidelines, \" says Sekhon.

Ingredients spring 201 5 FORWARD | 7PHOTOS: GETTY IMAGES (BASKET), iSTOCKA Healing Culture Linda Day is using her own experience as a breast cancer survivor to inspire other First Nations people to get tested and help take the fear out of a cancer diagnosis PHOTO BY CHUCK RUSSELLWhen Linda Day was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2012, she was surprised, and somewhat in denial. \"We don't get breast cancer, \" says Day, an aboriginal woman from Ontario's Oneida First Nation, who is now deputy executive director for the Vancouver Native Health Society ( VNHS ). VNHS is an organization that delivers medical counselling and social services for Vancouver's Downtown Eastside aboriginal community. \"I never knew any other aboriginal woman who had breast cancer. I asked around my relatives and we don't have a family history of it. \" Day even had a screening mammogram a few months earlier as part of a BC Cancer Agency screening program held at the Positive Outlook Program at VNHS , and the test came up negative. While she was in some physical pain from a fibromyalgia diagnosis, Day didn't even suspect cancer until she was at home recovering from the first of two hip replacements. It was during that time that she noticed a lump above her left breast. Day didn't give it much thought until a couple of weeks later, when she noticed the lump had grown and changed shape. She immediately went to her family doctor, who sent her for a diagnostic test at the BC Cancer Agency. That began the difficult process of testing and waiting for results, and more testing and waiting, before a breast cancer diagnosis was confirmed. \"The time between the diagnosis and waiting for surgery and treatment was the hardest part, because this cancer tumor was in me and I wanted it out, stat!\" says Day. At the end of May 2012, Day underwent a lumpectomy on her left breast. The test results showed good news; the cancer had not spread. Two months later, Day began the first of 17 chemotherapy treatments to help rid her body of the disease, together with a month of radiation therapy. While in chemotherapy, she also had her second hip replaced. Day is cancer-free today and credits her recovery to her traditional beliefs and the medical system, including her oncologist, with whom she developed a close bond, as well as traditional healing and teachings from her First Nations community. Day wanted to use her experience to help others. In February 2013, she started the Aboriginal Cancer Care Program ( ACCP ) at VNHS . The ACCP helps to raise awareness, not just about breast cancer but other common forms of the disease, such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The goal of the ACCP is to build a community of support for individuals who receive a cancer diagnosis, as well as their families and loved ones. It's a culturally supportive cancer program that utilizes the Medicine Wheel's four quadrants - spiritual, mental, physical and emotional - in cancer education. Day says First Nations people need to gain more awareness about cancer, treat-ments and support programs, and draw on their traditions, resiliency and cultural strengths while dealing with the disease. When she was fighting breast cancer, Day participated in healing circles and various traditional healings, where her family and friends gathered to express their love and support for her. There was also a \"brushing off \" ceremony, where feathers were used to symbolically and literally brush off and cleanse her body. \"It was very powerful and helped so much in my healing, \" Day recalls. Her battle with cancer was, of course, difficult at times. There was the pain, but also losing her long hair was hard to deal with at first. Day says it wasn't about vanity, but that she always had long hair. Over time, it became a part of her identity as an indigenous woman. Overall, having cancer and the treatment was \"very hard on my psyche, \" says Day, who adds that she never felt bitter about having the disease, and feels blessed to have survived. \"I never thought, 'Why me?' Instead I thought, 'Why not me?' I was meant to get through it and to tell other people that it doesn't have to take you down. Sometimes it may feel that way, but you can get through it. \" Day's goal now is to help take some of the fear out of a cancer diagnosis: \"I believe that the fear that cancer is a death sentence is preventing some people from getting screened. I want to offer those people hope. \"I've had people come to me and say, 'I saw how you handled it, and if it happened to me I could get through it too. ' That's empowering. \" Journeys 8 | FORWARD spring 201 5s he sits by the fireside of his home on the edge of the Slocan River, Corky Evans, one of the more memorable characters in British Columbia's political history, prepares to tell a story he hasn't told before - his experience with prostate cancer. He was in his late 40s when he was sent for a routine prostate exam. Corky's results were flagged, and further testing was suggested. But he was at the start of a busy decade in his political career; coming in a close second for the leadership of the province's New Democratic Party (first against Glen Clark, and then against Ujjal Dosanjh, both of whom went on to become premier), and subsequently serving in various ministerial positions in both cabinets. Ten years went by, and with his prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) numbers still rising, the man who didn't want to talk about cancer or his prostate now had to undergo a biopsy. At Kootenay Boundary Regional Hospital in Trail, he was told he had a moderately aggressive form of prostate cancer, and that he needed surgery. Somewhat begrudgingly, he agreed to a surgical consult with Dr. Larry Goldenberg at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, and it was there Corky got clear on his options. \"He [Goldenberg] was really straight with me, \" Corky recalls. \"We talked about possible side-effects of surgery, including having to have to pee in a bag, or not wanting sex again. But what are you going to do?\" What Corky did do, on Goldenberg's advice, was explore prostate brachytherapy. A type of radiation therapy, brachytherapy involves the insertion of radioactive seeds next to the cancer cells, allowing the radiation to kill the cancer cells while causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue. During a subsequent appointment at the BC Cancer Agency's Sindi Ahluwalia Hawkins Centre for the Southern Interior in Kelowna, Corky was impressed by Dr. David Kim, who surprised both Corky and his partner, Helen Sebelius, with his willingness to talk through every question the couple had about brachytherapy as an alternative to surgery. In 2010, research backed up Corky's desire to continue to wait and see, so another year went by before his PSA spiked again, and then it was time to take action. He was soon headed back to the Okanagan to undergo the brachytherapy procedure. Helen couldn't get away to come with him at the time, and Corky remembers spending a The colourful longtime BC MLA, now certified organic farmer, speaks candidly about his journey through cancerCorky EvansFeature PHOTO BY JEREMY ADDINGTON continued on page 12 10 | FORWARD spring 2015A12 | FORWARD spring 2015desolate night in a Kelowna hotel after the treatment. \" A neighbour from home was passing through and brought me a bowl of soup, \" he recalls, still moved years later by the kind gesture. \"It was one of those moments where you see a person's face, and you're not quite sure if it's a person, or it could be an angel. \" Corky, a lifelong smoker, is matter-of-fact, too, about having a cigarette at mid - night in the hotel parking lot because he was in pain and miserable. \"I certainly wasn't going to quit that night, \" he says, of what he describes as his addiction and his failure, although he points out that he hasn't had a drink since 1986. As he looks out over the fields of the farm where he has spent the past 45 years, Corky's memories of the year after his procedure are not happy ones: \"I pissed blood and I hurt for a long time, although Helen says it was because I got on my tractor too soon. \" He is frank about the other downsides of the procedure, includ - ing lost libido and reduced bladder control. \"Beautiful women and sexual activity are a driver of real life, \" he observes. \"For me, that part of my heart is somewhat severed. \" Corky is equally candid as he reflects on how he feels he handled the experience: \"I didn't go through this process well. Not only did I not follow doctor's advice, I didn't even read about it. I didn't even know the questions that I might ask. I was a failure when it came to learning and thinking about cancer and my prostate. \" What changed after his cancer experience in 2011 was what he chose to do moving forward. \"I was trying to decide what to do in my last years as MLA . There was another election ahead, and I thought about the people and the fact that they like me, and I like them, and I think I could be elected until I'm dead. But I' d really like to farm or garden. \" He recalls how Helen - his farming collaborator, life partner and a former arts administrator - helped him make up his mind with a simple question: \"Do you want to die on your tractor or die in the legislature?\" she asked. Corky says the answer was clear: \"I' d like to be here, in this place. \"This place is his and Helen's Against the Wind Farm in Winlaw, BC. As a farmer of certified organic garlic, blueberries, potatoes and turkeys, it's here where Corky can be seen, during the growing sea - son, with a trail of turkeys waddling behind him or a tousle of dried organic garlic in hand. He is quietly and deservedly proud of a respectable career in politics, overseeing important local and provincial projects, including the creation of the Columbia Basin Trust and the BC Sharing charitable food program, which helps lower income families enjoy BC agricultural products, not to mention important community projects in the Slocan Valley. \"Y ou know, I have a wonderful life, \" says Corky. \"I got to log for 20 years, and then I was in politics for 20 years. But, all my life what I really wanted to do was grow food. \" Corky (below left) is quite at home at his Against the Wind Farm in Winlaw, BC, where he's often seen with a trail of turkeys waddling behind him (below right).

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is perhaps the best known: other types of lymphoma include leukemia, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma. While patient outcomes in the past were uncertain, research focused on new drugs and drug combinations is cause for great optimism. The BC Cancer Agency Centre for Lymphoid Cancer is a world leader in this type of research focused on lymphoid cancers. \"What we are seeing now is the result of 30 years of effort at develop-ing a large research program focused on building a significant database of lymphoma samples and patient information, \" says Dr. Joseph Connors, clinical director, BC Cancer Agency Centre for Lymphoid Cancer. These data inform further, targeted research and development of the best treatments possible for each type of lymphoma. \"The major way we have improved survivorship has been by curing patients with less-toxic treatment, which has been a major focus of our research, \" says Connors. \"In addition, better molecular dissection of malig- nant cells is helping us discover new, more effective treatments. \" Non-Hodgkin lymphoma The most common form of non- Hodgkin lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell ABC ). The biology of these two cancers differs substantially. Connors observes that this may explain why GCB -type lymphoma has been quite responsive to standard chemotherapy, while ABC lymphoma has been far more difficult to cure. \"But the exciting thing is that new drugs have come along, \" says Connors. \" And these drugs are selectively more effective against the ABC t y p e .\" The drug ibrutinib is one of the most promising says Connors, and international trials are being conducted to test the effects of using ibru- tinib alongside the standard chemotherapy treatment. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of leukemia in adults. \" About 15 per cent of people with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia have a genetic mutation affecting chromosome 17, which has meant no treatment was effective, \" says Connors. \"But we have found that ibrutinib is also particularly effective in that subset, so it is giving us a way to treat these patients. \" Multiple myeloma \"With multiple myeloma, once again the real excitement is around newer drugs that are more effective than the ones we had previously, \" says Connors. \"The most exciting right now is a third-generation proteasome inhibitor called carfilzomib.\" All cells have proteasomes, whose job is to digest no-longer-wanted pro- teins - sort of a garbage disposal. We can use carfilzomib to stop the proteasome from working, making myeloma cells sick and eventually causing them to die. \" For many survivors of lymphoid cancers in British Columbia, research done right here at home means an im- proved quality of life thanks to improved treatments.

Every Wednesday morning, the two spend a couple of hours at the BC Cancer Agency's Vancouver Island Centre, and then the afternoon at the Gorge Road Hospital in Victoria, bring- ing smiles and calm to patients and staff as \"therapy pets. \" \"We'll walk into a waiting room and see the faces light up with big smiles, \" says Bruce Irving, Kinnegoe and Duffy's owner. \"The patients and families comment on how beautiful the dogs are, and they start putting their hands on them and petting them. They really have a sooth-ing effect on the people who are waiting and anxious about their health. \" Bruce and his wife Bonnie, along with \"the boys, \" have volunteered at the Vancouver Island Centre since 2011. Bonnie is a 15-year breast cancer survi-vor, and the couple knew they wanted to give back when the BC Cancer Agency set up the pet therapy program. Happily, the couple had already been involved in pet therapy. \"We got into pet therapy when Bonnie's mom went into care about seven years ago, \" says Bruce. \"We would visit the dementia ward of the Gorge Hospital, and it was very rewarding. So, when the opportunity arose to do the same thing at the cancer clinic, we jumped at it. \" Like other therapy pets, Kinnegoe and Duffy were screened by a veter - inarian, who not only checked their general health, but also tested their manners. By watching how prospective therapy pets react to sudden noises, being grabbed or having their tails pulled, the veterinarian decides if they would be good at the job. If the tails keep wagging, they pass and earn their therapy-pet kerchief. Bruce says Kinnegoe and Duffy have a sense of where they are needed. \"We walked up to a family group in the cancer clinic gathered around a young man who was obviously the patient, and they were crying, \" says Bruce. \"The dogs immediately went through the family group, straight to the young man. He started petting them and pretty soon the whole family was laughing. It just changed the whole atmosphere. \" Patients aren't the only ones who appreciate seeing Kinnegoe and Duffy at the door. \"The cancer clinic staff look forward to the visits, too, \" says Bruce. \"They are in very stressful occupations and are always dealing with people who are very ill. Get-ting to pet the dogs eases their stress. \" Bruce and Bonnie Irving, along with \"the boys,\" have volunteered at the Vancouver Island Centre since 2011. InFocus Ask An Expert spring 201 5 FORWARD | 15PHOTO BY CHUCK RUSSELLMyrna Tracy, regional professional practice leader with Patient & Family Counselling at the BC Cancer Agency Sindi Ahluwalia Hawkins Centre for the Southern Interior, answers some of the most-asked questions about changes to body image after cancer treatment. Coping with Changes to Body Image Q: When do people ask about body image issues? A: It depends. Some people have body image concerns before starting treatment. Others first bring it up with a counsellor while they are undergoing treatment. It can also emerge in survivorship. For example, someone might develop a lymphedema that becomes troubling, and thus the body image issue arises. Q: How can a survivor address body issues? A: Many people worry about other people's reactions to them. This can include concern about how people on the street will react to, for example, the effects of facial surgery, but body changes that are not visible, like a mastectomy, can cause deep concern as well. The best place to start is acknowledging the grief and feeling of loss about the change in your body. Sometimes a ritual helps. Y ou can release a balloon to thank and say goodbye to the previous body image. Then, have a cake to welcome the new image. It's about acknowledging the emotion. What a person thinks about their changed image is also crucial. They should consider what sort of messages they are telling themselves - pay attention to self-talk and focus on what you love about your body. The support of partners is, of course, extremely useful. Q: How should people prepare for questions from other people? A: Think about it ahead of time. Have a practised response that is comfortable for you. This is private information, so you don't need to say more than you want. When asked about hair loss, some might say, 'Y eah, isn't it great? My cancer is getting better. ' Others might sidestep the issue with 'I am just glad my eyes are still blue!' It depends on how comfortable you feel. Q: Why is it important to face body image issues with the help of others? What happens if you try to keep it all in? A: It is never a good idea to hold it in as the pain is not going anywhere and you can become unable to move on. My advice would be to go to counselling, and take your partner, a friend or family member. Don't suffer in silence. Q: What resources are available for survivors with body image issues? A: BC Cancer Agency Patient and Family Counselling departments will see survivors up to 18 months after treatment. If more intervention is needed, we make an effort to connect the person to a long-term resource. Mindfulness-based stress reduction classes are available in many cities and through the BC Cancer Agency in some areas. If body image issues are seriously affecting your intimate life, you may want to consider counselling from a certified sex therapist. 16 | FORWARD winter 201 5 inishing cancer treatment is a huge milestone, and now that it's done you might think the roller coaster of emotions you've been experiencing will finally start slowing down. However, for many people it is just rounding another curve on the ride. \" Any time someone has a major life change, many emotions can show up, \" says Sandy Faulks, regional professional practice leader with Patient and Family Counselling at the Fraser Valley Centre. \"People often experience grief over the losses they have experienced as a result of cancer, and anxiety and depression are commonly a part of it. \" Faulks explains that when someone finishes cancer treatment, their routine of seeing the health-care team, sometimes on a daily basis, ends, and they don't anticipate that it can be a difficult adjustment to transition back into their former lives and establish a \"new normal. \" \"During treatment it's like you're in a cocoon, being attended to by the health-care team, \" says Faulks. \"When treatment ends you may start asking, 'What now?' Some people need to talk about what they have been through as it is life-changing and the things they did before no longer fit or work for them. They see the world in a different way and they recognize that they have experienced many losses. \" \"I've had to realize that I don't get to be 'old Diane' anymore, \" says 58-year-old Diane Hamson, who marked the one-year anniversary of the end of treatment for stage three throat cancer in June. \"I can't do some things I could before cancer, but there are many things I can. I'm just grateful to be here and be who I am today. \" Hamson appreciates the time she has spent at the Patient and Family Counselling Centre in Surrey; it has been invaluable for her, in addition to support from her husband and three adult children. \"Sandy has been so wonderful. I realized that my family was really affected by what was happening with me and that my attitude set the tone for them, \" says Hamson. \"It helps to have someone to talk to. Sandy reassures and gives me confidence in how I am coping. \"I think it could be easy for a family to break apart due to the stress of dealing with cancer if they didn't have someone to serve as a sounding board. Counselling really should be part of the treatment process for everyone. \" Coping with a major life change can induce a downward spiral of depression and trigger anxiety, so finding healthy ways to prevent or stop that is important. \"I'm a huge proponent of practising mindfulness and deep breathing, \" says Faulks. \"When you are experiencing stress, a physical response takes place in your body that causes you to take shallower, quicker breaths, so the oxygen and blood don't flow through your body as effectively. \" Deep breathing is an effective technique widely used to calm that physical stress response, and mindfulness is a way to consciously create a sense of focus in the present moment. \"Practising mindfulness takes a regular, conscious effort, but it gives us the power to focus on the present where we do have control, \" says Faulks. Faulks says a good way to practise mindfulness is to go for a 20-minute walk alone each day, and notice and describe to yourself what you are seeing and experiencing, utilizing all of your senses. \"It really is important to recognize that you are still on a journey of healing after treatment ends, and that you may benefit from talking to a counsellor about your experience to make sense of it, so you can carry on more easily, \" says Faulks. Hamson wisely acknowledges, \"Is life perfect once you finish treatment? No. But I'm scared to become a hypochondriac and let worry rule my life, so I'm learning that I only need to be upset about things if I decide to be upset by them. \" F ILLUSTRATION GETTY IMAGESPractise Deep Breathing P ut one hand flat on your stomach and the other on your chest Imagine your stomach is a balloon T ake a slow, deep breath through your nose and feel the air go down through your chest as it inflates the balloon Ho ld your breath for a few counts, and then slowly release the breath as you feel the balloon deflate Do thi s for several breaths until you feel yourself begin to calm down and relax.

Learn how to overcome insomnia to get the regular sleep you need. Featurespring 201 5 FORWARD | 19Chances are you have experienced it: a night when sleep just doesn't come, no matter how many sheep you count; or you awaken at 3 am and simply cannot go back to sleep because of the thoughts swirling around in your head. Occasional sleeplessness is an irritant. Unfortunately, insomnia often becomes a way of life for cancer patients and survivors. Those who have had cancer are twice as likely as others to suffer from sleep-wake disturbances, with 30 to 75 per cent of cancer patients and survivors experiencing them - particularly insomnia. That's a concern, because persistent insom - nia is distressing for cancer patients and survivors and can adversely affect their well-being in many ways, says Nancy \"Surya\" Absolon, a radiation therapy RN at the BC Cancer Agency's Vancouver Centre. \"Over time, sleep-wake disturbances can lead to disrupted cognitive function, decreased quality of life and functional status (such as daytime sleepiness), \" says Absolon. \"Moreover, insomnia rarely occurs by itself. It frequently occurs as part of a symptom cluster with pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression. \" Absolon adds that despite their prevalence and seriousness, sleep-wake disturbances are under-reported. \"Patients don't mention it because they often frame it as a temporary thing, or some - thing that can't be treated. And after cancer treatment, survivors may feel it is part of their normal life, and there is nothing that can be done. As health-care professionals, we need to ask patients, 'How is your sleep?' and then follow up with them. \" Elizabeth Rich began having trouble sleeping after her diagnosis of melanoma. She brought it up with the BC Cancer Agency nurses at the recommendation of her family doctor: \"[BC Cancer Agency nurses] have a different approach. They don't take your concerns lightly; about sleeplessness or the demons you face at night. \"Surya was a big help as a nurse who addressed my sleep, \" says Rich. \"Some of what she told me reminded me of what we practise in yoga, especially the breathing exercises. So when I had those thoughts at night, I just did the breathing exercises and found it helped me relax. In half an hour, I was able to go to sleep. It worked better than any medication. \" Absolon recently led a study at the BC Cancer Agency evaluating a brief innovative sleep intervention that combined cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. The pilot found the inter - vention helped improve sleep quality and was easy to teach and use. Absolon and a team are now starting a larger study to further evaluate the intervention. PHOTO GETTY IMAGES Wake up at the same time each day: Patterns and schedules affect your sleep. Have a regular routine, and go to bed and wake up at regular times. Find a relaxation technique that can help promote sleep: Meditation, guided imagery, mindfulness, massage, yoga, aromatherapy and breathing techniques are a few examples. Use what works for you and be consistent. \"Clear your head\" before bedtime: Sometimes our worries trouble us as we are trying to fall asleep. Set a time in the early evening to plan, solve problems and make decisions. This will help keep your concerns at bay at bedtime. Have a pre-bedtime \"buffer\" routine: Set up a 90-minute time before bed to unwind and relax to prepare your body and mind for sleep. Dim the lighting and engage in pleasant, slower activities, such as reading, music or a warm bath. Avoid the following close to bedtime: Intake of stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine or alcohol within six hours of bedtime), sugary or spicy foods, or a heavy evening meal. Go to bed only when sleepy: If you are still wakeful, trying to force yourself to go to sleep is counterproductive. Use your bedroom for sleep and intimacy: It is important to keep the bed as a strong signal for sleep. Avoid unnecessary time in bed during the day, and don't read or watch TV in bed. If you are not asleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed and return when sleepy: If you find you can't sleep, go back to your buffer activity. Once you feel sleepy, go back to bed and repeat the process as necessary. Restrict napping: Daytime naps may interfere with nighttime sleep. If you must nap, a short (20- to 30-minute) nap in the early afternoon is refreshing and may be helpful and less likely to interfere with sleep at night. Consult with your family doctor, nurse or health-care professional to help manage insomnia.

The Power of POG Groundbreaking cancer research is providing hope - here and now 20 | FORWARD spring 201 5Foundation Over countless hours of training for the Ride to Conquer Cancer, and throughout the course of the two-day cycling journey, Zuri Scrivens never imagined that she would soon find herself part of a clinical cancer research study supported by the BC Cancer Foundation event in which she had just participated. Zuri's commitment to take part in the 2011 Ride was an outlet to \"do something\" in the wake of too many close family and friends being diagnosed with cancer. It was only a cruel twist of fate that mere weeks after she jubilantly crossed the finish line in Seattle, cancer became Zuri's own personal nemesis. It was exactly one month to the day of completing her second Ride, and just months after the birth of her son Michael, when Zuri noticed a lump in her right breast. It was quickly determined she had breast cancer. \"Honestly, my world just crumbled, \" says Zuri. \"I thought my life was over and I really wondered if I' d even be here two months from that point. \"Within a week, I underwent a unilateral mastectomy and my life changed permanently and completely. \" Grappling with the immediate impacts of the disease, she was challenged by no longer being able to breastfeed her son, the physical and emotional toll of treatments, and the fear of mortality. During this time, Zuri also watched as cancer's reach continued to spread within her family as two uncles received their own diagnoses while she was undergoing chemotherapy. \"I wish I could say that was it, \" says Zuri of her too-long list of loved ones impacted by the disease. Unfortunately, in December 2012, she was hit with another shock. Her cancer had managed to stick around after chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and it had spread. \"It was in my lymph system and my liver. \" A pivotal moment in time Unbeknownst to Zuri, her involvement in fundraising for the BC Cancer Foundation through the Ride to Conquer Cancer, and her own cancer diagnosis, coincided at a pivotal point in time, when sci- ence and treatment planning were about to intersect like never before. In the research labs and clinics of the BC Cancer Agency, scientists and clinicians had begun to collaborate on a new program, exploring the practicality of introducing genomic sequencing into cancer care for rare and hard-to-treat varieties of the disease. And, in less than two years, this idea blossomed into the Personalized Onco- Genomics Program ( POG ) at the BC Cancer Agency, which has already proven that genomic sequencing can be a critical tool in real-time cancer care. Zuri can now personally attest to the value of POG . Enrolled in the program after her cancer had spread, today Zuri is on two med - ications that were identified as potentially useful with insight from the genomic sequencing data. Most importantly, Zuri is cancer-free. By mapping the DNA of cancer cells and those of a patient's normal cells, BC Cancer Agency scientists can then read out the long sequence of letters from each sample and compare the cancer data to the normal cells to find the \"spelling mistakes. \" It's those mistakes that point to the root cause of an individual's cancer and potential pathways to treat the spelling mistakes through targeted drug therapies. What POG really boils down to is that more information in cancer care means better diagnosis, better drugs and better outcomes. The BC Cancer Agency is a frontrunner in the immediate translation of research data into treatment plans, allowing oncologists to make truly informed clinical decisions for their patients. With an ongoing funding commitment from the BC Cancer Foundation, POG is expanding, which will see more than 300 patients enrolled in the program. While most cancer institutions around the globe focus on genomic sequencing or clinical care, the BC Cancer Agency is one of the only places currently doing both. The link between genomic data and results from ongoing patient care and outcomes is unparalleled. \"I believe in it fully, \" says Zuri of the POG program. \"It's so important and I honestly don't know if I' d be here without it. \" The committed Rider, cancer survivor and POG participant says she is living, breathing proof of where BC Cancer Foundation donor dollars go.
