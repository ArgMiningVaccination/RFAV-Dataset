[[31]](#cite_note-31) He formulated the meditation system in a very well organized and scientific way. The basic four wings of the meditation system can be summarized as - Meditation, Yogasana and Pranaayam, [Mantra](/wiki/Mantra), and therapy.

[[33]](#cite_note-Mahapragya:Preksha_Practice-33) The First formal Preksha meditation camp was organized later in 1977.

Few schools were selected to start implementation of Science of Living. After one year of its implementation in schools, the results were surprising and very positive for students. It started getting wider acceptance with education ministry of Indian Government and state governments. Many schools started including it in their curriculum.

Some of the feedback can be summarized as reduce in stress, improved efficiency in studies, better concentration and memory, better anger management, etc. [[37]](#cite_note-Jeevan_Vigyan_teachers_training-37) Successor to [Acharya Tulsi](/wiki/Acharya_Tulsi)[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Mah%C4%81praj%C3%B1a&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Impressed by Muni Nathmal Mahapragya), him with the qualitative epithet of Mahapragya (highly knowledged) on 12 November 1978.

With this elevation, he was now referred as Yuvacharya Mahapragya. As a Yuvacharya , Mahapragya became a close associate of [Acharya Tulsi](/wiki/Acharya_Tulsi) in major decisions and activities related to the sect. In a public meeting on 18 February 1994, [Acharya Tulsi](/wiki/Acharya_Tulsi) declared that Mahapragya would now have the title of 'Acharya' also and that the former was renouncing this position forthwith. Subsequently, on 5 February 1995, Mahapragya was formally consecrated as the 10th Acharya - the supreme head - of the Terapanth religious order in a public meeting in [Delhi](/wiki/Delhi). [[43]](#cite_note-43) Having been elevated within Terapanth, Mahapragya received many responsibilities.

[[50]](#cite_note-50) With Ahimsa Yatra, Acharyaji's mission is to train and spread nonviolence and its broad perspective to people. It is an endeavor to awaken a new faith in the infinite power of nonviolence. It aims at bringing the problems of all forms of violence into sharp focus.

Approximately 40,000 volunteers were assigned to various responsibilities in their local areas.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] This Yatra allowed him to come into direct contact with farmers and common and poor people of the villages which he visited. He stopped at all the small villages on his route and held open mass meetings. Through this public speaking, Acharyaji created awareness on the broad perspectives of nonviolence, unemployment eradication, leading a life free from [drug addiction](/wiki/Drug_addiction), bad habits, communal harmony, healthy living, and harmonious social and personal lives. [[55]](#cite_note-55) Side by side volunteers spread out in different directions in order to establish personal contact with families afflicted by drug addictions, unemployment, and stress. These volunteers were then to stay behind in order to help solve the afflicted's problems. Verily the villages and towns trekked by the Acharya become centres of training in [ahimsa](/wiki/Ahimsa).

He often resorted to the passive voice. As one of his translator's once said \"Between one full stop and the next sentence, a kingdom can be built\". [[74]](#cite_note-JVB-74) \"The religion which does not bring about a change in a man's life, which does not impart peace to him, deserves to be thrown into the river Ganges rather than carried on as burden on one's shoulders. Rituals or idol worship alone are not enough unless one's conduct also gets transformed. Religion is not confined only to temples, mosques, or churches, but extends to the man's day-to-day living as well.\" [[75]] \"I believe in that religion which has moral values at its foundation and spirituality at its peak. I don't believe in that religion that doesn't have moral values and spirituality. I accepted that religion which made me physically, mentally, emotionally healthy. Religion is beyond rituals.

His mantra, his philosophy was also clearly visible in his life: PM\" \"As much as Acharya Mahapragya Ji has written about spirituality, with an equally broad vision he wrote on subjects like philosophy, politics, psychology and economic: PM Modi\".
