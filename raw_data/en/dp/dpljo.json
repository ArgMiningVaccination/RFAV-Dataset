Earlyon,Millerrecognized the University had a tremendousopportunity to define itself as an environmental leader. One initial step was taken with the planning for the Burton Family Football Complex and Mark R. Shenkman Training Center, which became the first athletic facilities in the nation to earn a Silver rating under the U. S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Envi- ronmental Design (LEED) standards. It was the first such structure certified at UConn and it followed the creation of a Green Campus Fund by the UConn Foundation, which allows alumni and others to direct their donations toward sustainability efforts at the Univer- sity. The fund was another first among U.S. public universities. Miller notes that while many of the sustainability changes at UConn are the result of new policies, many more developed from the engagement of an increasingly activist student body. Indeed, students have embraced the \"green revolution\" more enthusiasti- cally than any social movement in years, says Dan Britton, sustain- ability coordinator in the University's Office of Environmental Policy, which has a 25-member senior advisory council that recommends ideas to President Michael J. Hogan and works to engage the University community in environmental stewardship. \"Student awareness of environmental issues is much greater today than it was just a few years ago,\" Britton says. \"We see more and more students who want to get involved with these issues and who are pressing for stronger environmental policy.\" At UConn, sustainability is not only a philosophical idea that has found a rapt audience, but also a vision of environmental health that is reshaping the University in myriad ways. On March 25,President Hogan signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (PCC), which pledges UConn's support, along with other public research universities nationwide, to develop specific action plans, including both academic and operational goals and metrics, to create more environmentally sustainable campuses. It also commits the University toward becoming a carbon-neutral campus by reducing the use of fossil fuels through a comprehensive plan that will call for more renewable energy sources, alternative fuels and energy efficiency measures, among many other systemic and behavioral changes over the next 4c) years. And, last April, it was not surprising that the environment was a prominent part of the revised academic plan setting the direction and priorities for UConn's future. \"A major goal of the new plan is to promote environmental education for environmentally responsible citizens,\" says Veronica Makowsky, vice provost for undergraduate education and regional campus administration. Many professors are already approaching the issue from different vantage points. Over the past year there were more than io courses covering environmental and sustainability issues and no fewer than 34 degree options in many different academic disciplines.

Bothofourcities have tremendous transportation Mayors -John's been involved for many years-is that you have no clue what sornebody's party is. Mayors are all in this at the samelevel.Igetsofrustrated sometimes that 32UCONN MAGAZ INEIcan'tchangealotaboutBridge\u00ad port,but then Ithink back at being a state senator. Icanchange the state of Connectic uta lotless than ischangecomingfrom? the new greenrevolution-thenext greatindustrial revolution in theUnitedStates is going to b ea greenrevolution.

The theory of concentric rings issomething John and Ibothstudiedin our UConn classes .DeSTEFANO: Our core responsibility is to make these places safe. Idon 'tthinkanyone is going to livein a place or locate a business to where they do not perceive it is safe .The second thing is to have public schools that work for people. Our major invest \u00ad mentwhen I tookofficewas in our schools. Wedidn 'tbuild a baseballstadiumand a hockeyarena. We'vere-built or built 30 new schools ,and we'llhave42done by 2014.We'respending $I.5 billion dollars doing this. I thinkthat'spartofthereasonwhy we'veseen the school drop-out rate cut Frankly ,it's ofwhat can be doing to help UConn to promotetheeconomic well-beingofthe state , including our cities. The fund the Univer\u00ad sitysothat they 'reableto dowhat Yaleis moving to do, which is to make atuition-free environment and to provide greateraccess for kids coming out ofourcommunities who may face barriersoftu-ition. We 'renot going to compete inConnecticut withthemuscle in ourarms.Therewillalwaysbe cheaperlabor,butourcompeti\u00ad tiveadvantage is going to have the bes t-trainedworkforce and the besteducated workforce .And to the extent stateuniversity andcommu\u00ad nity college system-those pay dividends for years .Everytaxpayer inConnecticut contributed to Bill'seducation and to my education . Ilike tothinkweaddvalue back to the communities in which we're respectivelya partof. It seemsto me, that 'sabout the smartest investment that the State ofConnecticut and allofus as residents can make. FINCH:If I really dreamabout what I'd like to see for my city, Iwould loveto have a branchofUConn in Bridgeport.People wantedto put a casino in Bridgeport, but Iwant to look for an economic enginethat would giveus the cred ibility,the respect and theeconomic tha twillhelp h im,help me and help ourcolleagues becomebettermayors. The large iss ue here is we go throughlifelooking at a zero sumgame, which meansto saythat in orderfor me to put brea don my table,I've got to take it offyours. Whenyou're a mayor,you learn pretty quickly the distinctions ofclass and race and po litical partyare reallymeaningless .What'simportant are the values we share as residents ofourcommunity andofthe state,and to act on those values in one anotherandbecomea wholethat'smore thansumofthe part. FINCH: Ihad aphenomenal experience state Senate .It's certainly one ofthe mostenjoyable political experiences you could everhave . Butthere'sadisconnect the levels ofgovernment. Itshouldn'tbe b lamingthe localities and the localities blamingthe state.We'vegot to make government more seam less.Ithinkoneofthethingsthat I have to try to do is to continue to work with the GeneralAssemb lyto getthemtounderstand how difficult it is beinga FirstSelectman or a mayor in Connecticut. The buck alwayssto psat the local government level.They didn'tcallme when there was a fire when I was a state senator. Nowthey callme .They want action .They wantsomething fixed.It's a great feeling, but it's also one that Ithinkotherlevelsofgovernment need toberemindedofand, like John said ,not look at it as a zero sumgame.

SUMMER 200851TheLASTWORD Americans' continuing desireforchangeisbadnewsfortheGOP ByStuartRothenberg '78Ph.D. calls for changebyhanding 30Republican Houseseats and six Senate seats to the Democrats, giving that party majorities in bothhouses for the first time since the 1994elections. Undernormalcircumstances ,thatmightbeenoughtochange the public 'smood.Butthesearen'tnormaltimes. Given the public's continuing dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq and a weakening economy, accompanied bygrowing unem\u00ad ployment, highergas prices and acreditcrunch,itshouldn't be surprising thatnationalpolls continue to show that Americans areunhappy andpessimistic about the future. Fewerthanthreein10 Americans approveofPresident George W .Bush'sjob perfor\u00ad mance,andCongress's job even lower.Many polls show only15to20percentofAmericans believethat the countryisheaded in the right direction. Allofthisturnsout to be bad news for Republicans who, fairly or unfairly, get most ofthe blame . Republicans hope that Demo\u00ad crats,who now control Congress, willbe held at least partially re \u00ad sponsible for themess,but history suggests that thePresident's party invariably suffers the most. And polls show that voters both have abetteropinionofthe Democratic Party thanofthe GOP and that they prefer the election ofa Democrat asPresident next year. Since Democrats are once again better positioned to take advantage ofthe public's desire for change,their retirements ,a significant Democratic financial advantage ,and anapparent Democratic advantage in enthusiasm (measured both byturnoutinPresiden\u00ad tialprimaries and in national polls) meansDemocrats are widely expected to gain at least a handfulofSenate seats and a dozen House seats or more in November 'sballoting. The Democratic Party 's multiple advantages, however , don'tguarantee that Sen.Barack Obama is a sure winnerover Sen.John McCain .McCain's maverick image and obvi - ousstrengthin talking about national security and the war on terror inocu latehimat least somewhat from his party 'scur\u00ad rentproblems. And Obama 's relativeinexperience and the electora lmap is sure toconclude that Obama has an easier route to the White House than McCain . The economy has emerged as the nation 'stop issue,and that is not to McCain 'sadvan\u00ad tage.He simply is not as articu\u00ad late andpassionate talking about interestrates,unemployment and taxpolicyas he is aboutterrorism . Moreover ,while fewstates in the electoral map are likel yto changecolor in November ,Obama has a better chance of turning ahandfulofGOP states from red to blue than McCaindoes of attracting AlCore/john Kerrystates into the Republican column. For Democrats ,the2008election is an opportunity tocomplete the takeover of Washington that they started in 2006.Butthey andtheirsupporters shouldbecautious.In both 1988and2004, Democrats somehow found waysto pull defeat from the jawsof victoryand, even ifthey win the White House and both houses ofCongress later thi syear,it's far from clear that "}
