The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report this week in its [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6720a4.htm), highlighting the number of adverse event reports submitted in recent months involving Shingrix administration errors. Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine; RZV) is a new GlaxoSmithKline shingles vaccine that was just placed on the market in October 2017. It is only approved for adults age 50 and older, and is one two shingle vaccines that are currently approved in the United States. The other is Merck's Zostavax (zoster vaccine live; ZVL). Learn More About Side effects of the shingles vaccine Zostavax may result in the development of a painful and persistent strain of shingles [Learn More About this Lawsuit](https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/zostavax/) [SEE IF YOU QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION](#) The report indicates that 155 reports were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System during the first four months Shingrix was available, including at least 13 problems with Shingrix administration. According to the findings, nine of those errors were because the drug was administered in a single subcutaneous dose, instead of as a 2-dose intramuscular injection, which is how the vaccine should be given. The single subcutaneous dose is how Zostavax is administered, suggesting confusion among doctors. All but one of those patients suffered injection site reactions, including pain, erythema, and pruritus. In two cases, patients were given the vaccine information statement for Zostavax instead of for Shingrix, and not instructed to return for their second dose, which also suggests whoever administered the vaccine thought they were giving the patients Zostavax, or thought that Shingrix worked the same way. In the other four cases, the patients given the vaccine were younger than the minimum age of 50, for which the vaccine is approved. The CDC researchers suggest that early monitoring indicates that the vaccine providers are confused over administration procedures, and storage requirements of Shingrix. Nine of the 13 vaccine administration errors occurred in a pharmacy, while two happened in a health care provider's office, and two occurred at unknown sites. \"To prevent RZV administration errors, vaccine providers should be aware of prescribing information, storage requirements, preparation guidelines, and (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations for herpes zoster vaccines,\" the CDC report recommends. Shingles Vaccine Problems The report comes amid concerns over the potential side effects of Zostavax, another shingles vaccine that was introduced in May 2006. Merck now faces a growing number of [Zostavax lawsuits](https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/zostavax-lawsuits-131284/), which claim that the drug not only fails to protect against shingles as advertised, but actually causes a more persistent strain of the infection. According to allegations raised in dozens of product liability lawsuits filed over the shingles vaccine, Merck used an under attenuated live strain of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) in Zostavax, which was not weakened enough to prevent reactivation of the virus. Instead of the body developing the proper immune response, the live virus combined with the old virus in some users, resulting in a more virulent strain of shingles. Zostavax sales have fallen sharply in recent years, while Shingrix sales have far surpassed original projections, with full year sales now projected to exceed $600 million for the new drug. Shingles is caused by the same virus, varicella zoster, which causes chickenpox. Later in life, the virus can be reactivated and cause shingles, which is a painful rash that usually appears as a stripe of blisters on the body. Pain can continue even after the rash is gone, which is known as postherpetic neuralgia. Shingles itself can cause scarring, bacterial infections, encephalitis, hearing loss, vision problems and other complications. - GlendaAugust 27, 2023 at 3:07 pm I got the shringix shot November 6,2022 and developed the frozen shoulder I had to take therapy but had to quite because it was making it worse probably will have to have surgery because I have some tears in my shoulder - ConstanceJuly 12, 2023 at 6:27 pm I received a Shingrix vaccination (my second - minimal reaction to the first) in early January.

Several days later I developed a red rash with itchy bumps on my head, welts on my trunk, and blisters on my legs and several on my arms. I had tachycardia and post-menopausal bleeding, which added to the mystery. I also had gastritis. I was prescribed Benadryl at night and Claritin during the day by a dermatologist, and the rash disappeared. However, the tachycardia persisted for more than two weeks, and the digestive issues as well. It seems my entire body was affected. Apparently I had a very strong histamine reaction to the Shingrix. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have never had a strong reaction to vaccinations in the past. I have been diagnosed with a Histamine Intolerance Disorder and have been on a low histamine diet for three months. My digestive difficulties have improved. Could the rash, etc. be attributed to the Shingrix? - KellyMay 6, 2023 at 2:45 pm 54-year-old male first Shingrix shot felt lousy for a few days.

I was in such severe pain I wouldn't eat and lost 30 pounds in two weeks. At the end of this horrible first week I went to see my GP. He said I had developed a severe PMR. My seg rate was 110, but my c reactive protein was under 5. So he wasn't worried about GCA He immediately place me on 40 mgm of prednisone and told me to never take the second Shingrix vaccine. My question : was my GP told by a pharma rep they knew the shingrix vaccine was causing first time PMR flare in some patient. It's been over three years of decrease prednisone therapy and I'm still having deteriorating severe muscle, joint , back,leg, hand, and pelvic nerve pain. I'm pissed this pharmaceutical corporation has hiding these side effects from the FDA and public. I am in my 60's and as in good health. I will never be the same. I have developed a life long disease complication with no cure, just palliative medical care that's not working into my future. I want to know how many people have developed or reported PMR or Epstein Barr syndromes after their initial shringrex vaccination. - GaryJuly 9, 2022 at 10:04 pm got three shingles vax, two different kinds total, due to cvs bad record keeping and them being understaffed and in a hurry. now have guillain-barre. hans are nearly useless. i'd sue if I could but big pharma are protected by our corrupt politicians. beware of cvs and their careless business practices. i have proof of getting three shots. - DavidJune 16, 2022 at 3:48 pm Got the second shingrix vaccine March 2022.

He is on calquence for leukemia but pcp paperwork showed he needed shingrix vax to prevent shingles (he had the zoster vax, many years prior). Wife: If you are reading these comments and you've had #1 vax and are considering #2, please do not ignore these comments. Response to #1 was: \"How can this be on the market considering side-effects?\" Called pcp and noted all-systems-reaction with the most painful being the \"dots/ankles\" which turned more into wheals (stayed exactly same-sites as time passed): pain caused from the \"itch-feeling\" tho n-e-v-e-r- scratched once; ice-cubes were the best pain-solution, lotion w/aloe aided some.

That was the 1st vax. Why did I go for the 2nd vax? I knew the nurses & online sites said it would, likely, be worse than the 1st. \"Yes\" I did go for #2 vax: told administrator-pharmacy site of \"gut-punch\" and rash and she didn't have any warnings and did not say \"not to get #2; neither did the pcp-nurse say not to get #2.\" #2 Vax was not so much \"gut-punch\" but felt it underneath back of ribs on same side & told administ'r, \"feel it underneath vax-site (lymph-syst) ; the spots/rash from #1 had cleared up, but recently returned: thus became \"same as the first-round with intense itch-feeling & pain (not scratching once); unbalanced in body-movements noted as w/vax #1. Overall: vision changes noted w/ both #1 & #2: believe this is (continues) with a \"like-reaction\" to shingles, as at age 15 I remember the Dr. warning to \"guard-eyes\" as then had an intense shingles itch & swelling. Should I have taken #2 vax? Well, if I don't (ever) get shingles it may (may) be well worth it. The only other vax in recent years was the 3-vax-covid-series...to which I had an intense reaction to the #1 covid-vax; also had a pneumonia vax in past; otherwise, have avoided vaxes. Where does that leave us? Husb.: day #4 now...sleeping; taking broth only, feels \"like shit.\" Wife: I was feeling better yest...until last nite the \"itch-feeling leading to nausea\" hit: answer: toast w/nutmeg, cinnamon & ginger and aspirin. Noted that most of \"feeling off-balance\" is waning (didn't want to crash into anything which could, otherwise, be quickly skirted-around); was able to eat what I wished. I am hoping the lower-leg rash will abate-itching, but from the comments on this website, I don't know if I can hope all signs of this vax will be gone come summer grass mowing---I may consider some type of light-therapy. I still find myself reflecting on the ques: \"Why would this be on the market with the known reactions.\" Again, if you are reading this, it appears as many persons with whom I have spoken who have had \"no-reaction\" to shingrix-vax...so there are as many who have had a very undesired, if not changing life for a long-period of time or permanent life-altering reaction..............So......If you are considering that #2 shingrix vax, consider just how strong the #1 vax was for you, how long the reacion(s) lasted and whether you are willing to face #2 with what is commonly cited by both online-comments and clinic-nurses as \"worse than vax #1 reactions.\" - MichaelJanuary 11, 2022 at 12:14 am I stand by my statement above and have my medical records to prove.

I had a tiny patch of poison ivy (which I am very allergic to) when I got the shot. Within 24 hours, Ii was covered with it from head to toe. it sort of morphed into an ongoing autoimmune skin disease. My docs and I guess the vaccine jut put my immune system into overdrive to react to the poison ivy and it has never gone away. It felt like maggots crawling under my skin 24 hours a day. for months I was living on benedryl (which upsets your stomach at a high dose) and coffee for several months. I lost over 10% of my body weight due to that and the sheer misery of the rash. This was everywhere--on thle soles of my feet, on my eyelids. I coud not wear any clothes because anything that rubbed caused the rash and itching to start. I finally took a 3 week dose of steroids and it got a lot better. But I still have horrible itching all day long. This has set off a chain of related horrendous medical problems, including significant bone loss. I will never be the same and never stop scratching or coating my body with lotions. I now have to go on bone meds. I never had skin problems before--not once. Worse yet--the doctors are hawking this like ice cream. I told my doc time and time again that I never had chicken pox, but she insisted it would be no harm to get the vaccine. Well not really. My sister and father are doctors and they confirm I never had chicken pox. no one in our family did. I was never afraid of vaccines so I thought it would do no harm in case somehow I had a symptomless case as an adult--which is virtually impossible. Promotional material for this vaccine tell doctors to assume that anyone within a certain ag group had chickenpox. If they deny it, the literature says to assume they just forgot. Right--you forget you have chicken pox. I am now very anti-vaccine. this has ruined my life. I can barely move without getting the rash and crawling maggot sensation when any article of clothing rubs on my skin. - CarolMarch 16, 2021 at 5:31 pm I received my first Shingrix vaccine October 2020.

Said that was the cause of headaches. Went for M R I and he said I would've need surgery but could probably benefit from a epidural. Each morning my joints hurt so bad I can hardly get out of bed.

Off we went to the pharmacy to receive the first shots. That evening husband developed a large rash, 10 inches by 6 inches on the inoculated arm. Flu like symptoms, headache, joint aches followed. Lasted 3 days for him. Sicker than I had ever seen him in 30 years of marriage. A few days after I receive the shot, feeling very sick, I headed to my lab folks and had over $350 worth of labs taken. I developed Epstein Barr Virus, had NEVER had Mono, but here I was very sick. Had to start antibiotics immediately due to the kidney, bladder and spleen infections. Also developed mouth and vaginal sores that were very painful. I am now living with this virus and NO I will never take the second shot. I can only hope and pray that I will be able to take the Moderna inoculation in just over 2 weeks! I will be researching EXACTLY what will be in the Moderna jab for sure! - JanMarch 13, 2021 at 12:24 pm I had my first Shingrix shot Sept 2020. Only a sore hardness at injection site.

I went for my second dose in early February 2020, this time prepared to track the pain and use of my arm with the vaccine. Two, going on three weeks later, I still have pain in my left arm, with limited mobility. Over-the-counter pain medications do nothing for it. I can still use it, but find the pain increases the more active I am. I spent the past two days shoveling snow and - it really hurts and my reach is limited. Both the pharmacist and my PCP have dismissed my comments about the pain and mobility. I was hoping they would share my feedback with Shingrix. I recognize this is mild to many of the people who have posted but I'm frustrated that no official cares to collect this data of adverse reactions and hope that the pain will recede soon. - RebeccaFebruary 12, 2021 at 7:12 pm Had the shingrex shot, the 1st shot gave mea bad headache for 3 days, the second shot made my arm muscle hard with redness and a rash, that night I had very bad shivering with fever, the next day, today I have a very bad headache again.

I do not smoke, drink, have never done drugs and do not take any medications for any underlying health conditions. I took the 1st shot on 8/17/20, and on 8/27/20 began having pain in my legs. The next day I began having several falls and by that afternoon was unable to walk. I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Gullien-Barre Syndrome. I am waiting to be transfers to an acute care rehabilitation facility and my recovery if successful may take several weeks, months, or even years. I was definitely affected by this vaccine in a terrible way, and I do not remember being told GSB was a possible side-effect. - MaxineAugust 27, 2020 at 3:23 am Got the new shingles vaccine first dose .I got it August 21/20.

Took Tylenol for a few days to deal with it but it's been day 5 and I still feel lethargic and on and off headaches which gives me a feeling of malaise. I used to exercise daily and walk for 45 mins every day or play tennis prior to the 2nd shot, but somehow I am feeling like too strained to do it since. I am not sure why and I hope this wears off soon. - ThereseAugust 15, 2020 at 1:52 am I got my first dose of Shingrix about a month ago at the Pharmacy.

I went to the ER because I was experiencing chest pains and a blister on my back started forming. I was told that I had contracted the shingles. The shingles covered the ban around my upper back/chest area, I was in excruciating pain due to this outbreak. I am still, to this day, experiencing post neuralgia pain and it affects my lifestyle tremendously. - EyobJuly 31, 2020 at 9:37 am I had Shingrix vaccine in October 2019 and the second one in March this year. Since I had this vaccine my vision decreased and I have some other issues with my eyes. I go for a check up every year and when I was at my eye doctor last year April every thing was fine with my eyes. I know that Zostavax created a lot of health issues, Shingrix maybe has also some side effects. - LaneJuly 27, 2020 at 1:55 pm First of all i am NOT an \"anti-vaxxer\" person that fabricates stories about reactions to vaccinations etc. I am a perfectly healthy 56 year old active male.

Two months later, she contracted a viral ear infection- lab tests showed this virus was related to the shingles virus (?)... Her inner ears were so inflamed she lost 100% of her hearing in less than a day and had to be hospitalized for months with a wackload of other symptoms seemingly coming up out of nowhere. Diabetes type II, diabetes inspidus, pituitary gland tumour, lung nodule, and finally vasculitis. Treatment for the vasculitis was chemo (free), or an expensive alternative with fewer side effects... no brainer for our family. Forked out the money but there's no guarantee that this treatment would cure the disease. However, it was considered superior to the chemo. If it doesn't cure the vasculitis she has to do another round of it. [Aside: met a lady at the hospital drug administration unit during the first treatment dose. This lady had the same vasculitis disease as my mom and she takes this expensive drug every few years as maintence...]. 12% of her hearing came back, and she'll be getting cataract removal surgery soon to remove the cataracts that grew insanely thick after all the high dose steroid treatments she's had to be on. More money being forked out due to coverage for only the most basic treatment. Again, no brainer because the woman has been through enough. - On to the gameJuly 14, 2020 at 2:27 am This is an unmoderated comment section filled with unsubstantitated injury claims. Anti-vaxxers seek out these forums to post messages claiming all sort of horrific injuries caused by a vaccine to scare people.

I had to just wet on the floor beside my bed. I started keeping towels by my bedside. And while trying to keep a somewhat normal routine, I would just mess myself. Could not control my bowels. I assumed it was from by back issues...swelling, etc not having room inside from the swelling and full bowels and bladder. I did not tell anyone because I was embarrassed. Now to the back pain. I have had sciatic issues before but not this extreme. This was around Thanksgiving and Christmas, I called my neurologist, I received 3 shots to help with the pain. Hardly touched the pain i was having. Finally I coul not get any more shots. The doctor ordered exrays and MRI'S. They saw a cloudy area near my spine. They really didn't know what it was...som w kind of infection. They would not prescribe any meds until more test to determine what kind of infection. Finally got a antibiotic that would cover most any infection. Went back for more MRI'S , the cloudy area was gone. I was told it could been several different things nothing definite. I was told that I gave spinal stenosis. I had tons if blood work looking for cancer, etc. Nothing. I cannot even start to explain how much pain I was in. It was cramping muscles and would not stop. Felt kinda like someone had hold of my nerve and rubbing it together with sandpaper. I have cried and cried at home, nights, days, while at work..all the time. The major pain is gone after the antibiotics, but I still have pain in my lower buttocks. I didn't put 2 and 2 together until I read an article on the shingles vaccine. - MichaelMay 1, 2020 at 3:40 pm I received my first shingles (shingrix) shot towards the end of August 2019.

This continued to worsen over the next several days, and I ended up going to a hospital emergency department in Lexington soon after we arrived. This turned into vasculitis and I had open sores on both legs, especially around my ankles. I had bandages on both legs for over three months. Along with that I had neuropathy (that pins and needles feeling) in both legs and it was very painful. The neuropathy finally went away, but after the sores healed (these looked like something out of a forensic pathologist's book), it left reddish scars that I still have. I called the attorneys who are handling the class action suit, but nobody every returned my call. Needless to say, I did not get my second shot, as it's administered in two stages. - WendyApril 25, 2020 at 4:53 pm I received the first Shingrix vaccine in early November of 2019.

My pharmacy finally had availability in January, so I had the first shot one week before my 74th birthday, the 20th. On the 22nd, while showering, I felt the equivalent of an electric shock in my right ear, and I suffered a sudden hearing loss. My otorhinolaryngologist put me on steroids, which reduced the hearing loss temporarily, but did not restore full hearing. After the hearing loss seemed to worsen, he put me on a virus suppressant, which again seemed to help while I was on it. Now the hearing loss continues, accompanied by loud tinnitus in that ear, and may be spreading to my left ear. As a semi-professional musician, I would much rather have shingles again than lose my hearing in either ear, much less both. Nothing warned against such a potential side effect, but testimonies on this site make clear it may be one. - DanielMarch 7, 2020 at 2:46 pm I got my shingrix shot over month ago.

Took another ultrasound, L 7 mm nodule (too small to biopsy), R nodule VANISHED. 1. hospital fudged the results by playing with the ultrasound contrast. We went to the 2. hospital for evaluation of possible low grade lymphoma. No symptoms, no history of cancer, no fever, no rash, all blood work NORMAL even leukocytes normal and even went down from 1590 to 1300 in 2-3 weeks. Docs are covering up the shingrix side effects.

Then a couple weeks later I noticed that my tongue felt off, kind of numb, a few days later I started getting a pain here and there under my right ear, it was a semi severe pain but it only lasted for what seemed maybe 5 to 10 seconds and would go away. A few days later on the 27th my tongue felt even more numb, it was affecting my taste ability. It all seemed like no big deal and that it would go away at some point. Unfortunately this hasn't been the situation, the following day on the 28th I did some errands, came home and made dinner and everything was fine. Then about an hour later I started to notice that my lips felt kind of numb and things didn't feel right so I called a 24 hour nurse for a phone evaluation. She told me to get to an emergency room so I did and they were quick to get me in, my symptoms (I was told later) mimicked a possible stroke. I was admitted and run through a number of tests and seen by a number of doctors and admitted into the hospital. The end result was that I have Bell's Palsy. This is the worst thing I have had to deal with... the right side of my face is somewhat paralyzed and my speech is impaired. Since I left the hospital my speech has gotten worse. Could all this be a side effect of the shingles vaccine? I don't know for sure but a doctor said that it's possible, they all kept asking if I had been sick with any kind of cold or virus but I generally never get sick. So now I'm hoping that I'm one of lucky ones that recovers from this and I'm trying to stay positive but it's tough when I dwell on the thought of the idea that this could be permanent. At this point I can only wait day by day and hope that there will be future improvements. So it's extremely doubtful that I will get the second part of shingles vaccine. I will try and post an update in the future of my recovery. - DeniseJanuary 13, 2020 at 1:35 am Had shingles years ago and got the Zostavax vaccine. The only side effect was a sore arm.

I have had to see Neurologist, have CAT scan, be in PT for three months, see an Ortho for cortisone. I was given a a prescription of gabapentin (a habit forming medication). My range of motion is very, very limited now. As of today's date I am scheduled for carpal tunnel surgery 1/6/20. Before this vacation, I had a yearly check up for the past nine years- that's it!

Here it is December and I'm still fighting this illness because of us simple vaccine that I was told I needed because I'm over 50. It's been terrible absolutely terrible living through this period and I'm told it might take an entire year before in better. I hope that I am able to return to my active ways however I'm very suspicious. I used to be able to do things like ride my horse, Kayak, exercise daily, hike, and scuba dive.
