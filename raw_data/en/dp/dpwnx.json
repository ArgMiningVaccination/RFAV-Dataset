NMSIIS will roll out in two phases: Phase I is now in progress with pilot practices being trained and coming on board. Early this summer, use of NMSIIS will be expanded to other providers and users. Experience gained in Phase I will be used to fine-tune the spring open enrollment and training of providers. One of the advantages the NMSIIS will provide is ten years of back data. The data from hundreds of thousands of Part B Forms will already be loaded into NMSIIS. This means that the vast majority of children who have received an immunization in New Mexico in the past ten years will be in the system. This translates into a very robust system from day one. New Mexico providers will find this system useful and user-friendly. For more information, visit the expanded website at www.health.state.nm.us/immunize/ nmsiis.htm.

No. 1 NM's Statewide Immunization Information System rolls out! By Anna Pentler, MPH, MBA Executive Director of NMIC On January 11, the New Mexico Department of Health held a kickoff press conference for the long-awaited launch of The New Mexico Statewide Immunization Information System (NMSIIS). The event took place alongside a very busy immunization clinic at the Cesar Chavez Community Center in Albuquerque's Southeast Heights. The launch of NMSIIS was a great success with First Lady Barbara Richardson in aendance to hold the press conference and announce the launch. Two children were selected to be spotlighted by the press to use NMSIIS to locate their immunization history, identify the shots needed, and get immunized. The system worked perfectly.In this issue...

NMIC and the NM Department of Health will honor providers whose immunization rates for two-year olds are 90% and above according to the latest coverage surveys. In addition, several immunization champions will be honored, and there will be several provider awards for special categories. The Provider Awards Dinner will take place on April 28, 2006 at the Albuquerque Marrio Pyramid. All NMIC members are invited but must RSVP. This year we have 46 providers with rates over 90%; this is up from 43 last year. Each provider who achieves a rate of 90% and above helps New Mexico move closer to its 2010 goal of 90% on-time age-appropriate immunization for all New Mexicans, and we want to recognize and applaud their extraordinary efforts. NMIC will compile and share a list of best practices from the aw ard winners in order to help other practices bring their rates up as well. We are excited to have Dr. Melinda Wharton, Acting Deputy Director of the National Immunization Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as keynote speaker for the Awards Dinner. Her talk will focus on Pertussis and the use of Tdap to help \"Stamp Out Pertussis.\" Other events during NIIW/VWA, (April 22-29) include a Grand Rounds lecture in Las Cruces and a Promotora Immunization training on April 27th. Dr. Wharton will be speaking at both those events. In addition, Dr. Wharton will give a lecture at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center on Friday, April 28th at noon. The topic of that talk will be \"New and Emerging Vaccines in the Childhood Schedule and Vaccine Safety.\" We are very fortunate to have an excellent speaker and resource from which to learn Please join us in celebrating National Infant Immunization Week.Influenza The ACIP met in February and made a new recommendation that all children six months to five years should be immunized against influenza. In addition, the caregivers and households contacts of children up to five, should be immunized. Rotavirus The ACIP also recommended that infants receive three doses of the new oral vaccine, RotaTeq, at two, four, and six months of age. Children should receive the first dose of the vaccine by 12 weeks of age and should receive all doses of the vaccine by 32 weeks of age. There is insufficient data on safety and efficacy outside of these age ranges. Rotavirus is a viral infection that can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration (gastroenteritis) in infants and young children. It is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children in the United States and worldwide.
