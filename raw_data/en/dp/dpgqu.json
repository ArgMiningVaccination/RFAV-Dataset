Or have none of your other methods of treatment to treat the symptoms of your joint-related issues worked so far? An exosome appointment with us might be just what you need for overall wellness. Here's what you should know about exosomes and their uses. What are Exosomes? Exosomes are tiny extracellular vesicles used that can facilitate cell-to-cell communication as well as promote the repair of damaged tissue. They are released by most body cells and are readily available to help treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. Recent studies have also found that exosomes can be highly effective in drug delivery to specific tissues or organs within the body. As they are naturally occurring in the majority of your body's organs and fluids, exosomes are not only minimally invasive but they're also considered to be a non-toxic native delivery vesicle. What Are the Benefits of Exosomes? The use of exosomes offers multiple benefits. They have been shown to: - Reduce inflammation - Promote the proliferation of new cells - Treat brain diseases and various types of cancer - Receive a better reception as a vector for drugs from host cells - Relieve chronic pain Exosomes are known for their versatility and have been effective at treating everything from kidney injuries to coronary disease and lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Exosome-based therapies are now common in the plastic surgery industry, where they're used to treat issues with wrinkles, skin pigmentation, acne scars, and more. What to Expect During an Exosome Appointment If you've never been to an exosome appointment, you might be wondering what to expect. On intake, a trained physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking a comprehensive set of questions to determine your current health status, including lifestyle, mental, and physical health. During your actual exosome treatment appointment, you will most likely receive your dose of exosomes via IV treatment. However, if your issue is joint-related, then your exosomes can be administered via direct injection into the affected joint. Most patients typically feel relief after just one session, but since it's highly personalized, this may vary between patients and can take up to four weeks before you see a difference. As a minimally invasive procedure, you should experience very little to no downtime and can resume normal functions immediately following the session.
