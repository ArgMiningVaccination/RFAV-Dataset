Do not file draft forms and do not rely on draft forms, instructions, and pubs for filing. We incorporate all significant changes to forms posted with this coversheet . However, unexpected issues occasionally arise, or legislation is passed \u2014in this case, we will post a new draft of the form to alert users that changes were made to the previously posted draft. Thus, there are never any changes to the last posted draft of a form and the final revision of the form. Forms and instructions are subject to OMB approval before they can be officially released, so we post drafts of them until they are approved. Drafts of instructions and pub s usually have some additional changes before their final release. Early release drafts are at IRS.gov/DraftForms and remain there after the final release is posted at IRS.gov/LatestForms. Also see IRS.gov/Forms . Most forms and publication s have a page on IRS.gov: IRS.gov/Form1040 for Form 1040; IRS.gov/Pub501 for Pub. 501; IRS.gov/W4 for Form W -4; and IRS.gov/ScheduleA for Schedule A (Form 1040), for example, and similarly for other forms, pubs, and schedules for Form 1040.

June 30, 2023ONLY DRAFTAND OMB USETREASURY/IRSInstructions for Form 720 (Rev. March 2023) Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted. Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 720 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form720 . What's New The Infrastructure and Jobs Act (IIJA) made the following changes. Superfund tax. The IIJA reinstates and increases the section 4611 Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate (petroleum Superfund tax rate) on domestic crude oil (IRS No. 53) and imported petroleum products (IRS No. 16), effective January 1, 2023 (the taxes previously expired on December 31,1995). The new IRS Nos. 53 and 16 are added to Form 720, Part I. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act) made the following changes. Renewable diesel and kerosene changes. The Act made the following changes to the definition of renewable diesel and the treatment of kerosene, effective for fuel sold or used after 2022. Renewable diesel no longer includes fuel derived from biomass that meets the requirements of a Department of Defense specification for military jet fuel or an American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) specification for aviation turbine fuel. Kerosene is no longer treated as diesel fuel for purposes of the renewable diesel mixture credit. Sustainable aviation fuel credit. The Act created a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) credit under sections 40B and 6426(k), effective January 1, 2023, so line 12d is added to Form 720, Schedule C. Termination of liquefied hydrogen. The Act removed liquefied hydrogen from the definition of alternative fuel under section 6426(d)(2) for purposes of the alternative fuel credit and alternative fuel mixture credit for fuel sold or used after 2022. Inflation Adjustment for 2023 Transportation of persons by air (IRS No. 26). The section 4261 tax on the amount paid for each domestic segment of taxable air transportation is adjusted for inflation and increased to $4.80. Use of international air travel facilities (IRS No. 27). The section 4261 tax on the amount paid for international flights is adjusted for inflation and increased to $21.10 per person for flights that begin or end in the United States. The tax is adjusted for inflation and increased to $10.60 per person for domestic segments that begin or end in Alaska or Hawaii (applies only to departures).Arrow shafts (IRS No. 106). The section 4161 tax on arrow shafts is adjusted for inflation and increased to $.59 per arrow shaft. Reminders Kerosene used in aviation. Kerosene is generally taxed at $.244 per gallon unless a reduced rate applies. The $.244 per gallon tax rate applies to kerosene removals unless it is removed from a terminal or refinery (or a qualified refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon that is treated as a terminal) directly into the fuel tank of an aircraft. See Kerosene for use in aviation (IRS Nos. 69, 77, and 111) , later. Alternative fuel mixtures. For claims made on or after January 8, 2018, \"alternative fuel mixture\" means a mixture of taxable fuel and alternative fuel other than liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied gas derived from biomass, and compressed gas derived from biomass. Butane mixture doesn't qualify for a credit. A mixture of butane (or other gasoline blendstock) and gasoline is a mixture of two taxable fuels. Therefore, it isn't an alternative fuel mixture and doesn't qualify for the section 6426 alternative fuel mixture credit. See section 6426(e)(2), and Rev. Rul. 2018-02 at IRS.gov/IRB/ 2006-92_IRB#RR-2018-02 . Reducing your excise tax liability. For federal income tax purposes, reduce your expense for the section 4081 excise tax, whether taken as a deduction or as a component of cost of goods sold, by the amount of excise tax credits allowable under sections 6426(c) and (e). Similarly, reduce your expense for the section 4041 excise tax, whether taken as a deduction or as a component of cost of goods sold, by the amount of excise tax credit allowable under section 6426(d). Exported gasoline blendstocks. Claims for exported gasoline blendstocks taxed at $.001 per gallon are made on Schedule C, line 14b. Continue to use line 1b to make claims for exported gasoline blendstocks taxed at $.184 per gallon. Electronic filing. You can electronically file Form 720 through any electronic return originator (ERO), transmitter, and/or intermediate service provider (ISP) participating in the IRS e-file program for excise taxes. For more information on e-file , go to Excise Tax e-File & Compliance (ETEC) Programs - Forms 720, 2290, and 8849 . Federal tax deposits made by electronic funds transfer. Generally, you must use electronic funds transfer to make federal tax deposits, such as deposits of employment tax, excise tax (for exceptions, see Payment of Taxes , later), and corporate income tax. Generally, electronic funds transfers are made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make deposits on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Mar 22, 2023 Cat.

QSubs and eligible single-owner disregarded entities must pay and report excise taxes (other than IRS Nos. 31, 51, and 117), register for most excise tax activities, and claim any refunds, credits, and payments under their EINs. These actions can't take place under the owner's taxpayer identification number (TIN). Some QSubs and disregarded entities may already have an EIN. However, if you are unsure, please call the IRS Business and Specialty Tax Line at 800-829-4933. Generally, QSubs and eligible single-owner disregarded entities will continue to be treated as disregarded entities for other federal tax purposes (other than employment taxes).

Air Transportation Taxes Transportation of Persons by Air (IRS No. 26) The taxes on transportation of persons by air are the percentage tax and the domestic segment tax. Add the percentage tax and the domestic segment tax to get the total tax on transportation of persons by air. Note. The percentage and domestic segment taxes don't apply on a flight if the surtax on fuel used in a fractional ownership program aircraft is imposed. For more information, see Surtax on any liquid used in a fractional ownership program aircraft as fuel (IRS No. 13) , later. Who Must File The person receiving the payment for air transportation services must do all of the following. Collect the tax. Submit the tax. File Form 720 to report the amount of the tax collected, or considered collected, for the quarter. Exemption for amounts paid for aircraft management services. Effective December 23, 2017, certain payments related to the management of private aircraft are exempt from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. See Pub. 510. Percentage tax. The percentage tax is 7.5% of amounts paid for taxable transportation of persons by air. Domestic segment tax. For calendar year 2023, the tax on the amount paid for each domestic segment of taxable transportation is $4.80. Example. In January 2023, Frank Jones pays $267.60 to a commercial airline for a flight in January from Washington to Chicago with a stopover in Cleveland. The flight has two segments. The price includes the $240 fare and $27.60 excise tax [($240 \u00d7 7.5%) + (2 \u00d7 $4.80)] for which Frank is liable. The airline collects the tax from Frank and submits it to the government. Charter flights. If an aircraft is chartered, and the flight isn't one where the tax on fuel used in a fractional ownership program aircraft is imposed, the domestic segment tax for each segment of taxable transportation is figured by multiplying the tax by the number of passengers transported on the aircraft. Example. In March 2023, Tim Clark pays $1,142.20 to an air charter service to carry seven employees from Washington to Detroit with a stopover in Pittsburgh. The flight has two segments. The price includes the $1,000 charter payment and $138.00 excise tax (2 \u00d7 $4.80 \u00d7 7 passengers)] for which Tim is liable. The charter service collects the tax from Tim and submits it to the government. Rural airports. If a segment is to or from a rural airport, the domestic segment tax doesn't apply. -4- Instructions for Form 720 (Rev. 3-2023)June 30, 2023ONLY DRAFTAND OMB USETREASURY/IRSTransportation of Property by Air (IRS No. 28) The tax is 6.25% of amounts paid for transportation of property by air. The tax doesn't apply if the surtax on fuel used in a fractional ownership program aircraft is imposed. See Surtax on any liquid used in a fractional ownership program aircraft as fuel (IRS No. 13) , later. Use of International Air Travel Facilities (IRS No. 27) For calendar year 2023, the section 4261 excise tax on any amount paid for international air transportation, if the transportation begins or ends in the United States, is generally $21.10. However, a lower rate of tax applies to a domestic segment beginning or ending in Alaska or Hawaii, and the tax applies only to departures. For calendar year 2023, the rate of tax is $10.60. Communications and Air Transportation Taxes\u2014Uncollected Tax Report A separate report is required to be filed by collecting agents of communications services (local and teletypewriter service) and air transportation taxes if the person from whom the facilities or services tax (the tax) is required to be collected (the taxpayer) refuses to pay the tax, or it's impossible for the collecting agent to collect the tax. The report must contain the name and address of the taxpayer, the type of facility provided or service rendered, the amount paid for the facility or service (the amount on which the tax is based), and the date paid.

Deposits of communications and air transportation taxes may be based on taxes included in amounts billed or tickets sold during a semimonthly period instead of on taxes actually collected during the period. Under the alternative method, the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during a semimonthly period is considered collected during the first 7 days of the second following semimonthly period. The deposit of tax is due by the third business day after the seventh day of that period. Example. The tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold for the period June 16-30, 2023, is considered collected from July 16-22, 2023, and must be deposited by July 27, 2023. To use the alternative method, you must keep separate accounts of the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during the month and report on Form 720 the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold and not the amount of tax that is actually collected. For example, amounts billed in December, January, and February are considered collected during January, February, and March and are reported on Form 720 as the tax for the first quarter of the calendar year. The separate account for each month must reflect: 1.All items of tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during the month, and 2.Other items of adjustment relating to tax for prior months (within the statute of limitations on credits or refunds). The separate account for any month can't include an adjustment resulting from a refusal to pay or inability to collect unless the refusal has been reported to the IRS. See Communications and Air Transportation Taxes \u2014Uncollected Tax Report , earlier. The net tax liability that is considered collected during the semimonthly period must be either: The net amount of tax reflected in the separate account for the corresponding semimonthly period of the preceding month, or TIP Instructions for Form 720 (Rev. 3-2023) -11-June 30, 2023ONLY DRAFTAND OMB USETREASURY/IRSOne-half of the net amount of tax reflected in the separate account for the preceding month. Amount To Deposit Deposits of taxes for a semimonthly period must be at least 95% of the amount of net tax liability for that period, unless the safe harbor rule applies. See Safe Harbor Rule , later. The net tax liability for a semimonthly period is the total liability for the period minus any claims allowed on Schedule C for the period. Net tax liability for a semimonthly period may be figured by dividing the net tax liability for the month by 2, provided this method of computation is used for all semimonthly periods in the calendar quarter. The net tax liability for a semimonthly period isn't reduced by any amounts from Form 720-X. Safe Harbor Rule The safe harbor rule applies separately to deposits under the regular method and the alternative method. Persons who filed Form 720 for the lookback quarter (the second calendar quarter preceding the current quarter) are considered to meet the semimonthly deposit requirement if the deposit for each semimonthly period in the current quarter is at least 1/6 (16.67%) of the net tax liability reported for the lookback quarter. For the semimonthly period for which the additional deposit is required (September 1-11 and 16-26), the additional deposit must be at least 11/90 (12.23%) of the net tax liability reported for the lookback quarter. Also, the total deposit for that semimonthly period must be at least 1/6 (16.67%) of the net tax liability reported for the lookback quarter. Exceptions. The safe harbor rule doesn't apply to the following quarters. The first and second quarters beginning on or after the effective date of an increase in the rate of tax unless the deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is at least 1/6 (16.67%) of the tax liability you would have had for the lookback quarter if the increased rate of tax had been in effect for that lookback quarter. Any quarter if liability includes any tax not in effect throughout the lookback quarter. For deposits under the alternative method, any quarter if liability includes any tax not in effect throughout the lookback quarter and the month preceding the lookback quarter. Requirements to be met. For the safe harbor rule to apply, you must pay any underpayment for the current quarter by the due date of the return and check the box on line 5 of Form 720. The IRS may withdraw the right to make deposits of tax using the safe harbor rule from any person not complying with these rules. Online Payment Agreement If you can't pay the full amount of tax owed, you can apply for an installment agreement online. You can apply for an installment agreement online if the total amount you owe in combined tax, penalties, and interest is $25,000 ($50,000 for individuals) or less, and you've filed all required returns. To apply using the Online Payment Agreement Application, go to IRS.gov/OPA . CAUTION! CAUTION!Schedule A. Excise Tax Liability How to complete. Complete Schedule A to record net tax liabilities for Form 720, Part I, taxes for each semimonthly period in a quarter even if your net liability is under $2,500.

Report communications and air transportation taxes based on: Actual collections on line 1, or Amounts billed or tickets sold on line 2. The amount of tax to report for a semimonthly period is the net amount that is considered collected during that period. Example. Under the alternative method, the amounts billed for communications services from June 1-15, 2023, are considered collected during the period July 1-7, 2023, and are reported for the third quarter of 2023 on Schedule A in box M, not the first quarter of 2023. Reporting tax liability under the special September rule. An additional reporting is required under the special September rule as follows. Regular method taxes Enter the liability for the period beginning September 26/27 and ending September 30 in box F. Alternative method taxes Enter the tax included in the amounts billed or tickets sold for the period beginning September 11/12 and ending September 15 in box M of the fourth quarter return. Enter the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during the period beginning September 16 and ending September 30 in box N of the fourth quarter return. Schedule T. Two-Party Exchange Information Reporting In a two-party exchange, the receiving person, not the delivering person, is liable for the tax imposed on the removal of taxable fuel from the terminal at the terminal rack. A two-party exchange means a transaction (other than a sale) where the delivering person and receiving person are both taxable fuel registrants and all of the following occur. The transaction includes a transfer from the delivering person, who holds the inventory position for the taxable fuel in the terminal as reflected in the records of the terminal operator. -12- Instructions for Form 720 (Rev. 3-2023)June 30, 2023ONLY DRAFTAND OMB USETREASURY/IRSThe exchange transaction occurs before or at the same time as completion of removal across the rack by the receiving person. The terminal operator in its records treats the receiving person as the person that removes the product across the terminal rack for purposes of reporting the transaction on Form 720-TO, Terminal Operator Report. The transaction is the subject of a written contract. Information reporting. Schedule T is used to report gallons of taxable fuel: Received in a two-party exchange within a terminal\u2014these gallons must also be included on the appropriate line on Form 720, page 1; or Delivered in a two-party exchange with a removal across the rack.
