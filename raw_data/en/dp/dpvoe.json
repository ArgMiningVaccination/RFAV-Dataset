HOW EXCITING! I HAVE HAD A FRIEND TRY REIKI ON ME, BUT WHAT HELPED ME THE MOST WAS POLARIZATION. I HAVE HAD MANY TYPES OF SPIRITUAL HEALERS WORK WITH ME IN THE 90'S, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALL MOVED OUT OF TOWN. I HAVE DONE MY HANDS ON VERSION OF THERAPEUTIC TOUCH. I HAVE NOT DONE IT SOME YEARS NOW, BUT FEEL I AM READY TO GET BACK INTO IT! I AM GETTING READY TO START GOING TO A UNITY CHURCH SO I CAN FIND MORE HEALERS TO WORK WITH ME AND HELP RAISE MY STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BE AROUND THEM AND I IMMEDIATELY CHANGE. THAT WILL ALSO GIVE ME AN OUTLET TO GET BACK INTO THE HEALINGS I DID. I AM REALLY REALLY GLAD YOU POSTED THIS BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN SO MANY BLOGS ABOUT ALTERNATIVE HEALING, BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE INTERESTED AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY?????? I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MY VERSION OF THERAPEUTIC TOUCH ON MYSELF AND IT IS HELPING. I HOPE YOU ARE STILL ON THIS SITE. WE MUST STAY IN TOUCH! I WISH YOU PEACE, LOVE, BLESSINGS, JOY.........JAN I USE ALL CAPS FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED. LARA, AT LAST, SOMEONE LIKE ME! HOW EXCITING!

I was excited to see your post as well... I never see much on this site sbout alternative therapies. I would like to see more discussion on this, because anti-e meds have so many side effects. I am diagnosed with simple partial seizures ( I get the annoying uncomfortable deja vu's with a strong metallic flavor, etc), and had my first tonic clonic seizure on may 21st this year. I have no actual memory of the seizure which makes this all even harder to process. My neurologist wants me on meds, but I refused. Its hard to comprehend dealing with side effects of these drugs on a daily basis, when I may only have 5-6 seizures a year. I admit, I am still in a bit of denial... but not driving, so no worries there I just got back from an appointment with a naturopath. She gave me a homeopathic of Arnica. Has anyone ever been given that before? Also, I am curious if anyone has ever considered Cranio-Sacral work? I am a massage therapist (although I have not practiced in 6 months due to the fact I am trying to figure out my health) and I once took a class in cranio-sacral. Seems like an interesting treatment to try, but I have not found anything on how it could benefit epilepsy. Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on that... thanks! hello!

Re: Reiki/Homeopathy and Epilepsy treatment Submitted by Kat_Kia on Mon, 2011-05-16 - 08:20 Dear friend, I really hope that your status is better by now. I know all about denial with medicine! I m living with epilepsy the last 18 years, since I was 15. Did homeopathy worked for you? I started 1 month ago but still I am experiencing the healing period which can be hard sometimes. My doctor gave me Lachesis which is compatible with my personality. Other health issues that I had are completely healed but epilepsy told me that will take longer since it is the oldest problem that my body suffered.

Re: Reiki/Homeopathy and Epilepsy treatment Submitted by llanarth on Wed, 2011-05-25 - 19:08 I have tried homeopathy, and it worked to a certain extent, yes! I still get the occassional fit,but it is occassional! 3-4 a year! I had two lots of treatment, by 2 different homeopaths. They interestingly both put me on the same medicine. I still have lots of homeopathy around the house-Cuprum met- to avert a fit, Cocculus for when I'm tired, and Arnica too. I also take progesterone, which also helps.
