Contrary to popular belief, 'homeopathy' is not the same as herbal medicine. Homeopathy is a natural, gentle, safe and holistic type of medicine that was developed in Germany over 200 years ago. It is largely considered the first \"medicine\" in the United States and is governed to the same standards by the FDA as its better known pharmaceutical cousins. Homeopathy, as a science, is geared to provide the body with specific physical nutrients and information allowing it to heal itself rather than the basis of allopathic or traditional pharmaceuticals that act to mask or suppress symptoms in most cases. Our homeopathic remedies are made from natural sources such as arnica (mountain herb), belladonna or stinging nettle. Our remedies are created by a specific process, called potenization, which derives the energy pattern of the original source without containing any of the source molecules. Our homeopathic remedies work so effectively and gently on the body that even babies and pregnant women can use them safely. The Evidence The body of historical and present-day evidence supporting the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies is simply too significant to ignore. Homeopathy became extremely popular during the 19th century is primarily because of its impressive successes in treating the infectious disease epidemics that raged during that time like cholera, yellow fever, scarlet fever, typhoid, pneumonia, or influenza. Recent studies testing the effects of homeopathic medicines on cell cultures, plants, animals, physics experiments, and chemistry trials have shown statistically significant effects. Many highly respected people and cultural heroes over the past 200 years have used and advocated for homeopathy including eleven U.S. Presidents, six popes, JD Rockefeller, Charles Darwin, Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, and scores of literary greats, corporate leaders, sports superstars, world-class musicians, and monarchs from virtually every European country. It is also important to acknowledge that hundreds of thousands, even millions, of medical doctors learned conventional medicine but have used homeopathic medicines in conjunction with or (commonly) as replacement for conventional medicines. In comparison, the number of medical professionals who have trained in homeopathy and then stopped using these medicines is extremely small. The fact that homeopathic medicine represents the leading medical alternative in Europe and in significant portions of Asia (especially India and Pakistan) provides additional support for this often misunderstood medical science and art. In fact, over 100 million people in India depend solely on this form of medical care. Further, according to an A.C. Neilsen survey, 62 percent of current homeopathy users in India have never tried conventional medicines and 82 percent of homeopathy users would not switch to conventional treatments. "}
