Their address is 1111 North Fairfax Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. 703-684-2782. Current accreditation is granted through June 2022 STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY Application to and enrollment in the University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide.by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, catalogs, handbooks, and other published materials, and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. A student who neglects academic or other student duties, whose social conduct is unbecoming, or whose attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity, inevitably will come under question. The faculty then reviews the case, appraises the student's fitness for a career in this chosen profession, and recommends to the dean appropriate action as to the student's continuance or discontinuance from the program. CLASS OFFICERS During Fall module of your first and second year you will elect class officers to organize and represent your class. Class officers donate a considerable amount of time to the class. It is therefore recommended that any student that is struggling academically, should not jeopardize their standing in the program by taking on extra responsibilities of this nature. Listed below are the offices that are traditionally filled, and a description of their duties. President: A mature spiritual leader, able to organize the class and promote a cohesiveness that will bind the class together during your time at LLU. The president is the class spokesperson and is present at faculty meetings to represent you. Vice-President: Similar characteristics to president. Able to take over when president is not available. Also, your representative at faculty meetings. Secretary/Treasurer: Someone that is very good at handling the money and making arrangements that need to be made for class functions. A class account is opened at student finance. This person would be responsible for operating the account. Social Vice Presidents: We often have two people, usually of different genders. These people arrange social activities, (e.g. Groups that to in to watch taping of TV shows, camping trips, beach trips etc.). Sports Reps: These two individuals are one male, one female and organize male and female sporting teams and activities. They should have an ability to organize teams in an impartial manner to maintain class cohesiveness. Chaplain/s: Someone who is interested and willing to work with the faculty and class to organize activities of a spiritual nature, (e.g. Vespers at the beach, mountain retreat, prayer groups, Bible fellowship groups, class service projects etc.). Historian: Wants to keep the class together after you have all left the University. Someone who will keep records of where you are (as much as you tell that individual!). Maybe send out an annual newsletter update. APTA Representative: Someone really interested in our professional organization and what it does for us in the PT field. Attends local monthly APTA meetings and reports to the class any changes that may affect you. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 16 STUDENT AWARDS At the end of your program, the faculty will select individuals in your class for distinction with the following awards: Physical Therapy Faculty Award - In recognition for demonstrating outstanding potential and promise in the profession of physical therapy.

Notifying the department, while required, does not necessarily excuse the absence. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain any information that was given in his/her absence. If an examination is missed, you must notify the department prior to the absence and you are to contact the instructor within 48 hours to see if a make-up is possible. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Acts of dishonesty-including theft, plagiarism, giving or obtaining information in examinations or other academic exercises, or knowingly giving false information, is unacceptable for students in the School. Instructors and students are charged with the responsibility of reporting instances of such behavior to the department program director/chairperson. The department program director/chairperson is responsible for investigation. Substantiated violations will be brought before the Department faculty for disciplinary action. Such action may include, but is not limited to, academic probation or dismissal from the program. The educational and practical experiences utilized during classes which have laboratory activities are intended to provide the student with the best preparatory experience for the actual practice of physical therapy in the clinical setting. The lab practical testing formats are designed to be similar to clinical situations. To allow all students to participate in this simulated clinical situation, it is anticipated that there will be a significant time lag between the initiation of the practical by the first student therapist and the completion of the lab practical by the last student therapist. This time lag can allow opportunity for the students to disseminate practical information to other students. This sharing of information is considered to be an act of academic dishonesty and is strictly prohibited! ACCOMMODATIONS If you are an individual with a disability and need reasonable accommodation to fully participate in this program, please obtain the Student Information and Requested Accommodation forms from Dr. Craig Jackson, Dean, School of Allied Health Professions in Nichol Hall Room 1603.Accommodations, if granted, are for the didactic portion of the curriculum. Additional requests would need to be made for the clinical portion of the curriculum. As it is the responsibility of the program to develop the student into an entry-level clinician, time accommodations in the clinical setting may not be appropriate. ADDING/DROPPING Students may change their schedule by completing a Change of Program form available online at www.llu.edu/ssweb. The last day to add a course is five days after the beginning of instruction of the module. The last day to drop a course without record on the transcript is 10 school days after the beginning of instruction of the module. A \"W\" (withdraw) will be recorded on the transcript for courses dropped prior to 14 calendar days before the final examination week. Courses may not be withdrawn after that date. ADMISSIONS Students are admitted into the physical therapy programs based on the following: 1. Satisfactorily completing all prerequisites prior to the program starting with a minimum GPA as follows: Overall pre-requisites 3.4 Science pre-requisites 3.4 Non-science pre-requisites 3.4 2. Personal interview with one of the faculty 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 20 AMERICAN PHYSICAL THERAPY ASOCIATION All students are required to belong to the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) while enrolled in the program. The student is encouraged to read the journal and attend the APTA-sponsored meetings. The department gives up to $5000 per year, per class, to assist students in attending APTA sponsored meetings. The guidelines are as follows: 1. Department will pay the registration fee for up to two student representatives to attend APTA conventions with the following restrictions: a. Department will pay up to $200 registration fees per convention (Ex: $100 per representative for two representatives, or $200 for one representative) c. Department will pay registration fees up to two conventions per year 2. In addition to the above stated support, the Department will pay up to $5000 per class per fiscal year for student attendance at APTA conventions with the following restrictions: a. Student must submit receipts for reimbursement. Expenses for which the student is eligible for reimbursement are registration, lodging, transportation, and meals. d. Maximum meal allowance per day is set by the University (January 2021, $54/day) e. Maximum mileage allowance is set by the University (January 2021, $0.56/mile) 3. With class officers' approval, the APTA representative may receive money from both #1 and #2 for the same convention. ATTENDANCE Regular class and lab attendance is expected of all students. Specific requirements and final authority for attendance and any effect it might have upon grades, rests with the individual faculty member. However, students who miss more than 20% of regular class/lab sessions, even if absences are considered \"excusable,\" may be required to drop the course. Arriving more than 30 minutes late is considered an absence. The specific rules for each course will be listed in the class syllabus and be made clear on the first day of class. Pagers and cell phones need to be on silent or vibrate during class time. BACKGROUND CHECKS Loma Linda University requires that all students have a background check completed at the time of initial registration in June. The Department is required to send documentation to clinical sites prior to students attending their clinics for rotations (Short and Long Clinical Experiences). Therefore, student in the DPT program will be required to have background checks at the following times within the program: Summer Module of Year 1: Initial Background Check Spring Module of Year 1: Updated Background Check Spring Module of Year 2: Updated Background Check If a student receives a \"Hit\" on their background check, the cause of the \"hit\" is reviewed by legal counsel for the University. If legal counsel determines that the nature of the misdemeanor/felony is such that the student should not be allowed to complete a clinical rotation in one of the facilities within Loma Linda University Health, the Department will be notified. It is possible, that other facilities with which we have contracts would take the student, but placement will become more difficult. In addition, the student needs to recognize that having a misdemeanor or felony on their record may prevent them from sitting for the National Physical Therapy Examination or becoming a licensed physical therapist. Students who have any questions on this issue are encouraged to meet with the program director. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 21 CHAPEL Every Wednesday from 11:00-12:00 am during Fall, Winter and Spring modules, the student body meets in the University Church of Seventh-day Adventist for a university wide chapel service. Students are expected to attend each week of the module. If a student does not have a class or laboratory scheduled prior to 3:00pm on Wednesday, they are not required to attend chapel. Students are allowed two absences during the module. If a student is absent for more than two chapels in one module, the student must listen to the audio recording of the missed chapel and write a 1-2 page reaction paper. The reaction paper is to be turned in to the program director or designate. If a student does not complete the reaction paper, a registration hold may be placed on the student's registration packet. CLINICAL EDUCATION Clinical Education refers to that portion of your education spent in full-time (40 hrs/wk) clinical environments, including inpatient settings (acute and subacute hospitals and medical centers, rehabilitation centers, skilled nursing facilities) and outpatient settings (private practice, pediatric, geriatric, rehabilitation, wellness centers, sports medicine). Your year-at-a-glance schedule reveals how the clinical and academic portions are integrated with short and long clinical experiences. Please study your schedule carefully before planning vacations, weddings, or special events so that clinical assignments will not be interrupted. Advance permission must be obtained from the academic faculty and the clinical faculty before any adjustments may be made to your clinical schedule. All clinical assignments are made by the academic coordinator of clinical education (ACCE) or designate. Management and supervision of the clinical experiences are divided for practical purposes between the ACCEs, with DPT long clinical experiences primarily overseen by Theresa Joseph, PT, DPT, MBA (Room 1808 ext 87744) and short clinical experiences primarily overseen by Henry Garcia, PT, DSc (Room 1814 ext 47332). Students must not contact clinical facilities regarding clinical education unless given specific permission by either the ACCE or designate. The Department of the Physical Therapy, via the Office of the Dean, School of Allied Health Professions, currently holds approximately 900 active affiliation agreements with clinical facilities in almost every state. Clinical assignments will be drawn primarily from this collection because the development of new agreements is both expensive and time-consuming. Requests for new sites will be considered only after active resources have been exhausted and on the basis of predicted value for future students and must be submitted at least six to nine months in advance. Because of the limited number of local facilities available, assignments cannot be made on the basis of the student's family, marital status or personal preference. Although the department makes every effort to accommodate the student's preference, the student agrees to accept the clinical assignments made by the department at any of the affiliated facilities, whether local or out of state. Competition among schools for access to clinical education sites in California is keen. Our PT and PTA programs cooperate with the consortium of ACCEs from other PT and PTA programs in southern California called IACCC (Interscholastic Academic Clinical Coordinators Council). One of the objectives of IACCC is to improve communication between the academic programs and the clinical sites common to the group, particularly with regards to clinical education needs. Thus, we have the most effective means for securing clinical experiences in competitive sites, but we are also limited by the needs of other programs. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 22 COMMUNICATION Your University email address is the official method by which the University and the Department will communicate with you. The Department of Physical Therapy will use this method to make general announcements to the class and specific announcement to you as an individual. Please make sure that you check this often so that you do not miss anything. COMPLAINTS There may be a time while enrolled in the program that a student has a complaint. The following are the steps, in successive order, which a student should follow 1. Discuss the issue with the instructor/coordinator of the course. 2. Discuss the issue with the Program Director - Larry Chinnock 3. Discuss the issue with the Department Chair - Larry Chinnock 4. Discuss the issue with the Dean of the School of Allied Health Professions - Craig Jackson DISMISSAL/GRIEVANCE A student who is involved in dismissal proceedings or who has an academic or clinical grievance may proceed as follows: 1. The student should first discuss the problem or grievance with the instructor. If, following discussion with the instructor, the student is not satisfied and continues to believe that (s)he has not been dealt with fairly, the student may discuss the grievance with the chairperson or program director of the department. 2. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student has recourse to the Office of the Dean. 3. As a final appeal, the student may request the dean to appoint a faculty review committee of three (3) members to evaluate the situation and make a recommendation to the dean. This request should be presented in writing and include pertinent information regarding the situation. The student may request to meet with the review committee for discussion of the case. 4. The grievance must be filed within one module of the incident in question. EXAMINATION POLICY Academic dishonesty is not tolerated. To protect the integrity of the examination process during face-to-face (F2F) and remote testing environments, multiple examination formats and modes of surveillance, including video, may be used during examinations. Violation of any part of the examination policy may be considered academic dishonesty. The term \"examination\" includes midterms, finals, sectionals, and quizzes. 1. All examinations are timed and must be completed individually and not in group settings, unless indicated by the instructor. 2. Once student begins the examination it is expected that they will not leave until completion of the examination. Restroom and other activities should be taken care of prior to beginning the examination. 3. Hats are not allowed during the examination. 4. Talking is not allowed during the examination. The instructor cannot answer questions during the examination. Students may email the instructor for clarification on examination questions. 5. For all paper examinations using ScantronTM, the instructor can only accept what the student enters on the ScantronTM sheet. 6. Grading keys for examinations will be provided at the instructor's discretion. 7. The reproduction or saving of examination questions in any fashion is prohibited (i.e., use of cameras, screen shots, pictures, writing, copying, etc.). 8. 7-Day Rule: Requests to consider possible errors in grading must be made in writing within one week of examination score posting. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 23 9. In extenuating circumstances, the student may request that an examination be given at an alternative time. The student must complete the request form and turn it in to the program director. If the request is approved, there is a $50.00 fee for each approved examination. 10. During F2F examinations, seating may be assigned by instructor and examination is to remain unopened until instructor indicates that it is time to start. 11. During F2F examinations, all books, bags, purses, smart watches, electronic devices, etc. must be left in a designated area. Students can only take a pencil and eraser to the desk for paper examinations and only their computer for ExamSoft examinations. Cell phones must be silenced and placed in designated area. 12. During remote examinations, any electronic or non-electronic source that might aide the student in answering examination questions must be placed in an area outside of student visual and hearing range. 13. During F2F paper examinations, the completed examination and ScantronTM must be given to instructor before the student may leave. 14. During F2F and remote ExamSoft examinations, ExamSoft answers must be uploaded immediately after examination completion. 15. During ExamSoft examinations, the remote proctoring software for detecting, preventing, and deterring academic dishonesty during examinations using webcam and screen capture will be used each module during randomly selected remote and/or F2F examinations. Student behavior during the examinations includes movement, gaze, and background noise. Students are expected to remain in front of the computer screen for the entire examination. The Program Director selects the examinations to be proctored without faculty input. Department policy prohibits the instructor from informing students, which examinations are to be proctored by the ExamSoft proctoring software. FACULTY ADVISOR A faculty advisor/mentor will be assigned to students by the Department Chair or in faculty meeting for the following three conditions: 1. Per student request 2. Due to academic probation status 3. Faculty concerns affecting student success in the program. FINALS WEEK Finals will be scheduled one test per day Monday through Thursday. If more than four finals are necessary, than no more than two finals will be scheduled on any one day. Do not expect to be out of your last final for the module before 12:00pm on Thursday of Finals Week. Do not make any travel arrangements that will conflict with this schedule. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 24 GRADING Most course grades will be determined by the higher of two systems, percentage or scaled score (SS). The minimum passing grade is 75% or 325 SS. Grade determination will be made with consultation of the Grade Review Committee using the following guidelines: Scale Score Grade 590- (or > 95%) & <75% D Below 315 & 75% F GRADUATION REQUIREMENT A Doctor of Physical Therapy Student must have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0, with no grade less than C. PROGRAM COMPLETION REQUIREMENT Students are required to pass a mock board examination for program completion. Program completion is required to take the National Physical Therapy Examination (NPTE). The mock board examination minimum passing score is determined by the program director, in consultation with faculty, based on the most recent graduating cohort mock board examination and NPTE results. JURY DUTY If you receive a jury summons while in the program, please bring it to Barbara Cassimy. We have a form letter that we can give you that most of the time will excuse you from jury service until the end of the program. PARKING All students must register their vehicle if they drive and park on campus. To register your vehicle please go to https://parking.llu.edu/. For instruction on how to complete the registration, please see the first page under \"Forms\" in this student handbook. PROMOTION AND PROBATION Each student's record is reviewed by the faculty each module. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the School and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain a 3.0 program GPA. Specifically, a student whose GPA falls below the minimum required for the degree in any module, or who receives in any required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory, is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the department will notify the student in writing. Human gross anatomy is a 9 unit foundational course for the entire program, and because of the point GPA graduation requirements, students in the DPT program must receive a minimum grade of B (3.0) in the course to progress in the program. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 25 REGISTRATION Registration begins three weeks before Summer module. All students must clear with Student Finance to validate their registration. Registrations will be automatically dropped for students who have not obtained financial clearance by Thursday of the week prior to the first day of the module. To receive credit for a specific class, a student must be registered and financially cleared by the final date to add classes. Students are encouraged to register on time and are not to attend classes for which they are not registered. A late registration period is provided to accommodate students who have been unable to complete the registration process prior to the Thursday of the week first day of the module. RELIGION REQUIREMENT While in the physical therapy program, the students will take four religion courses for a total of 10 units. The courses the student will take are: RELE 707 Ethics for Allied Health Professionals (2 units) RELR 775 Whole Person Care (2 units) RELT 718 Adventist Heritage & Health (2 units) RELT 740 World Religions & Human Health (3 units) REPEATING COURSES A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may pursue, on the recommendation of the Chair of the department and the consent of the Dean, one of the following plans. In either plan the student must re-register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Re-register for the course paying the applicable fee. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). 2. Repeat the course the next time it is taught, attend all classes and/or laboratories, and take the final course examination. This option may delay the student's progression through the program. Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the last grade is computed in the GPA. A course may be repeated only one time. REQUEST FOR SPECIAL EXAM To take an examination at a time other than when it is scheduled, a student must secure the consent of the instructor, the faculty and the chair of the department and file a \"Request for Special Examination\" with the department. A $50.00 fee is charged for a special examination REQUIRED TEXT Each student must obtain a copy of the required textbooks within the first two weeks of the module. Books not purchased within two weeks will be returned to the publisher by the bookstore. It will then become the student's responsibility to obtain the textbook on his/her own. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 26 SCHOLASTIC QUALIFICATIONS/DISQUALIFICATIONS A DPT student must receive a B (3.0) or better in Anatomy (AHCJ 510) to continue in the program. Each student's record is reviewed each module by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the School and the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain a 3.0 program GPA: A student whose GPA falls below the minimum required for the degree in any module, or who receives in any required courses a grade less than C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory, is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the School for final action. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required GPA the following module or fails to have an overall minimum GPA after two modules will have disqualified him/herself from the program. If a student receives an unsatisfactory grade, they will be allowed to remediate the course the following quarter. If a student successfully remediates the course, they will receive a \"C\" grade. If a student a second unsatisfactory grade, they will have disqualified himself/herself from the program. SEXUAL HARASSMENT Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University, and threatens the careers, educational experience, and well-being of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Please refer to Loma Linda University's Sexual Harassment Policy found at: https://home.llu.edu/about-llu/policies/sex-discrimination-sexual-misconduct-title-ix STANDARDS OF ACADEMIC CONDUCT The purpose of education, especially Christian education, is to enhance intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and spiritual development of students at the same time that they are learning the skills of a profession. In the classroom, students shall be responsible to and respectful of their peers by avoiding any behavior that would disrupt the learning environment. Cheating is not tolerated. Cheating robs the student of an opportunity to learn and undermines relationships among peers as well as students and teachers. Where cheating is known, but not confronted, it ultimately allows a toleration of dishonesty, that if carried over into professional practice may result in abuse of patients and malpractice problems. For these reasons, cheating will not be tolerated and will be dealt with as a matter of serious discipline. Some types of violations of ethical conduct encountered in educational programs in the health-related professions are of particular concern. The following examples are illustrative but are not intended to be a complete list of concerns. 1. Academic Dishonesty Academic dishonesty involves a willful perversion of the truth in an academic setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 27 a. copying from peers, or knowingly and willingly permitting or assisting others to copy from examinations, assignments, or lab materials; b. using unauthorized aids for examinations, quizzes, assignments, clinicals, and laboratory procedures; c. looking at another individual's examination or quiz in a way that appears that information is being sought; d. plagiarizing, which includes the undocumented use of sources or ideas, whether quoted or paraphrased, or otherwise presented as one's own; e. fabrication and/or fraudulent insertion of scholarly materials, not the product of one's own efforts, into assignments or clinical records; f. interfering in a harmful way with another's work (e.g., sabotaging laboratory work, or illicit entry or deletion of computer data); g. writing a test, or examination, or assignment for another student, or having another person wrongfully write an examination for a third party. h. misrepresenting the attendance of self or of another party in a required class, laboratory or assembly; o i. altering grades or arranging for others to wrongfully alter grades on tests or examinations, instructors' records, or records of the School or University. 2. Forgery Forgery consists of the falsifying of signatures, altering of the content of documents after they have been signed, and may include other forms of lying or intentional misrepresentation. Examples of forgery include but are not limited to: a. falsifying instructors' signatures on charts or evaluation forms; b. altering patient records, grade forms, evaluation sheets, or other documents after a signature is received; c. signing another student's name on a classroom attendance record; or d. forging a person's signature on clinic records. TB TESTING & CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS A growing majority of clinical education facilities are requesting our students to present documentation for PPD testing within the previous six months of their arrival. The following schedule has been devised to ensure our students have a PPD test within at least 6 months of the starting date for each clinical experience. Students who have had a positive reading of the PPD must present appropriate documentation regarding timely chest x-rays. Schedule for PPD testing 1. At Initial Registration 2. Annually Afterward 3. As per specific clinical site requirement During the Student Orientation in June, each student will sign a form giving permission for the Health Service Office to release health records to the School so that health information may be sent to the appropriate clinical facility as needed. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the volume of tests to be done, each of the above series of tests will be pre-arranged and scheduled to be done as a group by the Student Health Services. The follow-up \"reading\" of the results of the test will also be done at a specific time two days following administration of the test. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 28 Students will not be tested or \"read\" on an individual basis. TO BE ARRANGED There will be blocks of time in your schedule that will be labeled TBA. These are periods of time that you are required to be in class. These time periods might be used by instructors to give examinations, have guest lecturers, or orient you to the affiliations. You should expect that there will be something scheduled for each TBA. The TBA schedule will also be emailed to the students. TUITION Tuition for 2021-2022 school year follows. Student is advised that the University may change tuition rates on a yearly basis.

Staff expertise, combined with the knowledge of community resources, enables the Student Assistance Program to provide comprehensive assistance to the students of LLU. There are two essential components of the Student Assistance Program: voluntary self-referral and referral by faculty and staff. The primary service is diagnostic evaluation and placement in services to address the individual needs of the student. Also, through the student assistance and training and educational efforts, the students are able to develop skills surrounding stress management, communication techniques, and many other topics that can aid them in healthful living. Students are encouraged to voluntarily and privately use the program to resolve personal problems before any involvement by faculty and staff is necessary. Anyone in need of assistance may call (909) 558-6050 or visit the clinic at the Loma Linda Health Center, 11360 Mountain View Avenue, Hartford Building, Suite A, between the hours of 8:00a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday-Wednesday, 8:00a.m.-8:00p.m. on Thursday, and 8:00a.m.-1:00p.m. on Friday. Transportation will be provided if necessary. If a student is interested in services provided by the on-campus University Counseling Center (see below), a referral will be made after the initial evaluation is completed. Counseling Center The University Counseling Center operates from the philosophy that students can only reach their maximum potential when their preparation for professional careers is accompanied by a parallel development of their emotional, social, and spiritual capacities. The Counseling Center implements this philosophy through a variety of services to students and their families which include: a. individual, family, marital, premarital, and group counseling; b. study skills, time management, and anxiety reduction training; and c. emergency 24-hour crisis intervention. Many students are seen in individual, one-to-one sessions. Typical issues involve conflict and communication in relationships, dealing with symptoms of traumatic experiences, substance abuse, eating disorders, adjusting to academic rigors, or any situation which generates anxiety or depression. The Center also offers training in reducing test anxiety and improving concentration. All discussions are confidential. Services are available at no charge to students for the first nine visits. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 32 The Counseling Center is located at 11378 Mountain View Avenue, Dover Building, Suites A and B, in the Loma Linda Health Center.

These pathogens need to get inside of your body to cause disease. They may enter your body and infect you through: 1. an accidental injury caused by a sharp object that is contaminated by blood borne pathogens, 2. open cuts, nicks, and abrasions 3. mucous membranes of your mouth, eyes, and nose Blood borne pathogens live in blood and other body fluids, such as saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions. In specialized areas, like laboratories, Blood borne pathogens may be in unfixed cells, tissue and organ cultures. Blood borne pathogens are not a friend to you; in fact, Blood borne pathogens can make you very sick. While performing your duties you may be at risk for exposure of the following Blood borne pathogens: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Ordinarily, your healthy, unbroken skin is a barrier to Blood borne diseases. However, when you are scratched or stuck by a bloody needle, lancet or other sharp object, your skin barrier would be broken. Air does not carry Blood borne pathogens; however, splashing or splattering them into your mucous membranes is a possibility for exposure while performing some procedures. It is in your best interest that you use the right barriers to minimize or eliminate your exposure to Blood borne pathogens in your work setting. Hepatitis B Virus is a vaccine-preventable disease that is caused by a virus that attacks the liver. It can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Symptoms can include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, or occasional nausea and vomiting. About one half of those infected with HBV will feel no symptoms at all. With prompt and proper treatment, over 90% of those infected with HBV will recover and clear the infection. If you are stuck with a needle or sharp contaminated with HBV, you have a 6 to 30 percent chance of developing Hepatitis B. However, remember that all employees who may potentially be exposed to Hepatitis B on the job are offered a free vaccine that will protect them from Hepatitis B. Less common than Hepatitis B is Hepatitis C. This, too, is an inflammation of the liver which 85% of the time leads to chronic liver disease. The symptoms are similar to Hepatitis B. Currently there is no vaccine for the prevention of Hepatitis C. There are newly approved antiviral drugs that may be effective in treating some people who have Hepatitis C. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, causes AIDS. HIV causes a breakdown of the immune system, and the clinical picture of HIV infections differs widely from person to person. Some persons remain apparently healthy for many years, while others become seriously ill, develop AIDS, and eventually die. There is no preventive vaccine against HIV. If you are stuck with an HIV-contaminated sharp, your chances of becoming HIV positive are less than 2 percent. Seven ways to minimize your risk of exposure are: 1. Get vaccinated against Hepatitis B before an injury occurs. 2. Engineering controls are designed to eliminate the exposure hazard. Examples are needless IV injection ports, needle-safe syringes, needle-safe venipuncture devices, lancets with retractable blades, face shields or pocket masks with a one-way valve for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and sharps disposal containers. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 36 3. Work as if you and your co-workers lives depend on it. Much of work practice controls are common sense. Listed below are several that should become your standard of practice: Place sharps in a container without recapping, bending, or breaking the used needle. Transport specimens in closed, leak-proof containers. Do not eat and drink, apply cosmetics or handle contact lenses in areas where there is a chance of exposure to potentially infectious materials. Store specimens away from food. Handle contaminated patient equipment with care and clean reusable equipment properly before using it on another patient. 4. Wash your hands with soap and water for 10-15 seconds whenever the following occur: Before you: After you: Prepare or eat food Blow your nose, cough or sneeze Insert of remove contact lenses Use the bathroom Treat a cut or wound Handle garbage Tend to someone who is sick Tend to someone who is sick or injured In addition to the above, when in a patient care setting: After removal of gloves After contact with blood or body fluids Before performing invasive procedure 4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) helps guard your skin, eyes, mouth, and personal clothing from exposure to blood borne pathogens. Your department will provide PPE that is effective for your particular job. This may consist of gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, lab coats, aprons, clinic jackets, and/or masks. 5. Good housekeeping is everyone's responsibility. General rules would include: Clean all blood and body fluid spills promptly. Spill kits are available in your department or through Central Service. Each kit includes instructions, clean up equipment, disinfectant, and PPE necessary to protect you while cleaning up a spill. Keep work surfaces and protective coverings clean. Never use your hands or feet to compact trash or soiled linen. Never pick up potentially contaminated broken glass with your hands. 6. Biohazard labels and/or signs are affixed to containers/bags that store, transport, or are used to ship blood or potentially infectious body fluids. These labels/signs must be orange or orange/red and are used to alert you of a potential hazard if you were to come in contact with the contents of the container/bag and you were not wearing PPE. The risk of infection is real and should be taken seriously. Taking necessary precautions to prevent risks will protect you from blood borne infections. For more information on blood borne pathogens, talk with your supervisor/department manager, or call LLUMC Hospital Epidemiology, extension 66115. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 37 EXPOSURE MONITORING PROGRAM A body fluid exposure can occur if there is an exchange of body fluids into mucous membranes or into skin that has been broken, torn, or pierced. Examples of blood and body fluid exposures include: A puncture with a contaminated needle. A cut or puncture with contaminated instruments. Transmission of blood or body fluids to mucous membranes, such as a splash to the eyes or mouth. If you are exposed to blood or other body fluids, the procedure to follow is: Wash the wound(s) with soap and water or irrigate mucous membranes with water or saline. Report the incident to your supervisor immediately. Fill out two forms: Report of Accident/Illness (Form 20-0032-A) and Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits (Form DWC-1) and have your supervisor sign it. Go to the Emergency Department for medical evaluation The Exposure Monitoring program operates by: Identifying work areas where there is a risk of exposure to blood borne pathogens. Providing education and training on how to prevent an exposure. Evaluating and treating those who have been exposed to blood borne pathogens such as Hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). When reporting an exposure to Blood borne pathogens, both the Report of Accident/Illness and the Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits must be filled out before reporting to the Emergency Department for medical evaluation. FIRE SAFETY Fire can be beautiful - but it can also be destructive. Risley Hall, one of our older university buildings, used to be one story taller than it is today. A fire did so much damage to the top floor that it had to be demolished. Other, smaller fires have also taken place. Late one night, a fire occurred in a patient care unit in the Medical Center. It was extinguished by the sprinkler system and the damage was minimal, but the clean-up was extensive. The bottom line is that everyone needs to be constantly vigilant to stop fires. Prevention: The best way to stop fires is to keep them from getting started. Some of the benefits of preventing fires are we don't have to worry about injury or death from a fire, we won't have to clean up afterwards, and we don't have to listen to the fire alarm! The basic elements that are needed to create a fire are: fuel - combustible materials heat - to get the fuel burning (could be sparks) oxygen - needed for all fires, and the more the merrier! We can prevent fires by keeping these three elements separate. Do not allow fuel to accumulate, e.g. paper, sawdust, dirty linen and oily rags Oxygen cannot be eliminated in very many places, but we can be careful in areas where there is or may be a higher percentage of it than normal. This includes the area around an oxygen tent, cylinder, or oxygen medical gas wall outlet. It also includes the area where substances that are oxidizers are stored, like hydrogen peroxide and chlorine. Keep combustibles and sources of heat or sparks away from these. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 38 The Fire Plan: Since prevention isn't always perfect, everyone needs to know what to do in case a fire does occur. Our basic fire response plan is called \"R.A.C.E.\" or \"the RACE Fire Plan.\" The four main steps you need to take if you find a fire are: RESCUE: Remove anyone who is in immediate danger, including yourself. If people are unable to get out of the room on their own, like hospital patients, assist them if you can. If possible, get someone else's assistance and use a 2 or 3 person carry. If you are by yourself, use a blanket to drag the patient from the room. And be sure to close the door behind you. ALARM: Turn on the alarm. Use the pull box, if your building has one, to get the Fire Department coming and to alert others in the building. Then, using a phone a safe distance from the fire, call 911 to report it to the Security Control Center. Be prepared to give them the specific information about the fire - location, size, number of people injured, etc. In addition to the Fire Department, an emergency response team will be sent, including Security officers, staff from engineering and housekeeping, and Respiratory Care technicians for patient care areas. CONTAIN: Close the rest of the doors in the area to keep the fire and smoke confined. If possible, tuck towels or sheets under the door and around the sides to help keep the smoke from spreading. EXTINGUISH: If you can do so without endangering yourself, fight the fire with an extinguisher. Use the right extinguisher for the type of fire and follow the PASS plan to use it correctly. (See below for information on extinguishers.) Evacuation Procedures: Be prepared to evacuate. If you are within the M.C. or C.M.C., know your horizontal (primary & secondary) relocation points. In most of the other buildings, evacuation should occur when the fire alarm sounds. Know your building evacuation procedures and external relocation points. Assist anybody who has a disability, remembering not to use the elevator unless authorized by Fire Department personnel. Remain outside until the Fire Department says it is safe to re-enter. NOTE: This plan is based on the idea that you are the only one around. If there are others in the area, get them involved, so several steps are being done at the same time. Fire Extinguishers: Before you can fight a fire, you need to know the three classes of fire you would see in normal situations and the kinds of extinguishers that are available. Classes of Fire: - Class A fires occur in combustible solids, like paper, linen, mattresses, clothing. Water puts out Class A fires very nicely. - Class B fires involve flammable liquids, like gasoline, alcohol, and some cleaning fluids. Using water on such fires would just spread the flaming liquid around. - Class C fires involve electrical equipment, such as TV's, computers, and beds with motors in them. Using water on this kind of equipment could get you electrocuted. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 39 Types of Fire Extinguishers: Water - the tall, silver can with a hose contains water under pressure. Good for class A fires only. Carbon dioxide (CO2) - the red extinguisher with the plastic horn contains CO2 under pressure. Good for class B & C fires only. Dry chemical - generally red, may have a hose or just a short nozzle. Usually good for all three classes of fire (A,B,C). Also called multi-purpose extinguishers. This is the kind you will find in most locations. Halon - generally red with a yellow-green label. Primarily for electronic equipment, but good for class B & C fires. If large enough, can also handle class A fires. Usually found only where there is a lot of electronic equipment. To understand how to use a fire extinguisher, you need to know the acronym PASS and what it stands for. When the first three steps of RACE have been taken care of, you are ready to attempt to extinguish the fire - If you can do so without endangering yourself! If the fire is too big, close the door and wait for the guys with the big hoses - the Fire Department. But, if the fire is still small, and if you have a clear exit from the fire in case it does get out of hand, grab the proper fire extinguisher from its cabinet or hook, and follow these steps: PULL the pin. You will have to break the plastic tie that holds it in place. The easiest way is to turn it like a key in a lock. Or give it a good, sharp yank. AIM at the base of the fire. Keep the extinguisher itself upright and point the hose or horn at the fire. If you're using a CO2 extinguisher, let go of the horn - it will stay where you aim it. SQUEEZE the handle. This activates the extinguisher. SWEEP from side to side, covering the whole area that's on fire. Keep this up until you are sure the fire is completely out, or you run out of extinguishing material. If needed, several extinguishers can be used - we have plenty! A hands-on class in the use of extinguishers is held each Fall, and all employees are urged to take it their first year of employment and at least every three years thereafter. Some staff are required to take it every year due to their particular job requirements. Finally, learn and remember the following: RACE and PASS as described previously in this section. Be ready to put them into action right away when needed. Evacuation Plan - Know where your relocation points are and how to evacuate yourself and others. Be ready to assist any visitors, disabled employees or students as needed. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 40 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY Hazardous materials are things that can harm you if you are exposed to them. They can be chemical or biological materials and be found as a solid, liquid or gas. Hazardous materials are found in almost every work environment. Work areas like Housekeeping, Engineering, offices, laboratories, and even patient care can have hazardous materials. Materials are classified by both the manufacturer and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as hazardous if they can burn easily, corrode, or destroy living tissue or metals, cause cancer, react with other materials, or cause an infection or disease. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulates employees' use of and exposure to hazardous materials through our Hazard Communication program. This program gives employees their Right-to-Know information through two main sources of information: labels and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Hazardous materials are required to be labeled appropriately by both OSHA and EPA. The label is your first warning that the material with which you are working is hazardous and why it is hazardous to you. Since there is only a small amount of space on a label, it will give a warning statement to tell you this information. If you see \"Warning,\" \"Caution,\" or \"Danger,\" it means that this material is potentially harmful to your health and safety. Hazardous material labels must include the name of the product, a list of ingredients, the name and address of the manufacturer and a warning statement. MSDS are written by the manufacturer of the product to tell employees the specific hazards with using that product. The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS) and your supervisor are your sources of MSDS. Types of information which can be found on a MSDS are: Hazardous Ingredients - a list of the hazardous components Physical and Chemical Characteristics - boiling point, density, vapor pressure Fire and Explosion Hazards - flash point, firefighting procedures, flammable limits Reactivity - incompatible materials, stability, decomposition products Health Hazards - routes of entry, signs and symptoms of exposure, emergency and first aid procedures Precautions for Safe Handling - spill procedures, storage and handling precautions Control Measures - personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation, safe work practices Hazardous Material Exposures: The best treatment for an exposure to a hazardous material is prevention. By reading the label and MSDS, practicing good housekeeping techniques, using the right PPE and eliminating shortcuts, you can minimize your risk of exposure to the hazardous materials with which you work. However, if you or a co-worker is exposed, follow these steps to reduce the injury. Consult the label and MSDS to identify the material. Decontaminate the affected body part (e.g., eyes, hands) with running water for at least 15 minutes. Report the incident to your supervisor immediately and fill out the right notification forms. Report (with your forms) to the Occupational Health Center or the Emergency Department for medical evaluation and follow-up. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 41 Hazardous Material Spills: Again, prevention is the best way to avoid spilling a hazardous material (see the above section for preventive techniques). If a hazardous material has been spilled, follow these steps to minimize the risk of you and others being exposed to it. Identify the material using the container label and MSDS. Confine or contain the spill. Try to keep it from spreading. Evacuate affected areas in an emergency. For example, the material is giving off vapors and it's difficult to breathe. Use a spill kit for spills of mercury, blood and body fluids, or chemotherapy materials. Spill kits are available from Central Service. If this is a different type of hazardous material and not any of the materials listed above, call the Security Control Center and have the officer page OHMS staff for clean-up. Don't try to clean it up yourself. 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 42 FORMS 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 43 Parking For information on parking, please click on this link: https://lluhparking.aimsparking.com/ 2022 DPT Student Handbook Page - 44 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY STUDENT CONSENT FORM I, , hereby voluntarily agree and consent to the following: (Print Name) (please initial) I understand that while I am enrolled in the Department of Physical Therapy, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University I will be involved in activities that may increase my risk of injury or illness above those associated with everyday activities of daily living.

Some examples of social media include: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, YouTube, Linkedin, Wikipedia, to name a few. Some examples of social media uses include: Blogging about movies, sports, or news events Posting on Facebook Uploading photos on Instagram Sharing videos on YouTube Creating content on a Wiki page Tweeting about current events It's a very natural response to just want to \"post everything\". But not \"everything\" should be posted. Loma Linda University Health and the School of Allied Health Professions would like to help clarify how best to enhance your social media experience while you are at LLU student. Social Media: The Three Rules of Engagement Be smart: Privacy does not exist in social media. Consider what could happen if your post becomes widely known. Search engines can turn up posts years after they are created. Double check your posts for professional content and accuracy. Acting in anger or impulsively could create a lasting impact that you may not want. Just think twice before pressing \"send\". Act Ethically: Remember that your social media activity can impact you both personally and professionally. Posts that put your education or future professional career in a positive light are really the best. Just consider your future before you post. And consider if it is the \"right\" thing to do. Protect Yourself and Others: Be respectful of others by not engaging in careless behavior that could hurt someone. Be sure that your posts or photos represent you and the people, clinical site, and school you're associated with in a professional way. It is important to be aware of FERPA and HIPAA, so that the privacy of patients and fellow students is protected. Acting with respect keeps you and others safe. Social media is a powerful tool. It has the power to make a significant impact, both positive and negative. If you just remember the social media three rules of engagement - be smart, act ethically, and protect yourself and others - and you'll have a great time and engage responsibly.
