But if you eat too fast or consume too much of these foods, you may experience occasional indigestion. Symptoms of indigestion can include uncomfortable abdominal fullness after eating, or you may have pain or a burning sensation in your upper stomach. Indigestion isn't a disease but rather a symptom of other gastrointestinal problems, such as an ulcer, gastritis, or acid reflux. Luckily, getting indigestion relief fast is fairly simple, as long as the condition isn't the result of a chronic, underlying health problem. What helps indigestion fast?

Over-the-Counter Antacids Commercially available antacids are probably the most widely used treatment to get rid of indigestion pain fast.

Because sodium bicarbonate has a high pH, it neutralizes acid in the stomach and can help alleviate bloating, gas, and upper GI discomfort. To use this treatment, mix one-half teaspoon of baking soda in about four ounces of water and drink it. Too much sodium bicarbonate can cause uncomfortable side effects, including stomach cramps, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea. If you choose to use this treatment, you must wait at least two hours between doses. Consuming too much baking soda to treat indigestion can also affect your health, especially if you're older. According to experts, adults under the age of 60 should not consume more than seven-half teaspoons of baking soda in 24 hours. Those over 60 should not have more than three half teaspoons in 24 hours.

Apple Cider Vinegar Some people get indigestion because their stomach doesn't produce enough acid to digest their food properly. If you're one of those people, taking one to two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in water can help get rid of indigestion fast. Because apple cider vinegar is naturally acidic, it can help stimulate your body's production and secretion of stomach acid. With more acid in your stomach, your body can digest your food faster, which can help alleviate the discomfort, bloating, and heartburn associated with indigestion.

Aloe Vera Researchers have found that aloe vera is an effective natural treatment for several symptoms of indigestion, including: - Heartburn - Flatulence - Acid regurgitation - Food regurgitation - Belching - Nausea - Trouble swallowing (dysphagia) Also see: [The Incredible Potato for Vitamins and Minerals](/the-incredible-foods-for-vitamins-and-minerals/) How to Get Rid of Indigestion at Night If you eat dinner too fast or choose foods that are too greasy, fatty, or spicy, you may suffer from indigestion in the evening. Consuming a lot of alcohol at night can also cause stomach inflammation, which may lead to symptoms of indigestion like heartburn, upper abdominal pain, or nausea. To get rid of indigestion at night, you should keep the head of your bed elevated, avoid late-night meals or eating within two hours of bedtime, avoid exercise before bedtime, avoid a nightcap (alcoholic beverage), and no smoking before bedtime.

Elevate Your Upper Body You might feel like laying down and going to sleep, but unfortunately, lying horizontal will only make your indigestion symptoms worse. When you lie down, stomach acid is more likely to travel backward and into your throat, where it can cause serious heartburn pain. To avoid that discomfort, use a few pillows to prop up your upper chest, neck, and head. If possible, it's best to avoid laying down at all if your stomach is still full. Sitting or standing can help your food digest faster and minimize your indigestion symptoms. 10. Take a Warm Bath or Apply a Warm Compress Heat can help ease indigestion by relaxing tension and cramping and alleviating bloating. When you're ready for bed and indigestion strikes, a warm bath will not only help you unwind and get ready for sleep, but it can also provide indigestion relief fast. That's especially true when you combine it with one of the indigestion treatments mentioned above. If you're not a fan of baths and it's the middle of the night, you can also try applying a warm compress or heating pad to your abdominal area to help soothe cramping and pain.
