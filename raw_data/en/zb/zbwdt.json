Graduate Students What happens if a student gets sick in a class I am a TA for? - You are not expected to take any action, other than to help public health officials contact trace others in your class if needed. - It is ok to share any reports of illness or symptoms with the [CSU public health office](http://www.ehs.colostate.edu/WPublicH/Home.aspx), if you believe they may not be aware of the student's situation. Otherwise, please protect their private medical information. - Continue to remind students in your class follow public health orders: wear a mask, disinfect their desk or table and chairs and other shared equipment, and maintain physical distancing. Remote committee meetings, exams, and defenses The Graduate School encourages all graduate student committee meetings, exams, and defenses be held remotely by web-based video conferencing (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom, other) for the Summer 2021 semester. If held in-person, everyone in attendance must follow the required [public health precautions](https://covidrecovery.colostate.edu/fall-semester-preparations-and-measures/). General assignment classrooms are prioritized for in-person course instruction and will not be available for graduate committee meetings, exams, and defenses. How do I do my oral exam or defense? Graduate students may hold their final exam in in-person, hybrid, or remotely. Please consult with your advisor to determine the format type for your exam. Here is a link from the grad school for remote defenses and email submission of forms: [https://graduateschool.colostate.edu/safety/](https://graduateschool.colostate.edu/safety/) Reach out to Kathy at [kathy.lucas@colostate.edu](mailto:kathy.lucas@colostate.edu) with questions. Send all grad forms via email to Kathy. Kathy will check the forms for accuracy and then forward to the Chair for signature. Once signed, they will be returned to you so you can forward to Grad School. All emails to Grad School need to come from a CSU email address. Here are guidelines for remote defenses: [https://graduateschool.colostate.edu/covid19/](https://graduateschool.colostate.edu/covid19/) What is the signature process for preliminary & final dissertation defenses? Either the advisor or Kathy Lucas will collect all the emails from a defense. The email should state how you participated and if it is a pass. To be consistent, Kathy will collect all the emails and then forward to the graduate school with the appropriate form. The student will prepare the form and email to Kathy. See the graduate school notes below: The department coordinator or advisor will help collect scanned signatures and/or email approvals for Graduate School forms. Once all approvals/votes are received, the coordinator or advisor will send the Graduate School one email, attaching a PDF of the GS form and its corresponding email approvals. - For all Graduate School forms: All email correspondence accepted in place of original signatures must come from a colostate.edu email account. - For GS16s and GS24s: In lieu of scanned signatures, committee members can send an email stating how they participated and how they voted (pass or fail). Forms may be submitted within five (5) business days. Undergraduate Students Who do I contact/where do I go for advising questions?

We want to support your college experience to the best of our abilities during this outstanding time. How and when will I be able to access CLeRC? We will be moving to a Canvas-based virtual CLeRC ( [Chemistry Learning Resource Center](https://www.chem.colostate.edu/facilities/clerc-chemistry-learning-resource-center/)) that should be relatively easy to connect for students. Anyone at CSU with Canvas credentials can self-enroll using this link: [https://colostate.instructure.com/enroll/7PAGDX](https://colostate.instructure.com/enroll/7PAGDX). Once someone is enrolled, it will appear in their list of active Canvas courses. This means anyone can click directly and they won't need to enter individual Canvas sections to access office hours or chemistry learning resources. For questions specific to CLeRC, please contact [Ben Reynolds](https://www.chem.colostate.edu/person/?id=A4A7C54F01F1FBEBEB1F08789EC935AB&sq=t). Who do I contact for questions? Research-related questions/concerns should be funneled to [Amber Krummel](https://www.chem.colostate.edu/person/?id=B07433407FC98CA80682F83272725A4E&sq=t), Associate Chair. Who do I contact for research safety questions? Safety questions should be funneled to [Chuck Henry](https://www.chem.colostate.edu/person/?id=A345C49497A657481C5018AA761ABCE3&sq=t), chair of the safety committee. What guidelines should I follow in the lab? - Masks are required indoors unless in a space alone. - Laboratory occupancy has returned to 100%. - Researchers must take appropriate training and provide informed consent before they can work in the lab. - Researchers will wear appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) when they are working on campus, including face masks. - Researchers will follow current public health guidelines as outlined [here](https://covid.colostate.edu/pandemic-preparedness-team-broad-guidance-for-all-summer-and-fall-2021-activities/). - Researchers who feel ill will not come into the lab; they will self-quarantine and report appropriately to their supervisor. They fill out the [COVID Reporter](https://covid.colostate.edu/reporter/)and follow directions from CSU Public Health. Additional general guidance Practices that will be in place across the Chemistry Department community during the initial phases of reopening the research enterprise under CSU COVID workforce restrictions: - Personal protection equipment - All workers will wear facemasks in buildings where masks are required, including but not limited to hallways, stairwells, bathrooms, laboratories, and multi-worker office spaces. There is some leeway for taking masks off in single-use spaces like faculty/staff offices, but that is the exception, not the rule. Researchers will not wear gloves outside of the laboratories in keeping with safety protocols maintained by the Department of Chemistry Safety Committee. Instead workers will wash their hands often with soap for 20 seconds. - Disinfectants and sanitization\u2014All Faculty and unit managers will order disinfectants and hand sanitizer for personnel to use in the laboratories and offices through the Chemistry Department Point of Contact (POC), Stockroom Manager Ben Shupe. The POC will order the appropriate disinfectant and hand sanitizer from university-approved sources. - Use of cameras - Historically we have kept cameras out of labs but allowed them in hallways and other public parts of Chemistry space under limited conditions. Some have expressed well-intended interest to include lab cameras to improve safety for researchers working alone. We do not recommend such use, both because of privacy concerns and the fact that such use cannot improve safety unless someone is constantly watching the video in real time. Notwithstanding, use for monitoring equipment (e.g., instruments, gauges, gloveboxes) might be warranted in some cases, if described by PIs in section D.3. of the safety plan. - ADA compliance - Asking employees if they are immuno-compromised or have a chronic condition is a disability-related inquiry subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) restrictions. If an employee voluntarily discloses a specific medical condition or disability that puts them at increased risk of influenza or covid complications, this information must be kept confidential. All health information will be maintained as confidential medical records. - Common spaces - Lounges and kitchen-type areas will be closed or have strict use limitations, to be updated by the department as necessary. - Worker occupancy indicators - All internal window coverings that are put up only for privacy will be removed. Additional possibilities are listed here, including but not limited to: adding signs (e.g., hanging on doorknobs) indicating presence of a researcher in lab; physical or electronic in/out lists. Note: the research restart working group has indicated that all rooms with hoods/specialized ventilation must keep doors closed. When can I access the stockroom?
