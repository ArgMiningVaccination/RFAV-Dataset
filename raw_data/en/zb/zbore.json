ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"S1B(R1) Addendum to S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals.\" The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The final guidance expands the testing scheme for assessing human carcinogenic risk of pharmaceuticals by introducing an additional approach that is not described in the original S1B Guideline. The final guidance is intended to offer an integrative approach that provides specific weight of evidence criteria that inform whether a 2-year rat study is likely to add value in completing a human carcinogenicity risk assessment. The Addendum also adds a plasma exposure ratio-based approach for setting the high dose in the rasH2-Tg mouse model, while all other aspects of the recommendations for high-dose selection in ICH guidance for industry \"S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals\" still apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background FDA is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"S1B(R1) Addendum to S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals.\" The guidance was prepared under the auspices of ICH. ICH has the mission of achieving greater regulatory harmonization worldwide to ensure that safe, effective, high-quality medicines are developed, registered, and maintained in the most resource-efficient manner. By harmonizing the regulatory requirements in regions around the world, ICH guidelines have substantially reduced duplicative clinical studies, prevented unnecessary animal studies, standardized the reporting of important safety information, standardized marketing application submissions, and made many other improvements in the quality of global drug development and manufacturing and the products available to patients. The six Founding Members of the ICH are the FDA; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; the European Commission; the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare; and the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The Standing Members of the ICH Association include Health Canada and Swissmedic. Additionally, the Membership of ICH has expanded to include other regulatory authorities and industry associations from around the world (https://www.ich.org/). ICH works by involving technical experts from both regulators and industry parties in detailed technical harmonization work and the application of a science-based approach to harmonization through a consensus-driven process that results in the development of ICH guidelines. The regulators around the world are committed to consistently adopting these consensus-based guidelines, realizing the benefits for patients and for industry. As a Founding Regulatory Member of ICH, FDA plays a major role in the development of each of the ICH guidelines, which FDA then adopts and issues as guidance for industry. FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, they describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. In the Federal Register of October 5, 2021 (86 FR 54982), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guidance entitled \"S1B(R1) Addendum to S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals.\" The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit comments by December 6, 2021. After consideration of the comments received and revisions to the guideline, a final draft of the guideline was submitted to the ICH Assembly and endorsed by the regulatory agencies on August 4, 2022. The final guidance provides guidance on expanding the testing scheme for assessing human carcinogenic risk of pharmaceuticals by introducing an additional approach that is not described in the original S1B Guideline and also adds a plasma exposure ratio-based approach for setting the high dose in the rasH2-Tg mouse model. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance issued on October 5, 2021. This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 While this guidance contains no collection of information, it does refer to previously approved FDA collections of information. Therefore, clearance by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) is not required for this guidance. The previously approved collections of information are subject to review by OMB under the PRA. The collections of information in 21 CFR part 312 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0014; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 314 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0001.
