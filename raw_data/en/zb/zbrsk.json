This spawned the entire class of life-saving antibiotics. There are over 100,000 species within the broad catego ry of fungi, of which the penicillin mold is one, and there are 38,000 species of mushrooms. Clinical research today continues to document the health benefits of select fungi. These fungi survive and thrive upon the decay of the forest floor through their dual power of self-protection and self-transformation. Over millions of years, mushrooms have successfully adapted to an environment replete with threatening microbial agents by developing natural substances that prevent bacteria and viruses from replicating inside their cells. Unlike other plants that, dazzling green with chlorophyll, synthesize nutrients from the radiant sun, the crimson, tawny , and inky mushrooms flourish by a different mechanism. While plants absorb carbon dioxide and liberate oxygen, mushrooms mimic human respiration by captivating oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. In keeping with forest ecology , plants then reuse this carbon dioxide to manufacture their food. By dischar ging enzymes into the matter upon which they feed, fungi break down complex carbohy drates and proteins into simpler compounds. This process of decomposition enriches the soil and makes essential substances available to plants in a form they can absorb. But unlike humans who need light and fresh food, mushrooms feed on moist decaying organic matter in deep shade\u2014they are the grand recyclers. Within the body , a few medici nal mushrooms seem able to transmute metabolic waste and neutralize toxic accumulations without provoking eliminative catharsis as a consequence. They are a safe and effective medicament that has been valued over thousands of years of human civilization.Taoist sages relied on their own observations to draw conclusions that today we test in laboratories. Twenty-two centuries ago, Emperor Ti instructed a fleet of ships to sail the Eastern seas in search of the Ganoderma (Ling zhi or Reishi) mushroom because it was believed to confer not only long life, but immortality . Chinese herbal texts suggest that the Ling zhi sharpens memory and mental capacity , awaken s the spirit, calms the mind, opens the breath, strengthens the heart, protec ts the liver, increases stamina and enduranc e and helps the body resist falling prey to the demons of age and illness. Mushrooms provide a link for us with these Taoist sages of ancient China who leaned on reishi-carved staffs and also used these mushrooms as spiritual aids\u2014as foods presum ed to foster enlightenment. In the mythic story , Alice in Wonderland, Alice ate one mushroom to make her larger, and another to maker her smaller , opening the windows of her imagination so that she could enter another dimension, a magical kingdom. Paul Unschuld, scholar of Chinese medical history , inform s us that fifteen centuries ago the classic pharmacopeia known as the Pen Tsao devoted its first monograph on a single herb to the Divine Fungus, Ling zhi. It was said to relieve the body of its material weight, prolong life, and transform the consumer into a supranatural being. Today we can still share in the subtle, barely palpable mind-altering properties of reishi that attracted the Taoists. By analogy , just as young mushrooms feed on decomposing forest debris, so it seems that in the human body they assist in the neutralization of psychic waste and recycle such negativity into mental clarity and optimist. These mushrooms were regarded as sacred agents that elevate the spirit, helping people to transcend the gross materi al world and gain perspective on the grand scheme of the 10,000 myriad things. Ingesting these mushrooms today can give us a taste of the state of mind whereby we experience illumin ated detachment, enabling us to act on the stage and observe from the audience simultaneously\u2014better realizing our destiny by remem bering that the health of our spirit is not merel y dependent on the vigor of our body or that spiritual purpose is not merely equated with material achievement. These mushrooms have not changed much over the millennia, nor has the human quest. We can experiment with them in our pursuit of physi cal and transcendent healing. They provide a way for us tocommune with the Taoists, to taste the same flavors, and savor the same longings of our collective soul. Harriet Beinfield Co-author Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese MedicineA c k n o w l e d g e m e n t s In writing this book, I am delig hted to share my personal expe rience in collecting, study ing, eating, and using fungi as medicine for nearly 20 years. I have also combed the historical and modern scientific literature available in libraries throughout the U.S., such as the C.G. Lloy d collection on fungi at the Lloyd Library , the Boston Medical Library , and several University of California libraries, as well as a number of European libraries. I am grateful to the library staffs of these institutions for their invaluable help and insight. A work of this complexity is, by necessity , a team effort. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to Michael Miovic, our super -editor, who has worked with us since 1988, until going on to medical school. Many thanks also to Ken Jones , who made an important contribution to this work through his own knowledge of medicinal fungi, critical editing, and literature collection. It was a pleasure to work with him\u2014his professionalism and attention to details are inspiring. Ken has the heart of a research warrior . My dedicated research assistan t, Patty Baker , has put many hours into this book, organizing literature, abstracting articles, checking references, and helping to move the project along when it got bogged down. Heartfelt thanks to David Arora, Dr. Varro Tyler, and Dr. Subhuti Dharmananda for reading the manuscript and providing important insights and corrections. I cannot put into writing what Beth, my partner , has contributed to this book\u2014from editing to literature organization, help with literature acquisition, and especially moral support. I translated articles and books from German with the help of my teacher , Shanti Coble, for whom I give many thanks for her patience and wonderful knowledge of scientific German. Since I don't read Chinese, most of the Chinese studies quoted in this work were gathered from Chemical Abstracts, Abstracts of Chinese Medicines (Chang and But, 1986-1988), Pharmacology and Applications of Chinese Materia Medica (Chang and But, 1987), The Fungi Pharmacopeia (Bo and Yun-sun, 1980), and Icones of Medicinal Fungi From China (Yinget al, 1987), as well as on-line searches of the NAPRALER T database and MEDLINE. My admiration and heart-felt thanks to the researchers and translators who helped to make this information accessible. Also, my deep appreciation for the rich cultural experience and love of fungi that come from China, Japan, Russia, France, and all other countries where mushrooms are known and loved for their spirit, as well as their value as food and medicine. W e have just begun to understand the riches they hold. It is my respons ibility to check and recheck the factual statements and references in this book, so any errors, as well as wild theories, are mine alone.Sources, Historical and Scientific A few words here are necessary about the quality and credibility of the various sources of information drawn upon in writing this book. As a reader of many herbal and health-rela ted books, I am often frustrate d when the writer does not mention the sources drawn upon. I hope this information is helpful when considering what personal value Medicinal Mushrooms may provide to you, the reader . I extensively reviewed literature from the three following primary sources: 1. The historical record: written works from ancient Egyptian medicine and ancient Chinese medicine through the end of the 19th century , including folk uses and medical uses. 2. Clinical reports from the 20th century: written reports from clinicians of all types who have used medicinal mushrooms in their practices. 3. Scientific studies: organized laboratory studies in vitro, where various organisms (such as bacteria) or cells (such as human immune cells) were exposed to mushroom extract s to observe their influence, or in vivo laboratory or clinical studies with animals or humans, either controlled or uncontrolled. It is sometimes difficult to judge the quality of these diverse reports and studies when one was not involv ed in the actual study or is unfamiliar with the credibility of the original observer or reporter . Thus, this present work does not pretend to offer a critical review of the literature in the sense of evaluating each report or study and commenting on its methodology or conclusions, except as it pertains to the possible use of a species. As for the histor ical literature, I have chosen works from the Institute for Natural Products library which most epitomize the written record of herbal use throughout the ages. For instance, the works of Hippocrates, Dioscorides, the Pen T'sao, Gerard, Parkinson, and the Eclectics were reviewed for relevant informa tion on medicinal mushrooms. Obviously many of the historical uses for mushrooms are very general and often based on a specific aspect of the appearance of a species (such as the phenomenally phallic stinkhorn). The theory that some morphological characteristic of a plant or other substance might give clues to its medicinalactivity is called the \"doctrine of signatures.\" A good example is the leafy lichen called lungwort that has the appearance of lung tissue and was said to be good for the lungs. It should be noted that some remedies, the activities of which may have been conceived under this doctrine, later proved to be active. The lungwort, Lobaria pulmonaria , for instance contains lichen acids that inhibit the growth of Pneumococcus organisms and mucilage to soothe inflamed membranes. It has also happened that some purported uses of medicinal agents originated or amplified by superstition or rumor were subsequently passed on as fact. While traveling and teaching, I often hear ridiculous statements from unknown origins that appear to have been passed on by word of mouth. A good example is the notion that ginseng is for men only, and the blood-moving and tonifying herb dong quai is exclusively for women. According to Traditional Chines e Medicine or the age-old tradit ional use of these herbs, this idea is simply not true. Scientific reports and studies on medicinal mushrooms come mainly from China, Japan, Germany , the United States, and Europe. As can be seen from a review of the bibliography of Medicinal Mushrooms, most of the laboratory and clinical studies were performed in China and Japan. The way in whic h these studies were designed, the care in which they were performed, and the data gathered and evaluated vary widely among research groups. In general, Japanese studies more closely follow accepted western protocols for scientific testing and evaluation, and the instrumentation available to the researchers is often of good design and quality . In China, the quality of the studies and instrumentation is much more variable. There the control group and the process of blinding and \"crossing-over\" the experimental groups, which attempt to eliminate the influence of the beliefs of the experimenters and volunt eers on the results, are often not considered as important as in the West. This is beginning to change, but many of the studies on medicinal mushroom s performed in China are not controlled in any way. They are more like clinical reports, in that a group of researchers give mushroom extracts to a number of patients (sometimes many patients) and the overall results noted. The placebo effect is often not considered in evaluating the results of a study , perhaps because in China, the way in which the mind or emotions affect the body is accepted as a legitimate part of the results.When evaluatin g a study , it is also important to note whether the experiment was performed in vitro or in vivo. If an in vitro study shows a plant extract to have activity , for instance a cancer -inhibiting effect, there is no certainty that the extract will be useful in treating or preven ting human cancers. For one thing, the extract may be too toxic. Whether the study was performed on animals or humans, and whether the dose was orally administered (p.o.) or given by injection, intraperitoneally (i.p.), or intramuscularly (i.m.) is also relevant. It is not certain what the significance of many of the therapeutic results or toxicological effects noted in studies with animals have in human medicine, and if an herbal extract shows positive results when administered by injection, it does not necessarily mean that it will be active when taken orally . Keeping the above discussion in mind, I invite the reader to use her or his own discretion and imagination when evaluating the possible uses and future potential, whether in medicine in general or for personal use, of the many species of mushrooms presented in this work. It is not my intention to raise false hopes that some of the species reviewed can cure any disease, especially serious chronic diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer , and AIDS. These diseases\u2014in fact all diseases\u2014are a result of the influences of one's lifestyle, diet, belief system, genetic predisposition, as well as many environmental influences. In my view , medicinal mushrooms show promise as part of an overall treatment plan for a number of ailments, but they are not magic bullets. They have a long history of use in many cultures and a fair amount of scientific investigation to their credit. I leave it up to the reader and to future investigation and experience to clarify more exactly what their role is in the treatment of disease. In this book, I see my job as presenting the world's literature\u2014which is vast\u2014in an organized way, attem pting to eliminate redundant and irrelevant information, so that the reader can gain an insight into the whole sweep and scope of the human record on medicinal mushrooms and what our healing relationship to them might be. I also will attempt to provide practical information that will enable the reader to try some of the species generally considered as safe for themse lves. Each user of herbs is part of the tremendously long and valued association of plants and people. Though of course vastly limit ed compared with the scope of human experience with medicinal mush rooms, I also add my own experience andinsight througho ut this work. For over twenty years, I have eaten or used as teas many of the species covered, as well as identifying them in the field. My vision for future editions of this work is a process of continued gathering of new information from the literature, the addition of further clinical experience, and the addition of personal experience from other cultures who use medicinal mushrooms. My interest and love of mushrooms and healing is a lifelong passion that, if I am so blessed, I will continue. The Chanterelle , from An Encyclopedia of Gardening by George Nicholson, cir ca 1887.Intr oduction Mushrooms have been valued throughout the world as both food and medicine for thousands of years. Throughout the world, many people enjoy hunting for wild mushrooms, delighting in the variety of shapes, sizes, and colors exhibited by these \"flowers of the fall.\" Europeans have always appreciated the gastronomic value of wild mushrooms. In Japan, pushcart vendors on the streets still sell medicinal mushrooms to the average citizen who uses them to maintain health and promote longevity . Some Japanese people have even been said to travel hundreds of miles in order to collect wild mushrooms that only grow on very old plum trees\u2014such as the Reishi \u2014renowned as a cure for cance r and degenerative diseases. Likewise, for over 3,000 years the Chinese have used and revered many fungi for their health-giving properties, especially tonics for the immune syste m (Liu and Bau, 1980; Yun-Chang, 1985). To the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria a number of fungi became an important part of their mythology and medical practice (Oso, 1977). Mushrooms may also be the perfect food for staying trim and healthy . A recent \"letter from the editor\" in the Nutrition Action newsletter (September , 1994) from the Center for Science in the Public Interest mentioned that up to 1/3 of the U.S. population are overweight. Because fats occur in mushrooms in minor amounts, especially compared with protein and carbohydrates, and the fatty fraction consists predominantly of unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, they may be the perfect food for losing weight and mainta ining a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. When it comes to mushrooms, most Americans and inhabitants of the British Isles are rather ignorant. Many people in the United States have a distinct dislike, even a fear, of fungi\u2014a phenomenon that may be called \"fungophobia\"\u2014a term coined by Hay (1887). Rolfe and Rolfe wrote about the distinctly unsavory view of which the British view mushrooms and mushroom hunters, in their delightful Romance of the Fungus W orld (1925). Generally , the first association wild mushrooms bring to mind here is \"poisonous.\" The principal edible mushroom most Americans know is thebland Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Sing., or \"button mushroom\" found in supermarkets. It has little flavor and negligible medicinal value compared with other wild species. In fact, it can even be unhealthful in the sense that it may be heav ily sprayed with malathion and other pesticides (many commercially cultivated mushrooms are among the most heavily sprayed items in the vegetable section). Happily , howev er, there are signs that these narrow-minded attitudes in the United State s and England are changing and catching up with the rest of the world. The spreading popularity of natural foods is one factor that has helped reawaken interest in mushrooms and mushroom-hunting. Another factor is the recent growth of the mushroom-export business, which has been boosted by troubles in Europe. Due to acid rain, sprawling development, and industrial accidents such as the one at Chernobyl, millions of acres of mushroom habitat in Europe and Russia have been disturbed, and many species of wild mushrooms are becoming scarce (Cherfas, 1991). Europe imports thousands of pounds of chanterelles and boletus each year. The high price these traditional gastronomic delights bring creates a good supplementary income for knowledgeable gatherers in the United States. Indeed, wild or home cultivation may soon become viable cottage industries in the Pacific Northwest, which has the forest habitats and substantial rainfall needed for such ventures. Cultivation as a home business may be preferab le to the recent problems that are surfacing in the Pacific Northwest among professional and itinerant pickers alike\u2014namely squabbling over mushroom patches on public lands. A newspaper article told of teams of professional pickers using walkie-talkies to coordinate harvests and mentioned that they can become upset when other pickers stray into what they consider their turf. In response to the increased harvesting press ure, quotas were recently set in the Mt. Hood National Forest (McRae, 1993). For books and supplies for the cultivation of edible and medicinal mushrooms, see the appendix. Finally , Japanese products containing LEM, a polysaccharide-ric h extract from the shiitake mushroom, and similar extracts from maitake are currently under going trials in Japan and the U.S. to test their effectiveness in treatin g vario us forms of cancer. They show promise for treating people suffering from various forms of cancer and AIDS and are currently instrong demand in Japan. Com mercial shiitake cultivators in the U.S., Canada, and in parts of Asia are decidedly interested in this new potential market and are starting large cultivation efforts, hoping the demand will continue to grow as further scientific studies are conducted. At present, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products from mushrooms may be worth more than 1.2 billion dollars U.S. I have written this book in the hopes that it will stimulate interest in the vital and fascinating field of medicinal fungi. Please note that this book is divided into two parts: the first part presents some general background about what fungi are, summarizes the history and use of medicinal fungi, and gives practical instructions on how to use them. It is writte n mostly in simple terms that should be understandable to the lay reader . For unfamiliar terms, see the Glossary of Terms on page 202. The second part, on the other hand, is detailed and technical, covering the botany , chemistry , pharmacology , clinical studies, indications, and dosages of medicinal fungi commonly avail able in the United States, Asia, Europe, and other parts of the world. It is intended primarily for researchers, writers, health practitioners and scientists, though it may also be useful for the lay reader with a strong interest in a partic ular mushroom. Here, one can find specific details on how to use many species of fungi for medicine and maintenance of health. In any case, whether you are new to the field of medicinal mushrooms, or a veteran mushroom-picker , there should be plenty of valuable information in this book that is appropriate for your needs and interests.M The Botany of Fungi any people feel a little unea sy when they first learn that a mushroom is a fungus. The word fungus often brings to mind unsalutary growths such as athlete's foot, the blue and green molds that grow on citrus fruits, the fuzzy white stuff on stale bread, or the mildew that thrives in dirty showers. Farmers and people who live in agricultural areas have also heard about the fungal parasite s that can devastate food crops such as corn, rice, wheat, and rye. So what does the familiar umbrella-shaped mushroom have to do with these fearsome fungi, and how could fungi possibly be medicinal? Actually , mushr ooms are just one of the many kinds of fungi. The fungi are a unique group of organisms that occupy a kingdom all to themselves, the Kingdom Fungi. Scientists have named some 100,000 different species of fungi (plus many more have yet to be classified) and divide d these into two major divisions, Mastigomycota and Amastigomycota. Mastigocycota are a large group of fungi that produce non-sexual motile zoospor es, which make it possible for them to thrive and reproduce in damp or wet environments. The water molds that attack dead fish, plants, and insects in a pond environme nt are members of this division. These fungi are not used for medicine or food and will not be considered further here. The other division of fungi, the Amastigomycota, is a large and diverse group that does not produce a motile stage and is not usually adapted to an aquatic environment. This group does contain all the edible and medicinal fungi, and consists of four subdivisions: the Zygomycotina are saprophytic, which means they grow on other plants and sometimes animals, rather than derive nutrients from a host as parasites do. Among this group is the genus Rhizopus , which includes black bread mold and the mold that grows on cooked soybeans to make the traditional Asian food tempeh. Other members are commercially important becau se they are used to produce alcohol, pigments, and steroids. the Ascomycotina, or \"sac fungi\", (ascomycetes) is the largest group of fungi, containing nearly 2,000 genera. Organisms such as yeasts, mildews, the cup fungi, ergot, and the edible and medicinal morels and truffles belong here. Many ascomycetes grow on decaying plant debris. the Basidiomycotina, or \"club fungi\" (basidiomycetes), consists of at least 15,000 known species. This important edible and medicinal group includes the jelly fungi, smuts, the polypores, puf fballs, and the majority of the fleshy fungi that produce a visible \"fruiting body\" or basidiocarp. the \"Fungi Imperfecti\" (deuteromycetes), is a miscellaneous group of about 15,000 species whose sexual phase (if any) is unknown. It is a somewhat haphazard assemblage of left-over taxa that are hard to place anywhere else. This group includes the famous Penicillium genus (Wallace, 1991). See the excellent textbook Fundamentals of the Fungi (Moore- Landecker , 1990) for further information on the biology and taxonomy of the fungi. The two subdivisions we will look closely at in this book are the Ascomycotina and the Basidiomycotina. The Ascomycotina are called \"sac fungi\" because they produce sac-shaped capsules that release spores, which are carried away by wind or water and eventually settle on the ground and grow into new mature organisms . Many tiny sacs are contained in the bowl- shaped fruiting body of an Ascomycete. The Ascomycotina include the familiar truffles, green and blue citrus molds, ergot (a parasite of rye and other grains that we will discuss again later), and the Cordyceps genus, which is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine.Fig. 1: Spor e production in a Basidiomycete. The Basidiomyc otina, for their part, are called \"club fungi\" because their spores are attached to club-sh aped structures named basidia (basidium means \"club\" in Latin). What are commonly called \"mushrooms\" are the fruiting bodies of Basid iomycetes and certain Ascomycetes. Fruiting bodies are repro ductive structures that grow above ground to release spores. Many fleshy fungi release spores from flat, plate-like structures called gills (see Fig. 1 ), but polypores release them from hollow tubes or pores (see Fig. 2 ). The main body of a mushroom, however , is a threadlike network called a mycelium that grows underground or in wood. It is the mycelium that breaks down complex molecules (like cellulose or lignan in trees) and absorbs food from the environment (see Fig. 3 ). Fig. 2: Spor e production in a polypor e ycotina have demonstrated antitumor activity , and several have also been found to have antibiotic, antiviral, antialler gic, and immunostimulating properties, as well as the ability to lower blood sugar , blood lipids (such as cholester ol), and blood pressure (Lindequist et al, 1990). Fungi resemble plants in that they cannot move on their own, and they have cell walls. Yet fungi are not really plants as we generally think of them \u2014their cell walls are composed of chitin, not cellulose, and they do not carry out photosynthesis. Instead, fungi must absorb food and nutrients from their surroundings, simil ar to bacteria. They do this by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment and then absorbing the products of digestion. Saprophytic fungi are critical in nature, because they decompose and recycle dead matter such as trees, animals, and any other organic residues. This returns nitrogen, phosphorous, and other mineral nutrients to the soil. Fig. 3: Mycelium absorb food fr om the envir onment. However , many fungi are symbi onts. For example, it has been found that fungi in the soil associate with the roots of about 90% of plants, helping them to obtain vital nutrients. This association is called mycorr hizae from myco= akin to fungus and rhiza= root. As the mycelia of fungi grow through the soil like a net of fingers, they absorb and concentrate nutrients, such as phosphorous, and water . Then, when the mycelia wrap around plant roots, even entering the plant's cells, the plant can absorb these concentratednutrients straight from the fungus. Thus, the plants' absorptive capabilities are greatly increased. In return, the fungus can absorb complex compounds that the plant makes, such as sugars and amino acids. Thus both the plant and the fungus benefit. Signifi cantly , studies have demons trated that soil deprived of fungi produces stunted, weak plant growth or none at all (Wallace, 1991) and thus this association is extremely important for the health of the forest. Trees that are cultivated in sterilized soil (formerly a common forestry practice) have been shown to grow much more slowly and are not as healthy as trees growing in a soil rich with fungi and other microor ganisms, which are naturally present with the recyc ling of old decaying wood from previous generations of trees. Thus the cycle of life goes on and is self-sustaining. Fungi can also be helpful to people. Two species in the Penicillium genus, P. roquefortii and P. camembertii , are used to flavor the famous cheeses that bear those same names, and Rhizopus oligosporus grows through cooked soybeans to produce tempeh (Hesseltine & Wang, 1986). Of course the antibiotic penicillin is also made from the Penicillium genus, and Asper gillus oryzae is used to flavor soy sauce and help ferment saki. Yeasts, which are single-celled fungi, make ethyl alcohol and C02 as waste products. They manufacture the alcohol in beer and wine, and their C02 makes bread rise and gives some beverages their fizz. Cyclosporine, a product of the soil fungi, Cylindr ocarpon lucidum Booth and Trichoderma polysporum, is an immunosuppressant that is widely used today in organ- transplant operations. By safely suppressing the immune response, it allows the body to \"accept\" a foreign organ that would otherwise be rejected (Reynolds, 1982). One last fungus I will mention here is Candida albicans , which is a yeast-like imper fect fungi. It is notorious for causing overgrowth in the mouth of newborns (thrush) and vaginal infections. People often develop C. albicans infectio ns after prolonged use of antibiotics, which destroy the many beneficial bacteria and fungi that live on and in the body . With these symbiotic organisms gone, the antibiotic- resistant C. albicans has no competition for food and starts to overgrow . That is one more reason to maintain a strong immune syste m in the first place, to obviate the need for antibiotics. Fortunately , many of the fungi in this book help strengthen theimmune respon se and have been successfully used to treat C. albicans infections. I have spent some time presentin g general background information about fungi because these organisms are often poorly understood. As you can see, fungi come in an extraordinary variety of sizes and types, ranging from single-celled yeasts, to powder -like molds, to giant woody conks. And they affect plants and people in both beneficial and harmful ways. Let's take a look now at how fungi have been used in medicine in various cultures. Please note that because the nomenclature or formal names (binomials) of mushrooms vary widely with the systems of classification followed by past authors, it is easy to becom e confused when reading older works on fungi. For the most part I have followed the system of nomenclature used in North American Polypor es (Gilbertson and Ryvarden, 1986), and David Arora has kindly reviewed the nomenclatural assignments for this and all other groups of fungi used in this book. As an aid for deciph ering older names in other works on fungi or medicinal herbs, I have included a taxonomic history with authorities (when available). The authori ty who first described a species is usually added to the end of the Latin binomial the first time the name occurs, but not with subsequent occurren ces. In this book, the authorities are also included in the main headings for individual mushroom mono graphs, as well as in the comprehensive Table 12 on page 189.A History of Use Western Medicine lthough fungi have been used medicinally in a variety of ways in the West, this use has not been as extensive as in Asia. The ancient Greek s used relatively few species as medicine, and that trend continued in Europe through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Nevertheless, in reviewing the writings of the ancients, there are a few mushrooms that were widely popular for food and medicine. In this discussion, I will review the works of the four majo r ancient Greek writers on materia medica medicine\" who flourished aroun d 455 B.C., mentions fungi as being used for moxa to stimulate specific points in serious chronic illness associated with the kidney , like dropsy (Potter , 133), and sciatica (Potter , 249), surprisingly similar to using moxa treatment on meridian points in Traditional Chinese Medicine (Potter , 133). Pliny (ca. 23-78 A.D.), the great compiler of ancient lore on natural history , mention s a number of fungi in his writings, but it is difficult to determine what species he was talking about\u2014most of them are simply placed under the general name \"mushroom\" or \"Agaricum .\" These are identified by Jones and Andrews (1956) as Boletus (probably Suillus sp.). It is probablethat fungi with similar appearance within the two groups were not well differentiated. For instance, under the heading of Agaricum , a white fungus that grew on trees was taken in a dose of four obole (4.7 gram), crushed in oxymel (vinegar and honey) (Jones VII, 213). A similar species which was of two kinds (male and female) growing in Gaul was said to be weake r, tasting at first sweet and then bitter . These characteristics are similar to those of Fomitopsis officinalis , a likely suspec t, given its singular popularity in the ancient world. As can be seen in Table 1 below , the Agaricum most definitely qualifies as a panacea! If even a fraction of the activity ascribed to it is true, modern science may find a fruitful area of research. Perhaps this fungi is a forerunner of the modern adaptogen, an herb which is reported to support adrenal function, build endurance, counteract the deleterious effects of stress, regulate body processes (such as blood sugar), calm the nerves, balance the hormones, and strengthen the immune system (Brekhman, 1980; Farnsworth et al, 1985). Dioscorides, a physician in Nero 's army (55 A.D.), was the author of the most widely used herbal of all times\u2014 De Materia Medica. This work stood the test of time\u2014it was considered the absolute authority for over 1700 years! Dioscorides reflects the low esteem in which fungi seem to be often held in the ancie nt world\u2014 he says of them in general that they are difficult to digest, often poisonous, and he mentions that \"they grow amongst rusty nails or rotten rags, or ye holes of serpents, or amongst trees properly bearing harmful fruits.\" The only fungus that seemed to have any kind of reputation as a healing medicine was the \"Agaric\" (Agaricon). The nature of this widely used species was not well understood in ancient times\u2014 Dioscorides places it first under the section entitled \"Roots,\" though to his credit, he does mention that some observers thought it to \"grow in the stocks of trees of rottennesse, as the mushrumps.\" Galen, the prolific late Greek medical practitioner and writer (130-200 A.D.), mentions that mushrooms are \"cold and moist\" in nature, though Fomitopsis officinalis was said by Gerard to be hot and dry . The Origin of the Words Mushroom, Fungus, and AgaricThe word agaric is generally thought to be derived from \"Agaria,\" a region in S.W. Russia or Agarus\u2014a town where an ancient culture, the Sarmatians, flourished along the Don river. Dioscorides (ca. 55 A.D.), the most famous herbalist of ancient times, used the name (agarikon ) in his widely influential De Materia Medica (Gunther , 1934) to describe what is now thought to be Fomitopsis officinalis (Vill.: Fr.) Bond, et Sing., probably because the fruiting bodies were principally obtained from this region. Throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the agaric was an important drug item and as such was often adulterated with other similar polypores. Subs equently , influential botanists like John Ray of the 17th and early 18th century , as well as the Renaissance herbalists, used agaric as a generic name for the entire group of bracket-like fungi with pores (instead of gills) that grow on trees. This trend was forever reversed when the great Swedish botanist, Linnaeus, single-handedly reformed systematic botan y, placing thousands of species of plants and fungi into generic groups and applying specific names to each. Linnaeus mistakenly appli ed the name agaric to fleshy gilled fungi, and it remains so today (Cooke, 1862). The word fungus is probably derived from spongia or sfggos (spoggos), a sponge, because of the sponge-like quality of some fleshy mushrooms (Murray et al, 1933). Mushroom probably originated in the 15th century or earlier . The French word mousser on from the old French moisser on is thought to be derived from mousse (moss), because many mushrooms grow closely in and around mosses (Murray et al, 1933). The influence of the Greeks was profound all through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, as can be seen in Gerard's Herbal (1633), a well-known compilation of many of the Herbals up to his time, (especially Dodoens, 1586). Gerard echoes the predominant English cultural bias in mostly dismissing fungi as \"venomous and full of poison.\" This feeling is eloquently put by the great English poet Shelley: And plants at whose name the verse feels loath, Fill'd the place with a monstrous under growth, Prickly and pulpous, and blistering, and blue, Livid, and starr'd with a lurid dew ,And agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould, Started like mist from the wet ground cold; Pale, fleshy , as if the decaying dead With a spirit of growth had been animated. Their mass rotted of f them flake by flake, Till the thick stalk stuck like a murderer's stake, Where rags of loose flesh yet tremble on high, Infecting the winds that wander by . Gerard is quite specific about the health benefits of mushrooms, saying they are \"cold and damp\" and can damage the internal organs. And further , that they \"do approach unto a venomous and murthering facultie, and ingender a clammy , pituitous, and cold nutrim ent if they be eaten. To conclud e, few of them are good to be eaten, and most of them do suffocate and strangle the eater . Therefore I give my advice unto those that love such strange and new fangled meates, to bewar e of licking honey among thornes, lest the sweetnesse of the one do not countervaile the sharpnesse and pricking of the other .\" The last sentenc e was probably written to apprise the reader of the fact that among a number of edible and even delectable esculent fungi there lurks a few that are poisonous and even lethal. Gerard mentions three types of medicinal mushrooms, \"Puffes-fists\" or Wolfes fists (puffballs), the powdery spores of which were said to \"dry without biting\" when applied to \"merigalls or kibbed heels (a recurrent localized redness and swelling, usually of the hands, feet or legs).\" Because they have a hard crusty exterior shell enclosing the powdery spores, which will smolder when ignited, dry, mature puffballs were also recommended to carry the spark of fire from one location to another , long before matches were known. The second is \"Jewes eare,\" (also called Judas' ear, because \"...it was believed that when Judas hanged himself on an elder tree, these ear-shaped 'excrescences' were condemned to appear on elders thereafter\") (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925). This fungus is Auricularia, which Gerard recommends for soothing \"the inflammations and all other soreness of the throat, being boiled in milk, steeped in beere, vinegar or any other convenient liquor .\" The third is the ubiquitous Agar ick, which Gerard writes about in some detail under the section on the Larch Tree, upon which it was known to grow . See \"The Panacea Mushroom\" below and the section on Fomitopsis officinalis for more information. After Gerard's time, the use of medicinal fungi in the West did grow to a certain extent. The eastern Europeans and Russians, especially , developedan intere st in the gastronomic and medicinal uses of mushrooms (Redwood, 1857). During the last 100 years, Russian and Eastern European scientists have conducted many studies on the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms, but unfortunately this literature is generally not as available as western European research, partly because of translation difficulties. One exception is the Chaga, Inonotus obliquus (Pers.: Fr.) Pilat., a very prominent species used in Russian folk medicine, for which a number of scientific papers are available in English. Medicinal mush rooms also found limited use in the young United States. Porcher (1854) summed up the situation adequately when he said, \"The medical uses of fungi are probably of far greater importance than their present very limited application might lead us to suppose\"\u2014 little did he realize what a prophetic stateme nt this would be\u2014today , 140 years later, a number of major pharmaceutica l companies worldwide, includ ing Merck, have mycologists (scientists who specialize in fungi) on staff and are actively extracting and looking for marketable compounds. Nonetheless, a number of species of fungi have been used medicinally at various times in Europe and the United States. The most important of these are discussed below according to their primary uses, that is, as panaceas, absorbents, for tuberculosis, and to af fect the nervous system. THE PANACEA MUSHROOM Because of the implications from Chinese Medicine that some polypores, such as Reishi and Mu er, were revered as cancer cures and panaceas, any reference to similar uses for western species of polypores is notable. The only hints of this, however , come in reference to Fomitopsis officinalis , and I will spend some time on this species because it is the most written about by far in western medicine.Fig. 4: Lar ch Agaric fr om The Theater of Plants, by J. Parkinson, 1640. This polypore is the agaric, or agaricum, of the ancients and has subsequently been Agaricus , White Agaric, Purging Agaric, Larch Agaric, and Quinine fungus. It was also used, along with several other polypores, as tinder , when it was called Touchwood, Spunk, and Tinder . According to Rolfe & Rolfe (1925), the Greeks and Romans believed in universal remedies (similar to the reverence for which the Chinese hold Panax ginseng ). An example is the formula called the Mithridate, which contained Agaric, as well as such interesting items as \"skinks bellies\". This formula, copied and recopied (with free additions of new ingredients by the copiers), was supposed to render the taker safe from any sort of poiso n, of both huma n and animal origin. The legend goes that a king (after whom it was named ) took it for a period of time to safeguard himself against the possibility of being poisoned by his enemies. Later in life, after losing a decisive battle, he became depressed and tried to kill himself by drinking a virulent poison\u2014and it didn't work (Watson, 1966)! Fomitopsis was included in the Mithridate formula since ancient times, and it was included in the form ula given in the first Pharmacopoeia Londenensis of 1618 (Urdang, 1944). Pliny was the first to write about the agaric; much of his information is summarized in T able 1. Table 1 USES OF AGARICUM IN PLINY (FROM THE TRANSLATION BY W.H.S.

Not only did he use it as a styptic (astringent) to stop bleeding, but he also used it for the following: injuries, bruises, falls, and fractured limbs kidney diseases with dif ficulty in passing urine menstrual insuf ficiency liver complaints and jaundice hysteria dysentery epilepsy sallow complexion (perhaps blood or heart deficiency) internal weakness of the or gans asthma colic phthisis (wasting diseases with night sweats, e.g., tuberculosis) \u2014give it in raisin wine pain in the hips, loins, and joints, poisoning, snake and animal bites According to Dioscorides, Fomitopsis should be taken for the above complaints in amounts appropr iate to one's strength and age\u2014either by eating the plain herb with water (as in tea or soup) or in wine (as an alcoholic tinctur e). The average dose was 3 oboli (3 1/3 grams) . For peoplewith stomach weakness, he directed it to be chewed and eaten in its whole raw form (I use it this way in small amounts and find it to be quite palatable and effective). For people with spleen (assimilation) weakness, he recommended a warm tea with vinegar and honey . He considered it at first sweet and then bitter as well as dry and warm. It is notew orthy that in the system of herbalism that is an integral part of Traditional Chinese medicine, many of the important tonics (such as ginseng) taste bitter and sweet and are considered warm in nature. Thus Fomitopsis officinalis may be an important first-class tonic (especially for enhancing immune strength and supporting adrenal function). This action has been disputed by one well-respected Chinese herbalist (Dharmananda, 1994), and it has not been proven by any scientific studies. See the monograph on this species for more details. Fomitopsis was used as a panacea, according to Dioscorides' prescription, for the next 1600 years or so. Gerard (1633) reported that agaric was still used in his time to cleanse the intestines and for jaundice, menstrual difficulties, edema, asthma, chronic fevers, and to restore healthy complexion, among other things. For those who can harvest their own Fomitopsis (they are common on larch and pine, but also on spruce, fir, hemlock, and Douglas-fir throu ghout the Northern Hemisphe re), Gerard also emphasizes that \"The best Agarick is that which is whitest, very loose and spungie, which may easily be broken and is light and in the first taste sweet. \" Note that the secondary taste is decidedly bitter . My own experience with this fungus suggests to me that this is indeed a very good tonic, when used in small amounts before meals. I have harvested it in the Pacific Northwest and in coastal California on old Douglas firs, especially ones that have been damaged by lightning or other natural catastrop hies. The fruiting bodies often grow high up into the tree and are difficult to harvest but will sometimes grow within reach. In former times they were dislodged from on high by rifles. The taste is hard to describe, but it is at first sour and sweet, with an enjoyable mild lingering bitterness, reminiscent of some wild American ginseng I have tasted. If the tea is taken in substantial quantities, intestinal irritation, nausea, and vomiting can occur in sensitive individuals. Gerard says of Fomitopsis that it is \"hot in the first degree and dry in the second degree,\" and that it \"cutteth, maketh thin, cleanseth, taketh awayobstructions stoppings of purgeth also by stoole ...and is \"a sure remedie for cold shakings, which are caused of thicke and cold humors. \" We might say it warms the mucous membranes, increa ses circulation, and helps to promot e the uptake of nutrients and the elimination of excess mucus and toxic wastes. The bitter taste helps to activate the mobility and secretions of the digestive processes, about which Gerard says, \"it comforteth the weake and feeble stomacke, (and) causeth good Gerard also recommends agaric for menstrual difficulties , edema, asthma, chronic coughs, tubercu losis, to restore proper color , and cure long- standing fevers. He suggests a dose of 1-2 drams in powder form (could be taken in capsule s) or 2-5 drams in decoction. He indicates that it \"purges\" (rids the body of toxins and mucus, speeds bowel transit time) and can cause nausea. For this reason , he reports that Galen recom mends an infusion with ginger , carrot seed, or lovage seed. Ginger has been shown in modern studies to allay nause a. The very best way to take Agaric is supposed to be in a syrup of vinegar , with the addition of ginger . From the 1600s, Agaric lost some of its magic, giving way to new and more specialized herbal medicines. In A New English Dispensatory (Alleyne, 1733), it is mentioned as a purging herb to be taken with aromatics (Ginger) and that a \"purging pill\" was official in the College Dispensatory , but that \"it is hardly at all in use, or to be met with in prescription .\" From the 2nd U.S. Dispensatory (Wood and Bache, 1834) we read that the 'purging agaric' \"In the dose of four or six grains (up to a dram) is said to act powerfully as a cathartic. In this country it is scarcely employed, though we have met with it in the shops.\" Nonetheless, in the late 1800s, the Agaricum was incorporated into the famous \"Warburg's Tincture,\" otherwise known as the \"Antiperiodica Tinctura,\" also available in pill form. The British Pharmaceutical Codex from 1934 mentions its use, and a dose is given of 0.2 to 2 grams. Modified Warburg's Tincture Fennel, bruised 4.6 g Gentian, bruised 2-3 g Cumin (zedoary) 2-3 gRhubarb root, bruised 9.1 g Angelica fruit, bruised 9.1 g Elecampane, bruised 4.6 g Saffron 4.6 g Cubeb, bruised 2.3 g Myrrh, crushed 2-3 g Agaric, powder 2.3 g Black pepper , bruised .5g Cinnamon, bruised .9g Directions: Mix the herbs together , grind them to a powder in a blender or coffee mill, and add enough 100 pr oof vodka to provide about 1 inch of liquid over the final mass of soaked herbs. Shake this mixtur e every day for 2 weeks, then squeeze out the liquid thr ough linen. Y ou may also strain the liquid through cheesecloth to r emove any debris or sediment, if desir ed. The usual dose is 4-16 ml, which is about 20 dr ops to 2 dropperfuls , 2-3 times per day , preferably just befor e meals. Note: This formula is a slight modification of the original one\u2014I have omitted opium, for obvious r easons, as well as quinine sulfate, for which agaric is supposed to be a substitute. This version has no aloe, as it is intended her e mor e as a warming digestive stimulant than a pur gative. However , you could add 2- 5 grams of aloe for a mor e pronounced laxative effect. Warbur g's tincture was used widely well into the 20th centu ry for a variety of conditions, but mainly to check night sweats due to tuberculosis, reduce excess secretions, and as a digestive stimulant to be taken in cases of tuberculosis and malaria. If you are interested in trying this formula, which is probably the most famous Western herbal formula containing a fungus as a major ingredient, see the directions on the recipe card (modified from the British Pharmaceutical Codex, 1934). Although this form ula was traditionally considered a \"tonic\" in western herbal medicine, it is more of a digestive warmi ng stimulant formula in the view of TCM. As discussed below , western herbalism traditionally considered digestive stimulants strengthening to the entire bodil y constitution. Cold and bitter herbs such as gentian and golden seal stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and if used chronica lly over several months, especially when combined withwarming herbs such as ginger , can help strengthen the immu ne system, improve energy levels, and facilitate the healing process in people who are recovering from long-term chronic ailments (Maiwald, 1987). In TCM, sweet and warm herbs that provide nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals and immune-stimulating polysaccha rides, are generally used to tonify and strengthen body systems and the overall constitution. My experience has led me to the integr ation of the two for optimum strengthening and sustaining effects. Strengthening the digestion is particularly important for healing, because it is this organ system that supplies vitality and warmth from the food that we eat. For a farther discussion of these issues, see my book Foundations of Health (Hobbs, 1992). ABSORBENTS Several species of polypores have been used for stanching and dressing wounds because of their fibrous, absorbent nature. These were usually prepared by removing any crusty exterior surface, pulling the fibrous fruiting body apart or cutting it into strips, and then pounding the pieces to make them soft and pliable. Up through the early 1700s, it was thought that these polypores had some special power (what we would now call a pharmacological action) as a styptic, but later it was decide d that their action is purely mechanical, working as a soft, absorbent mass. With the coming of modern scientific equipment and knowledge, we have confirmed anti-bacterial, anti-tumor , and immune-activating properties in many polypores, thus adding further credence to their use for wound-healing. A numb er of puffballs, such as Calvatia gigantea (Batsch:Pers.) Lloyd and Calvatia bovista Batsch, were also quite well known for their ability to stanch wounds . They were used after they were mature and dry. Interestingly , some puffballs were reported to have anesthetic properties on humans and to stupefy bees so that their honey could safely be collected. For instance, a Native American Indian author reports that her people, the Ahnishinaubeg, used the smoke of puffballs for these purposes (Keewaydinoquay , 1978). The Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania sell dried puffballs for burning, to collect honey (Arora, 1994). This use may not beespecially due to any chemical properties of puffballs per se, rather the phenomenon of smoke from any source causing bees to become less active outside of the hive. It is assume d that bees gorge on honey within the hive in response to its impending destruction due to fire (T yler, 1977). Fig. 5: Puffballs fr om Our Edible T oadstools and Mushrooms by W . Hamilton Gibson, 1895. TUBERCULOSIS Porcher (1854) commented on several mushrooms for treating tuberculosis. He reported that a French doctor , Dufresnoi, in the early 1800s, cured over 30 cases of tuberculosis using an electuary (a sweet herbal formula) that contained the fungus Lactarius deliciosus Fr., conserve of washed sulphur , and syrup of yarrow with a dose the size of a grape during the day. Another French doctor recommended the powder of the mushroom be simply mixed with honey and given in small doses. The mushroom was reported to contain a soothing mucilage. Dr. Dufresnoi also prescribed Lactarius piperatus (L.:Fr.) S.F. Gray (its acrid taste may warm and stimulate the respiratory tract). Modern science has identified sesquiterpenes from a number of Lactarius spp., including the pungent isovelleral and antibacterial (Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida utilis) activity, as well as the less active isovellerol and vellerol (Sterner et al, 1985). One of the most widely used of medicinal fungi for tubercu losis was Coriolellus suaveolens with an anise-scented fruiting body that grows in the United States from Idaho to the East Coast and in Europe and Asia as well. It was highly recommendedby a number of French and German doctors of the time as a cure for this ailment; several cases were reported in Porcher that had been given up as incurable and then completely recovered. Two drams of the powder were given morning and evening to af fect a cure. NERVOUS SYSTEM Three fungi that have been used in medicine are notable for containing compounds that strongly affect the nervous system\u2014er got (Claviceps purpur ea parasite that attacks grains, especially rye. It does this by producing a scler otium , or compact mass of hardened mycelia, that replace s the seed of the grain. \"Ergot\" is the common name for this sclerotium, and it is known to contain several alkaloids that cause smooth muscles in peripheral blood vessels to constrict, inhibiting blood flow. During the Middle Ages, people in Europe often unknowingly ate ergotized rye and contracted a condition called \"St. Anthony's fire\" characterized by burning hands and feet and hallucinations. Sometimes the restricted blood flow brought on gangrene and required amputation, and occasionally it even induced fatal respiratory and heart failure. Interestingly , some histo rians believe that the eccentric behavior of Salem's \"witche s\" was induced by ergot poisoning (Wallace, 1991). Despite the fact that ergot is potentially toxic (it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, tachycardia, confusion, and coma), it was and is used medicinally . The Merck Index (1907) indicated ergot difficult menstruation, night-sweats, whoop ing cough, migraine, diabetes, epilepsy , and chronic cerebral congestion. Today ergot derivatives are still used in a number of countries to induce abortions, to stop uterine bleeding after childbirth, for orthostatic hypotension, and especially for the treatment of cluster and migraine headache s (Wallace, 1991). Also, among ergot's alkaloids is a diethyl derivative of lyser gic acid amide, the source of Dr. Hoffmann's discovery of LSD in 1934. See the Ergot monograph for more information. Corn smut: Ustilago maydis is a common fungal growth that occurs on kernels of corn. It grows from the size of a marble to that of a child's head.It has been reporte d to contain alkaloids similar to ergot's (List & Horhammer , 1979), but this has been disputed (Osol & Farrar , 1947; W att & Breyer -Brandwijk, 1962). Ustilago does appear to have significant uterine stimulating and abortifacient effects, and a liquid extract of it is used in Europe in midwifery and gynecology (W att & Breyer - Brandwijk, 1962). During the 1880 s, Ustilago was briefly popular in medicine in the U.S. as an oxytocic, and it was even official in the 6th United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 1880. It was also used in traditi onal North American medic ine. The Ahnishinaubeg, a Native American Indian people, are known to have used Ustilago maydis to increase uterine contrac tions during childbirth (Keewaydinoquay , 1978); the Zuni used it to facilitate birth and to stop postpartum bleeding; and the Tewa eat the fungus with cold water for irregular menstruation (Youngken, 1925). However , due to the irregularity and weakness of the action of corn smut, this fungus has never enjoyed the same popularity in medicine as ergot. David Arora, in his All That the Rain Promises and More, extols the virtu es of corn smut as a food; in Mexico, it is consid ered a delicacy . For recipes, consult The Art of Mexican Cooking by Dian a Kennedy (New York: Bantam, 1989). See the monograph on Ustilago for more information. Fly agaric: Amanita muscaria is the famous bright red mushroom with white dots sprinkled on its cap. It has a long history of use as an hallucinogenic mushroom with great religious and cultural significance in Siberia, Northeast Asia, and perhaps elsewhere (Saar , 1991b; Wasson, 1968). Extracts of the fungus have also been recommended for epilepsy , spinal irritations, and for killing flies (after infusing the fungus in milk). Homeopaths still use it today for chorea (ceaseless, rapid, jerky movements of the body) and skin afflictions. Scudder (Felter , 1922), a renowned Eclectic doctor , prescribed a tincture of the fresh fungus for \"pain in the occiput and an inclination to fall backward,\" as well as for \"involuntary twitching of the muscles of the face, forehead and eyes.\" The Eclectics were medical doctors who used primarily herbs and practiced clinical medicine during the first part of the 1900s. People who drink the urine of Amanita -intoxicated individuals have been known to become intoxicated themselves, due to the presence of ibotenic acid and muscimol (Ramsbottom, 1953).MISCELLANEOUS USES OF FUNGI IN THE WEST A few other uses of fungi in Western folklore and medicine bear mentioning. According to Swanton (1915), in West Sussex, England, old men carried Daldinia concentrica (Bolt.) Ces. et de Not. (also known as \"cramp balls\" or \"carbon balls\") for protection against cramps. I have tried this numerous times and even seen some of my students carry them during their menstrual cycle, but to no avail\u2014maybe there is something we don't know about the way in which they were carried. Phellinus pomaceus was used as a poult ice for swollen faces, and in other English villages the charcoal of Piptoporus betulinus was used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. Elaphomyces (a genu s of truffles) were traditionally used in love potions in the 16th century (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925) and recommended as aphrodisiacs by English herbalists in the 1700s (Berkeley , 1857) perhaps due to their resemblance to human testicles (Tyler, 1977). Nativ e people in Mexico use Elaphomyces in divinitory rituals with the addition of Psilocybe. Fomes fomentarius and other conks (Phellinus, Fomitopsis) were powdered and used as snuff by the Ostyacks on the Ob river, in western Siberia (Berkeley , while Boletus A.D.), was used for bowel complaints , sore eyes, ulcers on the head, and for dog bites (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925). Table 2 summar izes the major uses of fungi in Western medicin e. If you would like further historical information, two notable works on the subject are Porcher's On the Medicinal and Toxicological Properties of the Cryptogamic Plants of the United States (1854) and R.T. Rolfe's The Romance of the Fungus W orld (1925). Table 2 FUNGI USED AS MEDICINE IN EUROPE Species Synonym Agaricus campestris L.:Fr .\u2014 nerve tonic (it diabetes, epilepsy suaveolenstuberculosis; also as an Ces. et de Not.\u2014 cramps flow of urine, ague cake, bilious to Claviceps purpur ea, above NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN USES OF FUNGI Many Native American Indian tribes did not regard fungi as an important food, and some thought them entirely unfit for consumption. Other peoples, such as the Ahnishinaubeg, the Tewa, and the Iroquois, did eat them, some with relish (Keewaydinoquay , 1978; Burk, 1983). Nonetheless, many Native American Indians did use fungi medicinally for rheumatism, pain in the joints, congested organs, sciatica, and gout. Interestingly , they used fungi in much the same mann er as the Chinese use moxa, that is, by employing ignited, smoldering polypores to blister , or even burn, the skin over the affected area. Early Europeans learned of these uses from Native American Indian s who called dried polypores used in this way \"spunk\" or \"touchwood\" (Lawson, 1714; Josselyn, 1860). Beverly (1947) described this practice as it was done among the native peoples of V irginia: \"....they take Punck, (which is a sort of soft Touchwood, cut out of the knots of Oak or Hiccory Trees...) this they shape like a Cone...and apply the Basis of it to the place affected. Then they set fire to it, letting it burn out upon the part, which makes a running Sor e effectually .\" Another author reported that Native Indians of Manitoulin Island, in Canada, did much the same (W , almost by the Native Amer ican Indians \u2014both medicinally and in other ways. The Blackfoot called them ka-ka- toos, or \"fallen stars,\" and, according to legend, these fallen stars were an indication of supernatural events. Various Native American Indians used puffballs as tinder to start fires and as incense to keep away unwanted spirits. Some wore them as magical charms, and puffballs were also dried, filled with gravel, and used as rattles. Medicinally , puff-balls were frequently used as a styptic. The soft, interior portion of the immature puffball was dried, ground, and applied to wounds to stop bleeding. In somecases, puffball spores were mixed with spiderwebs to make a hemostatic dressing. Tribes as diverse as the Cherokee, Chippewa, Kiowa, Makah, Menomini, Pawnee, Omaha, and Navaho all used puffballs in this way. For an excellent review of the uses of puffballs by the Native American Indians see Burk (1983). The Blackfoot drank an infusion of puffball spores to stop internal bleeding, while the Arikara combined the spore mass with the pulverized root of red baneberry to make a poultice for inflamed and abscessed breasts (in women). Puffballs were also used to soothe burns and itching. Dried, mature puffballs were used as a remedy for earaches and broken eardrums, while the mycelia were used to help heal bone fractures in animals (Burk , 1983). The Okanagan-Colville Indians of British Columbi a and Washington used the spores like talcum powder to treat diaper rash and if the rash was very serious, alum root (Heuchera cylindrica ) was added. Sores were also treated with the spores (Turner, 1980). Native American Indians used other species of fungi for medicine. For instance, the Ahnishinaubeg employed Fomitopsis officinalis as a powerful purgative, especially in cases where poisoning was suspected. However , only very small doses were prescribed, as too much was thoug ht to cause paralysis. They also used Fomes fomentarius as a cauterizer and styptic, and Lycoper don (also known as Calvatia caelata ex DC.) Morg.) as a blood coagulant (Keewaydinoquay , 1978). The Cherokee put Geastrum (earthstars) on the navels of babies after childbirth and left them there until the withered umbili cal cord fell off. This was done as both a prophylactic and therapeutic measure (Mooney and Olbrechts, 1932). The Okanagan- Collville Indians were known to bathe their babies in a broth of mushrooms with the idea that like mushrooms, which are so strong they move rocks as they grow out of the soil, babies subjected to the broth would grow up strong enough to move men (Turner , 1980). In British Columbia, the spores of a tree fungus known as \"owl wood\" (Trichaptum abietinus Fries) were collected from the trunks of fir trees to provide a powder that young men of the Thompson Indian tribe rubbed their skin with in conjunction with sweat bathing to impart strength (T urner , 1973). The Use of Medicinal Mushrooms in AsiaFungi have played an important role in Chinese culture for perhaps 7,000 years. Over the millennia, comm on mushrooms such as the wood ear and jelly fungus have been importa nt food items. Various simple fungi were also utilized to make fermented food products such as wine, vinegar , soy sauce, and pickled vegetables (Wang, 1985). Fungi were utilized for their healing properti es in Japanese and Malaysian cultures, but probably not to the same extent as in China, and there is far less written about these uses in English. In 1883, researchers (Batchelor & Miyabe, 1893) collected information about plants used by the Ainu from the Japanes e island of Hokkaido. They reported on the uses of several fungi, but only two were conclusively identified to species. Spores of a puffball (Lycoper don spp.) were said to be applied externa lly to heal scalds, burns, and \"pains in the body ,\" and Fomitopsis officinalis was used as a decoction for stomachache. The fungus was said to be \"greatly prized by the old Japanese doctors.\" The use of fungi such as hoelen, caterpillar fungus, and ergot in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was also recorded in the classic literature. TCM is over 3,000 years old and is now gaining popularity in the West. The two earliest great classics of Chinese herbal medicine are the Shen nung Pen ts'ao king or Pen ts'ao king, also called Pen king, generally translated to mean \"Herbal Classic,\" and the Ming i pie lu or simply Pie lu which is thought to be a supplement to the Shen nung Pen ts'ao, written in the Wei dynasty (221-264 A.D.). Subsequent authors sometimes combine both works into either name, considered to be the \"Herbal Classic.\" The Pen King is traditionally ascribed to the legendary Emperor Shen Nung (28 Century B.C.) but is now thought to be compiled from earlier manuscripts about 202-221 A.D. The Pen king mentions a number of Lloyd, and Tremella fuciformis Berk. (Yang & Jong, 1989). Earlier mention of the use of fungi in medicine outside of the main classics occurred as early as 26 B.C. in the \"Book of Songs,\" a compilation of folk-songs and poems. In 300 A.D., sever al important medicinal mushrooms, such as the caterpillar fungus ( Cordyceps spp.), ling mylittae ), were mentioned. Shiitake was included in a work on herbal medicine first in 1309 in the Materia Medica in Daily Use (Wang, 1985).A number of ancient Taoist works mention \"chi\" as a plant that brings happiness and immortality . In both the Pen king and the Pie lu the name chi is applied to various mushrooms, six of which are talked about in detail. ts'ing (green) chi, also called lung (dragon) chi is said to be sour and non-poisonous; it brightens the eye, strengthens the liver, quiets the spirits, improves the memory , and prolongs life. chi (red), also called dan (cinnabar) Qi tastes bitter but non-poisonous; acts especially on the heart; it has the same tonic and calming properties of ts'ing chi. huang (yellow) chi, also called kin (gold) chi, is sweet and non- poisonous; acts on the spleen\u2014tonic and constructive. pai (white) chi, also called y\u00fc chi, is considered pungent and non- poisonous; acts on the lungs, opens the air passages. hei (black) chi, also called h\u00fcan (dark) chi, tastes saltish and non- poisonous; acts on the urinary tract, same tonic properties. tsu' (purple) chi, also called mu (wood) chi, considered sweet and non- poisonous; acts on the bones and ligaments. (from Bretschneider , 1895 and Shih-Chen, 1973). A numb er of sources conclude that the chi are different forms of Ganoderma lucidum or ling zhi , a name which first occurs in the Ling yuan fang from the 11th century A.D. (Bretschneider , 1895). Ling means either \"effective\" or \"spirit\" or \"intelligence\" (Jingrong, 1979). Probably the most famous of all works on Chinese materia medica is the monumental Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu, which was compiled by Li Shih-chen and published in 1578. This herculean labor took Shih-chen 26 years and includes 1,892 species of animal, herbal, and mineral drugs, plus 8,160 prescriptions (Smith & Stuart, 1911). Although the work has never been translated into any western language in its entirety , there are two English summaries of various parts which include botanical, chemical, and herbal information about a limited number of species; these are Chinese Materia Medica, Vegetable Kingdom , (Porter F. Smith and rev. G.A. Stuart, 1911) and Chinese Medici nal Plants from the Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu...A.D . 1596 (Bernard E. Read), first publis hed in 1936 from smaller earlier editions. Smith and Stuart cover about 700 species and include some information ontheir historical uses. Read's work contains 867 herbal drugs but includes mainly bibliographic references from Europe and Japan (plus a few from China), as well as constituent lists for some herbs. The chief value of this work is a confi rmation of the Latin names of some importan t traditional Chinese herbs which were included in the Pen T s'ao, along with a historical bibliography listing early articles (from the late 19th century and early 20th century) concerning identification and trade of Chinese herbs. These two works mention a number of fungi from the Pen Ts'ao, including the species mentioned in T able 3. Table 3 MEDICINAL FUNGI OF THE PEN TS'AO A number of medicinal mush rooms, such as ling (Astragalus mem- branaceus ), are deemed to belong to the highest class of medicines, i.e., tonics, which are said to impart strength, vigor , and longevity . They fall into the category of remedies called \"fu zheng\", or \"supporting the normal\" (maintaining homeostas is), and are still widely used in China and Japan, now often in conjunction with W estern medicine. Some of the most commonly used fungi in the history of Traditional Chinese Medicin e (TCM) include ling zhi, cordyceps, zhu ling, and hoelen. As a group, the polypores are all thought to possess superior healing properties. I will only present some highlights on a few of these fungi here, because the volume of informat ion that has developed about them over the years is indeed vast. If you would like to learn more about these or related fungi, I invite you to look them up in the second half of this book. A great deal of scientific work has been done on them and, since TCM is a livingtradition, they are still widely used today much as they have been in the past. Ganoderma lucidum is, without doubt, one of the most famous medicinal mushrooms. It is known as ling zhi in China and reishi in Japan . It has been used for thousands of years to treat liver disease (such as hepatitis), nephritis (kidn ey inflammat ion), high blood pressure , arthritis, neurasthenia, insomnia, bronchitis, asthma, and gastric ulcers (Kabir et al, 1988). It is also said to benefit the heart (Ying et al, 1987). In the past, G. lucidum was very expensive, because it only grew in the wild, but cultivation techniques developed in the last 20 years have now made it accessible and affordable (Willard, 1990). Today this king of fungi is used especially for aging-related and degenerative conditions, such as cancer , and as an immune stimulant. Some members of the genus Cordyceps have the unusu al distinction of fruiting on caterpillars, which is why they are known as \"winter worm, summer herb\" (Bensky and Gamble, 1986). They were very rare in ancient China, so only the Emperor had the luxury of using them. Because these fungi were deem ed to have tonic properties similar to those of ginseng, they were used to build stamina and restore vital energy after exhaustion or prolonged illnes s. Today C. ophioglossoides is used in TCM to stimulate blood circulation and treat menstrual disorders, while C. sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. is used as a lung and kidney tonic and a nutritional supplement to build vital energy in the elderly . An article in Newsweek (Sept. 27, 1993, p. 63) reported on the female Chin ese long-distance runners who shocked the sports world by sweeping the distance events at the World Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Stuttgart, Germany . Shortly after, Wang Junxia broke 3 world records in 6 days of competition, and Qu Yunxia broke another long-standing record in China's National Games. These remarkable performances led the international athletics community to voice accusations that the women might have been taking outlawed performance-enhancing drugs. So far there is no evidence of wrongdoing, and the athletes' coach has said emphatically that these substances were not used. He credits the success to a hard training and a special diet which includes a \"mineral-rich soup\" containing dong chong xia cao (Cordyceps sinensis)! This may be in question, after 11 Chinese swimmers tested positive for dehydrotestosterone, a performance-enhancing substance that is banned by the International Olympic Committee (Reuter News Service, 1994).Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Sing., better known to the general public as \"shiitake,\" is another superstar fungus with a delicious taste and texture. It is the second most produced mushroom in the world, after Agaricus bisporus , about 14% of the total world mushroom production of 4.3 million metric tons (as of 1991) valued at 8.5 million dollar U.S., compared with 56% for Agaricus. See the excellent review , Nutritional and Medicinal Value of Specia lty Mushr ooms by Breene (1990) for further information. Historical records indicate that the Japanese used it at least as far back as 199 A.D. It was said to be praised by the Emperor Chuai who was given the mushroom by the Kyusuyu, a native tribe. In ancient China, it was known and revered even before that (Scientific Consulting Service). In the past, as in the present, shiitake was used for any and all conditions where the immune functio n needs a boos t, from colds to cancer and everything in between. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted on L. edodes , showing it to be antiviral and cancer -protective, among other ef fects. In Japan, versicolor (L.:Fr .) Pilat, is used as a health food. Modern laboratory tests show it to have cholesterol-lowering as well as immune-enhancing activity (Mitomo et al, 1980). I will review some of the key findings on shiitake, Cordyceps , and reishi in the next section. If you are interested in further information on the history and use of Chinese medicinal fungi, a beautifully-illustrated work on the subject is Icones of Medicinal Fungi from China (Ying, 1987). See the Resources section for ordering information. Besides the use of single mushrooms in teas and soups in folk medicine and in hospitals, there are many products in tablet form that combine a number of herbs in one formula. They are often made by freeze-drying a tea of the herbs, creating a powder which is then made into small pills and packed into glass bottles. There are a number of well known products manufactured in China and prescribed by acupuncturists and herbalists which contain a combination of several medicinal mushrooms. As an example, Wu Ling San is a traditional Chinese formula that was first recorded in the classic Chinese work, Discussion of Cold-induced Disor ders. The uses of this are detailed in the monographs on the Chines e herb Grifola umbellata below . Finally , using modern fermentation technology , active compou nds such as large molecular weight polysaccharides and protein-boundpolysaccharides are being remo ved from the fruiting bodies, spores, and mycelium of the most popular medicinal mushrooms (Wang, 1985; Yang & Jong, 1989). At the present time, there is information on 300 species of wild and cultivated edible fungi and 117 species for medicinal use. Because of increased use pressures and the difficulty of obtaining popular species at different times of the year, many species are currently being cultivated in China and other countries. This is an increasingly important economic force in many parts of the world. Illustration fr om Matthiolus, 1578L The Medicinal V alue of V isionary Mushr ooms aboratory and clinical experiments, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, showed lyser gic-acid diethylamide (LSD) to be a valuable tool in brain research and experimental psychiatry (Abramson, 1959; these clinical trials and reports have suggested that LSD has potential for treating chron ic alcoholism (Freedman, 1967; Abrams on, et al, 1967; Mottin, 1973; Ludwig, 1970). In light of these early promising results, it is interesting to note that research on the clinical usefulness of psychedelic substances has dwindled considerably over the last 30 years and lags behind basic neuro- pharmacological work (Crisp Data Base, N.I.H.). For instance, a search of Medlars, the world's largest medical database, reveals that in the 9-year period from 1966 to 1975, there were 262 published papers on psilocybe and psyilocybin and in the last 10 years, only 48\u2014and as a percentage, many more of the older studies were related to clinical appli cation. This reduction in scientific interest is probably due mainly to regulatory and political pressures. Through this research, as well as through massive popular use, one might suggest that by altering the brain chemistry and shaking one's firm footing in fixed everyday life-reality , positive healing changes subsequent to \"expanding the consciousness\" might be possible. On the other hand, the use of psychedelic substances has the potential of amplifying an existingemotional imbalance, leading to anxiety and adverse physical symptoms. Hallucinogenic substances purchased \"on the street,\" from unknown sources are unstandardized and hold the possibility of adulteration with toxic solvent residues or impure hallucinogens from \"kitchen chemists.\" For this such as Psilocybe (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l, mushrooms have been preferred by many seeking to explore their more healing aspects (Pollock, 1975). Besides LSD, the science and practice of psychiatry has also benefitted from the discovery and subsequent research on hallucinogenic mushrooms (Guzman, 1980; Hofmann, 1967). At least one active compound responsible for the psychoactiv ity of Psilocybe species, psilocybin (the other 3 are psilo cin, baeocystin, and norbaeocystin), has been synthesized and has provided insight into how the brain works, as well as the process of such mental disorders as schizophrenia (Singer , 1978; McDonald, 1980). Several researchers have commented on the potential usefulness of psilocybin in psychiatric work (Schultes & Hofmann, 1973). After over a thousand contro lled sessions with psilocybin, it was proposed to be more useful than LSD, because it is shorter -acting and has less potential for side effects, such as fewer flashback s and less post-session depression (Fischer & Gold man, 1975; Leuner , 1968; Pollock, 1976). Because people who ingest Psilocybe mushrooms often experience a feeling of profound detachment from the everyday world and its problems and viciss itudes, they might be able to open up and discuss problems with the therapist without excessive emotional baggage. Several controlled clinical studies and clinical reports support further research with psilocybin in this vein (Delay et al, 1959; Ruzickova et al, 1967; Leonard and Rapoport, 1987). Pollock (1975) has suggested that Psilocybe active compounds may be very useful for helping the alert terminally ill go through their dying process, based on previous work in this area with LSD, and because of the use of the mush rooms in medico-religious rites may \"be a more natural, psychologically aesthetic medicinal sacrament in the preparation of these patients for a death with dignity .\" When one ponders the possible medicinal effects of Psilocybe spp. and other hallucinog ens, the question arises how can one profoundly affect the mind and consciousness withou t gaining insight into the spiritu al nature of health and disea se as well? It is well known that many indigenous peopleshave used hallucinogenic and visionary plants for healing disease, divining the future, and as a gateway to converse with nature or God (Guzman, 1983; Schultes and Hofmann, 1979), but also for their euphoric effects (Singer , 1958). A common belief is that God gave the sacred mushrooms to the people for their inner development (Davis, 1981). Many Native American India n healers made use of Datura (Jimson weed), those from Mexico, peyote and Psilocybe , and a number of plants are used in Central and South Ame rica, notably ayahuasca. Excellent popular accounts of the uses of visionary plants for healing include Schultes & Hofmann (1979), Emboden (1979), and Ott (1976, 1994). Psychedelic mushrooms have been used for gaining insight into the disease process by shamans and healers for probably thousands of years (Hofmann, 1978; McDonald, 1980). In less industrialized societies, disease is associated with spirits and other influences closely related with one's general mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Schultes (1983) has pointed out the urgency in preserving the rich cultural knowledge of native peoples worldwide in regard to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms for spiritual and healing purposes, \"in view of the rapid disintegration and disappearance of indigenous cultures in many parts of the world, including, especially , Mexico.\" \"To neglect (these cultural uses of hallucinogenic mushrooms) would be tantamo unt to the closing of a door, forever to entomb a peculiar kind of native knowledge with the culture that gave it birth.\" In many western countries, Psilocybe mushrooms are illegal, but in other countries they are entirely appropriate\u2014the context and culture are the key elements. In the 1970s, the widespread use of these mushrooms was not ideal because of the lack of guidance from spiritual healers and curanderas trained in their appropriate use. In my experience, psychedelic mushrooms, such as Psilocybe semilanceata , a widespread native species , have the potential, if used carefully with knowledge and awareness, to be useful for developing a sensitivity to the cycles of nature, to learn how we can be in harmony with its processes. The experience can help to guide a receptive person through the often-held attachment of inhabitants of industrial societies to controlling nature, rather than enjoying the stay on mother earth as a caretaker and cohabitant with all the other animals, plants, and living beings. I haveexperienced their healing powers to break addictions, as a catalyst in learning how to eat more healt hfully , and even heal specific ailments. Of course, one could say that these feelings and experiences are merely a reflection of my personal nature \u2014that others taking them would experience as many different visions of their usefulness as a healing or enlightening agent as there are people, and this is probably true. Yet I have often seen an increased reverence for life and a heightened sensitivity to the beauty and mystery of nature as a common theme among people who have used these mushrooms. Other researchers have stated that experiences after ingestion of Psilocybe vary with the individual's expectations, beliefs, setting, presence of an experienced guide, and amount and species ingested, and this is undoubtedly correct. In a practical way one must be aware that Psilocybe and other hallucinogenic fungi can also be powerful agents for change and are not to be taken without awareness of the potential risks. Some people, especially if they are psychologically disturbed, emotionally unstable, or simply unhealthy , may become quite agitated and experience very unpleasant feelings of both body and mind. To be used as an agent of psychological and physical healing, it is best to work with a qualified wise woman or shaman experien ced in their use. Unfortunately , this person and setting may not be easy to find. Although Psilocybe may precipitate an acute reaction in rare individuals, or in those who overdose (one person was said to have jumped off a balcony), the health consequen ces of the long-term use of Psilocybe is unknown. Wasson (1957) has said that there are no cumulative effects on humans, citing the curandera, Maria Sabina, who took the mushrooms for 35 years in substantial doses, without any known side effects, although this obviously does not preclude adverse effects in others. Death from hallucinogenic mushrooms is virtually unknown, even after an overdose, and most of the danger lies in misidentification of species durin g collection and consumption\u2014a very real possibility (Ott, 1978). For instance, acute renal failure has been reported from toxic Cortinarius species in a 20-year - old woman who thought she was buying and ingesting \"magic\" mushrooms (Raff et al, 1992). It must be remembered that Psilocybe mushrooms may act as a liver toxicant, and that the long-term mutagenic, carcinogenic, adverse effects on the immune system, and other toxic effects have not been studied and are at present unknown. Of related interest is a 1994 study(House & Thom as) which shows that immune cells are affected by LSD in vitro at blood concentrations that can be achieved after oral ingestion. Today , there is probably a wide spectrum of beliefs about psychedelic mushrooms in different societi es. Some undoubtedly feel that they are dangerous and should be strictly regulated, while others argue they should be freely availa ble. On one side of the spectrum, Pollack (1975) had this point of view about the government regulation of natural hallucinogens. \"One would need only to become acqu ainted with the wealth of ethnobotanica l knowledge pertaining to natural hallucinogens to readily perceive that legislation prohibiting possession and use of these naturally occurring materials must be in fundamental violation of certain extremely basic aspects of human behavior , not to mention cherished human rights.\" Throughout history , humans have sought to alter their consciousness through natural and artificial means. Witness the popularity of alcoholic beverages in most parts of the world. A number of prominent researchers have concluded that Psilocybe spp. are neither addictive nor particularly toxic in contrast to the widely used tobacco products\u2014in fact, a preliminary comparative overview of the dependence-inducing potential and acute physical toxicity of 20 psychoactive substances was publish ed in 1993 (Gable), based on an extensive literature review and work of the Committee on Prob lems of Drug Dependence and the National Institute of Mental Health, on-going since 1948. The review reported that of the 20 substances, oral use of psilocybe mushroom s was by far the least toxic (highest safety margin) and had the lowest potential for inducing physical or mental dependence. Alcohol, tobacco and coffee were reported to have small to moderate safety mar gins and moderate to high dependence potentials. So why all the fuss over psilocybe? Perhaps there are frightening aspects to travel ing within inner psychic realms that are peculiarly disquieting to many . Daniel Freedman from the Department of Psychiatry , University of Chicago put it this way . \"It has been remarke d that tradition-bound scientists will predictably conclude that the proper use of hallucinogens is for resear ch and medical application; the illicit abuse is for kicks and cults. Our puritanica l ethics are said to prohibit us from even exploring whethe r the use of hallucinogens could improve the healthy , or possibly transform Western society into a Zen elysium. \"Whatever scientists may think, history does indeed record our unceasing urge to transcend limits and escape dreary reality or anxiety with the aid of magic, drugs, drama, festival rites, and....thr ough dr eams.\" The other side of the spectru m regarding the use of psychoactive mushrooms by non-researchers is epitomized by the view of Dr. VarroTyler, a respecte d pharmacogno cist with many years of research experience on medicinal plants and psy chedeli c mushrooms, who states emphatically that given our present state of knowledge, the use of Psilocybe mushrooms should be avoided altogether (Tyler, 1994). Some potential objections to the practice have been previously mentioned, namely the possible negative impact on the user's brain chemistry , mental health and immune system. For instance, halluc inogenic mushrooms have been reported to lead to panic reactions, acute psychosis, mental depression and even convulsions (Schwartz & Smith, 1988: Mush a et al, 1986), as well as nause a, vomiting and tachycardia (Peden et al, 1982), though some of these effects may have been due to psilocybin interacting with other recreational drugs (Schwartz & Smit h, 1988). Severe symptoms such as vomiting, myalgia, and temporary hepat otoxic and nephrotoxic effects after injection of an extract of Psilocybe mushrooms has also been reported (Curry & Rose, 1985; Sivyer & Dorrington, 1984). Misidentification or the inadvertent substitution of assumed psych oactive species with toxic or even lethal species of fungi from other genera (Raff et all, 1992; Tebbett, 1984; Rold, 1986), or from substitution from commercially purchased street drugs has also been reported from the literature (Raff et al, 1992). Young or inexperienced users are likely to take several mind-altering or euphoriant drugs at one session, increasing the possibility of additive or syner gistic effects producing harmful side ef fects (Schwartz & Smith, 1988). No matter how far out or unfat homable one perceives the use of LSD, Psilocybe spp., and other mind-altering hallucinogens to be, what may be even more of a cultural challeng e is the promise of \"designer personalities\" through prescrip tion drugs such as Prozac\u00ae, which may have the ability to permanently alter one's brain chemistry (Kramer , 1993). For a more detailed account of the chemistry , ethnohistory , toxicology , and pharmacology of of mushrooms, see pp. 152-157. Note of Caution: Althou gh I have personally not experienced side effects from the use of Psilocybe mushrooms, I realize that they are powerful agents capable of producing toxic symptoms in suceptible individuals. I am in no way recommending the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms, and I am not suggesting that they are safe or healthful,especially Amanita species. They stress the liver and have other toxic properties, especially when used chronically . It is essential to note that some species of as well as members of other mushroom genera, contain potentially lethal liver toxins, even when taken in small amounts. They could kill you! The possession, use, or sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms is also illegal under the provisions of Public Law 91-513, Section 202, Sched ule 1(c) and Schedule 3(b). A fascin ating insight into the promise of hallucinogens in the healing process can be seen in the curren t research with ibogaine, an indole alkaloid from the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga Baill. in the same subclass of compounds as psilocybin, which shows some promise for eliminating difficult addictions to cocaine and other drugs (Jetter , ents with the substance are encouraging, but controversial due to a possible neurotoxic effect of ibogaine (O'Hearn and Molliver , 1993). The alkaloid is extracted from the plant, and clinical trials are underway at the University of Miami. THE HALLUCINOGENIC PROPERTIES OF AMANITA MUSCARIA AND A. PANTHERINA Gordon Wasson, a banker who became the world's most renowned ethnomycologist (1968), claimed in his meticulously researched and presented book Soma, The Divine Mushr oom of Immortality , that Amanita muscaria is the sacred Soma of the Rig Vedas, the writings which contain over a thousand hymns to soma, and upon which the Hindu religion is based. That may or may not be true, but in any case, this fungus is well- known as an inebriant and hallucinogenic mushroom in Russia and other parts of Europe (Saar , 1991b); it also grows in Central America, North America, Tibet, and North Africa. Some writers have put forth the doctrine that the Maya knew of A. muscaria , consid ering it sacred, and that Christianity may have been originally founded upon a mushroom cult, the Bible being a euphemistic work talking about the effects of the mushroomto avoid persecution by the Romans, though there is little evidence to support these hypotheses (Cooke, 1977; T yler, 1994). Fig. 6: Amanita muscaria from The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening by George Nicholson, circa 1887. Years ago, a close friend of mine, now a naturopathic physician, experimented with Amanita ingestion; his experiences are written in the following account. SOMA\u2014A somewhat Divine Experience? In the early 70s I happened across a copy of Gordon Wasson's book, Soma, The Divine Mushr oom of Immortality in the library at Oregon State University . His contention was that Amanita muscaria was Soma, the source of inspiration for the Vedic scriptures. I was living on a rural hippie commu ne at the time. We were, in that culture, ever alert to any new possibilities for explori ng the boundaries and depths of our consciousness. The Amanita, a mushroom of preternatural beauty , is ubiquitous in weste rn Oregon during the fall. It had an ineluctable draw to persons of our world view . Under the influence of some forgotten authority, we attached significance to the ritual of taking the mushrooms in multiples of seven. Both whole mush rooms and pellicles were eaten. We first ate them fresh in small numbers, then dried. The most I ever tried was twenty-one. The experience could not be described as pleasant or enlightening (except as a demonstration of the extremes people will go to alter their awareness). In the caution of age I would discourage anyone from trying Amanitas. Within less than an hour of ingesting the mushrooms I would begin to perspire profusely . I clearly remember huddling next to my blazing wood stove, soaked with sweat, but feeling an unreachable coldness to the core of my body . With larger doses, nausea and vomit ing would overcome me. I attac hed no great signific ance to this message of toxicity since other valuedsubstances also had this effect. Shortly after purging, I would fall into a deep sleep. I never had any clear remembrance of spectacular dreams or revelatory visions occurring during this phase, but I seldom do even after normal sleep. I awakened after 2 or 3 hours. My state then would be best described by the word equanimity . Whatever needed to be done\u2014daily chores, fixing meals, dealing with an unwelcom e guest\u2014 was accomplished with an easy detachment. The sense was (though never tested) that if disaster were to befall, the world come to an end, I would have been imperturbed, though not unobservant or incapacitated. It was a not unpleasant state that I optimistically likened to the desired state of nonattachment purportedly achieved by certain religious practices. This condition would fade over a few hours time. One day, a feline mem ber of the commune where I lived ate half of an Amanita butto n that was drying above the stove. The attraction was puzzling. The drying fungus was redole nt of stale vomit. After realizing what had happene d, we paid close attention to Blue, as the cat was named. He became glassy eyed and lay drooling on the walkway outside. After about an hour, his head drooped in what appeared to be the sleep stage. It was a sleep from which he never awakened. He was dead less than two hours after consuming the mushroom. Sobered by Blue's demise and from reports of liver damage caused by Amanita muscaria , our experimentation came to an end. I have not eaten any since. My feeling is that either the chemistry of the Eurasian mushrooms is different from that of North American varieties, or the chemistry of Vedic poets is different from the chemistry of Oregon hippies. Perhaps if I could remember the experiences of my mind during periods of Amanita induced stupor , I would be penning paeans to the glory of the mushroom, but, I have my doubts. Stephen Brown, N.D. For more information about the cultural and medical uses of A. muscaria , see the monograph on page 64.A Modern Uses of Medicinal Fungi s I have been hinting at all along, far from being curiosities of the past, medicinal mushrooms are gaining an ever-wider popularity today . This new interest has been greatly stimulated by the large number of scientifi c studies that have been conducted on medicinal mushrooms. These modern studies have confirmed the traditional uses of many fungi and have even found new applications for them in some cases. Let's take a brief look at some of the findings. For complete summaries, see the monographs on individual species in the materia medica section. SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS ON MEDICINAL FUNGI One of the key results that has come out of both laboratory and human clinical studies conducted on fungi is that a number of compounds in fungi can stimulate immune function and inhibit tumor growth. In particular , compounds called polysaccharides , which are large, complex branched chain-like molecules built from many smaller units of sugar molecules, have been intensively studied since the 1950s. Again and again they have been shown to have antitumor and immunostimulating properties, not only from many of the medicinal mushrooms reviewed in this book, but also from lichens (such as usnea), bacteria, and even from the cell wall of a yeast (called zymosan) (Chihara et demonstrated that immune-a ctivating polysaccharides similar to those found in many fungi are also found in higher plants, such as the widely popular Echinacea and Astragalus , an important Chinese herb (W agner and Proksch, 1985). These giant molecules are similar to ones found in the cellular membranes of bacteria, and thus may \"fool\" our immune system into mounting an immune response to them, while posing no actual threat. This response has been shown to activate a variety of immune effector cell responses, including an increase in macrophage and killer T-cell activity . Since these heteropolysaccharides are considered to be among the most important of the active compounds in medicinal mush rooms, it is useful to look at them in closer detail for a moment. In fungi, polysaccharides are often molecularly bound to various proteins. Proteins are molecules that closely represent the unique identity of organisms, and thus often activ ate the immune system as they enter the body . They can sometimes initia te an immune response which does not act as a beneficial stimulant or tonic but can induce a powerful immune overreaction\u2014leading to an allergic response, for instance as in casein from milk products or gluten from wheat or grass pollens. This response can even be life-threateni ng, such as in a bee or wasp sting. I know of no reported cases of people having such extreme immunological responses to proteins in the medicinal mushrooms covered in this book; however , some people are know n to have idiosyncratic (highly individualized) reacti ons to such usually safe mushrooms as Boletus edulis. It is unknown what the allergenic compound(s) are. On the flip side, a number of mushrooms are said to increase the beneficial immune-activating response of the body . There are several questions that come up when one considers exactly what role the polysaccharides or protein-bound polysaccharides play in theoverall benefits ascribed to the herbs and mushrooms that contain them. Many existing scientific studies on medicinal mushrooms and their active components are performed with test animals such as rats and mice, where extracts of various kinds are injected, rather than given orally . It is pertinent to ask how this applies to humans using fungi for food and medicine. Do the polysacchari des, which are large molecular weight molecules, make it past the highly acidic environment of the stomach and the alkaline environment of the duodenum? Do the polysaccharides work when taken orally , or do they have to be injected? Also, when a tincture is made from the mushrooms (extracted with alcohol and water), how does the alcohol affect the polysaccharides or proteins? Are they destroyed by the alcohol, or partially broken down so that their activity is reduced? What aspects of the immune system do they activate (T-cell function and growth, macrophage activity , etc.), and how long does the activity last? While we do not know all the answers to these questions, there is some evidence to support the positive activity of polysaccharides orally , and a low (below 25%) percentage of alcohol does not seem to destroy all their beneficial effects. For insta nce, the world's oldest echinacea product that is still manufactured today is made from the freshly-pressed juice of Echinacea purpur ea (L.) Moench and then stabilized with about 24% ethanol. Because no other active compounds have been demonstrated (such as alkylamides), the manufacturer points to the polysaccharides as the immun e-activating principle. Other studies have shown that while very large molec ular-weight polysaccharides (about 800,000) activate a wide variety of immune functions, after reducing the size of the molecules by heating, the range and strength of the activity is proportionately reduced (Adachi, 1990). Small compounds with a molecular weight of about 6400 show only the ability to activate glucos e consumption (possibly lowering blood glucose) and synthesis of lysosomal enzyme (an anti-bacterial protective function). Various polysaccharides and protein-bound polysaccharides (i.e. they occur naturally bound to protein molecules) have shown strong antitumor and immune-enhancing ef fects. I have summarized a number of representative studies about active polysaccharide-containing fractions from medicinal mushrooms in Table 4. More detailed information can be found in the individual monographs. Table 4ACTIVE POLYSACCHARIDES FROM MEDICINAL FUNGI Of course polysaccharides are not the only active constituents found in fungi, nor do they show only antitumor activity . Smaller comp ounds, such as terpenes and steroids, have also been found, and some of these have shown antitumor activity . And a great number of polysaccharides and protein-bound polysaccharides have been shown to have antibiotic and antiviral properties, as well as the ability to lower blood pressure and reduceblood levels of lipids (that is, fatty acids) and sugar (Lindequist, 1990). These active compounds make many fungi useful for treating infections, flu, diabetes, heart conditions, and perhaps even AIDS. Following is a summary of research on the three fungi discussed above in the section on Chinese medicin e. These fungi are by no means the only ones studied, but two of them, ling zhi or reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and shiitake (Lentinula edodes ), are perhaps the best-known and most extensively studied mushrooms in the world. For more complete information on their chemistry and pharmacology , as well as literature references to document all of the uses, please refer to the monographs in the second half of this book. REISHI, LING ZHI In nume rous clinical trials conducted on humans over the last 20 years, Ganoderma lucidum has been used to treat a wide variety of disorders, including: neurasthenia, dizziness, insomnia, rhinitis, and duodenal ulcers retinal leukopenia, progressive muscular dystrophy , and osteogenic hyperplasia mental disease caused by environmental stress, Alzheimer's disease, hyper -lipidemia, and diabetes hepatitis and symptoms associated with anorexia high-altitude sickness (by oxygenating the blood) Of special note are reishi's actio n on the heart and lungs. In patients with coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia, reishi has been studied for its ability to alleviate symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea (sudden difficulty in breathing), precordial pain, and edema, and it seems to lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure. G. lucidum has also been used to treat heart arrhythmias. As for reishi's effect on the lungs, in one study of over 2,000 patients with chronic bronchitis, reishi brought about marked improvement in 60-90% of the patients. The older patients, especially , seemed to benefit the most (Chang & But, 1986). Bronchial asthma has also been reported to respond well to treatment with G. lucidum , as do severalother allergic diseases. Althoug h the antialler gic compounds in G. lucidum are not yet clearly understood, scientists have shown that G. lucidum inhibits the release of histamine, a compound that causes blood vessels to dilate and is responsible for swelling, inflammation, and other allergic reactions. CORDYCEPS DONG CHONG XIA CAO In the clinic, C. sinensis has been studied for the treatment of chronic obstructive liver disorders, high cholesterol, and other aging disorders, including loss of sexual drive, and has shown positive effects. C. sinensis has also been reported to be effective in the treatment of heart arrhythmias, lung carcinoma, and chronic nephritis and kidney failure. SHIITAKE Note: \"The shiitake mushroom is now Lentinula edodes ; separates it from a number of other Lentinula spp. that are not closely related. DNA studies support this separation. Many other Lentinula species are more closely related to the genus Polyporus (Arora, 1994).\" Two types of shiitake preparations have been studied extensively: lentinan, an active polysaccharid e extracted from the fungus, and an extract preparation of the mycelium of Lentinula edodes called LEM (an acronym for \"Lentinula edodes mycelia \"). In animal studies, lentinan and/or LEM have shown antitumor and antiviral activity , and a distinct stimulation of killer T-cells, which are involve d in the immune response. They have also stimulated the production and function of white blood cells, as well as the production of both antibodies and interferon (an antiviral protein), while they have inhibi ted the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are locally-acting hormones that regulate blood vessel size, mediate inflammation (a protective immune response) and smooth muscle reactivity . Another active constituent of shiitake, eritaden ine, may lower levels of choles terol in the blood (Yamamura and Cochran, 1974a). Table 5 summarizes the importantpotential uses of shiitake based on studies conducted on both animals and humans. Table 5 SUMMAR Y OF RESEARCH ON SHIIT AKE In human clinical trials, lentina n has shown antitumor activity and has been reported to increase the survival rate and length of life of women with various cancers in hundreds of patients (Aoki, 1984). Today it is commonly used for treating cancer , often in conjunction with chemotherapy . It has also been reported to be useful in treating chronic hepatitis and pulmonary tuberculosis, as well as gastric cancer , pancreatic cancer , leukemia, lymphosarcoma, and Hodgkin's disease.LEM has inhibited HIV infection of cultured human T-cells in vitro and in clinical trials (Iizuka, 1988 , 1990a,b). A symptomatic patient with antibodies to the AIDS virus and a T4 cell count of 1,250/mm3 was given a freeze-dried tea of shiitake mycelium orally at 6 g/day . The T4 cell count improved to 2,045 after 30 days and 2,542/mm3, and the symptoms were much improved after 60 days. The extract also inhibited the production of AIDS virus particles by infected T4 lymphocytes in vitro and increased the production of interleukin 1 by peritoneal macrophages. LEM may also be beneficial for non-insulin-dependent diabetics because of its reported ability to lower blood sugar levels. In Japan, lentinan is currently classified as a drug, while LEM is considered a food supplement. Note that LEM or other concentrated extracts are probably preferable to raw shiitake for medicinal purposes because they are more concentr ated and are easily absorbed in the digestive tract, but using the mushrooms in cooking and in teas may also be effectiv e. It is known that large overdoses of 10 to 50 times the normal clinical dose can lead to immune suppression, or it simply will not have any immunopotentiating effect. Otherwise, side effects are few, except for skin rashes that clear up shortly after disco ntinuing the extract.N Adaptogens and Immune Stimulants ow that we have explored some of the ways in which modern science views medicinal fungi, I would like to explain a bit about how modern herbalists and natural health practitioners classify and use fungi. Fungi are, by and large, used as adaptogens and immune stimulants. An adaptogen is any substance that meets three criteria, as defined by the Russian doctor and researcher , I.I. Brekhman, who, with his teacher , N.V. Lazarev , first defined the category of natural plant-derived \"biological response modifiers.\" These are as follows: It should cause no harm and place no additional stress on the body; It shoul d help the body adapt to the many and varied environmental and psychological stresses; and It must have a nonspecific action on the body , supporting all the major systems, such as the nervous system, hormonal system, and immune system, as well as regulating functions (such as the blood sugar); if they are too high, an adaptogen will lower it; if too high, reduce it. Through various scientific studies, it is known that the pharma cological effects of many adaptogenic herbs are complex\u2014they apparently support adrenal function (Farnsworth, 1985), and they are especially noted for their ability to build endurance and reduce fatigue. Adaptogens also stimulate the immune system indirectly , building the body's resistance to non-specif ic stresses such as novel chemicals in theenvironment, noise, pathogens, overwork, and emotional factors, among others. Immune stimulants, on the other hand, stimulate the immune system directly , boostin g its resistance to specific stresses such as pathogens, like viruses and bacteria. If you have any doubt that people today need adaptogens and immune stimulants, perhaps even as regular dietary supplements, just take a look around. The modern environmen t is full of many new biological challenges created by the industrial and electronic revolutions. This is especially true given that most of these new challenges have popped up during the last hundred years, which is quite sudden in terms of the time it takes for the human body to evolve defense mechanisms. One sign that our bodies are not yet fully adapted to these new changes and challenges is the recent proliferation of immune-based disorders such as AIDS, Candida infections, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and cancer . All of these continue to elude the stand ard methods of modern scientific medicine, despite massive efforts to stop them. For example, the American Cancer Association has spent billions of dollars over the last 20 years in search of a cure for the many forms of cancer\u2014but to no avail. One out of three Americans is now expected to contract cancer at some point in their lives. After seeing the cancer rates rise in spite of all the money poured into cancer research, the American Cancer Association recently announced that there may not be any hope of finding such a cure and that perhaps prevention is the only answer . Fortunately , TCM has been interested in preventive medicine for thousands of years, and modern western medicine is also taking a closer look. Looking at traditional medicine as a model, I have identified three separate classes of immune-acti ve herbs or herbal programs\u2014adaptogens, surface immune stimulants, and immune tonics. Each of these has a different application and works in a dif ferent way . ADAPTOGENS Adaptogens boost immunity mainly by supporting and balancing the endocrine (or hormonal) system. More specifically , laboratory tests have shown that they can support adrenal function, help the cells of the body utilize oxygen more efficiently , and increase the efficiency of cellularrespiration. Scientists are now discovering that the nervous, hormonal, and immune system s are all interc onnected and strongly affect each other (Locke and Hornig-Rohan, 1983). It is well-known, for instance, that excess cortisol (a hormone released from the adrenals in response to stress) can depress the immune system. And even more interesting, exciting new work suggests that attitudes and moods really can cause biochemical changes in the body that either enhance or depress the immune response . Thus, it is entirely plausible that adaptogens which stabilize the hormona l balance in the body can consequently enhance the functioning of the immune system. Another way in which a number of adaptogens (such as eleuthe ro, reishi, and Panax ginseng) might work is through the element germanium, which is reported to increase the uptake and utilization of oxygen in body tissues, while at the same time prote cting against damage from free radicals generated by this extra oxygen. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules (such as \u2014OH radicals) that have at least one unpaired electron. Because they like to \"grab\" electrons from nearby molecules to complete a pair (paired electrons are always more stable than single ones), they tend to react with important substances in the body , such as DNA, and are thus capable of causing widespread damage . Since more free radicals are produced during periods of increased immune-system activity (as during infections or stress), it is especially important to add adaptogens and antioxidant supplements to the diet at these times The most effective and tested nutrient antioxidants to add to an herbal regime are vitamin E and vitamin C. It is highly signi ficant, then, that some mushrooms and other adaptogenic herbs contain high amounts of germanium, which has been shown to have immunomodulating activity (Reynolds, 1993). For instance, in a recent analysis of 24 Chinese herbs, it was found that Reishi and Panax ginseng contained much higher levels of germanium than the others (Chiang and Wann, 1986). Many other medicinal mushrooms may contain large quantities of germanium, as well as polysaccharides and protein-bound polysaccharides, which have also been found to directly stimulate the immune system (Hung-Cheh & Mieng-hua, 1986). It is relevant that some reports indicate that it may not be wise to take purified germanium supplements due to possible kidney toxicity (Reynolds, 1993). IMMUNE STIMULANTSImmune stimula nts work mainly by increasing macr ophage activity . Macrophages (macro=big, phage=eater) are a kind white blood cell that \"eats up\" and destroys pathog ens such as bacteria, yeast cells, virus- infected cells, etc.\u2014a kind of garbage-disposal system. They reside in great numbers in the mucous membranes of the body\u2014especially throughout the digestive, urinary , and respiratory tracts. They also play a role in the reticuloendothelial system, which is a system of immune cells (including macrophages) centered in the spleen, liver, and lymphoid tissues that engulf and store wastes and toxic chemicals, taking them out of action. Macrophages and other phagocytes (like neutrophils) are like the body's protective shield ; they are our first line of defense. Stimulating this aspect of our immune system helps protect us against colds, flu, and infections of any kind, because these immune \"effector\" cells do not allow pathogens to even gain a foothold. Like muscles and other organs, the surface immune system needs constant exercise to keep it fit and ready to do its job. It gets natural exercise as a result of foreign organisms which we regularly ingest and inhale, as well as from minor illnesses (such as colds), bee stings, and other environmental influences. Since this exercise keeps it ready and able to fight off more serious illnesses, such as cancer , the next time you get a cold, be grateful that your surface immune system is getting a good workout! Currently , it is known that Cordyceps (Zhang et al, 1985), lentinan and LEM from shiitake (Ladanyi et polysaccharides from Trametes versicolor (PSK, PSP) (Yang et al, 1993 ; Nguyen & Stadtsbaeder , 1979) have shown an ability to stimulate macrophage activity and strengthen our immune system's fight against infection from bacteria and viruses. Herbs and other natural remedies that activate the immune system include echinace a, eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.), wild indigo (Baptisia tinctoria (L.) R. Br. ex Ait. f.), osha (Ligusticum porteri J. M. Coulter & J. N. Rose), cold-water and hot-water baths/showers, and physical exercise. Note that echinacea is really an all-star in this class. See my book Echinacea: The Immune Herb! for more information. IMMUNE TONICSImmune tonics , (spleen, kidney , or lung \"chi\" tonics as they are called in TCM) work by supporting the bone marrow reserve, from which macrophages, all other immune effector cells (such as T-cells), and red blood cells are made. Reishi is a good example of a medicinal mushroom which has been shown in labora tory tests to build up the bone marrow (Jia et al, 1993b; Guan & Cong, 1982), possibly acting a little like an \"herbal bone-marrow transplant.\" Many fungi are deep immune tonics, such as reishi, Cordyceps spp., hoelen, and shiitake. Ginseng, too, is a spleen Qi tonic, which is one reason it is so prized in TCM. An interesting case history that illustrates the difference between the surface and deep immune systems involves a group of young cancer patients who were given a surface immune stimulant combination containing echinacea, thuja , and baptisia during radiation therapy to help maintain their levels of white blood cells. In many of these children the depressed white blood cell count climbed quickly back to normal levels after taking the herbal formula for a week or ten days. Howev er, some of the children did not respond. Upon investigating this lack of response, it was found that these children had such low bone marrow reserves that they no longer had the resources to create more white blood cells, even though this immune function was stimulated. After these children rested and ate an extra nourishing diet for a period of several weeks, a number of them were able to respond positively to the immune-stimulating herbal treatment (Chone and Manidakis, 1969). The best way to take immune tonics is to eat them as part of one's regular diet, allowing them to provide the nutrients and vital substanc es the body needs to build superior immunity . This is a tradition in China and Japan, where food and medicine are not so artificially separated. If you would like to make an excellent immune tonic, try my recipe for \"Wei Qi Soup.\" The body's immune vitality is called wei Qi in TCM. This soup is very strengthening and building. It contains large quantities of vitamins and minerals in a readily assimilable form, as well as substances (such as polysaccharides) that the body can use to rebuild a weakened immune system. This recipe also provid es a great opportunity to try some of the mushrooms mentioned in this book. Try adding shiitake, turkey tail, common poria (such available in your local area.Wei Qi Soup Directions: Fill a pot 2/3 full with purified or spring water , then add: Astragalus membranaceus, 5-7 other tonifying mushrooms), 2-3 small fruiting bodies Slightly sprouted beans, 1/4-1/2 cup (aduki, black, etc.) Bring water to boil, simmer for 20 minutes, then add: Organic barley , 1/2-1 cup (choose amount depending on thickness desired) Simmer another 20 minutes, then add favorite vegetables such as: carrots & celery beet tops (or chard, collards, mustard greens, etc.) cabbage potatoes (optional) sea vegetables (nori, kelp, wakame, etc.) gobo (i.e., burdock root) nettles or other wild greens (when available) garlic & onions Simmer until the vegetables are tender , then add miso and spices such as ginger , celery , or fennel seed. Make enough for a few days and store it in the refrigerator . Indications and Dosage: During illness, when solid food is not desirable, drink 3-4 cups of the warm broth (add less barley and more water to make broth). For degenerative immune conditions, eat 1-2 small bowls per day , and drink the broth as desired. For autoimmune diseases such as aller gies, lupus, diabetes, and hepatitis accompanied by fatigue, weakness, or autoimmune conditions, eat the soup when desired, or drink the broth. This soup can be used upon occasion (1-2 times per week) for general tonification and may help to increase stamina.W A Guide to Using Medicinal Fungi ell, enough theory . At this point you probably have a number of practical questions about how to use fungi as medicine. For your convenie nce, I have compiled a table that lists the most commonly used medicinal fungi generally available in natural food stores, herb shops, Chinese herb dealers, or sometimes local acupuncturists (see the appendix for source addresses and phone numbers), along with indications for use and recommended dosages. This section will include information on making home products such as tinctures and other extracts with fungi, as well as evaluating and choosing commercially-available products. GATHERING YOUR OWN MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS I could not write a book on medicinal mushrooms without saying something about collecting wild mushrooms. An exciting aspect of medicinal mushrooms is that many of them grow commonly throughout the world. Some, such as Trametes (split-gill), may be growing right in your backyard or in a local wooded area. I like to encourage those who are interested to develop an active interest in mushroom hunting (and home growing to preserve our wild resources), for not only is eating wild mushrooms beneficial to our health but so is the activity of roaming through the woods.The rich smells of the earth (abundant with fungal myceli um), the splashes of fall colors, and the soothing greens of mosses and ferns enliven one's spirit and senses. I often walk down creek beds, fording small brooks here and there to check brightly-colored spots, in case they might be a chanterelle or sulfur shelf, rather than another dying leaf among a thousand. I splash through pools, picking up sticks tufted with Usnea and other lichens for later use. I climb up on banks thick with leaf-litter and twigs, run my hand down the length of smooth alder logs, checking for tiny Pleurotus buttons. One of my great est joys is filling my daypack with paper bags of various sizes, as well as wax paper (to protect delicate mushrooms), a basket, and a good field guide or two, and going on a mushroom foray . Stalking wild mushrooms seems to satisfy a deep instinct for the hunt and allows me to pick food and medicine that are entirely renewable, as long as I remember to be conscious about the gift of the earth that is being offered and pick carefully and respectfully . Here are a few helpful suggestions for conservation of useful fungi. Slice fungi that have stalks at the base, or carefully twist and pull them up. T ry not to disturb the mycelium. When pulling conks from live or dead trees, always leave one or two to encourage the distribution of spores. The mycelium is a perennial growth, insuring that the fungus will continue to flourish inside trees or decaying logs, until the work of breaking down molecules such as cellulose is complete. To insure that specific fungi can continue to spread through areas of the forest eco-system where they are needed, some spore-producing conks must be preserved. Also remember that when we remove one conk, we are removing years of growth rather than days. The less we disturb the forest duff while walking or picking, the better; remember to walk lightly so no one can tell that you passed there. Cover over any holes where mushrooms are cut with dirt, duff, or leaves. This shows respect for the earth as well as for other pickers\u2014there is nothing more depressing than seeing holes where mushrooms once were. Besides the walking, bending, crawling, and climbing that is necessary in a good mushroom hunt, the solitude and close contact with nature is ahealing connection that soothes the soul and calms the spirit. So many times I have felt the turbulence of the human world in my mind and body and have gone out into the woods and found the serenity that comes when a contact is made with our higher intelligence through nature. I find nibbling on wild mushrooms such as the Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) to be very ener gizing. The first thing that may come to mind when it comes to picking wild mushrooms is the possibility of eating a poisonous one\u2014and a healthy respect for this potential is good. Though it is true that some mushrooms are poisonous, most are not. There are plenty of unmistakable medicinal mushrooms that you can gather safely\u2014and if you are ever in doubt about a particular one, just play it safe. It is best for beginners to learn two or three easily identified mushrooms found in one's local area, as well as how to distinguish them from potentially poisonous mushrooms. Local community colleges or city adult educatio n programs often offer good mushroom- hunting classes. Weekend seminars can also be found in the fall in many areas, and these provide an invaluable opportunity to learn from the experts. As for mushroom guidebooks, there are several good ones that have color photographs, detailed descriptions, and pointers to aid the novice and experienced hunter alike. My favorite is David Arora's Mushr ooms Demystified (1986), which offers a wonderful mixture of good scholarship, the expe rience of many years of field work, humor , a meticulous attention to detail s, and the best keys to the identification of the fungi of the western United States available (though it is useful for other areas as well). This book has much valuable inform ation about American, and especially West Coast, species of fungi. See the Resources section in the Appendix for other choices. You will also want to learn how to prepare tasty wild mushroo m dishes. Where I live, in Santa Cruz, California, one of the highlights of the fall season is the \"Fungus Fair,\" sponsored by the city museum and the Fungus Federation, where exotic mushroom dishes are sampled by thousands of eager fungiphiles. I've included a few mushroom recipes here to get you started. For more, see Wild Mushr oom Cookery (eds. Wells, Rogers, and Piekenbrock, 1987) and A Passio n for Mushr ooms by Antonio Carluccio. You may be surprised to learn that mushrooms can be highly nutritious, in addition to being medicinal and tasty (see the section on the nutritionalvalue of fungi). So there's one last reason to get interested in mushrooms. Now go out there and experiment. Remember , fungi are fun! OTHER SOURCES OF MEDICINAL FUNGI There are an increasing number of people dealing in medicinal mushrooms and their products in the U.S., Europe, and Austra lia. In Asia, where they have been popular for centuries, mushrooms are increasingly being recognized as useful in medicine. This increased use is partly driven by modern research showing how valuable compounds such as lentinan can be for supporting the immune systems of people with cancer while they are under going treatments with chemotherapy , and partly because the art of cultivation of many medicinal species has reached a point where growers can supply the increasing market demand (Stamets, 1994). There are currently a number of growers of shiitake, reishi, and other medicinal specie s in the U.S. Here is a list of the most promising ways of obtaining medic inal mushrooms and their products. See the Appendix for a list of suppliers and growers. Table 6 SOURCES OF MEDICINAL FUNGI Type of Pr oduct Sour ce Bulk mushrooms Natural food stores (reishi, shiitake) Markets (shiitake, Chinese herb dealers turkey tail, auricularia, tremella, honey mushroom, chanterelles, and many others) Powdered concentrates (capsules, tablets, granules)Natural food stores (reishi, shiitake, maitake, cordyceps) Chinese herb dealers (formulas, freeze-dried granules to make instant tea, reishi tea cubes) Herb shops (same as natural food stores) Selected drug stores (reishi)Type of Pr oduct Sour ce Liquid extract products (tinctures, ampules\u2014 extract in honey base)Natural food stores (reishi, shiitake, cordyceps, rarely others) Herb shops (same as above) Chinese herb dealers (reishi, shiitake, cordyceps) STORING MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS When storing fleshy mushroom s, such as shiitake or Pleur otus, it is usually best to dry them. Small food driers are readily available at many department stores for under $50 and are well worth the investment. Any mushrooms I pick during the fall and winter seasons that I don't eat are dried for use throughout the rest of the year. Heavy , conk-like polypores such as Ganoderma applanatum are perennials and will readily dry, maintaining (even for years) the same appearance and medicinal properties as the day they were picked. Besides their medicinal use, they make great conversation pieces and desk ornaments. I have several brightly-colored red-belted polyp ores that have been on my desk for several years and they still look as fresh as the day I picked them! More delicate polypores, such as Trametes versicolor , should be quickly dried in a food drier or even the oven on low heat (there are no active volatile substances to worry about), as they will soon be turned to sawdust by fly larvae if left in the open air to dry on their own. MAKING PREPARATIONS: POWDERS, POWDERED EXTRACTS, PILLS, ENCAPSULATION Since the scientific literature seems to point to whole mushroom fruiting bodies as being especially active as antitumor agents and immune enhancers, I recommend taking dried and powdered mushrooms by the teaspoon, either in a cup of ginger tea, or even sprinkled into soup or on stir-frys and rice, etc. Some conk-like fungal fruiting bodies such as artist's conk or red-belted polypore cannot be powdered because they are too tough and fibro us. These can be sliced (or sawed) into thin slices and dried for tea or tincturing. Softer and thinner polypores or dried fleshy fungi can easilybe powd ered and encapsulated. When placed in \"00\" capsules, the average amount of powdered mushroom/capsule is about 400 mg. For mild to moderate immu ne support I recommend 2 capsules morning and evening. For specific immune-suppressed conditions, take 2-3 capsules 3 times a day. To make a mushroom extract that is stronger and more readily assimilated, try simmering the mushrooms (as many fruiting bodies or pieces as can be covered by the water in a pot) for about an hour. Strain off the dark tea and replace the liquid with fresh water to cover the mushrooms and simm er for another 30 minutes. Strain the new tea and add it to the first decoction. Throw the soggy , spent fruiting bodies away . Combine the first and second decoctions and begin simmering. Reduce this liquid to a thick paste, which might take as much as several hours. Take this paste off the heat, scrape it out with a cake spatula, and knead it with an organic rice or wheat flour to a dough-like consistency . Pack small pieces of this dough into \"00\" capsules and take 1 of them morning and evening. The dough can also be dried in a food drier or oven with low heat. The dried extract pieces can then be powdered in a blender or coffee grinder . The powder can be packed into capsules, sprinkled on food, or try adding a half-teaspoon to one cup of warm water or ginger decoction for an instant immune- supportive tea. In my experience, these extracts are stronger than simple mushroom powders, and the preparations retain the polysaccharides, or their breakdown products and nutritional qualities in a readily-assimilable form, though there is little scien tific data available on what effect the heat has on the ef ficacy of these compounds. TEAS AND SOUPS Teas are a good way to use medicinal mushrooms, and they should be simmered until the tea is somewhat dark and strong-tasting\u2014about 40 minutes to an hour. Add ginger or other flavorful herbs (1/8 part by weight of the mushroom s) and a little licorice (1/16th part) to help improve the taste, which might be somewhat bitter in its native state. For soups, add a variety of vege tables, such as broccoli, carrots, potatoes, beets, greens, garlic, onions, and a little seaweed and barley (to thicken) to the mush room tea stock. Fish, chicken, or a little red meat can be added forcertain deficiency conditions. Drink the broth (1-3 cups a day) and eat the vegetables. T ender fleshy fungi, such as shiitake and oyster mushrooms, can be eaten with enthusiasm, but it is best to push tough and fibrous fungal fruiting body chunks such as reishi, artist's conk, and turkey tail aside\u2014the essence has already permeated the broth, and they are far too tough to chew , even after boiling (unless you are a 3 or 4 pack of gum a day fan and have very well-developed jaws). PREPARING A TINCTURE; MAKING A LIQUID EXTRACT Making tinctures is a time-honored method of extracting and preserving the active ingredients of medici nal herbs and mushrooms. When making a tincture, use either 190 proof clear grain alcohol, if available (called Clear Spring in some places) diluted 50-50 with distilled water for most fungi, or if it is not availa ble, 80 or 100 proof vodka. To determine the percentage of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in a given proof product, divide by two. In other words, a common 80 proof vodka will contain 40% ethyl alcohol. This strength of liquid solvent, which is called the menstruum, is fine for tincturing many medicinal mushrooms. The process is simple . Place the chopped up dried mushroom pieces in a blender and cover with the menstruum. Blend until the consistency is similar to that of a fruit smoothie and pour into a quart or half-gallon canning jar. After half an hour, a clear one inch of menstruum should appear , and the blended mushroom fibers and particles should sink into a solid mass at the bottom. Make sure that there is at least an inch of clear menstruum after settling, so that none of the actual mushroom material stick s up above the top of the liquid, because fermentation can take place leading to off-flavors in the finished tincture. Shake the bottle every day and keep it in a warm place out of the direct sunlight. After two weeks, squeeze as much of the liquid from the mushroom mass as possible and bottle the mostly clear tincture. This liquid can then be stored in a cannin g jar or other suitable glass container for future use. It will retain its potency for two to three years. This type of tincture is a simple single liquid extraction, and it should contain a good amount of the major active constituents. My favorite method of creating a liquid extract of dried mushrooms for tonic long-term use is to make a double extraction. For this, the first liquid extract is separated from the extracted (or \"spent\") herb mass, which iscalled the \"marc.\" Set the alcoho lic tincture aside and then simm er (decoct) the marc in five times its volume of distilled water for an hour. Let the brew cool and then filter and squeeze as much of the water from the marc as possible. Compost this last marc, and begin simmering the watery decoction under low heat. Evaporate this to about one-fifth its original voume, and add enough of this concentrate to the first alcoholic tincture so that the final concentration of alcohol is at least 20-25%, which is needed to preserve the preparation. Some measuring is needed, but this can be calculated by knowing the approximate alcoh olic percentage in the first tincture. I feel, based on my experience, that this \"double extraction\" is richer in the immune-activating and anti-tumor polysaccharides, as well as the protein- bound polysaccharides and will be more tonifying than the original alcoholic preparation. Simmering the herb in water may soften and break down cell walls, releasing immune-strengthening high molecular -weight polysaccharides. DOSES It is best to take any tonic herbs, such as medicinal mushrooms, for at least three months, up to nine months. This is a general course for any \"constitutional remedy\" taken for its general tonic and strengthening effects. Take 1/2 to 1 tsp of the homem ade tincture morning and evening in a little water or ginger tea as a good average dose. Also follow the suggested dosages in the sections on individual mushrooms. mushrooms are 85-95% water , they do have signfica nt nutritional value. A number of reliable laboratory analyses of edible and medicinal mushrooms are available, especially on commercially important species such as Agaricus Kurtzman, 1993; Garcha et al, 1993). It has been estimated that of approximately 38,000 species of fungi worldwide, as many as 2,000 may be edible. My feeling is that this figure is very conservativ e. Fungi may be one of the world's greatest natural food resources, becau se they are able to transform nutritionally poor substances into foods rich in fat and protein . Edible fungi can be grown on cheap food by-products such as molasses, vegetable scraps, potatoes, and even sulfite waste liquids from the wood-pulping industry . The potential nutritional value of mushrooms ranking the highest on several internat ionally-accepted tests compares with meat and milk, whereas the least nutritive mushrooms are similar to common vegetables such as carrots and turnips (Cris an & Sands, 1987). It is also intseresting to note that a numb er of wild mush rooms are consistently more nutritious than their cultivated relatives. For instance, the straw mushroom, Volvariella volvacea , (=Lepiota (Morchella esculenta shiitake (L. edodes)\u2014 while tempting in texture and flavor\u2014rated lower . Although there is a wealth of information on the levels of important nutrients such as protein, carboh ydrates (soluble and insoluble fiber), amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, it is often difficult to interpret the data. The two main problems are the lack of uniform procedures and techniques among laboratories and the different ways of reporting the data. Even when data between mushroom species is comparable, it is hard to determine the significance in human nutrition. This is because a lab value of the percentage of protein in shiitak e, for instance, says little about how much protein we can actually utilize. This depends not only on our own individual digestive capacity\u2014the effectiveness of our digestive enzymes to extract the nutrients and how the mushroom is prepared or cooked\u2014but in the quality and composition of the protein, as well as how it is bound to other molecules, such as carbohydrates. Mushroom protein digestibility ranges from 34-97%, taking either egg protein or casein (from milk) as a standard 100% (Crisan and Sands, 1978; Garcha et al, 1993), possibly because mushrooms are high in free essential and non-essentia l amino acids. In animal feeding experiments, the addition of mush room pellets to the basal diet led to increased body weights. The rats increased food intake in the mushroom groups, especiall y when fed Pleur otus florida, but not as much when fed A. bisporus. Lipid peroxidation and organ weight tests revea led no toxic reactions even when the mushrooms were consumed in significant amounts (Garcha et al, 1993). Imaki and his co-workers (1991) determined the digestibility of shiitake by measuring various components in the fecal output and comparing it to the nutrient levels in the fruiting bodies and the percentage of the diet. When shiitake was added to the diet of volunteers at 40g/day , the digestibility of protein (from the was 65.8 +/- 13.1%, and the ratio of the total avail able energy to intake energy (Net Energy Availability) was 67.4 +/- 25.9%. At 60 g/day , the digestibility of the above nutrients was somewhat reduced. The range of nutritional content between mushroom species is wide, and different popula tions of mushrooms are known to vary considerably in their nutrient content and digestibilit y even within the same species (Crisan &Sands, 1978), possibly becau se of harvest during different stages of maturity and dif ferent growth substrates (Garcha et al, 1993). Because of this, figures for the nutritional content of edible and medicinal species in Table 7 are given as a range of values, based on high and low figures from a number of published studies. The figures are based on mg/1 00 grams of dry mushr oom weight, unless otherwise stated. Fresh mushrooms contain about 85-95% water , so divide figures by ten to approximate the nutrient amounts. Generally , prote in concentration s range from 1-4% of fresh weight, or about 10-45% of dry weight, a significant amount. It is also known that up to 40% of the amino acids in mushrooms are essential amino acids. The fairy ring mushroom (Marasmius oreades [Bolt.:Fr .] Fr.) has one of the highest protein contents at 50-55%, while the chanterelle ranges from 11.8- 24.3% and the king bolete (cep), 27-35.8% (V etter, 1993). Carbohydrates range from 3-28% of fresh weight and fiber from 3-32%, usually consistin g of pentoses like xylose galactose sugar alcohols like mannitol (particularly abundant) and inositol, to name only a few. Large polysaccharides commo nly found in mushrooms include glycogen, which is the same energy-storage compound animals use, and chitin, the main compound of insoluble mushroom fiber . Many classes of lipid compound s are represented in mushrooms, such as free fatty acids, mono-, di-, and triglycerides, sterols, sterol esters, and phospholipids. Fats usually range from 0.2-0.8% of fresh weight, or between 2-8% of the dry weight, with linoleic acid (an esssential fatty acid) being the most abundant lipid (Senatore, 1990). The content of this important fatty acid can be comparable to the amount in safflower seed oil, which is considered a rich source. When preparing mushrooms for the table, save the stem, which contains a higher content of linoleic acid than the cap. No one will gain weight when dining on fungi, except when they are saut\u00e9ed in copious amounts of butter! And think of the calories you will burn hunting them. Mushrooms are a good source of several vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, and vitamin C. Even beta-carotene , while not common in mushrooms, can be found in some species. The minerals phosphorus, sodium, and potass ium are fairly high, while iron and calcium are present but tend to be low, with a few exceptions (Crisa n & Sands,1987). It is also notable that mushrooms may accumulate heavy metals (especially lead and cadmium) in some species, perhaps related to the environment in which they are picked (Breene, 1990). Nutritional profiles of five common medicinal mushrooms are presented in Table 7. The figures are drawn predominantly from Crisa n & Sands (1978), Bano & Rajarathnam (1988), Breene (1990), Ershow & Wong-Chen (1990), Kurtzm an (1993), and Garcha et al (1993). Because fresh mushrooms vary considerably in water content, the figures are calculated on a dry-weight basis, which allows a greater consistency of data. To determine an approximate fresh-weight value, divide by 10 if the mushroom is very fresh (just picked), 9 if it has been in the refrigerator for a day or two, or 8 if purchased from the store. Table 7 NUTRIENT CONTENT OF EDIBLE AND MEDICINAL FUNGI (PER 100 GRAMS)It is also interesting to note that the members of the Polyporaceae (polypores) had relatively low mineral contents, and the percentage of copper , zinc, manganese, and lead was lower in mushrooms that were growing on wood than on the ground (Kawai et al, 1990). The levels of vitamin D2 in maitake, shiitake, and a number of other medicinal and edible mushroom s were determined by HPLC analysis and found to be in the range of 10 to 150 IU in 100 g of fresh fruiting bodies (Yokokawa & Takahashi, 1990). Ergosterol, a pro-vitamin D which is converted to vitamin D under the influence of sunlight, makes up more than 70% of the total sterol fraction in many mushrooms, and about 55-65% of itis in the free form. Shiitake mushrooms containing about 0.5% ergosterol (dry weight) were able to produce 400 IU of vitamin D per gram after being exposed to a fluorescent sunlamp (Breene, 1990). How does cooking affect the nutrients in mushrooms? Some heat-labile nutrients such as vitamin C, thiamine, and other B-vitamins are obviously diminished (often up to 50-70%) or destroyed. Most minerals are unaf fected and can actually become more available after cooking. Fiber is generally broken down to a degree, and protein is affected, though its value is probably not diminished. Stir-frying or saut\u00e9eing lightly , a traditional way to use choice edible species, will obviously preserve more unstable nutrients than boiling. Medicinal species, especially tough polypore conks, are best well-boiled. Most of the active constituents are associated with cell wall structures and may be release d, becoming more available to express their healing properties, after simmering for 45 minutes to over an hour. Other active constituents such as terpenes are also more soluble in very hot water and are relatively stable to heat. It is not known for certain whether vitamins and minerals play a significant role in the healing properties of medicinal fungi, but again, immune-enhancing minerals, such as germanium and zinc, are more accessible to the human system after cooking. Antinutritional Properties of Mushrooms It is important to consider anti-nutritional factors that may be present in raw mushrooms. For instanc e, it is known that A. bisporus and P. ostreatus contain hemagglutinins that have been shown to interfere with protein absorption in rats and have even produced lesions in the small intestine. After cooking at 100 degrees C for 1 hour they did not produce lesions. It is probably wise to cook most wild mushrooms that are eaten in any quantity . Besides just a taste to aid in identification of the species, I only eat three wild mushrooms raw\u2014 Agaricus campestris , the Tremella spp., witch's butter . I find them mild and delicious and have never experienced abdominal discomfort after ingesting them. I have tried oyster mushrooms raw but found them distinctly unappealing, which is interesting, because they are one of my favorites when cooked properly .Mushroom Recipes Stuffed Shiitakes 1 dozen shiitakes 1 onion 1/2 cup celery 1 cup bread crumbs 1/2 dozen wild mushrooms (oyster , honey , etc.) chopped parsley 2 tblsp olive oil cloves garlic 1/2 tsp tamari 1/3-2/3 cups parmesan paprika Cut the stems of f shiitakes and chop them finely .

Christopher's Late, W inter, Early Spring Nettles and Chanter elle Soup Gingerly pick the nettle tops (about 3-5 pairs of leaves down the stem) with clippers. Use gloves to protect tender skin, though a few stings are part of the ritual of spring nettle-picking and actually have a healing ef fect, activating blood and preventing arthritis and neuralgia, according to traditional medicine. Placethe nettles into paper bags. Nearby , neatly cut of f about a dozen fresh chanterelles under oaks and brush leaves over the cut stems as a way of showing respect. Place into mushroom basket and give abundant thanks for the gifts of the earth. Note: chanterelles from the store are not quite as fun but will serve nicely . At home, cook a soup stock with chicken, or with stir -fried onions, garlic, seaweed, and herbs. Add the chanterelles sliced into pieces of desired size to the stir -fry, and when done, combine with about 3 quarts of water . Add a variety of fresh vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, squash, burdock root, etc.), 2 medium-sized leeks, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Dip out about a quart of the soup stock and blend with enough fresh trimmed nettles to fill the blender to a puree. Add this back into the soup stock and simmer for another 15-20 minutes. Serve with good hearty bread if desired. This soup is as nutritious as it is delightful to the palate. The nettles are thought by many herbalists to build the blood because of their high mineral content; the burdock is traditionally recommended to stimulate liver and digestive function and has been reported to have antimutagenic ef fects (Morita, 1985); and the chanterelles soothe and nourish the liver and the eyes according to TCM.

Most of the information comes from China, Japan, Europe, and published materials from other parts of the world. We have been comprehensive in our collection of material, and our search for information, especially on the historical and cultural uses, is on- going. This material will eventually be incorporated into a second edition. As can be seen from the bibliography , we consulted nearly 900 articles and books. We have also gathered stories and information from practitioners of Traditional Chin ese Medicine and others with experience with useful fungi. Finally , I have added my own personal experience with a number of species gathered over the last 20 years. I have identified, harvested, extracted, and eaten many of the following mushrooms, and used some in a clinical setting. Most of the species are either available in natural food stores, from Chinese herb dealers (see resou rce section), or in the wild, and all have a history of human use, sometim es for thousands of years, and have shown positive physiological activity in scientific studies. The chemistry of fungi is a fascinating area of research in itself. It is interesting to note that many steroid compounds have been isolated from genera such as Amanita, Rhizopus, Polyporus, Hydnum, Fomes , and Ganoderma. For a review of these compounds, see the List of FungalProducts by Shibata et al (1964). Generally speaking, low molecular -weight compounds from Basidiomycetes, such as terpenes and steroids (which are more alcohol-so luble), have antitumor activity , while high molecular - weight comp ounds such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipopolysaccharides (which are better extracted with hot water ) may have antibiotic, cyctostatic, immunostimulating, virostatic, antialler gic, hypoglycemic, and hypotensive properties in addition to antitumor activity (Lindequist, 1990). A list of terms used commonly in the ensuing monographs is given below in the Appendix on page 202. In order to avoid repetition, I shall define them in the Appendix rather than explain them in parenthetical statements throughout the text. An underst anding of these terms will greatly enhance comprehension of the information presented on pharmacological activity . A word about such information as \"Taste and Energy\" and traditional contraindications found in the individual monographs. This is included to help health practitioners and herbalists who use a traditional system of energetics to determine the correct use and dosage for a given individual patient. The information was gathered from Chinese works on medicinal herbs, such as Bensky & Gamble (1993), Liu and Bau (1980), Hsu (1986), and from the author 's own experience. Gifts of Forest and Field, from One Thousand American Fungi by Charles McIlvaine, 1902AMANITA MUSCARIA (LINN.:FR.) PERS.:HOOKER (musca=fly , amanita=Galen' s after Mt. Amanus) FLY AGARIC Synonyms Agaricus muscarius Pers. Other Common Names Japan it is called \"beni-tengu-take\" (scarlet long-nosed goblin mushroom) (Ott, 1976). Amanita muscaria stamp fr om Bulgaria. Description and Habitat One of the most striking of fungi, it has a bright red cap scattered regularly with white (or sometimes yellow) dots. These are the most obvious identifying featu res. Like other Amanitas, there is a ring on the stalk and a scaly , attached volval cup at the bottom. The spore print is white, and in mature fruiting bodies the gills are free from the stalk. Fly agaric grows in woods, usually mycorrhizal with pine, spruce, fir, birch, and aspen (Arora, 1986). Range Common throughout the northern hemisphere and abundant in pine plantations in the southern hemisphere (New Zealand, Australia, etc.). HistoryA quote from a traditional legen d of the Koryak tribe of Kamchatka, Siberia goes as follows: \"Then the Big-Raven said, 'Let the Agaric remain on earth, and let my children see what it will show them.'\" Fly agaric derives its name from the ancients who mixed it with milk to stupefy flies (Cooke, 1977). Amanita has traditionally been used for epilepsy and to soothe spinal irritations (Rolf e & Rolfe, 1925), and by the Russians and Vikings as a hallucinogen (Ramsbottom, 1953). For centuries, the consumption of A. muscaria was practiced among native peoples of West Siberia, such as the Khanty , from the Taimyr peninsula, and nations on the continent east of a line drawn through the mouth of the Kolyma River and on the Kamchatka peninsula, including the Chukchi, the Koryak, the Eskimos, and Russians (Saar , 1991b). The custom is still practiced today , and the mushroom is considered a \"supernatural being.\" Although the use of A. muscaria to enter into the world of supernatural beings and communicate with them is often found among the highest and most sacred persons, it is also eaten by all classes, including the common people. The mushroom was also used in magical rites, associate d with such activities as communication with the souls of the dead, discovery of the name of a newborn child, to aid in assessing a dangerous situation and overcoming it, for the interpretation of dreams, for predicting the future, seeing the past, and visiting other worlds (Saar , 1991b). A. muscaria was also used by healers to divine the nature of illness. In this case, it is thought that the spirit of the mushroom enters the shaman or wise woma n who then speaks and acts through them. The consumption of the mushroo m is said to give the eater ample courage to communicate with the awesome spirit world and to meet powerful spirits, just as the bear eats it in order to have courage during mating. Songs were often sung in order to make a conn ection with spirits. The following is a Khanty song which was reported by Saar (1991b). Oh you little gold-stiped fly-agaric, chao-chao-chao, brought me, chao-chao-chao, Little patterned-stiped fly-agaric, chao-chao-chao, Many messages, many words you have, chao-chao-chao, (An unknown word) is placed on golden grass, chao-chao-chao, Little duckling, little duck, chao-chao-chao, One half of you walks on the ground, chao-chao-chao, The other half of you walks on the ground, chao-chao-chao,So one must rock, chao-chao-chao, You are among fly agarics a little fly-agaric. The mushroom was also eaten to increase physical endurance for working, hunting, resisting cold, and traveling long distances by foot. A. muscaria was used in homeopathic and herbal practice in early 19th century European and America n medicine. For instance, an extract of fly agaric was prescribed by the Eclectics in the early 19th century for night sweats due to debilitating disease as well as \"profuse sweating during the daytime.\" The dose given was 5 drops of a 1% solution of extra ct (Felter & Lloyd, 1898). Culbreth (1927), another Eclectic doctor , reported that this fungus \"reduce s force and frequency of pulse, contracts muscles of intestines and bladder , increases abdominal secretions, causes dyspnea, paralysis, death.\" He also said that it is given \"for intestinal torpor , duodenal catarrh, diabetes, antidote to atropine to replace physostigmine.\" As Agaricus muscarius it was introduced into the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia in 1828 (HPUS 8, 1978). Chemistry It is now known that A. muscaria contains a variety of potentially hallucinogenic and toxic compounds, and the closely-relate d Amanita pantherina produces them in even higher concentrations. It contains the isoxazole deriva tive, ibotenic acid, as well as its decarboxylation product muscimole (not present in the fresh fruiting body) and the related muscazone (Tyler, 1977). The quaternery compounds musc aridine and muscarine have also been identified, but the alkaloids bufotenine, atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine reported in earlier studies are now known not to occur (Falch et al, 1984; Moore-Landecker The quaternery compound muscarine is found in trace amounts but probably does not have hallucin ogenic properties; however , it can produce such unpleasant side effects as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, excess salivation, and tearing (Cooke, 1977). Muscimol is another similar compound that may not be prese nt in the fresh fruiting body but is a breakdown product of ibotenic acid produced in the body after its ingestion. Muscimol is also closely related chemically to GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter inthe brain. Both of the compo unds affect brain concentrations of other neurotransmitters, such as NE, 5- HT, and Dopamine in the same manner as LSD. Tests with humans have shown that a large amount of ibotenic acid taken orally could be detected in the urine within 90 minutes, and the breakdown product, muscimol, is probably excreted in this manner as well, possibly leading to a stronger effect from the urine products than the original mushroom. This seem s to support stories of people in Siberia drinking the urine of A. muscaria ingestors in order to maximize or prolong the hallucinogenic effects (Ramsbottom, 1953). Reports from Siberia say that a dose of A. muscaria can be recycled through 4 or 5 people (Ott, 1976). Ott reports that because a higher concentration of the water-soluble toxins are concentrated in the skin on the cap, people often peel this off and parboil the remainder when preparing the mushroom for food, though this practice is not recommended. Muscarine has a choliner gic effect on the peripheral nervo us system; however , it does not enter the central nervous system (Falch et al, 1984). These compounds are also known to produce such unpleasant effects as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, tearing, and salivation (Cooke, 1977). It has also been theorized that the hallucinogenic effects of the two Amanita species might be based on the cyclic acid, muscimol, working syner gistically with the two cyclic amino acids, muscazone and ibotenic acid. Variations in the vision-producing effects that researchers have experienced might be due to differing levels of active compounds as well as the potential of the individual to \"suspend belief\" and allow the experience to unfold without the burden of the modern skeptical mind (Cooke, 1977). It is interesting to note that studies show the ethanol extract of sporophore inhib its the growth of sarcoma 180 in mice, but it is quite toxic and kills insects (Y ing et al, 1987). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity Considered poisonous by many writers. Three undried fruiting bodies are said to be lethal by some cultures in Siberia and Eastern Russia , but among cultures who use them regularly , up to 21 fruiting bodies are reported to be eaten. Between 1 and 11 is more common (Saar , 1993). Among people who do not use A. muscaria culturally , the fungus should be consideredpotentially dangerous. Extreme caution should be exercised when ingesting even one-half of a fruiting body , and the author is not suggesting that the reader should experiment with them\u2014I am simply reporting on the cultural and medical uses. Uses in T raditional Medicine The taste and energy is sweet and cool. In certain areas of Japan, quantities of A. muscaria are dried, pickle d, then thoroughly washed prior to ingestion as a food (Ott, 1976), though this is not recommended due to its inherent toxicity . This species is also used as a visionary and divinatory substa nce. The culture and attitude of the person taking it are said to be directly related to the quality of the experience. One should have reverence and humility , and it is important to tell the mushroom spirit the purpose of its use, even in a loud voice (Saar , 1991b). Medical Uses Homeopaths only!) to treat chorea and skin afflictions; it is specific for bunions and sunstroke, and it is reported to clear up some types of cataracts (HPUS 8, Ramsbottom, 1953). Preparation and Dosage For medical use, in homeopathic dilution only (Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the U.S., 8th ed. under \"Bug Agaric,\" Agaricus muscarius). Among peoples who used A. muscaria for the traditional uses detailed above, the young fruiting bodies picked before the caps were fully expanded were considered the most effective, particularly for increasing endurance, but older specimens were considered better to induce hallucinations or euphoria (Saar , 1991b). The fungus is eaten in a variety of forms, and which one is best depends on the local customs of the people who are using it. Saar (1991b) mentions fifteen ways of admi nistration\u2014 namely eating it raw, fried, cooked, dried, in the form of an extract or tea, drinking the urine of a person who has already ingested the mushroom, or eating the flesh of a reindeer who has eaten it. The most common way of eating A. muscaria was after drying, because it is thought that fresh mushrooms were more poisonous. Over the last 20 years, I have often heard this idea in speaking with peopl e who have experience with the mushrooms in the western part of the U.S. Fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.) wassometimes adde d to the mushroom preparation to reduce toxicity or potentiate its action. The number of fruiting bodies consumed at one session varies, but it is generally reported to be between 1/2 to 1 1 (Saar , 1991b). For hallucinations, 3-11 mature fruiting bodies are recommended; for facilitating work, 3-5 young mushrooms; for simply inducing a pleasant state, 3 fruiting bodies are suf ficient. Related Species Amanita pantherina (DC:Fr.) Seer. has a similar chemistry but is reported to contain more ibotenic acid and muscimol than A. muscaria (Ott, 1976). Amanita is a dangerous genus to experiment with! Some of its members, such as A. phalloides, A. ocreata, A. bisporigera Atkinson, and A. verna are deadly . Learn to recognize these before experimenting with any gilled fungi for edible or medicinal purposes. Fig. 6: Amanita phalloides from The Natural History of Plants & Oliver , 1896. Procur in homeopathic dilution where homeopathic remedies are sold, e.g. natural food stores and some pharmacie s. The fresh fungi can be picked in the summer and fall under conifers and birches in many parts of (armilla=a mellea (Vahl.:Fr .) Kar . Other Common Names It is called oak root fungus in California because of its affinity for oaks (Arora, 1986) and is also known as honey-tuft fungus (Ramsbottom, 1953). Other names include honey fungus, honey agaric, halimasch, shoeshing fungus, and honey cap (Liu and Bau, 1980). Description and Habitat This honey-colo red mushroom is actually a group of very similar species collectively called the honey mushroom (Arora, 1994). It is extremely variable in color and habit and often grows in clusters on dead wood (sometimes submer ged, giving the appearance that they are growing on the ground), and it has dark fibers on its cap that tend to concentr ate towards the center . It also has a white or honey-colored ring toward the top of the stalk, though this may be absen t. The yellow- capped variety is most often found on hardwoods, while the pinkish-brown variety grows on conifer wood (Miller , 1979; Arora, 1986). In Asia, the fungus forms an interesting symbiotic relatio nship with the medicinal orchid, Gastr odia elata Blume in parts of Asia. Range Honey mushrooms are cosmop olitan, widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere. They are among the most common mushrooms, often occurring in lar ge numbers in the late summer and fall. History No data. Chemistry The major constituents isolated to date include the sesquiterpeno id a, b; 1990a, b, as well as the sesquiterpene aryl esters, armillyl everninate and et al,1986 ; Junshan et al, 1984; Yang et al, 1984.) In the mycelium extract, armillane (Donnelly & Hutchinson, 1990) is present. The volatile organic acids found in A. mellea consist of mostly propionic, valeric, isocapro ic, and caproic acids, with valeric abundant of them . Isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and heptanoic acids are minor constituents (Hong et al, 1990). The nutritional value of honey mushrooms is significant, and because of their abundance, may be a good dietary supplement. I have dried them for use throughout the winter and early summer months. Published analyses show that the protein content varies from 11.4-29.2%, total carbohydrate, 75.9%, calories 384 Pharmacology A. mellea has shown antibiotic action (in vitro) against the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and B. subtilis (Richard, 1970). Armillar ic acid, recently isolated from A. mellea , inhibits Gram- positive bacteria and yeast (Obuchi et al, 1990), while a polypeptide dextran exhibits antitumor activity (Ying et al, 1987). In vitro studies with the mycelial extract of Armillaria mellea also showed significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Donnelly , 1986). Animal studies on A. mellea reported that it decreases heart rate, reduces peripheral and coronary vascular resistance, increases cerebral blood flow (Chang & But, 1986), exhibits a cerebral-protective effect with AMG-1 (a compound isola ted from A. mellea) (Watanabe et al, 1990), and increases coronary oxyge n efficiency without altering blood pressure (Zhang et al, 1985; Chang & But, 1986). In addition, it has demonstrated sedative and anticonvulsant activity (Chang & But, 1986). Polysaccharides from A. mellea have helped to protect animals against the negative side effects of exposure to ionizing radiation (W ang et al, 1989). Human Clinical Studies A. mellea has been reported to reduce symptoms of essential and renal hypertension, as well as neurasthenia (Chang & But, 1986).Toxicity May cause nausea especially if not well-cooked or consumed with alcohol; poisonings may also be related to host (e.g. buckeye) (Arora, 1994). In some people the fungus may cause diarrhea (though I have not observed it), reflected in the German name Hallimasch, said to be a contraction for \"Hell im Arsch\" (T yler, 1977). Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, it is considered sweet and cold and is recommended as a nutritive tonic (Liu and Bau, 1980). The herb is most active in the liver, lung, stomach, and large intestine systems (Liu and Bau, 1980). A tablet product of the mycelia is produced in China and is said to affect the nervous system (anti-convulsant, analgesic effect), similar to the plant Rhizoma Gastrodia, with which it forms a symbiotic relationship. It is also said to strengthen the lungs, intestines , and stomach; prevents dry skin; and aids leg pains, lumbago pain, rickets, and epilepsy (Liu and Bau, 1980; Y ing et al, 1987). Medical Uses In TCM, A. mellea is said to preve nt some respiratory and digestive tract conditions, including gastritis and painful digestion, if taken on a regular basis. It is used in China to improve vision and to counteract ophthalmia and night blindness (perhaps due, in part, to its high vitamin A content). In China, tablets of A. mellea are said to increase the blood flow to the brain and heart and are recommended for treating dizziness, neurasthenia, insomnia, tinnit us, epilepsy , and numbness of the limbs (Yang & Jong, 1989). Preparation and Dosage Use the whole mushroom ad lib in stir-frys, soups, stews, tea, etc. Or take 30-90 grams of the dried powde r in capsules (2 \"00\" caps 3 x daily), or 30- 90 gram s sprink led on food, or as a tea. Of the specially-produced tablets (250 mg), which are created by a \"deep layer\" fermentation process, 3-5 tablets are taken daily . For home use, make a powdered extract as described on page 49-50, and take about 400 mg/day\u2014about 2 \"00\" capsules filled with the powder , one morning and one at night. Preparations and Recipes The honey mushroom can be preserved in oil or vinegar (Liu and Bau, 1980), or dried and then frozen (to stop insect damage). It should be driedquickly and thoroughly , for it has a tendency to turn powdery from insect damage when left sitting in a semi-fresh state. Related Species A. tabescens (cop.:F r.) Sing, of Europe and Eastern North America; it is similar but lacks a ring (Arora, 1994), and the European species A. bulbosa , is closely related, but its medici nal qualities are unknown. In China, tablets are made from an extract of the mycelia from this species, which is said to contain the coumarin derivative armillarisin A. Pharmacologically , it is reported to decrease the tension of the sphincter of Oddi, the duodenal sphincter , and increases bile flow (Y ang & Jong, 1989). Notes It was not possible to cultivate the highly prized medicinal orchid, Tian Ma, until the symbiosis with the honey mushroom was discovered. Procur ement Honey mushrooms grow commonly and abundantly on ornamental trees, fruit trees, and on live and dead trees in the forest throughout the world. It is best to pick any mushrooms at least 100 feet away from a busy road, and to avoid areas like parks that can be sprayed with toxic chemical s to control weeds or the mush-room itself. I recently spoke with the horticulturist at the UCLA botanica l gardens in Southern California, where there is a problem with Armillariella attacking valuable trees and shrubs. His method of controlling the fungus was to withhold all water or at least use only a minimum of water , especially on native trees and shrubs which are drought- tolerant, depending mainly on natural rainfall. Dried honey mushroom fruiting bodies, and possibly tableted products, are not generally available through commercial channels. They can be ordered through some Chinese herb dealers under the name mi huan mu erh in the Pen T'sao, according to Read (1936), and they are used interchangeably today .] MU ERH (W OOD Names Jew's ear (a contraction of Judas' ear), wooden ear, or tree ear (Liu and Bau, 1980); in Germany , Judasohr . In Japan A. is called kikurage , meaning an edible mushroom (Misaki et al, 1981), and in Chin a it is known as Yung Nge or Muk Nge (Miller , 1979). In TCM, it is called Mu erh (wood ears) or yun-er h (cloud ears) (Barefoot Doctor 's Manual, 1977); also known in China as Liu er and Mo-er (Ying et al, 1987; Agarwal et al, 1982). Fig. 7: Auricula auricularia from British Basidiomycetes by W . G. Smith, 1908. Description and Habitat This jelly fungus grows mostl y on wood (either live or dead), often in broadleaf tree groves or on fir trees. The fruiting body is semi- translucent, brown, cup or ear shaped, and rubbery in texture (except when dry , in which case it turns quite hard). Range A. auricula is common throughout the United States. A. polytricha has been reported from Louisiana south to Argentina. Also throughou t Asia and Europe. W idespread. HistoryBoth have been used for thous ands of years in China (McIlvaine, 1973), frequently to treat hemorrhoids and as a stomach tonic (Ying et al, 1987). Traditionally , there are 5 kinds of mu erh that are used, which are detailed in Table 3, page 22 (Brets-chneider , 1895). In European tradition, A. auricularia was boiled in milk, beer, vinegar , or any other convenient liquid and taken for inflammations of the throat (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925), as well as applied locally for eye irritations because of its high mucilage content and ability to hold medicated eye water (Cooke, 1862; Dragendorf f, 1898). The appearance of the fungus, which is similar to the fauces of the throat may have played a role in its eventual acceptance as a throat medicine. Linnaeus mentions wood ear in his Materia Medica (1749) as being refrigerant, drying, and astringent, and says that it is used in eye complaints, inflammations, and heart pain (angina). The name Judas' ear derives from a legend that holds these ear-shaped fungi appeared as a sort of curse on the elder tree on which Judas hanged himse lf (Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925). Chemistry The nutritional content of 100 g of dry A. auricula is as follows: 10.6 g protein; 0.2 g fat; 65 g carbohyd rates; 7.0 g course fiber; 5.8 g ash; 375 mg calcium; 201 mg phosphorous; 185 mg iron; and 0.03 mg carotene (Ying et al, 1987). Various active polysaccharides such as heteropolysaccharide glucans (Misaki et al, 1981) (Ukai et al,1983). Pharmacology Polysaccharides from A. auricula have stimulated DNA and RNA synthesis by human lymphocytes in vitro (Xia et al, 1987); this provides some support for the fungus' traditio nal use as an immune tonic. A. auricula' s polysaccharides have also shown the following effects and activities in studies on mice and rats: antimutagenic but not antihepatitis (Zhou et al, 1989b); anti-ulcer , with little effect on the gastric acid secretion and pepsin activity (Xue et al, 1987); anticoagulant (Sheng & Chen, 1987); lowered total cholestero l, triglyceride, and lipid levels (Sheng & Chen, 1989); possibly antidiabetic and might have a cytoprotective effect on cells of pancreatic islets in mice (Xue et al, 1989); also reported to be anti-aging, by decreasing the lipofuscin content of the heart muscles, increasing SOD activity of the brain and liver (thus clearing free-radicals and possiblyreducing tissue damage), and inhibiting monoamine oxidase B (MAO inhibitor) in the brain 1989a); immunostimulatory , antiradical, antileukocytopenic, and anti-inflammatory (Xia & Chen, 1989); prevention of egg implantation in animals, thus terminating early and mid-pregnancy (He & Chen 1991.); and antitumor action on implanted sarcoma 180 (Misaki et al, 1981; Tobata et al, 1981); anti-aggregatory activity on blood platelets, which might make it beneficial for coronary heart disease (Agarwal et al, 1982); antibiotic (Brian, 1951). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity , Contraindications May cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, but this is rare. One case history reports that after consuming 250 g of the fresh fruiting body of A. auricula, a human male experienced \"solar dermatitis,\" i.e., upon exposure to sunlight he developed flushing on the exposed parts of his body , with significant swelling, blisters, and exudation. He recovered and was dischar ged ten days later after treatment with pharmaceutical medications (Gu, 1986). Owin g to possible anti-fertility effects (He & Chen, 1991), A. auricula should not be taken by pregnant or lactating women and those planning to conceive. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, mu erh is considered mild and sweet; it activates the blood, stops pain. It is used to increase physical and mental energy. It is considered specific for bleeding\u2014especiall y excessive uterine bleeding, and bleeding hemorrhoids, as well as abdominal and tooth pain (Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dler , 1982). Medical Uses It is beneficial for lumbago, debility after childbirth, pains, muscle spasms, poor circulatio n, dysentery with blood, leukorrhea (white vaginal dischar ge), excess mucus, nausea, slow healing of wounds in the aged, and for mushroom poisoning (Liu and Bau, 1980). In the Barefoot Doctor 's Manual (1977) it is said to strengthen the lungs. A. auricula is used to treat hemorrhoids, as an anticoagulant, to stimulate bowel movements, and to help build ener gy (Y ing et al, 1987). Preparation and DosageTake 15 g of the dried mushroom in decoction as tea 2X/day . Or mix the powder with honey to make pills and take them twice daily . You may also add 60 g to the recipe for \"W ei Qi Soup\" given on page 45. PREPARATIONS AND RECIPES: For excessive leukorrhea, powder well-dried fruiting bodies, mix 9 g of fine powder in boiling water and drink 2X/day (Liu and Bau, 1980). Add honey or other sweetener to taste. As a postpartum tonic, soak 30 g A. auricula in vineg ar and drink 5-6 g, 3X/day (Liu and Bau, 1980; Y ing, 1987). For excessive phlegm and nausea, concoct 7-8 large wood ears by simmering and drink 2X/day (Liu and Bau, 1980). For bloody feces, uterine bleeding, or bleeding piles, boil the fungus (15 g) in water with 15 g sugar (or substitute 1 tsp honey) over low heat and take 2X/day, 1 cup at a time (Liu and Bau, 1980). For piles of the elderly that won' t heal\u2014mix the powder with water to make a paste, spread on gauze and apply on the spot (Y ing, 1987). For hypertension, vascular sclerosis, and ophthalmic bleeding, soak 3 grams of mu erh overnight in water, then steam it for 1-2 hours. Add honey to taste (optional) and drink 1 cup before bed (Y ing, 1987). Related Species A. polytricha and A. auricula (Liu and Bau, 1980) are used interchangeably and both are cultivated in China. A. polytricha has a tradition as a folk medicine in the Orient for coughs and for the improvement of the general physical condition (Pacioni, 1981). Studies on mice have shown that A. mesenterica (Dicks.) Pers. contains polysaccharides that inhibit the growth of both sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich carcinoma (Y ing et al, 1987). Procur ement Wood ear can be commonly purchased in grocery stores that emphasize Chinese food products. I have seen packages of dried fruiting bodies throughout Chinatown in San Francisco. A number of tableted products are available through Chinese herb dealers under the name mu erh. A few western herb products may contain this species as a minor component.BOLETUS EDULIS (Bull:Fr.) (boletus=the Synonyms none Other Common Names Steinpilz, cepe. Description and Habitat B. edulis grows under conifers as well as hardwoods and broadleaf trees (Arora, 1986). Range China, Europe, Russia, and throughout North America. Fig. 8: Boletus edulis , from the Illustrated Encyclopedia of Gardening by George Nicholson, circa 1887. History Although various species of Boletus grow in the Bohemian Forest area and the people of Bohemia and Bavaria collect great quantities of them for food, the only species they accredit with cancer preventive properties is B. edulis. The folklore appeared to have proved out when studies at Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in the U.S. found that among the species they had collected from Bohemia and screened for antitumor activity , only B. edulis was active (Lucas, 1960; Lucas, 1957).Chemistry No data. Pharmacology Extracts of the fruiting bodies have shown antitumor propert ies in mice (100% inhibition rate against sarcoma 180 and a 90% inhibition rate against Ehrlich carcinom a) (Ying et al, 1987; Lucas et al, 1957), which might be attributable to a peptide or protein. The mycelium of Boletus edulis does not appear to have anti-tumor properties (Lucas et al, 1957). Polysaccharides from B. edulis produced an antagonizing and neutralizing action on inflammation mediators. Administered to rats (10 or 25 mg/kg), polysaccharide A (a glucan) and B lizing heral blood, eosinophils and neutrophiles and when administered in saline, the polysaccharides caused lymphocyte counts to decrease while lymphocytes increased in pleural fluid (Grzybek et al, 1992). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, this fungus is considered to have a mild and salty taste. When used in \"Tendon-easing pills,\" it has a positive effect on lumbago, leg pain, numbness in limbs, bone and tendon discomfort, tetany , and leukorrhea (Ying et al, 1987). Medical Uses None. Doses The fruiting body is considered a gourmet food and is eaten in quantity by mycophagists in soups, stews, and stir-frys whenever available . Taken 9 g, 3X daily , the powder is followed with \"gauliapng\" wine. Preparations and Recipes In China, the dried, unopened mushroom (93 g) is cooked with pork to treat leukorrhea (1 X/day X 7). The unopened mushroom baked with Acanthopanax spinosua Harms, provides a powder used by women in China to conceive (Liu and Bau, 1980).Notes B. edulis also contains 8 essential amino acids and is said to promote good health if taken regularly (Y ing et al, 1987). Related Species B. speciosus Frost is used in TCM to treat flatulence and indigestion. The dried mushroom (6 g) is taken two times daily in the form of a simmered decoction. Suillus cavipes ease \"tendons and veins,\" and to dispel cold and wind. This species is a major component of Tendon-easin g Powder (Liu and Bau, 1980). B. satanas Lenz contains a toxic glycoprotein (Kretz et al, 1991). Procur ement Dried or canned Cepes can be found in markets, especially ones specializing in gourmet foods. They grow commonly along the Pacific coast of the U.S., in Europe, and other parts of the world, fruiting in the summer and early to late fall. Commercial products for medicinal use are not cornutum , spurred rye, Mutterkorn, Womb grain, Antony' s fire, St. Martial' s fire, and clavus (Liu and Bau, 1980; Arora, 1986). Description and HabitatThe genus Claviceps includes 12-50 species, depending on the source consulted. C. purpur ea is the source of ergot, the sclerotium that forms when this fungus parasitizes the ovaries of plants, usually grasses and cereal crops. Although C. purpur ea has many hosts, medicinal ergot is obtained only from rye grain (Sastri et al, 1950). Range Worldwide. History Until the advent of modern agricultural practices, C. purpur ea often invaded rye fields in Russia and eastern Europe, producing ergot, which was harvested with the grain. Animals and humans who consumed this contaminated grain frequently suffered from ergotism, a disease that produced either convulsions or gangrene. Large doses of ergot were known to induce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, and even fatal respiratory collapse and heart failure, while ingesting smaller doses over a long period of time is thoug ht to have produced gangrenous and/or convulsive ergotism (Sastri et al, 1950). During the Middle Ages, people unknowingly ate ergotized rye and suffered from a condition called St. Anthony' s fire charact erized by burning sensations in the hands and feet (produced by restriction of peripheral blood vessels) and hallucinations. Indeed one historian has suggested that the \"voices\" Joan of Arc heard and the Salermo witch trials were both products of ergot poisoning (Wallace, 1991). For a provocative yet classic discussion of ergot's use as a visionary drug in Europe, see Aldous Huxley' s The Doors of Perception (1954). Today , the potential for ergot poisoning, known as ergotism, is understood, and therefore uncommon. Despite its potential toxicity , ergot has been used medicinally both in Europe and China. It entered into the London Pharmacopeia in 1836 and was subsequentl y official in most pharmacopeias. It was official in the U.S. Pharmacopeia from 1820 until 1942. The 1907 Merck Index indicated its use for stimulating labor , difficult menstruation, internal hemorrhages, night-sweats, whooping cough, migraine, diabetes, epilepsy , and chronic cerebral congest ion. For a discussion of further uses, see Felter and Lloyd (1898). Ergot fluid extract was still official in the National Formulary of the U.S. in 1965, but has largely been replaced with ergotam ine tartrate, which is still of ficial (Osol et al, 1955).Chemistry A numb er of alkaloids have been isolated from ergot, three of which are oxytocic and have important therapeutic actions\u2014er gotamine, ergotoxine, really a mixture of 3 alkaloids (Reynolds, 1993) and ergometrine (Evans, 1989; Sastri et al, 1950; Ying et al, 1987). Lysergic acid is the nucleus of a number of the cited alkaloids, and lyser gic acid diethylamide (LSD), the most potent hallucinogenic compound known, is a derivative of C. purpur ea (Barron, 1967; Richards, 1969). Pharmacology The various physiological effects of ergot, let alone the purified alkaloid, are complex. Ergotamine has peripheral vasoconstrictor action, affects central serotoner gic neurons, and in therapeutic doses potentiates epinephrine and norepinephrine, inhibiting the re-uptake of these amines after nerve stimulation (AMA, 1983). As early as the 16th century in Europe, and possibly much earlier in China, ergot was known for its ability to promote uterine contractions (Osol, 1955; Evans, 1989; Madaus, 1938). Human Clinical Studies A number of studies have been performed with various ergot derivatives, especially dihydroer gotamine mesylate, which is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine and with heparin in the maleate for the treatment of migraine attacks and cluster headache (Reynolds, 1993). Toxicity Ergot is a very strong abortifa cient and thus should be strictly avoided during pregnancy , except the third stage under the supervision of a practitioner trained in its use (Osol, et al, 1955; Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987). Ergot and ergot liquid extract are considered less toxic than purified derivatives in small doses taken for short periods, except in susceptible individuals, particularly those with sepsis, hyperthyroidism, or impaired liver function (Osol, 1955). When taken in large doses (more than an ounce of the fluid extract), it may provoke vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, tachycardia, confusion, and coma. T aken chronically , it is dangerous, even though at first there are no symptoms. There are two forms of epidemic toxicity that have been described: (1) a gangrenous form causing agonizing pain in theextremities and (2) a more unusual nervous type causing convulsions (Reynolds, ed., 1993). Uses in T raditional Medicine C. purpur ea has a sweet taste, followed by acridicity and a strong odor (Liu and Bau, 1980). In TCM, natur al ergot alkaloids and their derivatives are used in the treatment of the ears (especially inner auditory tubes), eyes (corneas), lips, nose, and tongue. It is also used in the treatmen t of certain hyperthyroid diseases and as a preventive for dizziness due to motion sickness (Y ing et al, 1987). Medical Uses In modern medicine ergot derivatives, especially ergotamine tartrate, are still used to induce abortions (by promoting uterine contr actions), to decrease postpartum uterine bleeding, and for the treatment of migraine headaches (Zurich, 1993; Wallace, 1991). Dermatologists have used ergot to treat diseases that involve problems in regulation of the autonomic nervous system (Ying et al, 1987). Ergot itself is still official in the pharmacopeias of Austria, France, Romania, Russia, Turkey , and Australia (Reynolds, 1993). Preparation and Dosage 150 mg to 500 mg\u2014daily dose depends on type of condition being treated (Osol, 1955; Liu and Bau, 1980). Liquid extract, 0.6-1.2 ml (British Pharmaceutical Codex, 1954). Not recommended without the supervision of a practitioner trained in its use. Notes None. Related Species None. Procur ement I have seen ergot growing in wild grass in England. It can be found in commercial fields of grain in Europe, Asia, and North Americ a, and other parts of the world, especially where rainfall is plentiful. Extracts of ergot are available in homeopathic dilution, and isolated, purified alkaloids are sold as PARASITE Synonyms none Other Common Names C. sinensis is commonly called caterpillar fungus or summer -plant, winter - worm, while C. ophioglossoides is known as club-head fungus (Liu and Bau, 1980; Pereira, 1843). Description and Habitat C. ophioglossoides is a small (2-6 cm), club-shaped parasite on the fruiting bodies of the truffle genus Elaphomyces. It is found in the soil of bamboo, oak, and pine woods (Arora, 1986; Y ing et al, 1987). C. sinensis is slight ly larger (4-11 cm) and is club- or finger -shaped. It is found on mountain tops abov e 3,000m high in cold and snowy grass marshlands of China (Y ing et al, 1987; Liu and Bau, 1980). Cordyceps spp. grow by infecting insect larvae, mature insects, or truffles with spores that germinate, sometimes before the cocoons are formed, thus preventing furth er growth of the larvae. The fruiting body of the Cordyceps eventually emer ge from the anterior end of the dead host. C. sinensis grows on the larvae of Lepidoptera, especially the Hepialus armoricanus (Bat moth) (Ma et al, 1986; Liu and Bau, 1980). The Chinese consider this fungus to be a vegetable durin g the summer and an animal during the winter , giving it the name \"summer -plant, winter -worm\" (Pereira, 1843). Various methods of cultivating spp. have been studied in China, including subme rged fermentation culture (Zhang et al, 1986; Liu and Bau, 1980).Cordyceps taylori from The Natural History of Plants by Kerner and Oliver , 1897. Range C. sinensis grows throughout Asia. C. ophioglossoides occurs fairly commonly in the eastern United States but is rare on the west coast; it also occurs in Asia and Europe. The related species C. militaris (L.:Fr .) Link and C. capitata grow on subme rged caterpillars and are fairly common in parts of North America and Asia (Arora, 1986). History In ancient China, Cordyceps sinensis was used exclus ively in the Emperor 's palace, because it was very scarc e. It was prepared by stuffing five drams of the fungus into the stomach of a duck and slowly roasting it over a fire until it was well cooked. Then the Cordyceps was removed, and the duck was eaten twice a day for 8-10 days (Pereira, 1843; Rolfe & Rolfe, 1925). Pereira (1843) reported in the New York Journal of Medicine that C. sinensis has properties similar to those of ginseng, being used to streng then and rebuild the body after exhaustion or long-term illness. It was also used traditionally for impotence, neurasthenia, backache (Huang, 1993), and asan antidote for \"opium poisoning\" and to cure the habit of opium eating (Uphof, 1968). Chemistry C. unsaturated fatty and adenosine have been extracted from C. sinensis (Zhang & Li, 1987). From the water - soluble fraction of both species, cordycepic acid has been isolat ed and from C. ophioglossoides , the antibiotic compound, ophio-cordin (Furuya et al, 1983). Also from this species three anti-tumor protein bound polysaccharides, CO-N, SN-C, and erythroid progenitor cells and erythroid colony-forming units in the bone marrow of mice and given before (150 mg/kg X3) administration of an anticancer drug (harringtonine) that causes dramatic depletion of these erythroid cells, it prevented the decrease. While macrophage stimulation is a proposed cause of the increase in red blood cells, C. sinensis also caused erythroid cells to increase in vitro (Yu et al, 1993). A number of studies have demonstrated that C. sinensis has a range of immunostimulating and immunoregulating activities (Liu & Xu, 1985; Zhu, 1987). Notably , its polysaccharides have been found to stimulate phagocytotic functions and macrophage activity (Gong et al, 1990), particularly that of peritoneal macrophages (Zhu, 1987). Likewise, Cordyceps preparations and extracts have been shown to increase phagocytic activity (Tang et al, 1986), especially in the peritoneal macrophages (Zhang et al, 1985). A water -soluble extract of C. sinensis fruit-body admi nistered to mice (50 mg/kg) by the oral route provided a significant prolo ngation of lifespan against lymphoma. This effect was also found against lymphoma in mice that had received an immuno-suppressing chemotherapy agent (cyclophosphamide, i.p.) in addition to the extract (orally). B-lymphocytes were strongly stimulated, and IgM and IgG responses in cyclophosphamide -treated lymphoma-bearing mice could be restored to normal with C. sinensis extract (oral), as well as levels of macrophage activity (Yamaguchi et al, 1990). Howeve r, although immunostimulatory effects have been observed in immun osuppressedanimals, one study found no such effect on humoral immunity in normal mice (Tang et al,1986). Another study found that normal rat T-cells were not enhanced by C. sinensis , while defective T-cells were (Chen & Zhang, 1987). Thus, C. sinensis may boost depressed immune function but not enhance norma l function to the same degree. Significantly , wild and cultivated C. sinensis have demonstrated equal level s of immune activity , neither being superior to the other (Chen et al, 1987b; Zhang et al, 1985). True to the actions of other immunostimulants, a high dosage of C. sinensis (4 g/kg) produced an immuno-suppressive effect in mice comparable to that of cyclo sporin A (5 mg/kg) by prolonging skin allograph survival. C. sinensis proved highly active in mice against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, causing an 80% survival 60 days following tumor cell implantation. C. sinensis warm water extract was without antitumor activity in vitro, indicating that the major action of the fungus against Ehrlich tumor cells is mediated through the host immune system (Yoshida et al, 1989). In addition, C. sinensis has been reported to have antitumor activity against lung cancer in both mice (Zhang et al, 1987) and humans (Xu & Peng, 1988). In vitro, C. sinensis extracts and culture broths have shown positive inotropic and negative chronotr opic effects as well as causing a relaxation of aorta and bronchus (Furuya et al, 1983; Naoki et al. In animals, C. sinensis also shows bronchodilatory , sedative, and hypnotic actions (Chang & But, 1986); a sedative action due to the amino acids glutamic acid, tyrosine, and L-tryptophan (Zhang et al, 1991); inhibition of monoamine oxidase obtained from brain tissue (Xu et al, 1988); increased platelet formation, with normal platele t ultrastructure (Chen et al, 1987b); and prevention of spleen and liver atrophy , as well as of thymus hypertrophy in mice given cyclophosphamide (Chen et al, 1985). A fraction of a mycelial extract inhibited the formation of thrombi and platelet aggregation (Zhao, 1991). Finally , C. sinensis demonstrated Micr osporum lanosum (Chang & Y ing et al, 1987). Two protein-bound polysaccharides extracted from C. ophioglossoides , CO-N and SN-C, have been reported to have antitumor activity in animal studies. SN-C also appears to stimulate the immune system. Both SN-C carcinoma, Ehrlich carcinoma, and P388 leukemia) (Ohmori, 1989a). CO-N is a water - insoluble amino acid bound sugar (glycan) derived from the liquid cultured mycelium (1 g/liter) (Yamada, 1984a). Against tumors in mice, CO-N is highly active in small doses. Against sarcoma 180, a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg (i.p.) inhibited tumor growth by 98.7% (Ohmori, 1989). SN-C is active against a larger range of tumor systems than PSK or lentinan (Ohmori, 1988) . The antitumor action of SN-C is from both a direct cytocidal activity and immunostimulation. SN-C, derived from liquid cultured mycelia (2-4 g/liter), is reported to be the first immunomodulating protein-bound polysaccharide found that displays both kinds of antitumor activity (Ohmori et al, 1986). The primary polysaccharide component of SN-C that holds the immunostimulating action is CO-1, a glucan with a structure similar to lentinan and some other polysaccharides (Kawaguchi and Yamada, 1987). Although insoluble in water , SN-C is soluble in lactic, acetic, or citric acid (Ohmori, 1988). C. ophioglossoides has also shown strong anti-fungal (due partly to the compound ophiocordin), immunostimulant, and anticancer activity in animal trials (Kneifel et al, 1977; Liu & Xu, 1985). Like C. sinensis , it appears to activate the peritoneal macrophages (Zhang et al, 1985). Another active polysaccharide, called CO-1, shows strong inhibition against sarcoma 180 tumor (Yamada et al, 1984a), but not from oral administration (Ohmori et al, 1988b). Human Clinical Studies Clinical studies have been perfo rmed with C. sinensis , and based on these, it is reported to have therap eutic value in the treatment of chronic obstructive hepatic diseases, hypercholesterolemia, and other aging disorders, including loss of sexual drive (Chang & But, 1986; Chen & Zhang, 1987). For instance, in 155 cases of sexual hypofunction, 64.15% of the patients showed improvement when treated with cultured C. sinensis , and 23.68% showed improvem ent with wild C. sinensis grown on bath- moth larva, versus improveme nt in 31.57% of patients treated with a placebo. One capsule was given 3 times daily (330 mg/capsule) for 40 days, with 46 of the patients able to continue a normal sex life. An increase in 17- hydroxycorticosteroid and 17-ketosteroid levels was demonstra ted in these patients (Y ang et al, 1985). These trials with human volunteers are supported by animal studies in which Cordyceps lowered total cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, LDL-C,and VLD L-C, and increased plasma HDL-C and HDL-C/TC in both normal and hyperlipem ic rats (Xu & Zhang, 1987), as well as increased spermatogenesis in mice and rabbits (Huang et al, 1987). The effects of cultivated cordyce ps, a product of strain Cs 4 isolated from Cordyceps sinensis , were studied in a double blind, randomized placebo controlled study , which lasted for 2 months. Out of 273 patients with hyperlipidemia, the total cholesterol blood level decreased by 17.5% and the triglyceride level by 9.9%. No serious side effects were observed (Geng et al, 1985). In additi on, significant improvem ent (77.2%) was obtained in 87 cases of arrhythmia using 0.25 g of encapsulated C. sinensis mycelia 3X/day for 3 weeks (Yu, 1985). Three cases of lung carcinoma were treated with C. sinensis over a 3-month period with excellent results (Chang & But, 1986), while 18 cases of chronic neph ritis showed significant improvement after treatment with cultivated Cordyceps (Shen & Chen, 1985). Wild Cordyceps and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis both significantly benefitted patients with chronic kidney failure. The cultured mycelia dosage was 2 g, 3 times daily for 30 days (Chen et al, 1986). In a human study involving 51 patients with chronic renal failure, the administration of 3-5g per day of Cordyceps sinensis to 28 of the patients improved renal and immune function (Guan et al, 1992). In a study with 33 chronic hepatitis B patients, cultured Cordyceps sinensis mycelia was reported to improve liver function, raise plasma albumin, and adjust protein metabolism (Zhou et al, 1990). In 45 patients treated for post-hepatic cirrhos is with C. sinensis and extract of semen Persicae, the improvements found compared to an untreated group of patients, were in NK cell function, T-cell ratio and numbers, immunoglobulin levels, serum complement levels, and liver function (Zhu and Lin, 1992). Finally , in twenty-three cases of tinnitus treated with an infusion of Cordyceps, eight were reported as cured and nine significantly improved , while six found no improvement. The researchers concluded that Cordyceps was effective for tinnitus caused by fluid accumulation in the middle ear, while it was ineffective in cases with a long history of auditory nerve disorder (Zhuang & Chen, 1985). ToxicityAnimal studies show the extract of C. sinensis is low in toxici ty (Chang & But, 1986), and the LD50 was 27.26 \u00b14.38 g/kg I.P. in mice. When a preparation was given p.o. daily for 3 months to rabbits, no abnormalities were seen in the blood tests, or in liver or kidney functions (Huang et al, 1987). Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, C. sinensis is said to be sweet and acrid in taste and warm in nature. Therapeutically , its actio n is related to the lung and kidney channels (Chang & But, 1986; Liu and Bau, 1980). C. ophioglossoides is mild and slightly acrid (Liu and Bau, 1980). In China the herb is used as a tonic to the lungs and kidneys, to increase sperm production, increase blood production (counteracting some types of anemia), and reinfor ce Qi. It is often prescribed as a tonic to be cooked with duck meat (Huan g, 1993). In China C. sinensis cooked with duck is particularly recommended as a nutritional suppl ement for the elderly; indeed, a meal of this type is thought to be as potent as 50 g of ginseng (Y ing et al, 1987). Medical Uses Cordyceps sinensis is known as an antiasthmatic and anticancer agent which causes smooth muscle relaxation and can potentiate the effects of epinephrine. It has been used to stimulate the endocrine system, as an antibacterial agent, and for patients suf fering from chronic renal failure. In China, C. sinensis is used to regul ate and support the gonads and as a lung and kidney tonic. It is used specifically for excessive tiredness, persistent cough, impotence, debility , and anemia. It is also used as a tranquilizer , to build the bone marrow , and reduce excess phlegm (Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987). C. sinensis is official in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Tu, 1988) and is used as a hemostatic for treating phthisis, as a mycolytic, antiasthmatic, and expectorant for treating chronic cough and asthma and for \"impotence and seminal emissions with aching of loins and knees;\" it is also listed as a tonic. C. ophioglossoides stimu lates blood circulati on and regulates menstruation. In some parts of China, the above-ground parts of the fungus are used for treating metrorrhagia and abnormal menstruation (Ying et al, 1987; Liu and Bau, 1980). Preparation and DosageFor weakness and debility and for use as a tonic, use 3-9 g C. sinensis twice daily (Liu and Bau, 1980), or 1 gram of an extract. For menorrhagia and irregular menstruation, simmer 3-6 g C. ophioglossoides in chicken soup and take twice daily , or take a water decoction of 6 g each C. ophioglossoides and garden burnet, twice daily (Ying et al, 1987). For treating anemia and impotence, another Chinese source text recommends taking 25 to 50 grams stewed with pork or chicken (Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dler , 1982). Notes Cordyceps spp. show higher an immunostimulant extracted from Japanese Trametes versicolor (Jeong et al, 1990). Species C. shanxiensis , a newl y discov ered species, is regarded in Shanxi, China as having greater medicinal value than any other type of Cordyceps. It is called \"Jinbangbang Chongcao\" in China (Liu et al, 1985). C. cicadae contains two galactomannans, CI-P and CI-A, which show potent hypoglyc emic activity in normal mice (Kiho et al, 1990), and its polysaccharides have shown significant antitumor activity (Ukai et al, 1983). A number of species grow in the United States, among them C. capitata , which is common in northern California and the Pacific Northwest; also several undescribed neotropical species exist D-mannitol, alkaloids, steroids, and inorganic elements. It has the same amino acids, though twice the amount (Guo et al, 1985). C. militaris contains cordycepin, b-sitosterol, ergosterol, adenine, adenosine, and is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (Penman et al, 1970) and antitumor compound not found in C. sinensis. Cordycepin was dropped as a clinical agent for cancer due to toxic side effects (Shiao et al, 1989). C. hawkesii Gray has alkaloids, sterols, amino acids, vitamins, and trace elements similar to those found in C. sinensis (Guo et al, 1990). C. capitata (Fr.) Link growing on Elaphomyces is reported by the ethnomycologist Singer (1958) \"to be collected as a remedy for various diseases.\" Traces of an indole alkaloid were also found in this species according to T yler (T yler, 1994; W asson, 1961). Procur ementThough expensive, cordyceps can be purchased in bulk through Chinese herb dealers. It is also a compo nent of a number of tableted formulas, of both Asian and western origin. Species of cordyceps grow throughout the world; they are uncommon and of scattered occurrence, at least in temperate Other Common Names Surgeon' s fungus, zunderpilz. Description and Habitat F. fomentarius is hoof-shaped, grey to grey-b rown or grey-black in color , and has a hard, thick crust. It grows on both living and dead hardwoods, especially birch, maple, and poplar (Arora, 1986; Phillips, 1991). Range Very common in most parts of the world. History Various Fomes species were traditionally used in Europe and America as tinder to start fires and as absorbent \"pads\" to stop bleeding and dress wounds. See the beginning of this book, page 10, for more details. Amadou is called T suriganetake in Japan. Chemistry F. fomentarius was able to synthesize small quantities of prostaglandins from linolenic acid and arachidonic acid (Kapich et al, 1992). The lipid fraction contains fungisterol, and isoer gosterone (Singh ergosta-7,22 -dien-3-one (Arthur et al, 1958). PharmacologyA lignin from F. fomentarius completely inhibited the growth of herpes simplex virus in culture s (Sakagami & Kawazoe, 1991), while the liquid extract of sporophore reached an 80% effective rate against sarcoma 180 in mice (Ying et al, 1987). Isolated polysaccharides from a mycelium culture proved to be tumor -inhibiting in mice (Ito et al, 1976). Human Clinical T rials No data. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, F. fomentarius is considered slightly bitter and mild. It is recommended for reducing stasis of digestive vitality (Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987). F. fomentarius was used by the Okanagan-Colville Indians of British Columbia and Washington State and by the Shuswap to cure rheumatism. A piece of the fungus (after pound ing and softening) was put on the skin over the affected area with spittle and ignite d. This is also the possible species of fungus used by the Okanagan-C olville for arthritis, though Turner describes the fruiting body as \"small and flat and grows on birches.\" This species is not flat, but often taller than wide and more hoof-shaped. It is more likely the fungus in question is Piptoporus betulinus , the birch polypore. This species fits the description, and it grows on birches, as stated in Turner (1980). The fungus, called \"ktikwmn\", was pounded until \"mushy\" and put \"in a cloth\" to make a fungal poultice for arthritic areas. In European folk medicine, F . fomentarius was used internally for bladder complaints (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977). Medical Uses In China , it is used for indigestion and to reduce stasis of diges tive vitality , as well as for esophageal cancer and gastric and uterine carcino mas (Liu & Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987). In Europe, it has been used as an external application to stop bleeding in small wounds (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977). Preparation and Dosage As a decoction, 13-20 g, 2x/day . Related Species Fomes hornodermus Mont, is used in China as a folk-remedy as a sedative hemostatic and to clear endogenous wind for stopping itch (Ying et al,1987.) Procur ement Amadou is not available commercially in bulk or tablet form. It grows commonly throughout parts of North America, Asia, Europe and elsewhere. FOMITOPSIS OFFICINALIS agaric, agarick, purging agaric, and larch agaric. When \"touchwood,\" \"spunk,\" and \"tinder\" (Rolfe and Rolfe, 1925). These last names have been shared by other poly- pores, especially F. fomentarius. Description and Habitat White and knob-shaped when young, it becomes convex, then cylindrical, hard, and tough; it is more friable than most other polypores and not as fibrous. The surface becomes cracked as it ages, and the color changes from white or yellow to gray. Grows on larch, pine, spruce, fir, hemlock, and Douglas fir .Fomitopsis of ficinalis Range Common year-round throughout much of the Western U.S., from the Sierra Nevada north and east; the great lakes region. Also found in Europe and Eurasia. History Quinine conk, or \"Agaric\" as it was called by the ancients, has had a long history of use in the West (see sidebar on page 8 for history of the word \"agaric\"). The Greeks and Rom ans used it in a formula which was alleged to be an antidote to any and all poisons (Rolfe and Rolfe, 1925). As the legend goes, the king Mithridate (after whom the formula was named) took this potion for a period of time to safeguard himself from being poisoned by his enemies. Then later in life he became depressed and tried to kill himself by drinking a virulent poison\u2014but the poison didn' t work, presumably because of the formula he had taken many years earlier . Dioscorides, the noted Greek physician (c. 200 A.D.), thought of it as a panacea, saying that \"On the whole it is serviceable in all internal complaints when taken accor ding to the age and strength of the patient; some should take it with water , others with wine, and others with vinegar and honey , or with water and honey \" (Gunther , 1934).Gerard (1633), the English herbalist, used it in much the same way, suggesting a dose of 1-2 drams in powder form or 2-5 drams in decoction. Interestingly , Gerard felt that the best agaric would be white-colored, loose and spongy in texture, easily broken, and have a sweet taste; he considered heavy , blackish, and fibrous agaric to be poisonous. He also noted that since it is purgative and may cause nausea, the best way to take agaric is with syrup of vinegar and ginger , to prevent any negative reactions. After Gerard' s time, the medicinal use of agaric declined, replaced with more effective specific laxative and anti-malarial medicines. In the New English Dispensatory (1733), it is mentioned as a purging herb to be taken with aromatics (such as ginger), but the author reports it is rarely used and recommends that it be allowed to fall into disuse. Linnaeus, in his Materia Medica (1749), says that it is warming, mildly laxative, carminative, and anthelmintic. In the second edition of the U.S. Dispensatory (1834), the authors state that agaric \"is scarcely employed, though we have met with it in the shops. \" The use of this fungus refused to fade completely , however , and in the later 1800s, it was incorporated into the famous \"Warbur g's\" or \"Antiperiodica\" tincture (see page 14 for recipe and uses), and the British Pharmaceutical Codex of 1934 includes it. It is said to have been successful in malarial fevers in India; the recommended dose was 1/2 ounce of the tincture, and after 3 hours, another 1/2 ounce. \"Soon after the second dose, a violent, aromatic perspiration comes on, and the fever is usually broken.\" As far as I know , there are no modern clinical reports or studi es to substantiate this use. The tincture was also recommended for general collapse, because of its stimulant properties, in cases where there was no apparent organic disease present . Warbur g's Tincture was official in the U.S. National Formulary from 1888 to 1926 (Osol et al, 1955). The agaric is not much known or used by modern herbalists and the risk of side effects, such as bowel irritation, may outweigh its benefits (Dharmananda, 1994). Chemistry According to the Merck Index (1983) and Hager 's Handbook (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977), agaric contains & Kn\u00fctter , 1957). Agaric acid was still official recently as an astringent and purgative in the Austrian and Portuguese Pharmacopoeias (Reynolds, 1982). Graf and Winckelmann (1960) report on early chemical analyses of F. officinalis and the possibility of extracting sterols from this species and others for use in human steroid synthesis. Pharmacology Shows an inhib ition against sarcoma 180 of 80% (Ying et al, 1987). An observed laxativ e effect from the fruiting body was said to be due to agaricin, water -soluble salts, and mannitol (Jaretzky & Breitwieser , 1944). Human Clinical Studies None. Toxicity On the basis of experience in TCM, F. officinalis should not be used in doses of more than 1 g per day (Liu and Bau, 1980). In England (1965) agaric acid was recommended to be prohibited as a flavoring agent in foods because animal studies showed that in sufficient quantities, it could produce skeletal muscle weakness and CNS depression (Reynolds, 1982). Uses in T raditional Medicine According to traditional Europe an practice the energy of agari c is slightly sweet, bitter, and slightly acrid (Linnaeus, 1749); neutral to slightly cool. See page 10 for farther traditional uses. Medical Uses Prescribed prior to the mid-20th century as a purgative, bitter tonic, for bronchial asthma, night sweats from tuberculosis (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977); also a powder of the fruiting body , and later, agaricic acid, is used as an anhidrotic (agent that reduces sweating) (Windholz et al, 1976). The mushroom itself was still official in the Swiss Pharmacopeia in 1967 (Todd, 1967), and agaric acid in the Austrian and Portuguese pharmacopeias in 1982 (Reynolds, 1982). Preparation and Dosage 200 mg-2 grams decocted as a tea (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977), or taken as a powder in \"00\" capsules, usually with other herbs. One dropp erful of thetincture (1:5, 50% menstruum), 3 x daily . Related Species Currently in the same genus with F. pinicola , the red-belted polypore conk, but these taste nothing like quinine conk, as they are not friable and do not have the same medicinal effects. Notes Still in trade, especially in Europe, but may be adulterated with Laetiporus or friable (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977). Procur ement The bulk fruiting bodies are still in European herb trade. I have seen large fruiting bodies on Douglas fir in the Pacific Northwest, south to the San Francisco bay area in California , though it probably grows farther south. It is common in other parts of North America, Europe, and (Y okoyama, 1975). F. pinicola is a beautiful, varnished, orang e to red to brown shelf fungus. It has white pores , which are scarcely visible underneath its cap, that do not bruise and a lighter belt around the margin of the top cap. It has a very tough, cork-like or woody flesh and is usually found on dead conifers, less often on hardwo ods (on the West Coast, I have seen it mostly on Douglasfir). F. pinicola is known to feed on the heartwood and sapwood of its host, and it is a major decomposer of dead timber (Arora, 1986). Range Throughout Canada and in the states of North Carolina, Arizona, California, and Ohio (Lincof f, 1981). Also found in Eurasia. History The red-belted polypore was also known as Mech quah (red touchwood) by the Cree in Eastern Canada. They dried and powdered the fruiting body , making a paste with water and applying it to excessively bleed ing wounds as a styptic. A half teaspoon of the powder was also steeped in water and taken internally as an emetic for purification (Beardsley , 1944). In King' s American Dispensatory (1895), F. pinicola was recommended for persistent, intermittent fevers; chronic diarrhea and dysentery; periodic neuralgia and nervous headache; excessive urination; jaundice; and and fevers in consumptive patients. Chemistry The triterpenes ergosterol, 3 compounds closely related to trametenolic oxylanosta-8,24-dien-21-oleic acid, acid, which may be a mixture of triterpenes (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1977). Pharmacology F. pinicola has shown moderate tumor -inhibition against sarcoma 180 (Ito et al, 1972-73; Ikekawa et al, 1968; Shibata et al, 1968). Mice given crude polysaccharides extracted from F. pinicola orally showed significant retention of Bromsulphalein and elevation of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase induced by carbon tetrachloride (Zhang, 1987), which suggests an ef fect on liver enzymes. Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity No data. Taste & EnergySweet, tonic. Uses in T raditional Medicine Use daily as a tonic to reduce inflammation of the digestive tract and increase general resistance, or as a cancer -preventative, though this use is not supported by scientific studies with humans. The tea is sweet and mild- tasting with a little bitterness. It is one of the most common polypores in many parts of the world. I have enjoyed it as a tonic bevera ge with the addition of ginger or licorice for a number of years. Medical Uses Used in homeopathic medicine for fevers with headache, yellow tongue coating, nausea, epigastric weakness, and constipation (Boericke, 1927). Preparation and Dosage 20-30 g 2X/day in soups or as a tea. Note that this fungus must be simmered for at least an hour to extract its active constituents. Before cooking, saw up the dry carpophore into 1/2\" slices and break up into pieces. When fresh and small, they can simply be cut up with a serrated knife to increase surface area for extraction. Related Species F. cytisina shows weak tumor inhibition (Ikekawa et al, 1968). Notes Fiberboard made from wood chips pretreated with the extract of F. pinicola shows excellent flexibility , high tensile strength, and little swelling tendency (W agenfuehr et al, 1989). Procur ement The red-belted polypore is not available in commercial trade but is one of the most common polypores throughout north temperate regions of (Fr.) (Yokoyama et al, 1975). Other Common Names G. applanatum is also known as \"red mother fungus\" (Liu and Bau, 1980) or \"the ancient ling zhi\" (Willard, 1990). In North America it is known as \"artist' s conk.\" Description and Habitat G. applanatum often grows on the trunks of broadleaf trees, as well as on bamboo and conifers (Ying et al, 1987). It tends to cause decay in its host and may release over 5 trillion spores annually (Arora, 1986). In California, the fungus often grows on bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) (Hook. & Arn.) Nutt., and I have found these to be more bitter and acrid than ones growing on other trees. Another similar Ganoderma known only from California, G. brownii (Murr .) Gilbn., also grows on bay laurel and is distinguished from G. applanatum by having a distinctly yellow pore surface, rather than white (Gilbertson & R yvarden, 1986). Range Common throughout the United States. History The name applanatum means \"flatten ed\" in Latin and refers to its flat bracket- shape. The Athabaskans of Alaska burn the fungus to provide a mosquito repelle nt smoke, and they scratch pictures on the white underside of the fresh fungus. The Alaskan Indian name \"k'vajeghetl'a\" indicates use of this fungus for \"playing catch.\" The Susitna Dena'ina Indian s of Alaska hold that in the area of Alexander Creek, a \"giant k'adatsa\" (G. applanatum) once grew to around a quarter mile in width (Kari, 1977). Chemistry Like G. lucidum , this species contains various steroidal compounds (Pettit and Knight, 1962; Ripper ger and such as 1980). Ganoderenic acid, furanoganoderic acid, and ganoderic acid derivatives have been isolated from G. applanatum (Nishitoba et al, 1989). Because triterpenes such asganoderic acid have been corre lated with bitterness, flavor may be a good measure of quality for G. applanatum , G. oregonense , and other wild species (Shiao et al, 1994). This particularly holds true if one is interested in the pharmacological effects that are especially associated with these compounds, namely hepatoprot ection, antihistamine, ACE demonstrat ed immunostim ulating properties in animal studies. RNA from G. applanatum caused the production of a substance with interferon- like properties in mice spleen, while i.v. doses of nucleic acids isolated from G. applanatum conferred protection against tick-borne encephalitis virus in mice (Kandefer -Szerszen et al, 1979). G. applanatum polysaccharides have been found to increase spleen cell proliferation in vitro and stimulate antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 in mice, as well as increase spleen cell primary antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (Gao & Yang, 1991). Single doses of polysaccharides (from 10-50 mg/kg) from the mycelium have produced 100% tumor inhibition ratios (Mizuno, 1982). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine In my experience, the energetic property of G. applanatum is warming and slightly bitter and sweet, depe nding on the host tree from which it is harvested. In TCM, G. applanatum is used to reduce phlegm, eliminate indigestion, stop pain, and remove heat. Medical Uses In China , it is considered useful for rheumatic tuberculosis and esophageal cancer (Ying et al, 1987). It also has antibiotic properties and shows activity against other types of cancer as well (Kim et al, 1990). Preparation and Dosage 30 g a day in tea or water -based extract. Related Species Also see the entry on G. lucidum (pages 96-107).Procur ement Artist' s conk is available in commercial products and in bulk through Chinese herb dealers. I have seen it as the major ingredient in \"Ling Zhi\" extracts made in Taiwan. It is also an extremely common fungus, growing on a variety of hosts throughout the world. G. lucidum is commonly known as \"ling zhi\" (\"ling chih or ling qi\" are variant spellings ) in China and \"reishi\" in Japan. The name ling zhi means \"spirit plant\" (Huang, 1993) and first appears in the 11th century Ling yuan fang (Bretsch neider , 1895). Other common Chinese names include \"plant of immortality ,\" shi rh (\"mush room which grows on stone\"), \"ten-thousand year Bau, 1980; Bretschneider , 1895). Because of the difficulty in obtaining it, reishi was often referred to as the \"phantom mushroom\" in Japan (Matsumoto, 1979). It is also called varnished conk (Arora, 1986).Reishi Description and Habitat The Latin lucidum , meaning \"shiny\" or \"brilliant,\" refers to the appearance of the fungus' fruiting body , which has a modeled, varnished look. G. lucidum frequen tly infects trees, especially oak trees, causing their wood to rot. This has an unfortunate impact on the wood industry (Kac et al, 1984). The fruiting bodies of G. lucidum are reddish-orange to black, usually delicate, slender , and have a definite stalk which usually attache s to the cap from the side, though stalkless (sessile) specimens have been found. The annual fruiting bodies of G. oregonense and G. tsugae (species which may have similar medicinal uses), on the other hand, are larger and fatter , with less of a well-d efined stalk (or none at all). G. oregonense occurs from British Columbia south to northern California and apparently intergrades there into G. tsugae , which has a similar stature. Both commonly grow on fir (Tsugae spp.) and hemlock (Abies spp.), while G. lucidum on hardwoods, especially oaks (Quer cus spp.) (Gilbertso n & Ryvarden, 1986). In Japan, 99% of reishi growin g in the wild are found on old Japanese plum trees. Nonetheless, they are so rare that only a few reishi are generally found per 100,000 plum trees (Matsumoto, 1979). Range Ganoderma spp. grow throughout the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia. In North America, G. lucidum occurs most commonlyon the East Coast, especially the Gulf Coast and the Southwest. History G. lucidum has been used in the folk medicine of China and Japan for 4,000 years (Zhao & Zhang, 1994), especially in the treatment of hepatopathy , chronic hepatitis , nephritis, hypertension, asthm a, and gastric ulcer (Kabir et al, 1988). In the Ben Cao Gang Mu (A.D. 1578), China' s most famous natural history book, it is explained that \"continued use of Ling Zhi will lighten weight and increase longevity\" (Hua ng, 1993). It was once thought that the pharmacological effect of G. lucidum was due to its color; in actuality , ling zhi possesses many different properties depen ding on the stage and environment of its growth (Jong and Birmingham, 1992). During the Ming Dynasty (1368- 1644) it was called Qi zhi, or \"red fungus \". It was said to benefit the heart (Yeung, 1985). In TCM, ling zhi is considered to be in the highest class of tonics, promoting longevity . There are many Chinese and Japanese stories of people with cancer and other degenerative diseases traveling great distances to find it. In the past, reishi grew only in small quantities in the wild, so it was very expensive. In the last 20 years, however , successful cultivation of G. lucidum has made it more accessible and affordable (Willard, 1990). The cultivation of the reishi was pioneered by Shigeaki Mori, a Japanese man who spent 15 years developing an elaborate method of culturing wild- grown reishi spores in specially treated old plum tree sawdust. Mori' s process takes about two years from start to finish, and it is designed to cultivate akashiba (red reishi). The \"antlered reishi,\" which is traditionally the rarest and most highly valued of the reishis (Matsumoto , 1979), is produced by growing reishi in a controlled environment high in carbon dioxide. In addition to its medical indications, Reishi has been used in the Orient as a talisman to protect a person or home against evil (Matsumoto, 1979). Chemistry The sporophore, or spore-bea ring structure, of G. lucidum contains carbohydrates (both reducing sugars and polysaccharides), amino acids, a small amount of protein and inorganic ions, steroids, triterpenes, lipids, glycoside, volatile oil, riboflavin, and ascorbic acid (Ying et al, 1987) . Regarding the inorganic ions, specifically ,the Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ge, while the pileus (cap) contains the same except no Cu (Shin et al, 1986). The spores themselves contain choline, tetracosanoic (Hou et al, 1988). One of the lipids isolated from G. lucidum is pyrophosphatidic acid (Sugai et al, 1986). The fruiting body of G. lucidum contains, in addition, ergosterol, fungal lysozyme, and acid protease (Chang & But, 1986). A hot-wate r extract of the fruiting body was found to consist of 51% polysaccharide and 5% protein (Shin et al, 1986), while water extracts of the sclerotium produced soluble proteins, amino acids, polypeptides, and saccharides (Chang & But, 1986). The mycelium of G. lucidum contain s sterols, lactones, alkaloids, and polysaccharides (Chang & But, 1986), as well as triterpenes. Indeed, some 100 different triterpenes can be found in the fruiting body and/or mycelium of G. lucidum (Shiao et al, 1994). These include highly oxidized lanostane- type triterpenoids such as ganoderic acids C, D, E, F, G, H, I (Hirotani et al, 1985; Kikuchi et al, 1985a, b; Komoda et al, 1985), L (Nish itoba et al, 1986), R, S, T (Hirotani & Furuya, 1986), U, V, W, X, Y, and Z (Toth et al, 1983a); ganode renic acids A, B, C, and E (Komoda et al, 1985); ganolucidic acids A, B (Kikuchi et al, 1985b) and D (Nishitoba et al, 1986); lucidenic acids D, E, F (Kikuc hi et al, 1985a), and G (Nishitoba et al, 1986); and lucidone C (Nishitoba et al, 1986). Pharmacology Animal studies have shown the active constituents of G. lucidum to have a variety of pharmacological activ ities and effects (summarized in Table 6). A number of its polysaccharides have demonstrated antitumor and immunostimulating activities. For instance, Beta- D-glucan, also called G-I, shows potent action against sarcoma 180 (Willard, 1990), as does GL-1, an arabinoxyloglucan (Miyazaki & Nishijima, 1981). A polysaccharide- enriched fraction of G. lucidum has demonstrated the ability to stimulate macrophages to produce more tumor-necrosis factor (TNF-a) and a number of interleukins (Wang et al, 1994). The polysaccharide porti on of these protein-bound polysaccharides has been found to consist of glucose, galactose, mann ose, and traces of xylose and fucose, while the proteinportion contains some 17 amin o acids (Kim et al, 1990). In addition to having antitumor effects, G. lucidum 's polysaccharides have been shown to increase DNA synthesis of splee n cells in mixed lymphocyte culture (Lei & Lin, 1991) and increase both RNA and DNA synthesis in the bone marrow of mice. The sterols in G. lucidum are reported to act as hormone precursors, while adenosine (a derivative of RNA) has been found to inhibit platelet aggregation (Shimizu et al, 1985). Ganoderans A & B, glycans of the fruit body of G. lucidum, significantly reduced plasma sugar levels in hyper glycemic mice (Hikino et al, 1985). Another major class of compo unds in G. lucidum , the triterpenes, are reported to have adaptogenic and antihypertensive, as well as anti-aller gic effects. (It is interesting to note that Ganoderma is a rich source of these bitter triterpenes, as a bitter taste has long been associated with some of its therapeutic properties) (Jong and Birmingham, 1992). Ganoderic acid C appears to be the most active anti-aller gic constituent, followed by ganoderic acids A and D. Ganoderic acid B is the least activ e; however , ganoderic acids B and D are reported to be anti-hypertensives. The precise mechanisms of the ganoderic acids' anti-aller gic actions are still unknown (Jones, 1992b). Also, ganoderic acids T through Z show antitumor activity against hepatoma (liver -tumor) cells (Toth et al, 1983b), and A through D inhibit histamine release (Khoda et al, 1985). Oleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, and cyclooctasulphur are known to inhibit the release of histamine, thus preventing allergic reactions and inflammations (Tasaka et al, 1988), though oleic acid is a common element of a balanced diet. The polypeptide Ling Zhi-8 (or LZ-8), too, has shown activity against several type I allergic hypersensitivity reactions. Ironically , however , G. lucidum may be a source of an allergen itself: some people have demonstrated allergic reactions to the fruiting body , others to the spores, and some to both. In areas where Ganoderma grows in abund ance, the extremely high number of spores released into the air (G. applanatum produces about 11 billion spores per week from a single fruiting body) frequently cause reactions in susceptible individuals (T arlo et al, 1979). Table 6 ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OF G. L UCIDUM.Compound Type Action Cyclooctasulphur Inhibits histamine fatty acidInhibits histamine release Without focusing on specific active constituents, researchers have also reported the following activities and effects (in vivo and/or in vitro) in studies using G. lucidum , generally in the form of watery or ethanolic extracts. Keep in mind that most of these results are uncontrolled clinical or laboratory studies or reports, mostly from China.PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WHOLE REISHI EXTRACTS IN VIVO AND IN VITRO Analgesic (Chang & But, 1986) Anti-allergic activity Bronchitis -preventative effect, inducing regeneration of bronchial epithelium & But, 1986) Anti-inflammatory (Lin et al, Stavinoha et al, 1990) Antibacterial, against Staphylococci, Streptococci , and Bacillus pneumoniae, (perhaps due to increased immune system activity) (Hsu, 1990) Antioxidant, by eliminating hydroxyl free radicals (Wang et al, 1985; Chen & Zhang, 1987) Antitumor activity Antiviral effect, by inducing interferon production Lowers blood pr essur e Enhances bone marr ow nucleated cell proliferation (Jia et al, 1993b) Cardiotonic action, lowering serum cholesterol levels with no effect on triglycerides, enhancing myoca rdial metabolism of hypoxic animals, and improving coronary artery hemodynamics (Chang & But, 1986; Chen & Zhang, 1987) Central depr essant and peripheral anticholinergic actions on the autonomic nervous system reduce the effects of caffeine and relax muscles (Chang & But, 1986; Kasahara & Hikino, 1987) Enhanced natural killer cell (NK) activity in vitro in mice (Zhang & Yu, 1993) Expectorant and antitussive properties demonstrated in mice studies (Hsu et al, 1986; Chang & But, 1986) General immunopotentiation (Shin et al, 1986; Chang & But, 1986) Anti-HIV activity in vitr o and in vivo (Kim et al, 1994) Improved adrenocortical function Increased production of Interleukin-1 by murine peritoneal macrophages in vitr o (Jia et al, 1993a) Increased production of Interleukin -2 by murine splenocytes in vitro (Zhang et al, 1993) Liver -protective and detoxifying effects (Chang & But, 1986) No effect on type B monoamine oxidase obtained from mouse brain in vitro (Dai & Y in, 1987) Protection against ionizing radiation when treated with G. lucidum both befor e and after exposure (Chang & But, 1986; Hu & But, 1987) Slight anti-ulcer activity , perhaps due to the central depressant effect (Kasahara and Hikino, 1987) Increase white blood cells and hematoglobin in peripheral blood of mice (Jia et al, 1993) Human Clinical Studies In the last 20 years, G. lucidum has under gone a number of clinical studies with humans and is thought to be beneficial for a wide variety of disorders, including neurasthenia, dizziness, insomnia, rhinitis, and duod enal ulcers (Ying et al, 1987); liver pain (hepatodynia), symptoms associated with anorexia, malde veloped et al, 1984; Huidi & Zhiyuan, 1982); and mental disease caused by environmental stress, Alzheimer 's disease, liver failure, hype rlipidemia, and diabetes (Tamura et al,1987a,b,c,d,e). The clinical effectiveness of ling zhi extract and its components in this wide range of disorders is still largely unsubstantiated by modern internationally- recognized scien tific standards, but it is currently being used in clinics and tested extensively throughout Asia and other parts of the world. G. lucidum has also shown favorable results in treating hepatitis, especially in cases without severe impairment of liver function (Chang & But, 1986). For example, in a study of 355 cases of hepatitis B treated with Wulingdan Pill, which includes the fruiting body of G. lucidum , 92.4% of the patients had positive results (Yan et al, 1987). In a clinical report fromthe MAR A Institute of Technology , Malaysia, a lyophilized extract of the mushroom was said to be beneficial in alleviating the symptom s of patients suffering from hepatitis B by significantly reducing the SGOT and SGPT levels and leading to seroco nversion in 1 case after 3 months of administration (Teow, 1994). Positive results were also seen in patients with diabetes, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Of special note are reishi' s action on the lungs and heart. In clinical studies conduct ed in China during the 1970s, over 2000 patients with chronic bronchit is were given a tablet form of reishi syrup. Within 2 weeks, 60-90% of the patients showed marked improvement, including increased appetite. The older patients, especially , seemed to benefit the most, and those with bronchial asthma, in particular , responded well (Chang & But, 1986). As for its action on the heart, reishi has been reported to benefi t patients with coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia, bringing about varying degrees of improvement in symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea, precordial pain, and edema (Chang & But, 1986). In one controlled study , a reishi extract showed the ability to reduce blood viscosity and plasma viscosity in hypertensive patient s with hyperlipidemia, some of whom were recovering from an episode of cerebral thrombosis (Cheng et al, 1993). In another study , reishi extracts were reported to reduce blood cholesterol and lower blood pressure (Kanmatsuse et al, 1985). G. lucidum is said to act as a cardiotonic and has also been used to treat arrhythmia (Ding, 1987a). Another key action of Ganoderma spp. is found in its anti-aller gic effects. Fructificatio Ganodermae (FG), a formula of the fruiting bodies Ganoderma spp., including G. lucidum, G. japonicum , and G. capense , has been used in China as a tonic for over 2,000 years. Recent studies on FG have reported it to be effective in the treatment of chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, and several other allergic diseases. Although the effective principles responsi ble for this action have not been identified, it is known from animal studies that FG inhibits the mediator release and, at high concentrations, suppresses the mediator activity . Although FG can regulate the immune response, there are no reports of its effects on IgE antibody synthesis (Qiu & Wu, 1986). We do know , however , that in animals, G. lucidum inhibits the release of histamine, thus preventing oralleviating types I, II, III, and IV allergic sensitivity reactions. Reishi has been observed clinically to stabilize immunoglobulin levels, reducing the number of excess antibodies and boosting low levels. Since this effect includes stabilizing levels of IgE, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies , reishi may help alleviate food sensitivities (Kohda et al, 1985). Finally , reishi has been found to be effective for two unusual applications. First, it alleviates high altitude sickness by oxyg enating the blood. Chinese mountain climbers given G. lucidum before ascending mountains as high as 4,000-5,0 00 m (13,200 to 17,000 ft.) felt minimal reactions to the climbs (Chang & But, 1986). Second, and most unusual, G. lucidum has been found to be surprisin gly effective in treating myotonia dystrophica, a rare hereditary disease characterized by muscular atrophy which begins in the face, neck, and larynx, and progressively affects the musculature of the entire body . Eventually even the skin and many glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and gonads atrophy as well. There is no known cure for this disorder . Although reishi is not a cure, it can help alleviate symptoms. In one study , patients with myotonia dystrophica were given 400 mg/day of water -soluble G. lucidum spores administered i.m. Many showed marked improvement in muscle strength, improved sleeping and eating patterns, and weight gain within 1-2 weeks. Patients unable to lift their heads before treatment were able to do so after treatment, and their speech and walking ability improved as well. Indeed, in three cases the disease even ceased to progress (Fu & W ang, 1982). Toxicity In animal experiments, reishi extracts have shown a very low toxicity . (Chang & But, 1986). There is little reported data on the long-term adverse effects of reishi and its derivatives. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, G. lucidum is considered warming and acts to nourish, tonify , remove toxins, astringe, and disperse accumulation (Hsu et al, 1986; Chang & But, 1986). Different types of reishi have different tastes and thus affect different organs. There are thought to be six different types of G. lucidum (classified according to color), each with a different use. For a summary of these types as they are named and used in Japan, see Table 8. The red- colored variety is generally regarded as the most potent and medicinal (Hsu et al, 1986; Matsumoto, 1979) . The Japanese have used reish i as a folkremedy to help cure cancer , heart disease, liver problems, high blood pressure, joint inflammation, ulcers and other diseases (Matsumoto, 1977), which may be due to the ability of the aqueous extract to increase fibrin degradation products and inhibit blood platelet aggregation (Kubo et al, 1983). Medical Uses In China and other parts of Asia, G. lucidum is used for many aging-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, and cancer (Che n & Zhang, 1987), and also as a diuretic, laxative, sedative, and tonic (Liu and Bau, 1980). In China, numerous preparation s are made for daily use to promote health, inducing sound sleep and increasing resistance to infections and heart disease, and are also recomm ended for a wide range of ailments such as neurasthenia, chronic bronchitis, and coronary heart disease (Yang & Jong, 1989). The Japanese government has officially listed reishi as an adjunct herb for cancer (Willard, 1990). Preliminary clinical reports and practitioner experience seems to indicate that its immunostimulating polysaccharides may make it useful for people who are HIV positive, as well as for those who have Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), an infectious virus that causes mononucleosis (Dharmananda, 1988). Because of a high adeno sine content (e.g.150 mg%), reishi was not advised for use by hemophiliacs, but a pilot study in five HIV-positive hemophiliacs given reishi extract (adenosine intake, 1.35 mg/day) found no changes in blood aggregatibility , and it was concluded that the extract could be safely used by these patients (Gau et al, 1990). It is important to note that the adenosine content of various strains of G. lucidum varies greatly , and that a number of other species of medicinal mushrooms also contain adenosine in significant quantiti Other uses of G. lucidum includ e as an antidote for poisonous mushrooms (Ying et al, 1987) and as an ingredient in skin lotions for protecting again st UV radiation (Naeshiro et al, 1992b,d). It is also used for nervous disability , dizziness, hepatitis, nephritis, gastric ulcer , leukopenia, and as an expectorant (Chang and But, 1986; Liu and Bau, 1980; Y ing et al, 1987; Huang, 1993). Reishi extract is being used with favorable results in a Moscow cancer research center for treating cancer patients according to reports given at theFirst International Conference on Mushroom Biology and Mushroom Products held in Hong Kong, August 23-26, 1993 (Chilton, 1994). A clinical report from China (Lui, 1994) details a clinician' s work with \"Ganoderma detoxification and softening liver soup,\" which was given to 70,000 patients with a success rate in toxipathic hepatitis of 90%, according to the author . In my experienc e, it is especial ly suitable as a calming herb for people with anxiety , sleeplessness, or nervousness accompanied by adrenal weakness or general neurastheni a or deficiency syndromes. In this regard, it is to be much preferred to traditional western sedative herbs such as valerian, which could be too warm and actually stimulating for some individuals. Table 8 THE SIX TYPES OF REISHI Note: Informa tion from The Mysterious Reishi Mushr oom (Matsumoto, 1979). The original source of these attributes is apparent from the Ben Cao Gang Mu wherei n various \"Chih\" or tree fungi are discussed from the earlier writings of the alchemist Ko Hung. The black or purple are today identified by Chinese authorities as Ganoderma sinense and the red as G. lucidum and G. capense. To date, these are the only species to which any of the Japanese color designates above have been matched (Jones, 1994). Preparation and DosageG. lucidum may be taken in a variety of forms\u2014in syrups, soups, teas, injections, table ts, and tinctures, or as a bolus containing powdered medicine and honey . The dose in tincture form (20%) is 10 ml 3x/day; in tablet form (for insomnia) the dose is 1 g tablets, 3 tablets 3x/day . The syrup dose is 4 to 6 ml per day (Huang, 1993). As an antidote for poisonous mushrooms, make a decoction of 120-200 g of dried G. lucidum in water (Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987), and drink 3-5 cups a day . Notes The polysaccharides extracted from G. lucidum have shown higher anticomplementary activity than Krestin\u00ae (PSK), an immunostimulant extracted from Japanese Trametes versicolor (Jeong et al, 1990). Also, an analysis of the relationship between chemical structure and antitumor activity in common unit of these active glucans is a C-6 branched (1-3-b- D-glucopyranosyl-(1-3)-b- D- glucopyranosyl residue. Branching frequency appears to be important in determining activity (Miyazaki, 1983). Some products containing Ganoderma include a melanin-inhibiting skin preparation, a hair-growing extract which includes Japanese horseradish, a bath preparation, and a sake drink (Jong and Birmingham, 1992). RELA TED SPECIES The Genus Ganoderma Karst. contains a number of species that have been used medi cinally , or may prove to be useful in the future (Zhao & Zhang, 1994). For instance, G. oregonense grows in the western U.S., and has no particular history of use but is currently being harvested and substituted for reishi by some herbalists (personal observation). Though this species may prove to be identical with G. tsugae which does have a history of use in China, this kind of substitution should be carefully evaluated, because there may be significant differences in activity between species. For instance, Wang et al (1993) have said that the active high molecular weight polysaccharides of the mycelium and fruiting bodies of G. lucidum tsugae \"showed marked qualitative and quantitative dif ferences in the component sugars, the protein-moiety content and average molecular weight.\"Ganoderma capense Another of the red Ganodermas used in China is G. capense (Lloyd) Teng, which might belong in G. tenue Zhao, Xu et Zhang (Zhao & Zhang, 1994). Water extracts of G. capense contain adenine, adenine nucleoside, uracil, uridine, and D-mannito l (Chang & 1986). From a liquid mycelial culture, two anti-inflammatory alkaloids were isolated Ganoderma the mycelium are ganoline, ganodine, and ganoderpurine (Yu, 1990). Animal studies with G. capense show it has sedative (on the CNS), peripheral anticholiner gic, liver-protective, and detoxifying actions (Chang & But, 1986). It has also increased immunocytes in mice (Xu et al, 1985), and other animal studies show G. capense can potentiate the effects of some sedative drugs, including chloropromazine and respirine (Chang & But, 1986). Chinese physici ans report success using an injectable preparation of the mycelia of G. capense (the formula is called \"Bao gai ling zhi\") to treat collagen-related diseases such as dermatomyositis (a conditio n involving decay of muscle fibers accompanied by inflammation of muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin), lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and alopecia areata 1992a). In one study involving dermatomyositis and multiple myositis, patients received 4 ml intramuscular injections of G. capense lX/day for 1 month, or 2 g of a tablet preparation orally 3X/day for 2 month s. The results were 6 cases cured, 6 markedly improved, and 7 significantly improved (Chen et al, 1987). In a study involving 232 cases of alopecia areata (hair loss) treated with G. capense , 30.17% of the patients were cured, 21.98% significantly improved, and 26.72% improved. The course of the treatment was from 20 days to 10 months, with the best ef fects appearing in 2-4 months (Cao et al, 1986). G. capense has also been found beneficial in hereditary cerebel lar ataxia (Wang & Fu, 1981), which was more effective if treatment was initiated in the early stages of the disease (Zhiyuan & Huiti, 1981). Ganoderma japonicum (Fr.) Sawada A an alkali-soluble polysaccharide, isolated from G. japonicum has demonstrat ed significant antitumor activity (Ukai et al. 1983). Animal studies have shown G.japonicum to improve cardiac function by increasing myocardial blood flow and microcirculation and to protect and detoxify the liver (Chang & But, 1986). Also, as with G. lucidum , treatment befor e exposure has been found to signif icantly increase the survival rate of irradiated mice (Hu & But, 1987). The fruiting body of G. japonicum contains er gosterol, or ganic acids, glucosamine, and polysaccharides (Chang & But, 1986). A water extract strongly inhibited a-glucosidase, a key enzyme in glycoprotein processing of viruses (Fung, 1993). Ganoderma or egonense Murr . As previously mentioned, this species may be identical with G. tsugae , but this has not yet been determined. G. oregonense holds a \"crystalline substance\" whic h has shown a high degree of activity against acid fast and Gram positive bacteria (Brian, 1951). I have experimented with fruiting bodies of this species. It has a taste similar to reishi and produce s very large fruiting bodies. I displayed several in mushroom exhibits that were about 24\" long and 8\" wide with a thick lateral stalk. Ganoderma sinense G. sinense Zhao, Xu et Zhang is considered by some taxonomists to be synonymous with G. japonicum ; howev er, much controversy surrounds the distinction of G. japonicum (Zhao & Zhang, 1994). It is commonly known as \"zhi chih\" or \"zi zhi,\" the purple type of ling zhi, and is sweet and warming. G. sinense was traditionally used to treat deafness, afflictions of the joints, and to strengthen the \"shen,\" or spirit. It is also said to improve the complexion, increase agility , and impart longevity (Jones, 1992a), and it may be used as an anti-inflammatory , diuretic, and to improve stomach function (Liu and Bau, 1980). Both the mycelium and fruit-body have shown analgesic and anti-inflam matory activity in arthritis models in mice and the mycelial extract promo tes the phagocytic ability of the immune system (W an, 1992). Ganoderma tsugae Another species is G. tsugae Murr ., some forms appearing similar to G. lucidum, though it grow s mainly on conifers instead of hardwoods. Its common Chines e name, Song shan ling zhi, means \"pine tree fungus\" or \"pine wound\" (Jingrong, 1979), but though it is common in the U.S. and other parts of the world, it is more often found on fir and hemlock than pine(Gilbertson & Ryvarden, 1986 ). G. tsugae is today one of the major cultivated species of Ganoderma in Taiwan. Three of the same triterpenoids, lucidone A, ganoderic acid B, and ganoderic acid C2, that occur in reishi have been identified from this species. Significant hepato-protective activity from carbonte trachloride- induced liver toxicity was seen from ganderic acid B from G. tsugae when administered to mice (Su et al, 1993). The fruit-body also contains seven polysaccharides which have shown \"strong\" antitumor activ ity against sarcoma 180 in mice. The more potent are water -soluble polysaccharides which produced tumor inhibitio n ratios of 95.1-100.0% and prolonged life span by 236.3-267.5% (W ang et al, 1993). Mycelial extracts administered to mice (i.p.) significantly increased serum interferon levels and augmented splenic NK cell activity , but only at doses of from 1-50 mg/kg (Won et al, 1992). In North America, G. tsugae is found on dead conifer trees in the midwestern states, the Southwest, California, Maine, N. Carolina, and eastern Canada, typically on hemlock (Lincof f, 1981). Some of my students found a 16 pound fruiting body of this species or G. oregonense high in the Sierra range in California on old hemlock. When fresh, it easily separated into tender strips like cooked chicke n. The taste was sweet, mild, and slightly bitter . We all sampled it extensively and everyone prono unced it delicious. We packed the massive fruiting body (there is a picture in the color section) out of the wilderness area for several miles wrapped in a sheet. A word of warning about this species , though. If harvested before full maturity , it must be prepared as a tinctu re fresh or sliced and dried within 12 hours, or it will mold and take on an unpleasant taste. We are currently experimenting with the tincture and tea of this species. Procur ement G. lucidium is arguably the most common medicinal mushroom found in tableted and liquid products throughout the world. It is available in herb stores, natural food stores, Chinese herb dealers in bulk, and including drug stores in a wide array of prepared products to boost energy levels, improve sexual vigor , counteract aging, and for general health improvement. Various Ganoderma species grow throughout the world, including the Amazon. GEASTRUM TRIPLEX JUNG.(geo=earth, astr=star; a synonym for Geastrum triplex (Arora, 1986). Other Common Names G. triplex is commonly known as \"saucered earthstar\" (Arora, 1986). Description and Habitat The mature outer wall of G. triplex splits into 4- 8 rays, each of which is 3- 10 cm broad when expanded. This fungus is usually seen when its rays unfold and bend under the spore case, opening the apical pore so that the spores may be released (Arora, 1986; Miller , 1979). Hygroscopic (water-absorbing) earthstars are so named because they open their rays in rainy weather exposing their spore cases to moisture, facilitating spore release, and then close up again to retain them when it is dry. Many other species of Geastrum are not hydroscopic (Arora, 1986). Geastrum triplex from The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening by George Nicholson, cir ca 1887. RangeGeastrums are common throughout the United States (Arora, 1986), Europe, and Asia. History In North America, the Cherokee applied the powder of several Geastrum species to the umbilical cord after childbirth, perhaps as both a hemostatic and antibiotic (Mooney and Albrechts, 1932). Chemistry No data. Pharmacology No data. Human Clinical Studies None. Toxicity None known; said to be inedible because they are so tough (Arora, 1986). Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, G. triplex is punge nt, detoxifying, and tonic to the lungs and throat (Liu & Bau, 1980); it also clears internal heat and fever (Ying et al, 1987). It is said to reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract. Decoct it with licorice for sore throat, coughs, and laryngitis. It is used to stanch bleeding and reduce swelling (Ying et al, 1987). The Maya use the spores of Geastrum species to treat wounds (Arora, 1994). Medical Uses Not known. Preparation and Dosage Decoct 3 g for a batch of tea (about 5-6 cups of water) and take twice daily . Related Species The use of Geastrum in vario us cultures is probably not species-specific\u2014 any available species is apparently useful. Astraeus hygrometricus (Pers.) Morg. (said to be unrelated to superficially similar), also called the \"hygroscopic earth- star\", has also been used traditionally in Chinese folk medicine as a hemostatic (Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987). The spore dust of A. hygrometricus is applied externally to stop bleeding of wounds and watery chilblains (a swelling associated with coldness and dampness) (Liu and Bau, 1980). In India, the spore mass is blended 1:1 with mustard seed oil and applied to burns, 4-5 times daily (Raiet al, 1993). The related Geastrum fornic atum (Geaster fornicatus Huds.) had a reputation a styptic (Dragendorf f, 1898). Procur ement Earthstars are not available commercially , except on occasion by special order through Chinese herb dealers. They grow commonly in many regions of the world. GRIFOLA FRONDOSA (DICKS.:FR) S.F. GRAY. Common Names G. frondosa is called \"maitake\" in Japanese, which means \"dancing mushroom.\" Some say it is so named because in ancient times people who found the mushroom danced with joy since it could be exchanged for its weight in silver . However , others feel the name \"maitake\" derives from the fact that the fruiting bodies of adjacent fungi overlap each other , looking like butterflies in a wild dance (Nanba, 1992; Harada, 1993). It is also called hen of the woods and sheep' s head (Arora, 1994). Description and Habitat Small overlapping tongue- or fan-shaped caps with stalks that are often fused together occurring in masses at the base of stumps and on roots. Range It is common in parts of the Eastern U.S., Europe, and Asia; also reported (rarely) from the western half of U.S. History Maitake collecto rs in Japan traditionally guard their hunting grounds with hatch marks on trees bordering the trove and keeping others out of the marked areas. Even so, maitake hunters always forage alone and never divulge the location of their treasure, even to their own family. Until cultivation techniques were developed in 1979, maitake was only available as a wild harvested mushroom. In 1990, Japanese cultivators producednearly 8,000 tons of maitake, and production is expected to increase with expanding exports to the W est (Harada, 1993). Chemistry Both - and (-D-glucans have been detected from maitake, with -D- glucans predom inating. They appear to occur in two forms\u2014the native form (laminaran type) and the helix (curdlan) type (Ohno et al, 1987). Other identified polysaccharides include a -D-glucan and a D-glucan (Kato et al, 1989; Kato et al, 1990; Mizuno et al, 1988; Wei et al, 1991), grifolan et al, 1987), grifolin-LE (Ohno et al, 1986a; et al, 1989), MT-2 (Adachi et al, 1987), LELFD (Suzuki, I. et al, 1989) and grifolan NMF-5N (Takey ama et al, 1988 ), as well as metal-bound protein s known to act as carriers of metals in intest inal absorption (Shimaoka et al, 1990), and an N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin (Kawagishi et al, 1990). Dried maitake was found to be relatively rich in 5'-nucleotides (106-366 mg/100g), inclu ding GMP (Sekizawa et al, 1988; Sekizawa et al, 1989). The total lipid content of G. frondosa is 3.4% , with octadecenoic and octadecadienoic acids being the major acids major phospholipids (Kojima et al, 1991). Ergosterol (vitamin D2) is the majo r sterol, at the concentration of 50-150 IU in 100g wet material (Y okokawa and T akahashi, 1990). Pharmacology Maitake reduce d blood pressure in rats without changing plasma HDL levels. Lentinula edodes (shiitake) also lowered blood pressure but in addition reduced plasma free, VLDL-, and HDL-cholesterol levels (Kabir and Kimura, 1989). Refer to the main entry on Lentinula edodes for further information about shiitake' s pharmacological activity . Adachi and co-workers (1988) found a blood-pressure-lowering effect with the powder of maitake fed to hypertensive rats in their normal chow . The effect was of rapid onset, short-lived, and dose-dependent and was noted in a low-molecular subtraction from the ether -extracted fraction. There was no activity reported from the water -soluble fraction, which may indicate that the tea of maitake is not effective in lowering blood pressure, unlike reishi and shiitake, whose water -soluble fraction has demonstratedthis effect. However , an aqueous extract of maitake reduced serum cholesterol levels in rats (Y agishita et al, 1977). A hepato protective effect was found from an extract of G. frondosa (300 mg/kg) in rats in a hepatitis model (paracetamol-induced) . With the exception of shiitake extract, extracts of other edible protect the rats (Ooi et al, 1993). In another report, a number of popular medicinal fungi were tested for hepatoprotective protective effects (in vitro), showing maitake to be among the active species (Lee et al, 1992). Feeding maitake fruiting body powder (20% of the diet for 21 days\u20141 gram/day) to genetically diabeti c rats has also lowered blood glucose levels in a non-insulin dependent diabe tes mellitus model (Kubo et al, 1994). The blood glucose-lowering effect was said to be both due to a high (150,000) molecular -weight glycoprotein from the hot water decoction and from compounds of an ether - ethanol extract. Nanba (1991, 1994c) reported at the Japan Pharmaceutical Confe rence that when maitake powder was orally administered to rats, the water weight in the excrement increased by about 120%. Powdered maitake orally administered, enhanced the activities of macrophages, N-killer -cells, and cytotoxic T-cells (by 1.4, 1.86, and 1.6 times respectively) and induced an 86% tumor growth inhibition compared with those of non-treated tumor -bearing mice (Mori et al, 1987). Various isolated polysaccharide and protein-bound polysaccharide fractions and sub-fractions from maitake, which are both water -soluble and -insoluble, have also been tested for antitumor and immune-enhancing effects in vivo (with animals) and in vitro (Wu & Zou, 1994; Ohno et al, 1988, 1986a, 1987, 1984; Suzuki et al, 1987, 1985; Adachi et al, 1987; Mizuno et al, 1986; lino et al, 1985). Nearly all (the \"D-fraction\" mentioned below seems to be the exception) of these fractions are active by injection only and not orally (where tested in this dose form) (Ohno et al, 1986a), varying only in the type of tumor it is most active against and the dose and regime with which it is most effective. While scientists look for the most active fractions, which may be effective at low doses and possibly patentable, these studies may also support the use of whole fruiting body teas, extracts, and dietary addit ions, where one receives the benefit of thesyner gy of all of the fractions. Whole powdered fruiting bodie s have been shown to be active orally , and unfortunately , there is little if any data on the chronic daily use of this (as well as other) species and their effect on the immune system and general health. However , the testing of isolated fractions and sub-fractions may be useful in pointing the way to the production of very active and safe preparations that can help people overcome chronic immune diseases such as AIDS and cancer . Recently , a number of studies have been performed with the so-called D- fraction (a 3-branched b-l,6-glucan with about 30% protein) from maitake which has shown an interleukin-1 -stimulating effect. This may be partly responsible for its anti-tumor effect (implanted MM-46 carcinoma and IMC carcinoma) when given to mice by injection and also orally (Nanba, 1993). Nanba (1994b) has also report ed that D-fraction administered to tumor - bearing mice along with the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C, markedly enhanced tumor inhibition, and that the extract inhibited the growth of MM-46 breast cancer cells in mice when administered orally , even after the tumors were well formed. The researcher also found the extract to be effective in the formation of new tumors and slowing metastasis of existing cancer cells to the liver of mice. See Table 9 for a complete review of anticancer and immune-po tentiation effects of maitake. Recently , murine monoclonal antibodies (Mab) were isolated by injecting mice with a proteoglycan fraction derived from maitake and subsequent hybridization and culturing of spleen cells (Hirata et al, 1994). The authors predict that the antibodies may \"recognize\" the type of immu nologically- active b-D-glucans that are found in maitake, shiitake, and other similar fungi, thus acting as a means to identify active polysaccharides. A sulfated proteo-glucan from maitake also shows anti-HIV activity and apparently preve nts HIV from killing T-cells in-vitr o (Nanba et al, 1992), though the National Cancer Institute chose not to follow up with subsequent studies (Japanese NIH, 1990, 1991; National Cancer Institute, 1991) because of the toxicity posed by sulfation, and also because of its high molecular weight, which makes it difficult to study as an injectable (Shirota, 1994). Researchers have suggested that maitake extract, as well as schizophyllan, may stimulate the immune system in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (Ostram, 1992).A group of researchers in Japan have identified a peptide that can enhance the absorption of coppe r from the small intestine by increasing the level of soluble copper (Shimaoka et al, 1993). Table 9 LABORA TORY STUDIES WITH MAITAKE EXTRACT : ANTICANCER EFFECT AND -POTENTIA TION Note: Grifola fruiting bodies acid insoluble, alkali soluble, and hot water extractable D-fractio n, which is a polysaccharide bound to a protein in the ratio of 70:30. Oral dosages of fraction-D (0.4% of maitake, dry weight), that is effective in mice at inhibiting tumors and restoring immune functions suppressed due to the growing cancer , are about 0.75 milligrams/kilogram of mouse weight. Although it is difficult to compare the activity in mice with humans, assuming a 1:1 activity ratio would mean that a comparable dose of D-fraction, found in the quantity of 4 mg/g of fruit body, is 47.25 mg for a 140 pound person\u2014the amount contained in about 11.81 grams of maitake fruiting body\u2014assuming a laboratory extraction simila r to those in Hishida (1988) and others. However , the usual dose recommended by doctors using maitake in cancer treatment is 3-7 grams/day (Shirota, 1994; Nanba, 1994a).In Mori et al (1986), it was found that including dried maitake powder in the mouse chow as 20% of their feed seemed to activate the immune response as well as stimulate a strong antitumor response. The dose of fraction-D that proved effective in mice was administered every other day for 10 days. The hot-water extract of Grifola fruiting bodies was fractionated to create fraction-D by successive precipitations and purification using several solvents: first ethyl alcohol, then other solvents. The tumor -inhibition rate for the whole hot-water fraction (\"Pre-A\" fraction) only was 2%, as compared with 58% for fraction-D (29 times as strong). Whether a longer administration of weeks or months of the hot- water extract (and perhaps in a higher dose than given in the experiment\u2014 0.5 ml every other day X 10/mo use) would lead to significant antitumor and immune-enhancing effects is not clear (Hishida, 1988). It is interesting to note that Hishid a claimed to have found a substance in the pre-A fraction that \"inhibited immune stimulation,\" which may have led to the very low tumor -inhibition rate of 2 %. Later purification may have eliminated those substances responsible. Human Clinical Studies A maitake D fraction-containing extract is being studied in medical clinics in the U.S. for patients with breast and colorectal cancers (Miller , 1994). In China a Grifola extract demonstrated an anticancer effect in 63 patients with lung, stomach, hepatocellu lar cancers, and leukemia (Zhu et al, 1994). The extract was given orally , 4 capsules three times daily before meals for 1-3 months. Nanba (1994a,b) reports that he has \"seen a lot of advanced cancer patients recovered from severe side effects from chemotherapies\" (with fraction D). Maitake extracts with D fraction may also prove to be an effective therapy for patients with AIDS. Dr . Joan Priestley , MD reports that her patients with Kaposi' s sarcoma and other symptoms of AIDS show improvement when administered the extract, and Dr. David Hughes, MD has had positive results with Kaposi' s sarcoma lesions (Nanba, 1994a). These reports are encouraging, but keep in mind that they are preliminary clinical reports, not controlled studies. A prospective uncontrolled, non-randomized study was undertaken at the Ayurvedic Medicine Center of New Y ork (Gerson, 1994). Eleven volunteers with documente d essential hypertension were given three 500 mg caplets of maitake mushro om extract (Grifron) two times daily in the morning andevening. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly for an average of six weeks. There was a mean decre ase in systolic BP of 14 mm Hg and 8 mm Hg in diastolic BP, which was about a 7% and 9.4% average drop respectively . The drop was steady and consistent. Some of the patients in the study were taking medication during the test, and of course, the possibility of the patients getting used to the testing procedures and technician during the test leading to a gradual decrease in blood pressure cannot be overlooked. The results do suggest that a follow-up controlled study would be desirable. A concentrated polysaccharide extract of G. frondosa was used in a randomized controlled clinical trial with 32 chronic hepatitis B patients. The recovery rate was reported to be 72% in the Grifola group and 57% in the control group. Seroconvers ion from HBeAg positive to negative was 44% in the Grifola group and 13% in the control group (W u & Zou, 1994). Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine The closely-related G. umbellata (sclerot ium) has a sweet, bland taste and mild ener gy (Chang and But, 1986). Medical Uses When used consistently (3-5 times weekly) as a food or tea, it possibly aids in cancer -prevention, immune-stimulation in people with cancer , support for people with cancer under going chemotherapy (which is immunosuppressive), and people infected with the AIDS virus. It potentially benefits diabetics (lowering blood glucose) and people with hypertension. Preparation and Dosage 3-7 grams a day in supplement form, in tea, or in cooking (soups, etc.). Related Species Grifola umbellata , reviewed below . Procur ement Maitake can be found in gourmet restaurants (I recently enjoyed a dish featuring them in Maine), dried and packaged in gourmet grocery stores, occasionally through Chinese herb dealers, and increasingly , in prepared products in Japan, throughout other parts of Asia, the U.S., and Europe. It grows commonly in Europe and Asia and in the eastern U.S.GRIFOLA and Bau, 1980); choreimaitake (Yokoyama et al, 1975). Description and Habitat Whitish to gray circular caps with central stems. The fruiting bodies arise from sclerotia, or \"tubers\" (Arora, 1986). Range Eastern North America and Asia. History Zhu ling is first mentioned in the Divine Husbandman' s Classic of the Materia Medie a, also known as the Classic of the Materia Medica , which was the first book that focuses on descriptions and uses of indiv idual herbs (Bensky & Gamble, 1993). This important work was said to be written by the legen dary \"Divine Husbandm an,\" who is considered the father of herbal medicine in China, but is known to originate from the first century A.D., later reconstruc ted from several manuscripts on herbal medicine by the famous T aoist, T ao Hong-Jing (452-536 A.D.). & Yamamoto , 1964; Yokoyama et al, 1975; Chang and But, 1986). According to Suzuki et al (1982), its mineral content (ppm) is as follows: Studies on 1-, 2-, and 3-year -old G. umbellata have determined that total sugar , polysaccharide, and ergosterol content is highest in the 2-year -oldfungus (Guo et al, 1992). Pharmacology The most important use of zhu ling in TCM is as a diuretic in cases of edema, scanty urine output, and damp heat conditions such as jaundice, vaginal dischar ge, and diarrhea. A number of modern studies, mostly from China, have supported this traditional use. For instance, zhu ling has produced increased urine output and elevated excretion of sodium and chloride in rats, after an injection (i.p. of the acetone extract, apparently by inhibiting active transport of chloride and blocking sodium reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle) (Huang et al, 1985). The effect was similar in strength to ethacrynic acid, a commonly used diuretic drug with significant side effects, such as depletion of potassium, an important electrolyte (Reynolds, 1993). The zhu ling extract did not increase the excretion of potassium. In an older study by Shen and coworkers in 1957, a decoction (8 grams administered 4 times as a decoction) increased the 6-hour urine output by 62% and chloride output by 54.5% in healthy volunteers, which was stronger than that seen with Akebia quinata or hoelen (Wolfiporia cocos). The water decoction may be stronger than an ethanolic extract (tincture), which did not increase the urine output in healthy human subjects, but did in another study with dogs (Chang & But,1986). The zhu ling extract did not lead to thinning of blood or a change of the glomerular filtration rate, so the diuretic effect was thought to be due to inhibition of electrolyte and water reabsorp tion by the renal tubules (Chang & But, 1986). In a number of in vitr o and in vivo studies, G. umbellata and its crude and refined hot-water extracts (Ueno et al, 1982; Miyazaki et al, 1979; Chang and But, 1987; Ying et al, 1987 , Yu et al, 1985), as well as the ethanolic extract (Chang & But,1987), have demonstrated marked antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 and hepatoma, plus a number of other types of experimentally-induced cancers (Ito et al, 1973). The extracts accelerate the production of IgM and strengthen the phagocytic power of the monocytes (Li, 1985; Chang & But, 1986), while improving cellular immunity (macrophage proliferation and activity) in normal and liver-compromised mice (Zhang et al, 1991). A number of polyporusterones, A-G have been isolated and determined to be cytotoxic on leukemia 1210 cells in vitro (Ohsawa et al, 1992). However , the fungus shows no effect on leukemia L615 (Chang and But,1987). A special zhu ling extract \"757\" showed DNAsynthesis inhibition in mouse sarcoma 180 (Chang & But, 1987 ). Zhu ling polysaccharides, especially , have been shown to be antineoplastic in vivo, and this effect may be due to a nonspecific immunostimulant or immunopotentiating action (Chang and But, 1986). For example , although a polysaccharide extracted from this fungus has shown antitumor activity (in vivo), increas ed formation of antibody cells in the spleen, and increased phagocytosis of the peritoneal macrophages in mice, G. umbellata extract was not directly effective on the tumor cells in vitro (Zhu, 1987). Also, in mice with hepatoma H22 given G. umbellata , restor ation of liver carbohydrate metabolism and adrenocortical function took place, which suggests that the antitumor properties may also be attributed to a metabolism-restoring action (Wei et al, 1983). Zhu ling purified hot water extract has also demonstrated a mitogenic effect in vitro (Yadomae et al, 1979b). Mitogens are high-molecular weight compounds often associated with bacterial cell walls and are known to modulate the immune response. Tumor -necrosis factor (TNF), which may be produced by macrophages associated with the reticuloend othelial system (RES), is also known to reduce tumor size and increase the survival time of animals with various cancers. Zhu ling spray-dried water extract was fed to mice and showed no TNF-releasing activity , whereas the Chinese herbs bupleurum, angelica, cnidium, and cinnamon had strong activity in the same assay (Haranaka et al, 1985). An alcoholic extract of G.umbellata has demonstrated antibiotic actions in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Chang & But, 1986), and a polysaccharide derivative demonstrated hepa toprotective effects in mice (Lin and Wu,1988). The polysaccharides have also been found to confer protection again st ionizing radiation (Hu and But, 1987). In this study , the survival rate for mice given G. umbellata 2 hours before exposure was 35.5%, while the survival rate of mice treated 48 hours before exposure was 75%. The control group' s survival rate was only 2.5%. In a screening of 80 different Chinese herbs for hair growth promoting activity , G. umbellata placed third among the five most active species. One of the constituents responsible for this action was identified as 3,4- dihydroxybenzaldehyde, a compound with anti-inflammato ry activity (Inaoka et al, 1994). Human Clinical ReportsGrifola umbellata was shown to increase diuresis, stimulate the immune system, and act as an anticancer agent. This fungus is used to treat edema, increase vaginal secretion, and promote urination. The dose is 6 to 15 g made into a decoction. It is one of the major ingredients in the Chinese formula, Wu Ling San, which has been reported from clinical trials to radically improve cirrhotic ascites (Huang, 1993). G. umbellata' s polysaccharide s have been used in the treatment of cancer patients since the mid-1970s, with varying degrees of improvement reported, includi ng better appetite, weight gain, and greater mental alertness (Zhu, 1987). The clinical symptoms associated with lung cancer (10 cases studied) and chronic hepatitis (170 cases) were improved with the administration of a polysaccharide from G. umbellata (Li, 1985). Clinical studies on a new G. umbellata extract named \"757\" show that this fungus could help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and strengthen the immune system (Chang & But, 1986). For example, when 757 was used in combination with chemotherapy , an 86% rate of symptomatic improvement was noted in subjects with lung cancer , while those who were treated with just G. umbellata had only 62.5% rate of improvement in symptoms. Tumor stability was 70% in the combined therapy group, as compared to 25% for the use of the extract alone. The \"757\" extract seemed to protect immune system functions in 13 patients who had esophageal cancer and were concurrently receiving chemotherapy , but the therapeutic effects were less certain (Chang & But, 1986). In 39 patients with cirrhosis of the liver with ascites who failed to respond to other treatment, a modified traditional herbal formula \"Wu Ling San,\" (6-12 gram s daily in decoc tion), was reported to bring about a clinical cure in 17 cases, marked improv ement in 7, and significant improvement in 12. The base formula was composed of the following (Bensky and Barolet, 1990): ling) 2.3 zhu) 2.3 grams ling) 2.3 grams] Five-peel decoction (Wu Pi Yin) was also given to the volunteers, which consists of the following: Pericarpium Arecae iride 9 grams Zhu ling decocti on brought good results in five cases of chyluria in 4 of the patients (Chang & But, 1987). Sclerotium Polypori Umbellati (zhu ling) 3 grams ling) 3 grams Rhizoma Alismatis Orientalis (ze xie) 3 grams Talcum (hua shi) 3 grams Gelatinum Corii Asini (e jiao) 3 grams Contraindications and T oxicity G. umbellata was found to be nontoxic in animal studies at the dose of 200- 250 mg/kg oral, 500 mg/kg i.p., or up to 100 mg/kg i.p. daily for 28 days (Chang & But, 1987). No negative reactions have been noted in human trials (Zhu, 1987). The LD50 of an acetone extract i.p. was determined to be >0.4 g/kg (Huang et al, 1985). In traditional use, the mushroom is not recommended for people who do not have dampness imbalances, or for long periods of time (Bensky and Gamble, 1993). Used longer than 3-4 weeks it might be too drying (without the addition of other moistening herbs such as marshmallow root). Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, zhu ling is considered to have a sweet and bland taste; its temperature is slightly cool (Bensky and Gamble, 1993). Zhu ling is used primarily in health imbalances where there is excess dampness\u2014as a diuretic for painful urination, urinary tract infections, edema, diarrhea, jaundice (damp heat in the lower jiao), and leukorrhea (Chang and But, 1987; Bensky & Gamble, 1993). Zhu ling is a major component of the popular Chinese patent formula called Wu Ling San, which also contains other strengthen ing herbs. This formula is modified from the one given above, and provides a 3 -4 week supply: Zhu ling 180 grams Hoelen 180 grams Cinnamon 120 grams Alisma 300 grams Atractylodis (stir -fried)180 grams Grind the herbs to a powder , blend, and place in capsules (take 2 caps 3 x daily), or stir 6-9 grams into warm water or tea and drink 1 cup morning and evening. Wu ling san is recommended for invigorating the function of the Kidney , strengthening the Spleen (digestion and assimilation), and increasing urine output. Specific symptoms which indicate the use of zhu ling include water retention, abdominal distention with vomiting, diarrhea, and dry mouth with no desire to drink (T u, 1988). Medical Uses G. umbellata is used to treat lung cancer (Ying et al, 1987). In a clinical report from China, its decoction showed a 92% improvement rate in patients with cirrhotic ascites (Huang, 1993). Preparation and Dosage 6-15 grams/day as a decoction, extracts in tablet or capsule form, or in soups (T u, 1988). Related Species Grifola fr ondosa (see above). In the 1940s, low molecular weight antibiotic terpenoids were isolated from what was reported to be Grifola confluens , which and Mizu no in 1948 (Hirata and Nakanishi, 1950). Chemically , this compound is 2-trans, trans- farnesyl-5-methylresorcinol and was recently shown to have a cholesterol- lowering effect in rats (Sugiyama, 1992). Grifolin has also shown antibiotic properties against Gram positive bacteria (Hirata & Nakanishi, 1949). The fruiting body and cultured mycelium of A. confluens , known in Japan as Ningyotake, contains polysaccharides which show antitumor activity (Mizuno et al, 1992). Procur ement Zhu ling is a common component of Chinese prepared products, as mentioned above. It is also available in bulk through Chinese herb dealers.INONOTUS and Habitat The sterile carpophore conk is a hard black, deeply-cracked stalkless growth found on alder , birch, and elm; notable from the appearance of having been burnt. The fertile fruiting bodies are transitory and hard to find. Chaga can attain lengths of 4-5 feet. Range Poland, Western Siberia, throughout North America (Kier , 1961; Saar, 1991a). History Russian folklore from the province of Olonyets in northwestern Russia tells of a fungus which grows on birch trees being revered for treating a variety of cancers. Folkloric reports also come from Siberia, the Baltic, and Finland. Specifi cally , only the \"abortive\" sporophores of the fungus were given to cancer patients as a tea until the cancer improved (Luca s, 1960). In Russia, besides its well-known use against cancer (Grzybek et al, 1983), chaga is regarded as a tonic, blood purifier , and pain-reliever (Hutchens, 1973) and was widely used against cancer in Poland in 1961. It was recommended and approved for public use against cancer by the Medical Academy of Science, Moscow , 1955 (Hutchens, 1973). In 1960, the U.S. National Cancer Institute received a report that a decoction of chaga had been used successfully to treat cancer in Australia (Hartwell, 1971a). Chemistry Inooidiol, oxygenated acid (Kem pska et al, 1962). A Pteroiloglatamic acid derivative has also been isolated (Grzybek et al, 1983), as well as the aromatic vanillic-, syringic- and r-hydr oxybenzoic acids (Lovyagina et al, 1958). Pharmacology Based on its long history of use against cancer , a number of eastern European resear chers have tested it in the laboratory for antitum or activity . Gatty-Kostyal et a1 showed an antitumor effect of the alcoholi c extract in 1954, followed by a number of other Polish and Russian researchers who also tested various extracts in vitro and in vivo (Jarosz et al, 1990), which lead to the use of the official preparation \"Befungin\" as an anticancer therapy (Grzyb ek et al, triterpenes, particularly Inotodiol, of shown antitumor activity (in vitro) against MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo in mice (Kahlos et al, 1987; Kahlos et al, 1986). In animals, a water extract of chaga at non-toxic doses showed activity against carcinoma (Kier , 1961). The identity of the active compound(s) responsible for the antitumor activity is still under discussion. Some researchers point to the triterpenes, especially obliquol, (Grzybek et al, 1983). However , these compounds occur in very small amounts (less than 0.2%) in the official Russian anticancer remedy Befungin, as does the proven anticarc inogenic comp ound, a pteroiloglatamic acid derivative (Grzybek et al, 1983). Because of this, Grzybek et a1 (1983) tested the polysaccharide fraction in the Allium- test, which measures the inhibition of the mitotic index. The researchers claim that the test is \"predictive of experiments with animal tumor systems.\" Polysaccharide fraction B from Inonotus showed positive activity in the test, prompting a call for further research on chaga polysaccharid es, especially since the fraction was found to be contaminated with minerals, proteins, and nucleic acids. Antitumor activ ity was only found from extracts prepared by lengthy heating or \"decocting,\" which investigators noted was the means of preparation used in folk medicine. Infusions, prepared by steeping the plant material, were not active against the tumor systems tested (Lucas, 1959).Chaga showed no in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli (Broadbent, 1966). Human Clinical Studies A study in Poland with 48 patients having third and fourth stage malignancies found chaga injections with cobalt salts to be the most effective form of preparation. In ten of the patients, tumors reduced in size, pain decreased, hemorrhaging occurred less often and became less intense, and recovery was attended with better sleep and appetite and feelings of improvement. Most of these patients were women treated with chaga for cancer of the genital organs or breast cancer (Piaskowski, 1957). Other clinical studies have been conducted in lung cancer patients with an aerosol preparation and in inoperable genital cancer in women with an extract of chaga administered by injection and suppository (Hartwell, 1971a). Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine Chaga is a Russian folk remedy for cancers, including inoperable breast cancer , lip cancer , gastric, parotid gland, pulmonary , stomach, skin, and rectal cancers, and Hodgkin' s disease (Hartwell, 1971a). Russians also use chaga to treat ulcers and gastritis and to regenerate organs and glands. To treat the lower bowel, decoctions are applied as colonics (Hutchens, 1973). In Western Siberia, the Khanty people traditionally prepared chaga and still use the tea to treat tuberculosis, stomachache, stomach disease, liver or heart disease, worms, and as an internal cleansing agent. In the form of \"soap water ,\" the fungus is used by women to make a wash for external cleansing of the genitals following or during menstruation; for cleansing new-born infants; for \"ritual washing\"; and as a soap substitute for washing the feet and hands or the whole body . Soap water is prepared by burning chaga until red and then placing the charred fungus in hot water and stirring until it breaks up, and the water turns black (Saar , 1991a). Medical Uses Russian clinicians concluded that in cancer patients chaga is useful in some but not all cance rs; that it preve nts intoxication and regur gitation, improves appetite, and reduces pain; but that for cancer chaga requires long-term use of at least one year (Larionov , 1965). Preparation and DosageFor cancer, chaga has been prepared as a tea, decoction, extract, syrup, injection, suppository , tablet, and aerosol (Hartwell, 1971a). The tea is prepared by boiling small pieces of the fungus in water for several minutes . Three square centimeters provide 2.5 liters of tea. According to Hutchens (1973), the tea is taken in a dose of three cups per day, 1/2 hour before meals, for 12-20 weeks with intervals of 7-10 days. Hutchens advises that only the middle portion of fungus be used, which is a granulated mass distinguishable from an outer rough part and a soft portion adjacent to the host tree. She suggests a tea be made with warm water (5 parts to 1 of chaga) by soaking the fungus for 48 hours in order not to destroy activity (Hutchens, 1973). However , this method is contrary to methods used by the Khanty (Saar , 1991a), who cut the fungus into small pieces and boile d it for a few minutes (3 cm of the fruiting body/pot of tea). The Khanty drank the tea \"until the indispositions were over.\" And according to antitumor studies, unboiled extracts had no antitumor effect in mice, but boiling apparently activated the antitumor principals, leading to tumor inhibition in mice (Lucas, 1960). It seems that both folkloric and laboratory evidence points towards boiling the grated fungus and administering the tea. An alcoholic extract may also be effective , according to Russian studies. Related Species Inonotus sciurinus Imaz., I. tabacinus (Mont.) Kavst., and I. orientalis (Lloyd) Teng. of China have shown high rates of tumor inhibition against Ehrlich carcinoma and sarcoma 180. The most active was I. orientalis with rates of 100% inhibition against both tumor systems. I. cuticularis (Bull.:Fr . inhibited Ehrlich carcinoma by 100% sarcoma 180 by 90%. This species occurs on hardwoods throughout the U.S., Canada, and Asia. Medicinal uses include gastropathy , hemorrhages, bromhidrosis, and leprosy . It is considered sweet, smoothing to vital energy, strengthening to mind and spirit, and removing harmful wind (Y ing et al, 1987). Notes According to Belova and Varent sova (1962), the tincture of chaga should be made 1:10 (weight to volume) preserved with 10% ethanol. The solids content of the tincture should be about 2-2.3%, but that of the decoction made by heating the powdered fruiting body to 80 degrees centr igrade for 1 hour is 6-9%. The decoction can be filtered, concentrated unde r vacuum to20% solids and then either preserved with 10% ethanol or dried to a powder in a food dehydrator (Yakimov et al, 1961). Andreeva (1961) found that the maximum extraction of a polyphenol mixture was highest at 100 degrees centigrade, but that a self-condensation reaction changed the composition of the extra ct at higher temperatures. Although the total steroid content of dry chaga was found to be 0.85-0.94% by Loviagina & Shivrina (1962), the authors conclud e that the total anticancer effect of the extract must be due to compounds other than inotodiol, the only sterol shown to slow the growth of tumor cells in vitr o. Procurement To my knowledge, chaga is not available in prepared product s outside of Russia. It grows on birch and other hosts, especially in the eastern U.S. (I found several in northern Vermont), Alaska, Europe, and other parts of the northern hemisphere. edodes, means \"edible\". Other Common Names The common Japanese name for L. edodes , shiitake, derives from its association with the shiia tree (Willard, 1990). Also known as snake butter , Pasania fungus, or forest mushroom (Liu and Bau, 1980) and Hua Gu in Chinese. Description and Habitat These light amber fungi are found on fallen broadleaf trees (Ying et al, 1987). The trees particularly suitable for growing shiitakes are chestnut, chinquapin, beech, oak, Japanese alder , sweet gum, maple, walnut, and mulberry . They have decurrent, even to ragged gills; a central to off-center stem; an inrolled margin when young; and are covered with a delicate, white flocking. They are not found in the wild in the United States but arewidely cultivated. Commercial kits which allow one to grow them indoors are available, and outdoor cultivation is also possible (see resource section). Range L. edodes is indigenous to Japan, China, and other Asian countries with temperate clima tes. A very similar species occurs wild in Costa Rica (Arora, 1994). History Shiitake has been renowned in Japan and China as a food and medicine for thousands of years. According to historical records, in the year 199 A.D., the Japanese Emperor Chuai was offered the shiitake by the Kyusuyu, a native tribe of Japan. Even older documents record shiitake' s use in ancient China, where it was referred to as \"ko-ko\" or \"hoang-mo\" (Scientific Consulting Service). The cultivation of shiitake is probably quite ancient. It is currently the second most commonly produced edible mushroom in the world (Nakamura, 1992). The nascent interest here has been spawned partly because shiitake tastes much more exotic and delicious than the bland Agaricus bisporus of supermarket shelves, and partly because of the immense amou nt of research that has been conducted on its varied medicinal properties. Constituents Shiitake has excellent nutritional value, containing proteins (2.22-2.60% fresh and 25.9% dry weight), lipids (primarily linoleic acid), (Horie, 1991), minerals (especi ally calcium), and vitamins B2 and C (Liu and Bau, 1980; Ying et al, 1987 ). High amounts of ergosterol, a provitamin which converts to vitam in D in the presence of sunlight (Ying et al, 1987), is also present. In fact, studies have shown that exposing shiitake to direct sunlight for 3 hours/day increa ses its vitamin D2 content up to 5 times. Shiitake is an efficient source for this nutrient , containing between 873 and 4,381 IU/100 Takamura et al, 1991; Takeuchi et al, 1991 ). Sunlight exposure also increases the free amino acid content which is about 2,180 mg% in the dry fruiting bodies, and it makes them sweeter and less bitter (Kiribuchi, 1991).The mineral content of cultured shiitake mycelium (on of 90% bagasse, 5% rice bran, 5% whea t bran, and other nutrients) when extracted close to the fruiting stage with boiling water was as follows (in mg/g of dry weight): (Iizuka & Maeda, 1988; Ikebe et al, 1990; Lasota and Sylwestrzak, 1989) As with many vegetables and fruits, the mineral content is highly variable, depending on the substrate where it grows. For instance, shiitake cultured with extra calcium in its culture medium has up to 3 times as much calcium in the fruiting bodies (Sasaki, 1990). The mycelial cell-saps contain 30 enzymes and more than 10 amino acids, while the fruiting body contains all the essential amino acids, with lysine and arginine being particularly abundant (Liu and Bau, 1980) and methionine and phenylalanine the limiting amino acids (Lasota and Sylwestrzak, 1989). In laborato ry analysis it was found that amino acids, protein, glycoge n, lipids, ascorbic acid, and total ash contents increased as the fruiting body developed (Fasidi and Kadiri, 1990). Based on these findings, it may be desirable to consume fully mature fruiting bodies for maximum nutritional value. The researchers generally found higher concentrations of nutrients in the cap than the stem of the fungus. Potassium was the most abundant mineral element, followed by phosphorus. The compounds responsible for the characteristic odor of fresh shiitake have been determined to be l-octen-3-ol, ethyl acetate, 2-octeno l, and octyl alcohol with the addition of 1,2,4-trithiolane in the boiled fruiting bodies. The latter compound\u2014along with 1,2,4,5-tetrathiane\u2014is characteristic of sulfur -containing components (Ahn et al, 1987). Shiitake is the source of two well-studied preparations with proven effects\u2014namely Lentinula and cell-wall constituent extracted from the fruiting bodies or mycelium of L. edodes. In essence, it is a highly purified, high molecular weight polysaccharide (of abou t one million) in a triple helix structure,containing only glucose molecules with mostly (l-3)-(-D-gluc an linkages in the regularly branched main chain with two ( (l,6)-D-gluc opyranoside branchings for every five -(l,3)-glucopyranoside linear linkages (Aoki, 1984b). The configuration of the glucose molecules in a helix structure is thought to be important for the biological activity (Hamuro et al, 1971b). Lentinan is completely free of any nitrogen (and thus protein), phosphorus, sulfur , or any other atoms except carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen (Chihara,1981). It is water -solub 1984b). Lentinula edodes extract (LEM) is a preparation of the powdered mycelia extract of L. edodes harvest ed befor e the cap and stem grow . LEM' s major active constituent is a heteroglycan protein conjugate, that is, a protein-bound polysaccharide. It contains about 24.6% protein and 44% sugars, mostly the pentose s xylose (a wood sugar) and arabinose (a pectin sugar), as well as glucose and smaller amounts of galactose, mannose, and fructose (Iizuka and Maeda, 1988). LEM also contains various nucleic acid derivatives; vitamin B compounds, especially B-l active polysaccharides and protein-polysaccharide complexes, water -soluble lignins were isolated from LEM (Hanafusa et al, 1990). Both lentinan and LEM have been studied extensi vely for their interesting biological effects, which will be reviewed in the following Pharmacology section. Pharmacology It is impossible to consider the pharmacology of shiitake withou t reviewing its two most tions, Lentinula edodes mycelium extract (LEM) and lentinan. The chemical nature of these two substances is reviewed in the preceding section. Lentinan and LEM have both demonstrated strong antitumor activity , both orally and by injection in animals and humans. These substances work by enhancing various immune system functions rather than attacking the tumor cells (or viruses) themselves. In the following sections I will review the major published laboratory and clinical work available on their antitumor , immune- regulating, and antiviral effects, as well as their effects on the cardiovascular system.It must be ment ioned here that the immense volume of data available on lentinan alone is overwhelming, and it is not my intention to mention each study . However , a vast majority of the published studies are redundant and only serve to amplify or clarify certain points. In the following sections, I will report on the most characteristic and current studies. Please note that all the studies on lentinan quoted below are performed with test animals (nearly all with mice) by injection\u2014 either intraperitone al (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v .), unless mentioned. Antitumor Effects To begin with, various polysac charides extracted from L. edodes besides lentinan have shown antitumor (Chihara, 1969) and immuno stimulating activities (Cao et al, 1989), for instance, by increasing phagocyt otic activity of the peritoneal macrophages (Jiang et al, 1986). In one study , Fuji et al (1978) isolated a polysaccharide containing an a-mannan-peptide complex (KS-2) that strongly inhibited tumor growth when administe red to mice both orally and i.p. in doses between 1 and 100 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal injections (in mice) of other intracellular polysaccharides increased the phagocytotic function of the reticuloendothelial system (an important defense mechanism composed of highly phagocytic cells), while extracellular polysaccharides showed no ef fect (Zheng et al, 1985). Of interest to mushroom-eaters and health-care practitioners is whether lentinan or shiitake in its whole form has any antitumor effect when taken orally as a tea, added to the diet, or used in capsules or tablets, powdered or in extract form. Based on the number of active fractions from shiitake fruiting bodies showing antitum or activity , this would seem likely . Nanba et al (1987) found that powdered shiitake fruiting bodies fed to mice as 10% of their normal diet inhibited the growth of sarcoma 180 and MM-46 tumors by 40%, but not B-16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinom a, or others. Mori et al (1986 ) found that if shiitake were made part of the feed (20% a week) after tumor implantation, the tumor inhibition rate was 53.9%. If shiitake feed was given on the same day, the inhibition rate was 72.4%. Powdered whole shiitake fruiting bodies administered orally to tumor - bearing mice at 10% of the normal diet, improved macrophage phagocytosis, which is thought to play a role in its tumor -inhibiting activity (Nanba et al, 1987).Ikekawa et al (1969) found that an injection (i.p.) of the freeze-dried water extract of shiitake (200 mg/kg/day X10) produced an inhibition rate of 80.7%. Although many early papers (before 1980) on lentinan report that it is not active orally , Aoki (1984b) stated that it is but gave no farther details. However , studies in normal mice administered lentinan (1 mg in saline) orally demonstrated that compared to controls, peripheral white blood cell counts showed no significant difference, but that T helper cell and T cell ratios were significantly raised after one month of administration; ratios then fell to normal after eight weeks, thus indicating the development of tolerance to lentinan (Hanaue et al, 1989). Lentinan was first isolated and studied in 1969 for its anti-tumor effects by Chihara and coworkers of the National Cancer Institute of Japan (Chihara, 1970b ). Lentinan' s antitumor activity was significantly stronger than polysaccha rides from many other fungi, lichens, and higher plants (Arai et al, 1971), but it appear s to be active in certain animals for some, but not all, types of tumors (Maeda et al, 1974). The purified polysaccharide has been shown in animal studies to be nontoxic and enhance the immune response, producing strong tumor regression and even disappeara nce of tumors by 5 weeks in sarcoma 180 (Maeda et al, 1974b; Togami et al, 1982 ), ascites hepatoma 134 (Moriyama et al, 1981), and Ehrlich carcino ma (Ying et al, 1987), as well as a number of other experimentally-induce d cancers in allogeneic, syngeneic, and autologous hosts as well as preventative activity against chemical carcinogenesis. Injections in mice produced either an 80% reduction in tumor size or complete regressio n in most of the animals. An intact immune system with a functioning thymus gland was found to be a requisite for the anticancer effect (Maeda & Chihara, 1973; Dennert & Tucker , 1973; Yamada et and when immunosuppressive agents (6- benzylthioguanosine or X-radiation) were given with lentinan, the anti- tumor ef fect was reduced (Arai et al, 1971). Lentinan has also been found to restore enzyme activity of X-prolyl-dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase, which can be depressed in cancer patients and mice with implanted tumors (Kato et al, 1979). Laboratory tests seem to point to an important role of the adrenal- pituitary axis and central-perip heral nervous and catecholamines in lentinan' s antitumor activity (Maeda et al, 1974). In Japan, lentinan is often used to help support immune function in cancer patients during chemotherapy (for instance cyclopho sphamide), often leading to increased survival times (see Human Clinical Trials section). It is well-known that such chemotherapeutic agents can lead to severe immune suppression. A number of animal studies also support this use (Dennart, 1973). Hosokawa et al (1981) report on the importance of timing for the effective administration of combination immunotherapy and chemotherapy . Studies in animals support the use of lentinan in combination with immunobiological agents to treat cancer , such as a combined treatment with IL-2 (Suzuki, 1990; Yamasaki et al, 1989). Against spontaneous lung micrometastases in mice, lentinan or IL-2 alone were inef fective. Used in a combined treatment, pulmonary metastases were significantly inhibited. Thus, IL- 2 plus lentinan acted syner gistically (Yamasaki et al, 1989). Immune-Regulating Effects As previously mentioned, lentin an does not attack cancer cells directly , but produces its anti-tumor effect by activating different immune responses in the host. This activation was at first thought to occur only in immune- compromised animals, but not in healthy animals (Maeda et al, 1974b) and was called an immunorestorative agent, but recent work has uncovered a true immunopot entiating effect, by showing a clearly augmenting effect on the proliferation of peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC) from healthy human donors, which is also supported by animal studies (Aok i, 1984b). It is not presently known exactly what molecular interactions take place in the initial stages of lentinan exposu re in an animal system; howeve r, there is a transitory but notable increase in several serum protein components in the a-and b-globulin region, namely complement C3, hemopexin, and ceruloplasmin (Maeda et al, 1974a). The following effects have been noted after lentinan administration in animals and humans. Lentinan can activate natural killer (NK) cells in vitro in the same concentrations that can be achieved in the blood plasma of patients clinically-treated with lentinan (T ani et al, 1992; Sendo et al, 1981). NK cell activity is involved in tumor suppression (Herberman & Nunn-Har grove, 1981) and either does not stimulate T-killer cell activity or only undercertain conditio ns, but it is a strong T-helper cell stimulant (Dennert & Tucker , 1973) both in vitro and in vivo (Miyakoshi and Aoki, 1984a,b) and can increase their levels (Liu et al, 1988). Lentinan has also shown the ability to stimulate peripheral blood lymphocytes into increased lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell and natural killer cell (NK) activity mediated by interleukin 2 in vitro from the blood of healthy donors and cancer patients at levels achievable in vivo by administration of clinical doses (Arinaga et al, 1992a; Fujimoto et al, 1992; Tani et al, 1993). Intravenous lentinan also significantly increased the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from 10 patients with gastric cancer to produce IL1-a, IL1-b, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) (Arinaga et al, 1992b). It can also inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which can slow T-cell differentiation in animals and humans (Aoki, 1984b). Lentinan has also been shown to inhibit suppressor T cell activity in vivo (Miyakoshi & Aoki, 1984a), and, in addition, increase the ratio of activated T cells, and cytotoxic T cells in the spleen when administered to gastric cancer patients with chemothera py; this increase in activity of the T cell subpopulation has been associated with decreased immune response in people with certain cancers (T akahashi et al, 1992). Lentinan can also stimulate Ig production in human cells in vitr o, as well as interferon in the peripheral blood circulation of cancer patients (Miyakoshi & Aoki, 1984b) and animals and increases the production of lymphocyte- activating factor (Interleukin 1), which is able to enhance the maturation of T cells. Interleukin 6 generation by human monocytes could also be augmented in vivo (Sakamaki et al, 1993). In an in vivo study , rats with peritonitis receiving combined lentinan- gentamicin treatment had a significantly better survival rate than controls. Lentinan activated the peritoneal macrophage secretory activity of active oxygen and produced cytokines which thus enhanced the ability of PMNs to produce active oxygen, which possesses a bactericidal abilit y in PMNs (=polymorphonuclear leukocytes) (Shen et al, Lentinan could also increase peritoneal macrophage cytotoxicity against metastatic tumor cells in mice, but not against a highly metastatic tumor type (Ladanyi et al, 1993). Of eleven patients treated with lentinan for carcinomatous pleuritis or carcinomatous peritonitis, eight patients improved and in two the malignancy disappeared, while in another two it diminished (Yoshino et al, 1989). Lentinan can activate the normal and alternative pathways in thecomplement system and can split C3 into C3a and C3b, enhancing macrophage activation (Aoki, 1984b). When a 2-mg dose of lentina n was administered to twelve patients intravenously twice, the first dose at 3-9 days before and the second the day before surgery, lentinan was effective in increasing the CD4 cell ratios in lymph nodes of twelve gastric cancer patients and strongly increasing the number of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (CD4, Leu1 1, LeuM3) in tumor tissue, but not in those of peripheral blood compared with a control group (Takeshita et al, 1993). Lentinan' s immune-activating ability may be linked with its modulation of some hormonal factors, and it is known that these hormones play a role in tumor growth. For instance, the antitumor activity of lentinan is strongly reduced by administration of thyroxin as well as hydrocortisone (Aoki, 1984b). Lentina n can delayed- type hypersensitivity reaction (DTHR) (Izumi, 1981). Table 10 IMMUNE EFFECTS OF LENTINAN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS Antiviral Effects Because viral diseases such as HIV are difficult to treat with modern pharmaceuticals, lentinan and LEM' s strong inhibitory action against a number of viruses is of great interest, and LEM seems to be the stronger of the two. Lentinan works through both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms to support host defense against various cancers, bacteria (tuberculosis), viruses (such as the AIDS virus), and parasites (Aoki, 1984b; Mizuno et al,1992). Lentinan has shown VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus)-encephalitis, Abelson (Chang, 1981), and adenovirus type virus-induced tumors (Hamada, 1981). Lentinan could also stimulate non-specific resistance against respiratory viral infections in mice. Notable protection was induced by lentinan administered intranasally before lethal influenza virus infection which could be confirmed by a reduction of the lung virus titres. Lentinan also conferred complete protection against an LD75 challenge dose of virulent influenza virus, and significantly prolonged the survival time in mice after an LD100 challenge administered by i.v. Enhanced broncho-alveolar macrophage activity was also noted. Measurable interleukin 6 was produced after 6 h, well before IL- 6 induced by viral infection alone (Irinoda et al, 1992).Lentinan was successful in treating a patient positive for HIV but without AIDS symptoms except for low helper -T cell and low lymphocyte counts and low NK cell activity . A drip infusion of lentinan restored these immune cell counts to normal (Aoki, 1984a). Lentinan is particularl y active at augmenting helper -T cell activity (Akiyamaet al, 1981). Lentin an may also be useful in clinical practice for strengthening immune and endocrine functions of elderly people and people who are run-down from overwork, as well as the prevention of cancer in high-risk individuals, both orally and by injection (Aoki, 1984b). In Japan, in the treatment of low natural killer cell syndrome (LNKS), a disease which appears to be identical to chronic fatigue syndrom e in the West, lentinan was successful in reversing the symptoms of remittent fever , persisting fatigue, and low NK cell activity (Aoki et al, 1987). LEM may be useful in the treatment of AIDS. It has been shown to inhibit HIV infection of cultured human T-cells (Iizuka, 1990b), and it potentiates the effects of AZT against viral replication in vitr o (Tochikura et al, 1987c). The mechanism of its action is not known for certain, but the extract was found to activate macrophages and stimulate the production of interleukin 1. LEM and lentinan are not the only active fractions of L. edodes. Water- soluble lignans with antiviral and immunomodulating also been isolated from shiitake mycelium (Hanafusa et al, 1990), and JLS, a new compound recently derived from the mycelium, has shown the ability to block the release of infectious herpes simplex virus type 1 in animals (Sarkar et al, 1993). The fungus contains water -solubilized lignin derivatives, such as EP3 and EPS4, which have shown immuno logical and antiviral activiti es not only against herpes simplex I and II, but also against equine encephalitis, polio virus , measles, mumps, and HIV (Suzuki et al, 1989, 1990; Sorimachi et al, 1990). In addition, an aqueous extract of the mycelium (known as JLS-18), consisting of 65-75% lignin, 15-30% polysaccharide, and 10-20% protein, has inhibited the herpes virus both in vitro and in vivo (Koga et al, 1991). Bacterial and Parasitic Infections Another area of research with lentinan is its ability to mobilize the humoral immunity to help ward off bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics. For instance, lentinan was given to 3 patients who were sheddingMycobacterium tuber culosis bacilli resistan t to antituberculosis drugs. was given by IM injection, 1 mg/day , twice a week, titers of specific opsonin toward the bacilli were so elevated that tuberculosis bacillus excretion ceased in one of the patients, and the patient' s general conditions improved (Aoki, 1984b). Lentinan is also effective for limiting relapse of tuberculosis infectio ns in the lungs of mice (Kanai & Kondo, 1981) and increasing host resist ance to infection with the poten tially lethal Listeria monocy togenes (Aoki, 1984b). Lentinan protection against toxic stress from bacter ial endotoxin. For instance, when lentinan was administered to rabbits with, or especially before, endotoxin, its clearance was increased (Yokota et al, 1991). Lentinan increased resistance against the parasites Shistosoma japonicum and Shistosoma mansoni, which may have been mediated through T cells (Aoki, 1984b). Hepatopr otective Effects LEM slowed the growth of cancerous liver tumors in rats by injection (Sugano et al, 1982). A polysaccharide fraction from shiitake also demonstrated liver-protective action in animals (Lin and Huang, 1987b; Mizoguchi et al, 1987b), as well as the ability to improve liver function and help produce antibodies to hepatitis B (Amagasse, 1987). In combination with polysaccharides from the fungi G. lucidum and P. versicolor , lentinan has improved SGPT and completely restored GPT levels in the livers of mice with toxic hepatitis (Zhang & Luan, 1986). Crude extracts and/or cultures of the fungus have demonstrated liver- protecting action s (Lin, 1987), perhaps because of their high adenine and choline content (Ying, 1987); anti-inflammatory actions via the inhibition of prost aglandin release from the cell walls of macrophages (Scientific Consulting Service); and the ability to increase interferon production in vitro in human umbilical leukocytes (Meng et al, 1987). Cardiovascular Effects Another active compound isolated from shiitake, eritadenine, has been shown to lower blood levels of cholesterol and lipids (Yamamura and Cochran, 1974b ). Added to the diet of rats, eritadenine (0.005%) caused a 25% decrease in total cholesterol in as little as one week (Chibata et al, 1969). The cholesterol-lowering activity of this substance is more pronounced in rats fed a high-fat diet than in those on a low-fat diet (Rokujo et al, 1969). Other constituents as well may make shiitake valuablefor treating cardiovascular conditions. Recently , two new compounds have been isolated and found to lower serum cholesterol, while the fungus' tyrosinase helps lower blood pressure (Ying et al, 1987). Various other studies have confirmed that shiitake can lower both blood pressure and free cholesterol in the plasma (Kabir , 1987), as well as accelerate accumulation of lipids in the liver, thus remo ving them from circulation (Kimoto et al, 1976). Human Clinical Studies A numb er of clinical studies have been conducted on lentinan, less on various other fractions or whole shiitake fruiting bodies. Lentinan was shown to have antitumor activity and to increase the survival time for 3 patients with inoperable gastric cancer (Mashiko et al, 1992; Shimizu et al, 1981), and of women with recurrent breast cancer who have under gone surgical therapy (Kosaka et al, 1985). In a phase II study involving 2 groups of patie nts with progressive cancer but with no serious liver, kidney , or bone marrow dysfunction and no prior treatment by operation or irradiation within a month of the lentina n administration, lentinan alone did not improve immune parameters or show an anticancer effect. However , lentinan adminis tered once or twice a week with chemotherapy did show a statistically significant difference (<0.01) in immune enhancement and an anticancer effect (Taguchi et al, 1982). A follow-up phase III trial was initiated based on the finding s of the phase I and II trials. In this randomized controlled trial, 275 patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer were given either one of two kinds of chemotherapy (mitomycin C with 5-fluorouracil or tegafur) alone or with lentinan injections. Statistically , the best results were obtained when lentinan was administered prior to chemot herapy and in the patients with both primary lesion and without prior chemotherapy (Taguchi et al, 1981b). The results were evaluated on the basis of prolongation of life, regression of tumors or lesions, improvement of immune responses, and side effects. In another trial, the relationship between prolonged life span and change s of serum IAP and albumin induced by the therapy of lentinan plus tegafur in inoperable and recurrent gastric cancer was studied. The results were as follows: tumor regression (1 case, 2%), improvement of performance status (PS), appetite, or pain (18 cases , 42%). Cases which showed a decrease of serum IAP from abnormally high levels (more than 500 mu/ml) and an increase of albumin from abnor mally low levels (less than 3.5g/dl), had asignificantly increased prolongation of life span by comparison with the other cases (Ishigami et al, 1992). It is important to note that those patients with low protein levels (< 5.9/dl) showed no response to lentinan, whereas those with normal protein levels showed excellent results (Nishihira et al, 1988). In another group of 16 patients with advanced cancer , lentinan (4 mg/week for 4 weeks) was injected into malignant peritoneal and/or pleural effusions. Eight y percent of the lesions showed clinical responses, and performance status was improved in 7 patients. The survival time for patients who responded immuno logically to the treatment was 129 days and 49 days for those who did not respond (Oka et al, 1992). In anoth er contr olled, double-bl ind study involving 72 cases of chronic persistent hepat itis, lentinan was more effective than danshen (a Chinese herb, Codonopsis pilosula) for this condition (Lin et al, 1987). Another study , too, found that a polysaccharide fraction from L. edodes was useful for treating chronic viral hepati tis B (Zhu et al, 1985). Forty patients with chronic hepatiti s B and seropositive for Hbe antigenemia were given 6 grams of LEM daily (orally) for four months in an unrandomized, uncontrolled clinical study (Amagase, 1987). The study focused on the number of patients seroconverting from HBeAg positive to anti-HBe positive, which was 25% after LEM therapy and was higher in patients with chronic active hepatitis, 36.8%. In addition, 17 patients (43%) became seronegative for HBeAg. Liver function tests showed improvem ent even in patients who remained seropositive. Only one patient reported side effects \u2014abdominal fullness and loose stools. As for its effects on infectious disease, in a study of 3 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had shed drug resistant M. tuber culosis bacteria for 10 years, after treatment with lentinan, the excretion of M. tuber culosis ceased (Usuda, 1981). These findings have been supported by several studies with mice (Kanai & Kondo, 1981; Kanai et al, 1980). Another promising use of L. edodes is to boost the immune response in AIDS patients. In one case study , when an extract (LEM) of L. edodes was used to treat an HIV+ patient with AIDS symptoms, the T cell count rose from a baseline of l,250/mm3 to 2045/mm3 after 30 days, and then up to 2,542/mm3 after 60 days. Improvements in symptoms were noted (Iizuka and Maeda, 1988).After one week on dried shiitake (9 g), 10 young Japanese women showed a decrease in serum cholesterol of 7%. Another group who ate 90 g of fresh shiitake showed a 12% drop in serum cholesterol after 7 days. A further study in young women on fresh shiitake (90 g) for 7 days included butter (60 g) in addition to the shiitake. In a control group of 10 women, only the butter was added to the diet for one week. In this group serum cholesterol increased by 14%, whereas the group on shiitake and the butter showed a decrease in serum cholesterol of 4%. A separate study in people 60 years of age or older found the drop in cholesterol was 9%, whether they had eaten dried or fresh shiitake (Suzuki and Oshima, 1974). Toxicity L. edodes is non-poisonous, though some people may experience minor side effects or allergic reactions. For instance, during 17 years researchers have observed numerous cases of shiitake-induced toxicodermia or shiitake dermatitis (Nakamura and Kobayashi, 1985; Ueda et al, 1992). Nakamura (1992) reviewe d the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and sources of shiitake dermatitis. It is known that people who work indoors in the cultivation of shiitake are prone to an immune reaction to spores called \"mushroom worker 's lung.\" Antibodies to shiitake spore antig ens can be demonstrated in people who show symptoms. Protective mask s can help, but not entirely eliminate, an eventual reaction to the spores after continued exposure (Van Loon, 1992). A watery extract of the whole fruiting body is reported to lessen the effectiveness of the blood platelets in the process of coagulation, so people who bleed easily or who are taking blood thinners should use caution when chronically using shiitake or its water-soluble fractions (Y ang & Jong, 1989). LEM has shown no evidence of acute toxicity in over 17 years of popular use in Japan, even in massive doses (over 50 mg/day for 1 week), though mild side effects such as diarrhea and skin rashes may occur . Symptoms disappear after a short period, once the body has adapted to the LEM. Likewise lentinan has no known serious side effects (Aoki, 1984b). Patients with allergies may experience some negative reactions due to its histamine sensitizing properties (Chihara, 1981), though this has not been demonstrated in humans. In a phase I clinical trial of 50 patients with advanced cancer , 0.5 to 50 mg/person/day lentinan was given by injection for 2 weeks. Minor side effects such as a slight increase in GOT and GPT liver enzymes and a feeling of mild oppression on the chest were caused at5 mg/day , but these disappeared after lentinan administration was stopped. In a phase II trial, only 17 of 185 patients with advanced cancer had similar transitory side effects. Skin eruptions were noted in 7 cases, mild oppression on the chest, 6 cases, and mild liver dysfunctio n, 4 cases (Taguchi et al, 1982). In a follow -up phase III trial by the same researchers, 15 out of 275 patients experien ced nausea and vomiting (2), heaviness in the chest (4), heat sensations (2), and one case each of face flushing, a rise in blood pressur e, and heaviness in the head (Taguchi et al, 1981b; Aoki, 1984b). The LD50 by IV injection into mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys is more than 100 mg/kg. Large amounts administered IV chronically for 25 weeks showed definite signs of severe toxicity , but anaphylaxis could not be demonstrated (Aoki, 1984b). In toxicity tests in animals, lentinan caused no antifertility effects in males, and pregnant animals administered lentinan had normal litters with normal offspring (Cozens 1981a, 1981b, 1981c). Lentinan seems to be very safe when given to humans in the dosage range of 1-5 mg/day once or twice a week by IV injection (T aguchi et al, 1982). Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM , shiitake is said to have a sweet taste and be mild in nature. Shiitake is a food that is both strengthening and restorative. Medical Uses Shiitake is used medicinally for any and all diseases involving depressed immune function, including cancer , AIDS, environmental aller gies, Candida infections (contr ary to current fashion in modern western medicine, which holds that fungi only aggravate yeast infections), and frequent flu and colds. It also appears to be beneficial for soothing bronchial inflammation and regulating urine incontinence (Liu and Bau, 1980), as well as for reducing chronic high cholesterol. According to one prominent Japanese researcher , lentinan is an immunomodulating agent which may be useful both therapeutically , as a general rejuvena tive for older persons (no matter what the condition of their health), as well as prophylactically to protect healthy , physically active young people from overwork and exhaustion (Aoki, 1984b). In Japan, lentinan is currently classified as a drug, whereas LEM is considered a food supplement. Shiitake use in Cancer -PreventionAs more clinical research on lentinan is published, the effective range of application is becoming more defined and somewhat broader . The immune mechanisms behind various types of cancer are complex, so lentinan, or any immunostimulant, may or may not be useful for a particular situation or individual. The best results will be realized when \"used in conjunction with other therapy under strictly planned timing and schedules, and only when the host-tumor relationship is in good agreement with such treatment\" (Chihara, 1981). In my experience the best results with any immune adjuvant s will be realized when one considers the type of cancer (location), the individual' s general health and immune and hormonal status, as well as the individual constitutional type. Besides immune adjuvant therapy , it is important to address imbalances in diet and other health habits and attempt to correct any disharmony in other or gan systems. Shiitake mushrooms have cancer -preventive properties and can be a beneficial additi on to the diet. Recent statistics show that one out of three people may have cancer sometim e in their lives! Compounds that block the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds from nitrites (which occur in many meats and some vege tables) are produced in shiitake and other mushrooms (such as matsutake and the common button agaric) when they are dried or heated. Uncooked shiitake contains no detectable amounts of the nitrite-scavenging compound thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TCA, thioproline); dried shiitake contains 134 mg/100 g (dry weight basis) of the compound; and boiled shiitake holds 843 mg/100 g (Kurashima et al, 1990). Shiitake and HIV T reatment Researchers have suggested that LEM may be more effective than AZT in the treatment of AIDS because it inhibits the cytopathic effect of giant cell formation in a cell-free system with MT-4 cells, or a cell-to-ce ll infection system with MOL T-4 cells, both of which induce multinucleated giant cells very efficiently . LEM may work by blocking the initial stages of HIV infection (Tochikura et al, 1988). AZT inhibits cell-free infection of HIV, but it is ineffective in preventing the formation of multinucleated giant cells. AZT is also expensive and is known to cause severe bone marrow toxicity and a host of other side effects (Physicians Desk Refer ence, 1993). Furthermore, it may become less effective over time or may not offer any long-term survival advantages even with early use (Fackelmann, 1992).LEM is non-toxic and less expensive. It costs $825/kilo (1,000 grams) wholesale, and assuming an average therapeutic dose of 3 grams/day , the cost would be about $2.48/day , or $74.40/month. The dose for prevention or maintenance would be about $.83/day or $24.75/month. See the reference section for suppliers. While products of LEM that are already encapsulated are considerable higher per dose, they do offer convenience, and are readily available from natural food stores and herb shops. How ever, these products are not suitable for the treatme nt of ailments where therapeutic doses of LEM are required (over 1 gram/day) because they are too expensive. I recommend encapsulated products mainly for prevention of disease and maintenance of health, as a daily dietary supplement. Of course, more clinical trials will be necessary to assess the long-term benefit of LEM for HIV and AIDS. I also recommend seeking the advice of a qualified health care professional before discontinuing any medications prescribed by a doctor . Preparation and Dosage It is important to note that lentinan' s anticancer effect is highly dose- dependent. The traditional dose of the whole dried fruiting body in tea, soup, or other dishes is given as 6-16 grams; of the fresh fruiting body , about 90 grams (Liu and Bau, 1980). According to manufacturer 's recommendations and the few clinical trials performed with humans, durin g the initial stages of AIDS or chronic hepatitis the best dose of LEM may be between 2-6 grams/day in 2 or 3 divided doses orally . Once the disease is more stable, the dosage may be decreased, perhaps to 1/2 -1 gram per day (Sharon, 1988). For lentinan, the optimum dose is 1-5 mg injected IV or IM twice a week and greater doses can cause immune suppression (Aoki, 1984b). Interestingly , it has been clinically established that smaller doses of intravenous and intramuscular lentinan are more effective than larger doses for cancer patients (1 mg IV injection is considered safe, while 10 mg may produce marked depression in the host immune response). However , it should also be noted that what is considered an excessive dosage intravenously may be a favorable dosage for oral administration (Aoki, 1984b). Commercial preparations of L. edodes are available in the United States in natura l food markets. The tablets are usually made from a dried water -extract of the mycelia or fruitin g bodies, because drying concentrates the lentinan and other active principles. Standardized extracts are also available, and they are preferred because the amount of lentina n present is certified and clearly stated on the bottle. Note that for full therapeutic doses, although fresh shiitake can be a valuable dietary supplement, the amount one would need to eat for medicinal doses is so high that it might cause digestive upset. That is why LEM, which is concentrated and easily absorbed, is preferred as medicine. Related Species The mycelial extract of L. cyathiformis , a species native to Hungary , showed antitum or activity in mice against Ehrlich ascites tumor and sarcoma 180. This fungus was reported to be significantly more active than mycelial extract s of three samples of L. edodes collected in the Orient (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam) (Rethy et al, 1983). L. ponder osus O.K.M. is found in the western U.S. from August to October (Lincof f, 1981). L. velutinus Fr. and L. crinitus (L.:Fr .) Fr. are boiled for use as foods by the Sanama Indians of Brazil May to Septemb er in many parts of the U.S. and in Californ ia during winter (Lincof f, 1981), has shown antitumor activi ty in mice (sarcoma 180 and carcinoma 755) (Espenshade and Grif fith, 1966). Notes L. edodes shows higher anticomplementary activity krestin, an immunostimulant extract from Japanese Trametes versicolor . It show s more potent Cordyceps ement Shiitake can be found in many markets throughout North America, Asia, and Europe. It is one of the most commonly cultivated mushrooms. I encourage home cultivation, which is an exciting (and certainly one of the most inexpensiv e) ways to have enough of this fantastic fungus for daily use. See the resources section in the Appendix for sources of mycelium and the books The Mushr oom Cultivator (Stamets and Chilton, 1983), The Shiitake Growers Handbook (Przybillowicz and Donoghue, 1991) or Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushr ooms (Stamets, 1994) for more information on cultivation. Shiitake is increasingly popular in preparedproducts throug hout Asia, North America, and Europe, and LEM is available in tablet or capsule form. Other Common Names Kaigaratake. Description and Habitat This is an unusual polypore, because it appears to have gills instead of pores. It grows on deciduous and coniferous woods, especially white birch (Liu and Bau, 1980) and looks like a large, thick T. versicolor on top, sometimes with a greenish caste. The green color often seen on L. betulina is actually a green algal growth which occurs on the pileus as it ages (Overholts, 1977). Range This polypore grows throughout most of the United States. I have seen moderate sized patches in Calif ornia and Oregon, as well as in the eastern United States. History No data. Chemistry The sterol peroxides ergostero l peroxide and 9(1 l)-dehydroer gosterol peroxide were identified as immunosuppressive compounds in an in vitro model (Fujimoto et al, 1994); ergosta-7,22-dien-3(-ol, fungisterol (Yokoyama et al, 1975). Pharmacology A water extract of Lenzites betulina has demonstrated mild anti-tumor activity against sarcoma 180 in mice (Ikekawa et al, 1968). L. betulina , known in Japan as kaigaratake, has shown immunosuppressive activityagainst lymphocyte proliferation in mice due to sterol peroxide s (Fujimoto et al, 1994). Human Clinical Studies None. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, L. betulina is consi dered warming; it dispe ls internal wind and has a mild nature. The mushroom is used to enhance blood circulation, resolving cold and eliminating endogenous wind (Ying et al, 1987), and support the tendons and veins. It is one of the main ingredients in a Chinese patent medicine for leg and tendon pains called \"Tendon-Easing Pill\" (Liu & Bau, 1980). Medical Uses None found. Preparation and Dosage 1-2 pills twice daily of \"Tendon -Easing Pills,\" or use in tea. To make a tea, simmer 1-2 fruiting bodies in a quart and a half of water for 45 minutes. Strain and add a little sweetener . Drink 1 cup twice daily . Related Species None. Procur ement The birch polypore is comm on on birch, oak, and other hardwoods throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. There are no commercial products available outside of China to my knowledge. LEPISTA NUDA (BULL.:FR.) CKE. (lepista=a mushroom. Description and Habitat This gilled Basidiomycete is saprophytic and can be cultivated at home. A well-known edible species, it is easy to recognize for the beginner because of its shiny-smooth bright purple cap and purple gills. It grows on the ground, either solitary or in groups, and it is firm and has a purple cast, getting lighter as it ages. In California I have seen it frequentl y under oak trees. Lepista nuda from Text-Book of British Fungi by W . Delisle Hay , 1887. Range Common throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. History No data. Chemistry No data. Pharmacology L. nuda has shown pronounced antitumor activity against sarcoma, and the vitamin B1 found in its sporophore makes it effective in regulating carbohydrate metabolism. It is resistant to both Gram positive and negative bacteria (Y ing et al, 1987). Human Clinical Studies No data.Toxicity Although L. nuda itself is not toxic, be forewarned that it may accumulate and concentrate heavy metals in contaminated environments. In a study of 60 species of edible mushrooms collected from polluted areas, L. nuda was found to contain the second highest level of mercury , after Calocybe gambosa (Kalac et al, 1989a). In a later study by the same researcher , eleven species of mushrooms were collected within six km or less from a lead smelter in Bohemia, Czechoslovakia. L. nuda showed extensive accumulation of lead, copper , and mercury . All samples had higher concentrations of these metals than mushrooms in any other part of Bohemia, and they far exceeded safe levels. For example, more than 100 mg lead per 1 kg of dry matter were found in L. nuda , where the safe limit was established at 5 mg/kg (Kalac et al, 1991a). Uses in T raditional Medicine The fruiting body is considered sweet and mild in nature. Medical Uses In China, L. nuda is used to regulate sugar metabolism and support the nervous system (Liu and Bau, 1980). Preparation and Dosage Liberally , as desired, though some people may be sensitive to it, experiencing nausea or digestive upset. Related Species There are many related species, but their medicinal properties are presently unknown. Procur ement The blew it grows commonly throughout North America, Europ e, Asia, and other parts of the world, but it is not generally available commercially , at least in the U.S. David Arora reported seeing it on occasion at the Monterey Market in Berkeley , California (1994). PEZIZA bladders or blisters)BLADDER CUP Synonyms None. Other Common Names None. Peziza vesiculosa from British Fungi and Lichens by George Massee, cir ca 1890. Description and Habitat This Ascomycete is a round to flattened, cup-shaped denizen of dung. It is pale brown on top and whitish underneath, and it grows either solitary or in clusters. The Latin vesiculosa, meaning \"with bladder (or vesicles),\" may refer to the fungus bladder -like shape or to its minutely blistered underside. Range Usually found growing in clusters on manure or rotting straw in corrals or around stables and gardens throughout the world (Arora, 1986). History No data. Chemistry A water -soluble high-molecular weight acidic polypeptide with B-cell mitogen carbohydrates (Ohno a -1,3-glucan polysacchari de (Mimura et al, 1985) have been isolated in addit ion to various other polysaccharide fractions (Ohno et al, 1985). Another compound, epipentenomycin I, was isolated from the carpophores of Peziza spp. (Bernillon et al, 1989). PharmacologyThe crude extract of P. vesiculosa has been shown to act as a B-cell mitogen (i.e., it induces mitosis), and it enhances certain activities of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), especially phagocytosis and inhibition of tumor cells, in vitro (Suzuki et al, 1982; Yadomae et al, 1979b). P. vesiculosa has also been shown to inhibit sarcoma 180 in vivo (Suzuki et al, 1982; Mimura, 1986). A glucan known as PVG (Mimura, 1986) and various polysaccharides extracted from the fruiting body have been implicated in this antitumor activity (Ohno, 1985). The carpophores of Peziza spp. demonstrate antimicrobial activity against certain Gram- positive bacteria (Bernillon et al, 1989). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity According to Arora (1994), it is advisable to cook Ascomycetes (including morels) before ingesting them. I have seen similar fungi from the same genus growing on painted plasterboard, carpets, and other household areas \u2014one should be cautious about using such carpophores because they may pick up heavy metals or other toxic compounds from the substrate. Uses in T raditional Medicine It is considered sweet, slightly bitter , and cool in nature. Medical Uses In Japan this fungus is used to treat tumors and depressed immune function (Suzuki et al, 1982). Preparation and Dosage 2-4 g per dose. Related Species A number of similar species are common worldwide, inclu ding Peziza domestica. Procur ement Available from the wild; in bulk occasionally from Chinese herb dealers; and in China in prepared form. PHELLINUS and R yvarden, 1987). Other Common Names Nisehokuchitake. Description and Habitat P. igniarius is a hoof-shaped or semicircul ar polypore that grows on both living and dead hardwoods, especially birch and aspen. It is brownish, becoming black, furrowed, and eventually cracking (Arora, 1986; Phillips, 1991). Range P. igniarius is common in many parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. History No data. Chemistry Ergosta-7,22-dien-3-ol) and fungisterol have been identified from this species (Y okoyama et al, 1975). Pharmacology The mycelium of P. igniarius have shown 70% inhibition of sarcoma 180 in mice (Ohtsuka et al, 1977), and water extracts of the sporopho re exhibited potent antitumor effects against Ehrlich ascities carcinoma and sarcoma 180 in mice (Y ing et al, 1987; Ito et al, 1976). Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine According to TCM, P. igniarius is bitter and cooling. It is said to detoxify and restore the internal organs (Liu and Bau, 1980). In China, it is a considered a soothing diuretic, digestive tonic, and antidiarrheal agent. Medical Uses It may also be used as a styptic, both internally and externally and is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treating uterine bleeding and for blood inthe urine. P. igniarius is also an effective emmenogo gue for amenorrhea and for treating 1980; Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dler , 1982; Ying et al, 1987). The powdered fruiting body is taken in liquid or in pill form, and preparations can also be applied externally for pains in the abdominal region (Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dler , 1982). Preparation and Dosage Take 13-30 g of P. igniarius or F. fomentarius as a decoction 2X/day . Related Species P. antitumor does P. linteus (Shibata et al, 1968; Ikekawa et al, 1968; et al, 1987). Procur ement False tinder polypore is not available in commercial trade but can be picked from the wild in many parts of Asia, North America, and Europe. PLEUROTUS Common Names Hiratake (Japan). Description and Habitat P. ostreatus has a fleshy white, brown or gray, semi-circular capo shaped like an oyster shell and grow s in layered clusters on deciduous trees throughout North America, Asia, Europe, and other areas. This is a choice edible cultivated in many parts of the world. It has a pleasant odor, and inside the cap is a thick, white flesh. The stalk is usually absent or small. Range North America and most other continents. Pleurotus ostreatus from Our Edible T oadstools and Mushrooms by W . Hamilton Gibson, 1895.History Pleurotus was praised in a poem written during the Sung dynasty (A.D. 420-479) as \"the mushroom of flower heaven\" (Y.-C. Wang, 1985). The country people in France were said to water wild Pleurotus logs to encourage fruitings for the table (Ramsbottom, 1951). Chemistry P. ostr eatus contains 8 kinds of amino acids , as well as vitamin B1, B2, and vitamin P (Ying, 1987), while the dried mycelium is a source of B1, B2, B5 (niacin), B7 (biotin), but not B12 (Solomko and Eliseeva, 1988). One analysis of oyster mushrooms, including P. ostreatus , revealed appreciable amounts of all essential amino acids with the exception of tryptophan. The protein quality was high enough to nearly equal animal- derived protein (Eden and Wuensch, 1991). Grown in a medium of peat extract, the mushroom has high protein content and high concentrations of essential fatty acids and mineral s (Manu-T awiah and Martin, 1987). Grown on wheat straw , P. ostreatus contains minerals (7.9%), acid the oleic acid (Solomko, 1984), and thesaturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio is 14 (saturated) to 86 (unsaturated) (Bano & Rajarathnam, 1988). A lectin has also been described from the fruiting body (Conrad & R\u00fcdiger , 1994). The major organic acids in the fruiting bodies include formic, malic, acetic (the most abundant at 266 mg/100 g), and citric acids (Bano & Rajarathnam, 1988). See the Nutritional section on p. 56 for farther information on this mushroom. Pharmacology Antitumor activity of P. ostreatus as part of the normal diet was found in a feeding study of the mushroom in mice with sarcoma 180. The tumor inhibition rate reached 79.4%, and against a mammary tumor system (MM- 46) there was an 89.7% tumor inhibition rate (Mori et al, 1986). By injection (i.p.), P. ostreatus (200 mg/kg/day X10) produced tumors (Ikekawa, 1969). An acidic polysaccharide fraction of this mushroom showed a 95% tumor inhibition rate against sarcoma 180 from doses of 5 mg/kg (Y oshioka et al, 1972). The dried and powdered mushroom fed to hamsters at 2 % of a high-fat diet for six months lowered serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in blood plasma as well as cholest erol and triglycerol levels in the liver more than in controls. Serum VLDL decreased by 65-80%, and total serum lipid levels were reduced by 40%. A polysaccharide from the mushr oom as part (4%) of a norm al diet was found to lower serum and liver levels of cholesterol in hamsters after 2 months' feeding (Bobek et al, 1991b). As 5% of a high-fat diet in rats, P. ostreatus lowere d serum cholesterol accumulation by 45% in three months (Bobek et al, 1993) . Rats with hereditary high cholesterol levels also showed significantly reduced levels of serum cholesterol from feeding on the mushroom as part of the diet (4%). Even with 1% cholesterol added in their feed, these rats showed a nearly 40% decrease in cholesterol levels (VLDL and LDL) (Bobek et al, 1991a). When their diet was supplemented with 2% dried fruiting bodies of Pleurotus, hamsters with a chronic alcohol intake also showed reduced levels of cholesterol and even lower levels than control hamsters not given alcohol. P. ostreatus totally negated increases in triglycerol levels and liver cholesterol resulting from chron ic alcohol ingestion (Bobek et al, 1991c). Metal-bound proteins, known as carriers of metals in intestinal absorption, were found in P. ostr eatus (Shimaoka et al, 1990). Human Clinical StudiesNone. Toxicity P. ostreatus in Bagh dad, Iraq produced toxicity in animals after oral and intraperitoneal administration for 30 days (liver inflammation, hemorrhaging in kidney , liver, intestine, and lung) consistent with local reports of toxic ity in people (Al-Deen et al, 1987). The LD50 values for short-term administration were very high, exceeding 3 g/kg. The significance of these findings for potential toxicity from oyster mushrooms in the human diet is not know n. I have been eating this wild-harvested mushroom in substantial quantit ies for a number of years without apparent ill effects. Uses in T raditional Medicine It is considered sweet and mild and is used to strengthen veins and relax tendons and to dispel \"air and cold\" (Liu and Bau, 1980). In Mexico Pleurotus is cooked in stews or fried (Alfaro et al, 1983). Medical Uses In China it is indicated for joint and muscle relaxation (Yang & Jong, 1989); when the sporophores are made into \"Tendon-easing powder ,\" they are effective in the treatment of lumbago, numbed limbs, and tendon and blood vessel discomfort. In the Czech Republic, extracts have been made from the fruiting bodies as the main ingredient in dietary preparations recommended for prevention of high cholesterol (Opletal, 1993). Preparation and Dosage 3-9 grams. Related Species Hypsizygus (=Pleurotus) ulmarius is used in China to promote the circulation of blood (Yang & Jong, 1989). A freeze-dried water extract of P. spodoleucus caused a 72.3% inhibition of sarcoma 180 tumors in mice (Ikekawa et al, 1969). P. dryinus was cited by a 12th century Arabian physician as \"Gharikoun,\" a mushroom used to treat tumors of the gullet and throat (Hartwell, 1971). P. sajor -caju produce d a hypotensive action in rats (25 mg water extract, i.v.) and decreased glomerular infiltration in rat kidneys (T am et al, 1986). NotesOyster mushroom may be an excellent blood-builder . According to published result s, it has up to 19 mg/100 grams (dried) of iron. In animal feeding studies, the addition of P. sajor -caju or P. flabellatus to the diets of anemic albino rats raised hemoglobin content to 15.5 and 16.2 respectively , which compares with 8.2 for controls, which were fed copper and milk. The value was 14.0 in normal rats (Bano & Rajarathnam, 1988). P. griseus contains a highly active antibacterial substance named \"pleurotin\" which is unstable in solution if exposed to heat or light (Brian, 1951). Procur ement Widely cultivated and sometime s available in markets. I buy them in bulk at my local farmer 's market. This is one of the easiest mushrooms for home cultivation (Stam ets and Chilton, 1983) and of particular note as a wild species. We pick oyster mushrooms in coastal California starting in early October and continuing throug h January or even February , though the biggest fruitings are generally in the fall. Not generally found in prepared products. POLYPORUS R yvarden, 1987). Other mistakenly identified as tuckahoe; tuckahoe is Wolfiporia cocos (Gilbertson & R yvarden, 1987). Description and Habitat This polypore is short, tough-fleshed, and arises from a black, under ground tuber (sclerotium or perhaps pseudosclerotium). Its cap is 4-15 cm in diameter and 0.5-1 cm thick; ochraceous tan to tawny , covered with small scattered scales (Overholts, 1977). Found growing solitary or in two's or three' s on the ground in mixed woods and under oak and madrone in thewestern U.S. (Arora, 1986). Note: white inside; the tuber from P. tuberaster is not, as it is heavily mixed with dirt and pebbles (Arora, 1996; Gilbertson & R yvarden, 1987). Range Polyporus tuberaster occurs throughout the eastern United States, western U.S., and Canada, as well as in Europe and perhaps in Asia (Porcher , 1854; Arora, 1986; Overholts, 1977), though whether all the species with a similar appearance occu rring with an under ground sclerotium are this species is uncertain. Overholts, however , claims that it is widespread. History The Native American Indians may have valued this fungus as food, though its identity in the ethnobotanical literature is in question, being confused with the much more edible sclerotia of Wolfiporia cocos (tuckahoe). Porcher (1854), doctor , reported that Polyporus tuberaster was used in Italy and China for fevers and eruptive diseases. In southern Italy the tubers are still sold in the markets as food, but it is the fruiting bodies that are eaten, not the \"tubers.\" The tubers are sold to be placed in flower pots and watered to produce the edible (when very young and tender) fruiting bodies (Arora, 1994). Chemistry No data. Pharmacology No data. Human Clinical Studies No data. Toxicity None known. Taste & Energy Bland, cool. Uses in T raditional Medicine Stone fungus tastes similar to Wolfiporia cocos , which would make it sweet and bland with mild energy, and it may enter the Heart, Spleen, and Lung (Bensky & Gamble, 1993). It has been reported as being used for food by Native American Indians over 150 years ago, though the sclerotium is often riddled with dirt and sand, making it difficult to use, unlike Wolfiporiacocos and other sclerotium-producing species (Arora, 1987). The reported use of it as food in Italy may refer to the tender new above-ground fruiting body (Overholts, 1977). Whether this species or other tuber -producing species are similar in action and efficacy to Wolfiporia cocos remains to be seen. Medical Uses None known. Preparation and Dosage 9-16 g in decoction, 3X/day .

Gordon W asson, 1957.Range Many parts of the world, including North America, Mexico, South America, Scandinavia, and parts of Asia. History As ment ioned in the first part of this book, the use of Psilocybe species held an important place among the Meso American peoples, in the context of \"mushroom cults,\" dating back at least 1500 years. Mushroom stones have been found in excavations from Mayan sites in Guatemala that are conservatively dated back to 1000 B.C. These cultures were strongly persecuted by the Spanish when they arrived in the new world (Schultes & Hofmann, 1973). See this work for more historical details. It is ironic that some Europeans came to the new world to escape religious persecution, and many delivered to the native people just that from which they were running. Today , the Mazatec Indians are said by Singer (1958) to \"have preserved more of the original Aztec lore about teonanacatl than the people living now in Aztec country , who are at least in part the direct descendants of the Aztecs.\" Psilocybin moleculeThe exploration of the traditional uses of psychotropic fungi, which helped bring this knowledge into the modern collective consciousness, unfolded over the last 100 years or so, but took a giant leap from the work of Schultes, Reko, the Wasson s, Heim, Singer , Hofmann, Guzman, and others (Guzman , 1983). In the 50s Valentina and Gordon Wasson organized a number of expeditions to Oaxa ca and other parts of Mexico to explore the ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology of halluc inogenic mushrooms. These expeditions were interdisciplinary in nature, including scientists from other related fields of research (e.g., the chemist who discovered LSD, Albert Hofmann). Hofmann has given an intriguing account of the group' s first experience with the sacramental mushrooms, called Teonanac. tl (meaning flesh or food of the Gods) by the ancient Aztecs, under the guidance of the now renowned curandera, Maria Sabina. The last name Sabina means \"wise woman.\" Because there were no mushrooms growing near the village where the meeting took place at the time, Hofmann offered tablets of pure psilocybin, whic h Maria Sabina finally declared the same medicine as the mushrooms. After a 1957 articl e in Life magazi ne by Gordon Wasson, the small village in Mexico where Maria Sabina lived was reported to be \"overrun\" with hippies wanting to eat mushrooms and meet the curandera (Guzman, 1983). In the materialism and prosperity of the post war period of the 1950s, it is easy to understa nd the longing for spiritual exploration which developed during the 1960s. Hallucinogenic mushrooms may have been used in many parts of the world, including Europe and parts of Asia, as well as the Philippines, Indonesia and Cambodia (Pollock, 1976). A friend of mine who has traveled often to Asia tells me that omelettes and other dishes that include psychoactive mushrooms are on the menu at some eating establishments, especially in Thailand and Bali. This has been reported in other literature(Pollock, 1976). The mushrooms eaten throughout Asia commonly include psychedelic species of Psilocybe and Paneolus. Chemistry Four indole alkaloids, hydroxyltryptamine derivatives, related to bufotenin (from toads) and serotonin (a common neurotransmitter in the human nervous system), have been isolated from various Psilocybe spp., in addition to (Guzman, 1983; Lincof f and Mitchell, 1977). Pharmacology The main active constituent of Psilocybe, is fully water -soluble and relatively stable, though the fruiting bodies may lose up to 50% of their activity after drying. To prevent further degradation of quality , it is important to freeze them immediately after drying. In comparison with unfrozen dried mushrooms from the same batch of Psilocybe, the frozen lots are substantially more potent after 4-12 months. Psilocybin is not soluble in ethanol, but its less abundant isomer , psilocin, is. A mixture of ethanol, diluted acetic acid and water was said to be an effective way to extract psilocybin (Gartz, 1994). Psilocybin is reported to be 900-1,000 times less potent than LSD but 90 to 100 times more potent than the active alkaloid from peyote, mescalin (Davis, 1981). About 50% of the psilocybin given orally to rats is absorbed and within 24 hours, 65% is excreted in the urine and about 20% from the bile and feces. The highe st concentration in the liver and kidney occurred after 20- 30 minutes, and after 40 minutes in the brain. An especially high concentration is found in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats, which may explain its ef fects on behavior (Aboul- Enein, 1974). Pharmacological Effects Psilocybin affects the symp athetic nervous system, especially the sympathetic structures of the brain, and can elicit dilation of the pupils, erection of the hair, rapid heart beat, and an increase of body temperature. Motor control is also af fected (Schultes & Hofmann, 1977). When given to mice and rats, the compound produced an excited state followed by a reduction in motor activity , as well as a marke d degree of aggressiveness which was dependent on isolation time, and several othervariables. Baboons showed an increase in spontaneous eye movements, but reduced motor activity (Aboul-Enein, 1974). Human Clinical Studies See discussion of the use of Psilocybe in clinical medicine on page 27 above. Toxicity The known physiological hazards of Psilocybe use are relatively minor (Davis, 1981); true hallucinations are uncommon, except with large doses, but visual distortion and alterat ion of hearing and other senso ry functions are normal (Schultes & Hofmann, 1973). Psilocybin has very few toxic effects in animals, especially compared to its ef fective dose. In mice, the LD50 is 280 mg/kg, which makes it 2.5 times less toxic than mescaline and 50 times more potent as a hallucinogen in humans (Schult es & Hofmann, 1973). The acute lethal oral dose of psilocybin was reported by Gable (1993) to be 14,000 mg, the safety mar gin (between an effective dose and lethal dose) very large and the dependence potential very small. The most significant danger in the use of psychoactive mushrooms picked from the wild is the possibility of ingesting a toxic species from other genera, such as potentia lly lethal Cortinarius species (Raff et al, 1992). It has also been reported that psychoactive mushroom s purchased \"on the street\" may be either adulterated with chemical hallucinogens such as phencyclidine (PCP) or LSD (Schwartz & Smith, 1988). In a screening of 886 samples of alleged psilocybin mushrooms analyzed by Pharm Chem Street Drug Laboratory , 252 (28%) were hallucinogenic mushrooms, while 275 (31%) were other mushrooms adulterated with LSD or PCP, and 328 (37%) were completely inactive. Uses in T raditional Medicine Wasson states that the native people of Mexico do not use Psilocybe for pleasure, and Singer (1958) writes that the Nahua Indians consider hallucinogenic fungi \"strictly a matter of religious healing, the business of the curandero or curandera\". However , he adds that the Mazate c freely talk about their euphoric effects. Among the Mazatec, the mushrooms are often taken either during a divinatory ritual where questions are asked about a sick patient, \"about the future, about the stolen money or the missing donkey\", or during a long-ni ght vigil of \"supplication, chanting andpraying.\" For a complete discussion of the ritual and sacred uses of psilocybe, see the fantastic book Mushr ooms, Russia and History (Wasson & W asson, 1957). Medical Uses As previously mentioned, psilocybin has been used in psychotherapy , especially in Germany . It was considered more promising than LSD because its effects were milder and of shorter duration, with essentially the same ef fects (Aboul-Enein, 1974). Preparation and Dosage Of the pure alkaloid, psilocyb in, between 4 to 10 mg is considered an average dose (Schwartz & Smith, 1988). The amount of psilocybin in Psilocybe sspp. ranges from 2-17 mg/g (Corrigan, 1982), and P. cubensis is reported to contain about 10 mg/g of fresh weight. Related Species Psilocybe baeocystis, P. caerulescens, P. cubensis, P. cyanescens, P. semilanceata. Only fungi from a few mushroom genera are known to possess a psychoactive effect, mainly Psilocybe (81 species), (Ascomycetes), Claviceps ea (Schultes & Hofmann, 1973). A species of Russula is reported to be used as a psychotropic agent by the indigenous people of New Guinea but has not been confirmed. The species Cordyceps capitata are reporte d to be used in religious ceremonies among the Nahua Indians from the Nevado de Toluca region of Mexico, but for their \"suggestive\" testicular shape (Schultes, 1978; Guzman, 1983 ; Guzman et al, 1976). They apparently do not contain psychoactive substances. In the following table, I review these genera, their ethnopharmacology and their main active compoun ds. The information was drawn from Ott (1976, 1978), Schultes (1973, 1978, 1979), Singer (1978), and Wasson (1957, 1968), Lincof f and Mitchel (1977). Table 1 CHEMISTR Y AND ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY OF PSYCHOACTIVE FUNGI Procur ement Active species of Psilocybe can be picked in the wild throughout the world. Cultivated and dried fruiting bodies, especially of P. cubensis , are available on the illicit recreational drug market. They are commonly sold in restaurants and by street vendors in parts of Asia (Thailand), Mexico, and Central and South America. Species of Psilocybe are sometimes grown at home. Notes See pages 27-33 for farther discussion.It is interesting to note that up to 24% of under graduate students at a private southern U.S. university reported the use of mescaline or psilocybin in 1990 (Cuomo et al, 1994). Amanita citrina and A. porphyria are known to produce bufotenine, reported by some to be psychoactive. There is no evidence that the fungi themselves have any activity , and they apparently do not contain toxic amines, being considered only mildly toxic (T yler None known. Other Common Names S. commune is also known as the \"split-fo ld\" mushroom (Liu and Bau, 1980). Schizophyllum from American Fungi by Charles Mcllvaine, 1902. Description and Habitat These small, whitish fungi have dense hair and no stalk. They grow mostly on dead trees, appearing most of the year. They may be disting uished from look-alikes by their split gills and in-rolled mar gins. Range S. commune grows worldwide, being one of the most common mushrooms known. In fact, the species name, commune, means \"common\" or \"widespread\" (Pacioni, 1981).History No data. Chemistry S. commune contains the amino acids cystine and glutamine (Jung, 1981), as well as schiz ophyllan, an active polysaccharide (Kikumoto et al, 1970). The dried fungus contains, in mg/100 g, iron (280 mg), phosphorus (646 mg), calcium (90 mg), 0.5% fats, and 17.0% protein (Parent and Thoen, 1977). Pharmacology The polysaccharide schizophyllan shows antitumor activity against both the solid (Tabata et al, 1981) and ascites forms of sarcoma 180, as well as against the solid form only of sarcoma 37, Ehrlich carcinoma, Yoshida sarcoma (Koma tsu, 1969), and Lewis lung carcinoma (Yamamoto et al, 1981). Schizophyllan has also increased cellular immunity by restoring suppressed killer -cell activity to normal levels in mice with tumors (Oka et al, 1985) and demonstrated protective effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Komatsu et al, 1973). Schizophyllan (SPG) activates macrophages (in vitro and in vivo) which results in augmentation of T cell activities and increased sensitivity of cytotoxic LAK and NK cells to IL-2. Although structurally similar to lentinan, SPG does not directly activate T cells (Shimizu et al, 1992). SPG is distributed in the body in macrophages, tissues next to tumors, and Kupf fer cells (in bone marrow , lymph nodes, liver, and spleen) (Mizuhira et al, 1985 ). In bone marrow cells of mice, SPG inhibited chromosomal damage caused by chemo therapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and mitomycin C) and by radiation. Best results against radiation damage were found when SPG was administered shortly after or at the same time as radiation, and SPG restored mitosis of bone marrow cells previously suppressed by anticancer drugs (Y ang et al, 1993). Human Clinical Studies In recurrent and inoperable gastric cancer , schizophyllan (SPG), combined with chemother apy (tegafur or mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil), in a randomized, controlled study in 367 patients, resulted in treated subjects living significantly longer than those on chemotherapy alone. Survival rates were also increased in 323 cases of resectable gastric cancer (Furue, 1985).In randomized controlled studies of SPG in combination with radiation therapy , SPG significantly prolonged the 5-year survival rate of stage II cervical cancer patients, but not stage III patients (Okamura et al, 1985; Okamura et al, 1989). SPG-trea ted (i.m.) cervical cancer patients show a more \"significa ntly rapid\" restoration of T-lymphocyte level s following radiation therapy than control patients (Noda et al, 1992). In cervical patients given SPG prior to surgery, compared to patients not pre-treated with SPG, regional lymph node production of interleukin-2 was significantly higher , suggesting prior helper T cell activation of cervical regional lymph nodes (Shimizu et al, 1992). Intratumoral admin istration of SPG in advanced cervical carcinoma patients produced increased lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor tissue and in tissue surro unding the tumor and NK cell infiltration in tumor tissue (Gorai et al, 1992). The application of S. commune in TCM against gynecological diseases (Yang & Jong, 1989) foreshadowed the current use of SPG against cervical cancer . In oral carcinoma numbers and NK cell activity in peripheral blood showed a significant increase (Yoneda et al, 1991). There are also indications (in vitro) that chronic hepatitis B patients could benefit from SPG, since SPG can enhance immunological responsiveness to the virus, particularly in interferon-g production (Kakum u et al, 1991). In Japan, SPG is also being studied in chronic fatigue syndrome. A clinical report on the experience of a Japanese resear cher from Kyoto University was reported in the Japan Economic Journal in 1992 . Of 11 patients with symptoms of CFS, Uchida found the symptoms of 10 greatly improved, and natural killer cell count increased. The treatment was said to be without side ef fects. Toxicity No data. Uses in T raditional Medicine In TCM, S. commune is said to have a sweet taste and be mild in nature (Liu & Bau, 1980). It is recom mended for general weakness and debility (Ying et al, 1987) and to cure gynecological diseases (Yang and Jong, 1989). In Mexico, 5. commune is a highly regarded fungus for cooking or frying with sesame seeds and beans. The energetic quality assigned by curanderos who use it is cold (Alfaro et al, 1983). Medical UsesIn China , the fungus is stewed with eggs to make a preparation used to cure leukorrhea (Y ing et al, 1987). Preparation and Dosage As a tea, take 9-16 g in decoction, 3X/day . a (Pers.:Fr .) Reid (Lincof f, 1981). Notes This mushroom may be eaten whole raw, as it has a slightly bittersweet taste after masti cation. Unfortun ately , it is often so small that it is difficult to collect large quantities of this fungus in the wild, at least in California, but not necessar ily in all region s (Arora, 1994). In many tropi cal areas, S. commune is a regularly eaten food. The natives of Zaire prepare the fungus by boiling it in water for 1-2 hours with the addition of vegetable salt which tenderizes this tough fungus. They are served drained with peanuts and salt and oil for seasoning (Parent and Thoen, 1977). Procur ement Review the Notes section above. Schizophyllum is not generally available in North America or Europe in commercial trade, either in bulk or prepared products. In Japan, it is prescribed as an adjuvant to cancer therapy . TRAMETES VERSICOLOR (L.:FR.) PIL. (trametes=one for T. versicolor , but Trametes is now generally accepted as correct (Arora, 1994). Other synonyms less frequently used include Polystictus versicolor Fr.and Polyporus versicolor (Arora, 1986). Other Common Names Japan, T. versicolor is also known as \"kawarata ke,\" which means mushroom by the river bank (Namba, 1980). In China, the fungus is called \"yun-zhi,\" meaning cloud fungus (Y ang et al, 1993).Description and Habitat This common denizen of the woods is true to its name, as the multi-colored cap resembles turkey tails. Its fan-shaped fruiting bodie s grow in overlapping clusters on dead logs. The top is zoned, usually in shades of brown, white, grey, or blue (though this is variable), and it sports hairy bands. The underside of the cap is white and shows minute pores which do not discolor after scratching. Range T. versicolor is comm on worldwide. I have seen it growing in many parts of the United State s and Europe, and it grows throughout China (Yang et al, 1993). History For the year 1987 in Japan, PSK (\"polysaccharide Kureha,\" which is extracted from turkey tail) accounted for 25.2% of the total national expenditure for anticancer agents (Fukushima, 1989). Florists in Europe recently adopted this fungus as one of the top species for commercial design (Poppe, 1991). Chemistry The lipid fraction from the carpo phores of T. versicolor amounts to 1.7% of the total weight and contains the lanostane-type tetracyclic triterpenoid ergosta-7,22,dien-3-ol as the major sterol (common in many other Polyporaceae), along with smaller amounts of ergost-7-en-3-ol (fungisterol) and ergosterol (Yokoyama et al, 1975; Endo, 1981). They also contain (-sitosterol (Kim et al, 1978) and hydroxymethylquinoline (Abraham and Spaso, 1991). The two principal immunologically active fractions are PSK or \"Krestin,\" a water -soluble, protein-bound polysaccharide that has (-1, 4-glucan as its main component as well as (-1,3 linkages and 38% protein (Sakagami and Takeda, 1993), and ting of 10% peptides and 90% polysaccharides (Yang et al, 1993). Miyazaki et al (1974) isolated an antitumor polysaccharide that did not contain nitrogen and called it coriolan. Pharmacology Pharmacological activities that may be due to the polysaccharide PSK include the inhibition of 1976a; Ueno et al, 1978; Yan, 1985); improvement in the functioning ofblood vessels (Ito and Hidaka, 1980a); support of hepatic function (Ito and Hidaka, 1980b); restoration of serum lysozyme content and normalization of splee n index in irradiated mice (Cai et al, 1987); immune function enhancement (Iwaguchi, 1985), and the possible prevention of liver cancer (Wang, 1989). Against lethal cytomegalovirus infection, the action of PSK appears to be through NK cell activation (Ebihara and Minamishima, 1984). Also, nitrogen- extracted versicolor mycelia increase antibacterial potency and prolong antibacterial effects of antibiotics and can increase antibiotic sensitivity in antibio tic-resistant bacteria (Kureha Chemical Industry Co., 1978). Two polyoxygenated ergosterol derivatives showed cytotoxicity (in vitr o) against hepatoma cells (Valisola lao et al, 1983). T. versicolor has been used in the control of the tobacco mosaic virus found on Nicotiana tabacum (Asano et al, 1979). Animal studies have shown that PSK, which is derived from the mycelium, has immune-enhancing activity and a broad antineoplastic scope. It has been shown to prolong the survival time of irrad iated mice, stimulate phagocytotic activity of macrophages, and improve the functions of the reticuloendothelial system (Zhu, 1987). In cyclophosphamide- induced granulo cytopenia in mice, PSK (i.p.) caused a signific ant increase in granulocyte production (Mayer and Drew , 1980). PSK (oral) restored antibody (IgG) production in mice bearing sarcoma 180, but not in normal mice (Nomoto et al, 1975). In regard to PSK's antitumor properties, it acts directly on tumor cells, as well as indirectly in the host to boost cellular immunity . It has shown antitumor activity and lung cancer (Tsukagoshi et al, 1984). An intriguing feature of this compound is that injection of PSK at one tumor site has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in other sites, thus helping to prevent metastasis (Ebina et al, 1987b). Also, PSK' s antitumor activity is enhanced in combination with radiation, chemotherapy , or immunotherapy . Oral administration of PSK as 10% and less of rat feeds suppressed carcinogen- induced cancers of the colon, esophagus, breast, and lung (Tsukagoshi et al, 1984).PSK has also demonstrated antiviral activity . It may inhibit HIV infection by modifying the viral receptor or by stopping HIV from binding with lymphocytes (Tochikura et al, 1987a). Another mechanism through which PSK is reported to have general antiviral activity is through the stimulation of interferon production (Ebina et al, 1987a). PSP is an immunostimulant extracted from T. versicolor mycelia. Although simila r to PSK, which is also extracted from the mycelia, PSP is devoid of the sugar fucose while PSK is without the sugars rhamnose and arabinose. The major sugar in PSP is glucose, and the polysaccharide' s main chain is linked by (1-3 and 1-4 glycosides. PSP has shown activity by the oral route and by injectio n (i.p.). In normal mice, oral doses of PSP (0.5-2 g/kg) caused greatly increased phagocytic activity Acanthopanax (300 mg/kg, oral). PSP increased T-cell numbers (in vitro), interferon production (in vitro), and increased interleukin production in mice (PSP , 1,500 mg/kg/day X5, orally). Co-treatment of mice with PSP and cyclophosph amide resulted in a significant prevention of decreases in white blood cell and IL-2 production. In tumor -bearing mice, PSP stopped thymus atrophy and increased serum IgG values. PSP showed tumor - inhibiting activity in animals with sarcoma 180, P388 human lung adenocarcinoma, and various cancers of the liver, stomach, nose, and throat (Yang, 1993). A glycoprotein obtained from the mycelia of Trametes spp. showed activity (in animal and in vitro tests) against experimental hypertension, diabetes, cancer , thrombosis, and rheumatism. The protein inhibits and vasodilating. It has also been shown to reverse conditions associated with nephron disorders, improve proteinuria and proteinemia-associated conditions, and regulate prostaglandin formation and degradation (Ikuzawa, 1985). An extracellular polysaccharide from T. versicolor administered to mice (i.p. or oral) challenged with herpes or influenza viruses caused serum interferon induction and inhibited a decrease in phagocytosis (Chen, 1986). Whole T. versicolor has been shown to lower serum cholesterol in animals (Y agishita et al, 1977) and, in combination with the herb Astragalus membranaceus Bunge, it has been found to enhance neutrophil function andspeed recovery in rabbits suffering from burns (Liu et al, 1985). Finally , a powdered extrac t (from a 70% ethanolic tincture) of this species was tested in rats by injection in a Hippocratic screening of higher fungi and demonstrated mild tranquilizing and diuretic activity (Malone et al, 1967). Human Clinical Studies PSK has been used both orally and intravenously as an immune adjuvant in clinical medicin e. Cancer patients given 3 g of PSK per day have shown increased interferon production (Ebina et al, 1987a). In cancer patients, PSK also antagonistically elevates the activity of phosphofructokinase and shows antioxidant activity , working as a superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenger (Nak amura et al, 1986). PSK has been shown to be effective against many human cancers (Hotta et al, 1981) but seldom with satisfactory results administered alone. In combination with radiation in stage III uterine cervical cancer patients, PSK (3-6 g/day) prolon ged the life span and appeared to have enhanced the sensitivity of the cancers to radiation therapy . One study performed at the Department of Gynecology , National Cancer Center Hospital in Tokyo (Kasamatsu, 1982 ) tested the influence of PSK on the survival rate with cervical cancer patients. PSK was given orally in the dose of 3-6 grams a day in conjunction with radiation therapy . After radiation, patients having no observed tumor cells remaining was 36% with PSK and 11% without. Two-year 3-year survival year survival rate 64% and 41% respectively . The rate of cancer deaths within 5 years was 21% with PSK and 52% without. Improved survival rates have also been reported in gastric cancer patients from PSK (6 g/day) in a combination treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent tegafur following gastrectomy and patients with postoperative stomach cancer . In a randomized, controlled study with 462 curatively resected colore ctal cancers, PSK was given orally for over 3 years following mitom ycin C (by iv on the day of surgery and 1 day following) and 5-flu orouracil (5-FU) orally for 5 months. At the time of reporting, the average study follow-up was 4 years. The increased diseasefree survival curve of the PSK group over the control group (who only received the 2 drugs) was statistically significa nt (Mitomi et al, 1992). In another similar study , PSK was administered after the same chemotherapeutic regime as the previous study to 56 patients and a placebo to a group of 55 control patients. The rate of remissions and the survival rate in the patients takingPSK was significantly higher than the control group. Enhanced immune functions, including enhanced polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity was said to be a significant factor in explaining the results (Torisu et al, 1990). PSK was tested as an adjuvant immunotherapy in a group of patients with carcinoma of the nasopharynx (n=21), and found to significantly increase (35 versus 25 months) the median survival time over the control group (n=17) as well as the 5-year survival rate (28% versus 15%). All patients in both groups had previous radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (Go & Chung, 1989). Another earlier study with nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (n=67) reported similar results (Chung et al, 1987). The dose was 1 gram 3 times daily for a minimu m of 1 month. Three cases of toxicity were noted. Other uncontrolled clinical studies have reported enhanced or recovered cellular immunity from PSK in patients with glomerulonephritis, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Symptoms decreased, and relapse was prevented. Improved symptoms and normalization of immunity were reported in systemic lupus erythematosus, and in cases of lupus, chronic rheum atoid s, sclerosis, Be\u00e7het' s disease, and dermatomyositis, peripheral lymphocytes showed recovery of blastogenesis. Others have reported that PSK causes a significa nt decrease in LDL cholesterol in hyperlipidemia (stage IIa) patients, a significant decrease in cyclophosphamide-induced chromosomal damage in children (Tsukagoshi et al, 1984), fewer sick days, and increased immunity in patients with recurrent genital herpes (3-5 g/day) (Kawana, 1985). A controlled clinical trial of PSP was conducted in 485 cancer patients (211 control patients) treated with the polysaccharide-peptide (3 g/day for 30 days orally) in combination with radio-and chemotherapies. The patients were diagnosed with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and lung. As a result of PSP , side ef fects from the conventional therapies most significantly lessened in the categories of pain, poor appetite, tiredness, weakness, and dryness of the mouth and throat. The clinicians noted that in TCM, this indicates an invigorating action on the heart and spleen. Compared to control patients, body weight in the PSP group was significantly higher , and their T-cell ratio, NK cell activ ity, and IL-2 levels were also higher . To counteract the decreases in white blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet levels which accompany chemo-and radiotherapy , batyl alcohol is often given at the same time. PSP in place of batyl alcohol produced compar able results.The rate of remission in the esophageal cancer patients who received PSP plus chemothera py was 72%, whereas those on chemotherapy alone had a remission rate of 42%. PSP also raised the one-year survival rate for this type of cancer by 11%. The main immunologic pathways activa ted by PSP to inhibit tumors are through helper T-cell, NK cell, and complement C3 (Yang, 1993). In breast cancer patients treated with 4'epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, PSP stabilized and nearly prevented white blood cell decreases from the chemotherapy (Shui et al, 1992). Toxicity Unlike many standard anticancer drugs, the PSK in T. versicolor produces few, if any , side ef fects on the bone marrow or other or gans, and it shows no immunosuppressive action. In general, T. versicolor has very low levels of toxicity (Su et al, 1987) and produces few or no side effects (Tsukagoshi et al, 1984 ). The oral LD50 of PSP is reported as 10.0 mg/kg. Negative results were found on the Ames and chromosome distortion tests (Yang & Jong, 1989). Uses in T raditional Medicine The taste and energy is sweet and slightly warm; enters the spleen and heart meridians; invigorates the spirit (Y ang et al, 1993). In TCM, T. versicolor is used to clear dampness, reduce phlegm, heal pulmonary disor ders (Ying et al, 1986), strengthen the physique, increase energy, and benefit people with chronic diseases (Yang & Jong, 1989). In Mexican folk medicine, the fungus is used to cure ringworm or impetigo of the skin (Alfaro et al, 1983). Medical Uses In China, it is considered useful for infection and/or inflamm ation of the upper respirator y, urinary , and digestive tracts, curative to liver ailments, including hepatitis B and chronic active hepatitis, and is used for general immune weakness and tumors (Y ing et al, 1987). Preparation and Dosage Take as desired in tea, up to 20 g 3X/day . Powder the dried fruiting bodies and take up to 5 grams a day in capsules. For PSP, one gram 3 times daily (Yang & Jong, 1989). Related Species T. pubescens has exhibited anti-tumor activity (Shibata et al, 1968), and T. hirsutus is also active against sarcoma 180 in mice, and it is a popular folkremedy for benefiting lung diseases, stopping coughing, and promoting the regeneration of muscle (Ying et al, 1987). Coriolus consors contains coriolin, an antibiotic that has been shown to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria and Trichomonas vaginalis (Takeuchi et al, 1969). In addition, many species of T rametes have shown antibacterial activity (Hervey , 1947). Notes T. versicolor is an excellent fungus to collect in the wild, as it is widespread and abundant. To prevent larvae from damaging the fruiting bodies, it should be frozen promptly after harvesting for 24 hours and then dried, or dried soon after harvest in a food dryer at 120 degrees. Trametes number approximately 15 species in the western part of Canada and the U.S. (Lowe and Gilbertson, 1961). The tea is mucilaginous and has a flavor and odor reminiscent of cream of mushro om soup. You may also add a handful of the fruiting bodies to the Wei Qi Soup recipe (page 45), or chew the mushroom raw (it tastes and feels something like mushroom-flavored chewing gum, which is actually more enjoyable than one might first imagine). For the last 10 years, I have often eaten 2 or 3 of the fresh fruiting bodies as I'm walking in the woods. I also know people who take 4-10 grams of the fungus powder daily as a tonic and cancer preventative. The mild-tasting fruiting bodies can also be used to make soup stock. Procur ement Review the Notes section above for information on collection from the wild \u2014it is widely available, often in large quantities. PSP and PSK are just beginning to be available in the U.S. and Europe, and are commonly prescribed in Japan for a variety of diseases and as a \"heal th food\" No data. Other Common NamesT. is also known as the simply 1983; Liu and Bau, 1980). In China, the carpophore of T. fuciformis is known as \"yin er\" (Zhibin et al, 1982). Description and Habitat Jelly-like, nearly white transluc ent fruiting body , 5-10 cm in diameter with numerous wavy , leaf-like convolutions. Slightly yellow after drying. Prefers to grow on deciduous trees such as oaks, willows, poplars, chestnut, chinquapin, maple, liquidambar , and even eucalyptus. It is commonly cultivated in Asia (Liu and Bau, 1980). Range Grows mainly in the southern United States and warmer climates worldwide; common in Asia (Arora, 1986). History T. fuciformis (white fungus) has been used in China since ancient times as a Qi and immune tonic (Zican et al, 1983), as well as nutritive tonic for treating debility and exhaustion (Zhibin et al, 1982). It is said to enhance beauty , gonadal activity , reduce fevers, and heal ulcers. It is recommended in China to be taken for weakness after childbirth, constipation, abnormal menstruation, hemoptysis (blood in the sputum), dysentery , and gastritis. Finally , it is supposed to remove facial freckles if eaten frequently . Despite its gelatinous demeanor , this fungus is obviously a favored delicacy for many Asians. The method of administration is a lukewarm watery preparation made by soaking 3-4 grams of the white fungus for 1-2 hours, then cooking it down into a paste in an earthen pot. If the advice to \"add enough crystal sugar to take twice daily\" is commonly followed, its popularity might be considerably enhanced in the west (Liu & Bau, 1980). Chemistry Various semi-pu rified polysacch arides have been isolated and characterized from the spores (polysaccharid es A and B) (Zhibin et al, 1982) and the fruiting bodies (Kakuta et al, 1979; Ukai et al, 1978). The stero ls from the lipid fraction of Tremella ergosterol, 28.5% erosta-5,7- Chang, 1984). Pharmacology A number of animal studies have shown that polysaccharides as well as a fermented solution and various extracts from T. fuciformis enhance cellular and humoral immune function (Xiao, 1987; Zhu, 1987; Xia & Chen, 1988). The polysaccharides and glyco proteins have been found to increase the effectiveness of interferon induc tion (Yang et al, 1986); increase splenocyte interleukin-2 (IL-2) production (Ma and Lin, 1992); promote phagocytosis (Zhibin et al, 1982), as well as the size and proliferation (Liu et al, 1994) of peritoneal macrophages. In addition, they protect against the negative effects of radiation (Hu and But, 1987; Xia & Chen, 1988; Zican et al, 1983) by augmenting natural killer cell activity , antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity , and production of splenocytes of IL-2 (Zheng et al, 1993). Five polysaccharide fractions isolated from T. fuciformis, labeled BI- BV, have demonstrated antitumor activity against HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells in vitro (Gao, 1991), and polysaccharides A, B, and C demonstrated antitumor activity (ip) in mice (Ukai et al, 1972). T. fuciformis polysaccharides and spore extracts have also demonstrated antilipemic (Zhibin et al, 1982; Konishi, 1988), (Xue et al, 1989), liver-protective (oral administration), and antiaging (Zhou et al 1989a) activities, also increasing the SOD activity of the brain and liver and inhib iting brain monoamine oxidase B (Zhou et al, 1989a). One preparation lowered the LDL-cholesterol in rats fed the preparation, which also contained butter , sugar , and egg yolks, by 30% over controls (Nakajima et al, 1989). The polysaccharides could also increase the rate of survival and prolong the time of survival in mice (pretreated, i.p.) with implanted tumor cells (Liu et al, 1994 ). They prolonged thrombus formation, reduce d thrombus size, reduced blood platelet count, platelet adherence, and blood viscosity , and positively influenced other blood coagulation parameters (Shen & Chen, 1990) and stimulated phagocytotic activity of macrophages (Lin, 1982).One study of total polysaccharides (TFTP) has little influence on glycogen metabolism in the livers of mice, whether norma l mice or mice in which liver injury was induced by surgery or by carbo n tetrachloride, which caused the glycogen content to decrease. Structural protein synthesis in the injure d liver was increased by TFTP , whereas synthesis of serum protein levels decreased from TFTP to levels lower than that of untreated controls (Yue & Cong, 1986). Human Clinical Studies Two polysaccha rides (A and B) and a fermented mixture from T. fuciformis have been used in a variety of clinical trials. It is effective treating leukopenia induced in cancer patients by radio-and chemotherapy , and it has also been shown to boost immunological functions and stimulate leukocyte activ ity (Hu and But, 1987). Other clinical studies have confirmed that extracts of T. fuciformis possess antitumor and anti-radiation properties and strengthen immu ne activity (Zican et al, 1983). In addition, both Tremella spore fermented solution and polysaccharides A and B have increased phagocytosis of macrophages, resulting in improved immunity and resistance to chronic bronchitis in human patients (Lin et al, 1982). A polysaccharide-containing extract was given to 45 patients with chronic hepatitis , 3 capsules containing 1 gram a day for 3 months (Xiong, H.-Z. et al, 1985). In the 32 patients in the group with chronic active hepatitis, the success rate is reported to be 56.3%, and of the 13 with chronic persisten t hepatitis, 76.9%. Ten patients who were HBsAg positive converted to negative, and 13 had a decrease in HBsAg titer. Sixteen patients were said to be clinical ly cured, and after a follow-up period of 6- 36 months, 14 patients were free of farther symptoms. Toxicity Believed to be non-toxic (Ying et al, 1987; Hu and But, 1987); the LD50 (i.v.) of the spores fermented 17.87 ml/kg and of polysaccharide A, 380 mg/kg (Lin et al, 1982). Uses in T raditional Medicine Taste and energy are sweet and mild (Ying et al, 1987). Therapeutically related to lung and spleen channels (Enquin, 1990;), it is said to supplement the vital energy, promote blood circulation and strengthen the heart, nourishthe yin and stomach, and invigorate the brain (Zican, 1983; Bensky & Gamble, 1993). In TCM, T. fuciformis is well known and highly respe cted in both TCM and folk medicine. It is used as a cough syrup for treating chron ic tracheitis and a number of other cough -related conditions, such as asthma, dry coughs, heat in the lungs, etc, especially with yin deficiency (clears yin deficient heat). It is also used to strengthen semen, counteract yin deficiency , lubricate the lungs and intestines, harmonize the blood, stimulate the heart, increase the secretion of saliva, strengthen vital energy, and nourish the stomach, kidneys, and brain (Ying et al, 1987). In China, a number of prepared products are made from this fungus, including \"Yin Mi Pian\" which includes A. mellea. An extract is made by fermentation, a process which may release active high molecular weight polysaccharides and make them available to the body . The extract is then made into tablets, 6-12 of which are taken daily for 4 weeks to enhance the recovery of red- cell production in the bone marrow in cases of \"blood deficiency ,\" and enhance immune system funct ions, such as phagocytosis and levels of lysozyme in bronchial secretion s. The tablets are used clinically to benefit lowered white blood cell count after radiation or chemotherapy for cancer , the coughing and phlegm associated with asthma and chronic bronchitis (Yang & Jong, 1989). T. fuciformis has shown positive results in treating debility and exhaustion according to TCM practitioners in China (Enquin, 1990; Zhibin, 1982). Medical Uses Based on its beneficial effect on the blood and cholesterol-lowering effects in anima l studie s (see pharmacology section), T. fuciformis may be useful when taken daily as a preventat ive and/or treatment (with other herbs, diet and exercise) for cardiovascular problems, such as arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and abnormal clotting, though there are no clinical studies that support this use. In Japan, a patent was registered for \"cholesterol- controlling foods and drinks\" containing powdered Tremella fuciformis. Clinical trials support its use with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer patients and for patients with chronic infections, to augment immune function. Preparation and Dosage3-4 gram s twice daily in teas, soups, and other dishes, or powdered and sprinkled on food. T. fuciformis is prepared by soaking 3-4 grams of the dried fruit body in water for a couple of hours and then stewing the fungus until it becomes the consistency of a paste, add a sweetener such as honey to taste and take a small amount twice a day (Liu and Bau, 1980). Related Species All similar species are usable for food, since none of the jelly fungi are known to be poisonous; not all have been tested for medicinal activity . Two widely used related species are T. aurantia and T. mesenterica Mart. (Ying et al, 1987; Liu and Bau, 1980). T. mesenterica , also known as aureous jelly fungus (Liu and Bau, 1980) or in the west, witch' s butter , is bright yellow- to-orange and has a convoluted shape. Commonly seen on logs during rainy weather , it is jelly-like when wet and small and hard when dry. T. aurantia has many of the same qualities according to TCM as T. fuciformis , namely , it is nourishing, regulates Qi, stops coughing, is used for asthm atic attacks, reduces phlegm, and supports the liver. In addition, it is used clinically in China for hypertension and tracheitis (Y ing et al, 1987). T. mesenterica has been recommended for eye ailments and for palsies in European herbal medicine, especially pungent fruiting bodies, which are thought to be superior to ones that are mild-tasting (Dragendorf f, 1898). It is thought to have a sweet taste and cold energy in TCM and is used to relieve inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. It is soothing, demulcent, and slightly expectorant, and it may be taken as tea for colds and flu, asthma, bronchitis, and general debility . To make tea from T. mesenterica , use 3-6 g of the fresh fungus, or soak the dried fungus in water to hydrate it before weighing. Simmer the measured quantity in water for 6- 8 hours until it becomes a paste. Then add honey and take the preparation continuously for periods of 10 days, resting 2-3 days in between each period (Liu and Bau, 1980). T. mesenterica grows on dead hardwoods, especially branches or sticks (Arora, 1986). A liquid extract from A. polytricha and Flammulina velutipes was given orally in a study with children and was said to help prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia as well as stimulate weight gains and improve appetite. The preparation was awarded a silver cup at a 1990 international food fair (Ni et al, 1993). Procur ementRead the Notes section above. Various Tremella species are available in Chinese food stores and herb shops. They are common in the wild, and may be included in some Chinese prepared products. cocos is also known as \"hoelen\" in Chinese (Narui et al, 1980). \"Fulin g\" is the Chinese name for the sclerotium of this fungus, and other parts of it have names as well. For example, \"fulingpi\" is the black skin removed from the sclerotium; the inner white portion of the sclerotium is called \"baifuling;\" and the tuber which encircles the root of the pine tree is called \"fushen.\" There is also a reddish variety of W. cocos which is known as \"chifuling\" (Chang & But, 1986). In Japan, it is known as Matsuhodo. Description and Habitat P. cocos grows under ground on the roots of pine (Narui, 1980) and other trees. It is often found infecting tree roots and stumps of hardwoods and conifers. There is a rather tough fruiting body arising from a sclerotium. The flesh of the fruiting body is often resupinate on wood, thin and white to tan with the stalk absent (Arora, 1986). Range Eastern Asia, Eastern Australia, and especially common in southeastern North America. Polyporus tuheraster forms tubers that are riddled with dirt and sand and are much less usable (Arora, 1986). History P. cocos is economically important in Nigeria, where it is used as food as well as in traditi onal medicine (Prance, 1984). In the Eastern and Southern U.S., Indian use of P. cocos was primarily for making a kind of bread which the Euro pean settlers called \"Indian bread.\" Indian bread, or Indian potato, was also a survival food for slaves running from capture. A single growth could weigh 15-30 pounds and, after baking, it could be ground to producea flour . Like potatoes, tuckahoe s were dug up from the ground and were often found in the same shape and size as sweet potatoes, and they were believed to be poisonous until roasted. In 1821, John Torrey made one of the first analyses of \"tuckahoe,\" finding that it contained a kind of \"glutin\" made up of a vegetable matter he called \"sclerotin,\" a name genericized in the same year in Sclerotium cocos, a binomial that aptly described both the coconut-like shape of the fungus and its occurrence as a sclerotium (Weber, 1929). Chemistry P. cocos contains polysaccharides (Li, 1974), protein-bound polysaccharides such as H-11 (Kanayama et al, 1983), and 0.28% of a mixture of triterpenecarboxylic acids (Iseda & Yagishita, 1956), including the triterpene acids pachymic acid and related compounds, tumulosic acid, and eburica-7-9 (l l)-dien-20-oic acid (Valisolalad et al, 1980) , as well as ergosterol (Li, 1974; Yokoyam a et 1975); also sterols (Yokoyama et al, 1975); and choline, phospholipids, and resin (Li, 1974). Its water-soluble sugars are composed of glucose, sucrose, and a small amount of unknown sugar . No fructose is present (Iseda & Yagishita, 1956). Two new triterpenoids, poricoic acids A (I) and B (II), have recently been isolated from the surface layer of P. cocos (Tai et al, 1991 ). The fatty acids in Korean (white) P. cocos have been identified as caprylic acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, dodecenoic acid, and palmitic acid, the major ones being caprylic and dodecenoic acids (Moon et al, 1987). According to Suzuki et al (1982), the mineral content (ppm) of P. cocos is Na (8.9), K (570), Ca (12), Mg (29), Fe (47), Mn (6.9), Zn (2.2), and Cu (2.2). See the Nutrition section for comparison with other fungi. Pharmacology As with many other medicinal fungi, the polysaccharides of P. cocos have been reported to inhibit tumors indirectly by stimulating immunological functions (Lou et al, 1988). One such polysaccharide, named pachyman, showed no significant antitumor activity (Narui et al, 1980; Chihara et al, 1970a), but it increased phagocytosis in the peritoneal macro phages and accelerated recovery from cyclophosphamide-induced leukop enia in rats et al, 1987a). a protein-bound polysaccharide (H11) (Kanayama, 1983; Kanayama,1986). H11 was isolated when it was discovered that in large doses (200 mg/kg) a crude fraction of the mycelium produced a tumor inhibition rate of 80% and complete remission of tumors in 10% of animals (Kanayama, 1986). Carboxymethylpachymaran (CMP), a chemically modified form of the polysaccharide pachyman in P. cocos , increased the effectiveness of interferon induction in vitro (Yang et al, 1986), enhanced phagocytic activity of macropha ges (Singh et al, 1974), and produced very high rates of tumor inhibition in mice (Hamuro et al, 1971a) . Pachyman was found to be effective again st original-type, anti-GBM nephritis in rats. This may be due in part to the inhibitory action of pachyman on C3- deposition in the glomeruli (Hattori et al, 1992). Another compound from P. cocos that has been studied in some detail is poriatin, which is said to be a group of low-molecular weight tetracyclic triterpenes (Zha ng et al, 1993). It, too, has immunostimulating activities, having demonstrated antiviral activity and the ability to activate peritoneal macrophages and increase pinocytosis and phagocytosis. It can also improve the production of colony stimulating activity by macrophages, lymphocytes, and other cells, shortening the period of leukocytopenia, and enhance lysosomal enzyme activity \"with protein and RNA synthesis\" (Ding et al, 1987; Zhong et al, 1993). Poriatin is especially interesting in that it has also demonstrated immunosuppressive activity and is an aldosterone antagonist (Deng and Xu, 1992; Wang et al, 1992a). For instance, in a study on rats with experimentally-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis, poriatin decreased the severity of the disease. A combined thera py of poriatin and cyclophosphamide (a neoplastic suppressant used in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias), was even more effective. This not only suggests that poriatin may be useful in treating autoimm une diseases, but also points to the valuable syner gistic effects that can be obtained by integrating herbal and modern western medicine (Wang et al, 1992b). P. cocos has also shown suppressor actio n (in vitro) against the secretion of cytokines (TNF-Alpha, IL-6, IL-b and GM- CSF), but only from high amounts (T seng and Chang, 1992). Finally , P. cocos has been shown to have antimutagenic activity (Nunoshiba et al, 1990) and, in combination the pain threshold, decrea sespontaneous locomotive activity , and to produce increased sedative and hypnotic effects in mice given phenobarbital (Xie and Ren, 1987). A methanolic extract of P. cocos (as Pachyma hoelen) has shown hair growth promoting activity applied topically to mice (Inaoka et al, 1994). Human Clinical Studies Reference was made above to the possibilities of integrating herbal and modern western medicine. One such study conducted on humans used a combination of 400 mg metronidazole and a decoction of the roots of Paeonia lactiflora plus the sclero tium of Wolfiporia cocos (10 g of each herb), to treat viral hepatitis. The cure rate for the combined thera py was 75%, while it was only 40% with the use of metronidazole alone and 36% with the decoction alone. The control group showed 0% cure rate (Wang, 1987). The chemically-modified form of pachyman, carboxymethylpachymaran, which Guo et al (1984) call \"carboxylmethyl Poria Cocos Polysaccharide\" was reported to produce an \"immediate cure\" of chronic viral hepatitis in 11 out of 30 patients, while 16 were improved. Following two courses of the polysaccharide (60 mg, i.m.), no side effects were found and a normalization was seen in immune functions (Guo et al, 1984). P. cocos has also been used to treat arrhythmia (Ding, 1987). Toxicity There has been one case of an allergic reaction to the sclerotium of P. cocos which produced systemic pruritus, sore limbs, dizziness, and nausea (Shen, 1985). However , P. cocos is generally considered safe. Uses in T raditional Medicine According to TCM, it is considered sweet and bland with a mild energy (Chang & But, 1987) and is used to invigorate the Spleen, tonify the Stomach, clear dampness, as a sedative, tranquilizer , and diuretic, and for clearing febrile illnesses and leukorrhea (Tu, 1988). The internal white portion is used as a febrifugal, diuretic, and to strengthen the vital energy, soothe agitation, and lower blood sugar (Y ing et al, 1987). Medical Uses In China the cortex of the fungu s is used as a decoction for coughs, edema, and as a diuretic; the sliced, whole sclerotium is used to treat jaundice and to induce menstruation (Miyasita, 1976; Lee et al, 1977). In Korea, P. cocos is used as an antifertility drug to induce menstruation (Lee et al, 1977).Preparation and Dosage Usually 9-15 g (T u, 1988). Related Species In the western half of Canada and the U.S. alone, there are approximately 74 species of Poria (Lowe and Gilbertson, 1961). I have experimented with Wolfiporia corticola or look-alikes in the same group and feel that they have potential. These forms of Poria are simply layers of white pores that grow flat on decaying wood. In some years, they grow in thick layers of pores, 1-2\" thick on dead alder and oak. I cut them off with a knife, like cutting through honeycombs, and dry the long strips of white pore layers. They make a good-tasting (sweet and slightly bitter) tincture (in 45% ethanol), and the tea is palatable. I have noticed a diuretic effect from it, but I need more clinical experience with it to say more. Gregory et al (1966) found that P. corticola showed strong antitumor activity (Sarcoma 180) in mice, which was supported by Ruelius et al (1968), as well as \"considerable antibacterial activity\" against a number of bacteria and fungi (Ying et al, 1987). The activity was said to be due to two isolated antibiotic substances, nemotin and nemotinic acid (Kav anagh et al, 1950). Also from this species an antitumor acidic protein was isolated and named poricin (Ruelius et al,1968). In a survey of mushrooms for antibacterial activity , 33 species of Poria showed a strong degree of activity (Hervey , 1947). Procur ement Hoelen is one of the most commonly used of all Chinese herbs, and is available in Chinese herb shops and some natural food stores in bulk. It is also included in a large number of commercial prepared products in Asia, North America, and Europe. It is difficult to obtain from the wild in North America or Europe, less so in Asia. ADDITIONAL SPECIES Brief monographs\u2014for species where there is insuf ficient data for a full treatment; and table of species AGARICUS BISPORUS (LANGE) SING.BUTT ON MUSHROOM It is known that the button mushroom, the most commonly cultivated mushroom in most western countries, contains carcinogenic compounds, most notably agaritine, which is related to a class of chem icals called hydrazines. While these compounds are known to possess carcinogenic properties, tests show that one might have to consume as much as 350 grams of fresh mushrooms daily for 50 years for there to be a significant risk of initiating tumor growth (Toth & Gannett, 1993). It is difficult to correlate this risk with actual human consumption. The researchers also found that during the storage period of commercially-available mushrooms, the carcinogenic hydrazines were reduced up to 47% after 1 week and up to 76% after 2 weeks, and that cooking only reduced them by an average of 25%. This means that cooking does not significantly reduce the risk. Moderate consu mption of button mushrooms may not be any more carcinogenic than a number of other slightly risky foods or beverages such as peanut butter or wine. It is interesting to note that a numb er of other edible mushroom species, including P. ostreatus, F. velutipes , and V. volvacea have been shown to be free of agaritine (Breene, 1990). Button mushrooms do contain significant amounts of protein, vitamins and minerals, but when one considers the possible carcinogenic effect of their chronic consumption, and the possible trace amounts of malathion that may be present, it is probably wise to eat them no more than 2-3 times weekly in moderate amounts. CALVATIA GIGANTEA (BATSCH:PERS.) LLOYD, C. SPP. GIANT PUFFBALL , M A BO Some authors say that the large fruiting body of this fungus is the largest of all fungi (McIlvaine and Macadam, 1973), though Arora disputes this (Arora, 1994). It has been recorded that specimens of C. gigantea have been found as large as 5 ft. and weighing 50 lbs, and one observer has said that from a distance they have sometimes been mistaken for sheep grazing on a hillside (Arora, 1986).One study showed that C. gigantea possesses antitumor properties (Roland et al,1960), and the spores of C. gigantea contain amino acids, urea, ergosterol, and lipid. They also contain calvacin, a moderately heat- stable mucoid ingredient which effectively inhibits the growth of sarcoma 180 in mice (Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dl er, 1982). Externally it is used as a styptic, and internally it is used to reduc e fever and internal heat. In TCM, it is said to be effective against chronic tonsillitis, and swollen, sore throats, (Ying et al, 1987) and is applied topicall y to stop bleeding in oral hemorrhages and nosebleeds (Bensky & Gamble , 1993). Between 1.5-6 grams of the dried puffball is used as a tea internal ly, or the spore powder is applied externally (Tu, 1988). Pharmacological research in China may support the traditional hemostatic effect of puffball spores. In one study of 467 patients, C. gigantea spores was effective in 98% of the cases in stopping trauma tic hemorrhage after operations. The spores have also shown activity against a variety of pathogenic bacteria in vitro, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus , and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bensky & Gamble, 1993). When preparing the tea, wrap the dried fruiting body in cheesecloth and cook for 20-30 minutes. Procur ement Available from the wild, or some Chinese herb dealers. CALVATIA SPP. Extracts of Calvatia craniformis are active against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and various fungi. For wounds, it is also used in China to promote granulation of tissue, while relieving inflammation, pain, and swelling (Ying et al, 1987). The antibiotic (effective against gram positive bacteria) and antitumor compound, cavatic acid was isolated from the aerobic culture of the mycelium (Umezawa et al, 1975). In Chinese folk-medicine C. gigantea as well as C. lilacina is said to be \"soothing and sweet,\" and is recommended for coughs, hoarseness and sore throats. As with many puffballs , this species is also often used for bleeding of all kinds, for instance, blood in the sputum and nosebleed, but also for hemostasis and C. in pharmac y as Fungus chirur gorum has a reputation of stopping nosebleeds and as a general styptic; Bovista plumbea CIBARIUS FR. CHANTERELLE Cibarius comes from the Latin \"good to eat\" (Lincof f, 1981). C. cibarius is found on the ground near conifers and broadleaf trees. In central and southern California it is often found under oaks, particularly near the edge of pastures (Lincof f, 1981; Arora, 1986). Chanterelles are a beautiful fleshy tubaeform fungi which are bright orangeyellow in color . The common orange-colored chanterelle contains 8 essential amino acids, as well as vitamin A. The frequent consumption of this fungi is beneficial in preventing night blindness, inflammation of the eye (ophtalmia), and dry skin, according to TCM. It also helps tonify the mucous membranes, and may increase resistance against certain infectious diseases of the respiratory tract (Y ing et al, 1987). Studies on mice show ethanol extract of C. cibarius sporophore can inhibit the growth of sarcoma 180 (Y ing et al, 1987). Cantharellus from Esculent Funguses of England by Charles D. Badham, M.D., 1847. Procur ement Abundantly available in some areas of the world, such as the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. Often sold fresh in markets, farmer 's markets, and in Europe, they are available canned and dried. On the menus of some gourmet restaurants. FLAMMULINA VELUTIPES (CURT.:FR.) SING. ENOKIT AKE F. velutipes is a popular edible mushroom in Japan where a tender cultivated form of the wild version is called \"enokitake.\" It is commonly used in Japanese cooking and increasingly can be found in salads in some gourmet restaurants. If taken on a regular basis, Flammulina velutipes may prevent, as well as cure, liver disease and gastroenteric ulcers, according to one Chinese source (Y ing et al, 1987; Y oshioka et al, 1973). F. velutipes contains several types of amino acids including valine, which inhibits the growth of Ehrlich ascities tumour and sarcoma 180 in mice, and lysine, reported to increase body height and weight (Y ing et al, 1987). Polysaccharides of F. velutipes show significant tumor inhibition in mice with sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich carcinoma (Y ing et al, 1987). A polysaccharide fraction from this mushroom produced a tumor inhibition rate of 82% with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day against sarcoma 180 in mice (Y oshioka et al, 1973). F. velutipes contains a cardiotoxic protein (flammutoxin) that is rendered harmless when subjected to heat (100\u00b0C) for a period of 20 minutes. The protein also causes the swelling and respiratory inhibition of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (Lin et al, 1974). I would caution against the chronic use of enokitake raw in salads or other dishes. Procur ement On the menu in Japanese restaurants and some gourmet restaurants. Enokitake is often cultivated. KOMBUCHAAlso called kombucha tea, the tea mushroom, Fungus japonicus, tea kvass, etc., Kombucha is a tough jelly-like \"skin,\" which is really a complex associa tion or symbiosis of yeasts (which are simple fungi) and bacteria. Over the last 50 years, and probably much longer , Kombucha has enjoyed cycles of popularity in many European countries, throughout Asia and the U.S. and is currently experiencing a reawakening of interest, with numerous repor ts in the popular press (i.e., Taking the Fungal- Tea Plunge Newsweek. January 9, 1995) and on television. Kombucha tea can be considered a traditional ferment ed food and the Kombucha \"skin\" is eaten as a dessert delicacy called Nata in the Philippines. As a traditional food and beverage that has been widely used over hundreds of years, Kombucha tea probably has some health benefits, but the fantastic claims that are made for it are undoubtedly overblown. These claims include anti-aging effects, such as restoration of hair and cancer -prevention. A list of other reported uses would place the tea into the realm of the panacea: gout, rheumatism, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, irritability , constipation, mental fatigue, and low sex drive. To my knowledge, no studies exist to support such claims. I consider it simply a healthful (when made properly) and to some, a flavorfu l beverage that is fun to make at home. The social aspect of discussing how our Kombucha is doing, how well it grows on different teas, and sharing the \"offspring\" with friends and even strangers, is an important part of its allure. In 1928 , Herm ann reported on his identification of two bacteria, Bacterium xylinum Brown and B. xylinoides Henneber g (both are now known to be the same organism, Acetobacter aceti subsp. xylinum [Brown] comb, nov.), and (now Gluconobacter oxydans subsp. suboxydans [Kluyver and de Leeuw] comb, nov.), named after its ability to form gluconic acid. Researchers have subsequently determined that Kombucha is a symbiotic association of \"vinegar bacteria,\" mainly A. aceti subsp. xylinum , which produces the pure cellulose mat or pellicle which we associate with the name \"Kombucha,\" Acetobacter ketogenum (sic) Walker and G. oxydans subsp. suboxydans already mentioned, and nest-like masses of yeast cells embedded in the mat, mainly Pichia fermentans Lodder Bacteriology , 8th ed., 1975). It is entirely possible that other bacteria and yeasts are present in a given batch of Kombucha tea, depending on the type of tea used, the temperature, the starting culture , the percentage and type of sugar used, and other factors. When the Kombucha organism is grown on a tea infusion which provides nitrogen, vitamins and minerals, other essential nutritive substances, and sugar , its yeasts proliferate. They transform the sugar into small amounts of alcohol, much of which is ultimately changed to acetic acid (up to 3%) by the bacteria, which also thrive on B vitamins produced by the yeast. This process gives the \"tea\" a sweet and sour smell of fermenting apple cider . The finished tea is reported to contain on average between 0.5 and 1% alcohol, as well as lesser amounts of lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, and oxalic acid (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1973). When black tea is used to make the nutrient solution upon which the organism grows, small amounts of caffeine are present, depending on the brewing method and the caffeine content of the original tea. During the fermentation process, the caffeine is not entirely degraded and is still present in the finished tea (Hermann, 1927). Simple sugar content in the finished product, even when table sucrose is used, is minimal, about 3 %. Reports that the tea contains usnic acid, a lichen acid that has antibiotic properties, is simply not true, and I can find no published chemical analysis of kombucha tea or of the organisms in it that identify glucuronic acid as a constituent or metabolic by-product, despite second-hand reports that they do. If it is prese nt, it occurs in minor amounts. Gluconic acid, which is a major compone nt, is chemically distinct from glucuronic acid and is not used by the liver for detoxification of hormones and toxic compounds as is glucuronic acid (Osol et al, 1955). The infusion of Kombucha is said to have been extremely popular as a folk remedy for thousands of years (Fasching, 1985). The first recorded use of the tea was during the Chinese empire of the Tsim-Dynasty in 221 B.C. (Frank, 1991). It was known as \"The Remedy for Immortality\" or \"The Divine Tsche\". The \"Tsche\" (meaning tea) was said to be introduced in Japan by the Korean doctor Kombu in 414 B.C. (Fasching, 1985). Frank (1991) says the name originate d from the Japanese name for a seaweed, kombu, and from the word \"cha,\" meaning tea. His contention is thatsomeone may have made the culture from kombu tea, and the name was erroneously transferred to the culture. Kombu tea is still sold throughout Japan and is very popular . Subsequently , Kombucha tea came to be used in India, Russia, and other Eastern countries. It is reported that Kombucha enjoyed wide popularity until World War II when black tea and sugar (with which it is grown) became scarce (Fasching, 1985). In the 1960s a German doctor named Sklenar developed a \"biological cancer therapy\" using mainly Kombucha, which he had learned about in Russia during the war . Glucuronic acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid are mentioned with regard to Kombucha' s effect on metabolis m, particularly concerning its \"detoxifying throug h Sklenar theoriz ed that the glucuronic acid causes detoxification, based on its known detoxifying function in the liver. The glucuronic acid forms conjugates with metabolic waste products and harmful substances, such as drugs or poisons, thereby facilitating the detoxification process (Fasching, 1994). This theory has no basis in fact, according to a very thorough search of the scientific literature, but acetic acid and lactic acid may have mild detoxifying effects; they have been widely reported in the literature on fermented foods to retard the growth of harmful bacteria, while promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the intestine. Directions for Making Kombucha A. Pour 34 oz of water into a glass or enamel pan and set on stove. B. As the water is heating up, add 2 oz sugar and stir until dissolved (if honey is being substituted, add it after the tea has reached room temperature). C. When the water boils, remove the pan from the heat and add 1-4 teaspoons or 2-5 teabags (to taste) of either black or green tea. Steep 10-15 minutes. D. If tea leaves have been used, strain through a strainer; if a teabag was used, remove it. E. Let the mixture cool to lukewarm and then pour it into a glass jar or glazed earthenware jar (to make lar ger amounts use a lar geglass cooking bowl or a glass aquarium) (Frank, 1991). Ideally the container should have a wide mouth, and there shouldn' t be too much air space above the liquid. F. Add about 10% Kombucha from the previous batch (if you are making it for the first time, get the extra starter liquid with the culture, or add two tablespoons of boiled vinegar to the tea). G. Place the culture in the liquid, taking care to not break the layer on the upper surface (the smooth, shiny surface should be face up, with the brown, rougher layer underneath). Sometimes the culture floats and sometimes it sinks to the bottom, which may depend on how soft or hard the water is. H. Use cheesecloth to cover the mouth of the container and secure with a rubber band. I. Place in a warm spot (a constant temperature between 64\u00b0 and 78\u00b0 F. is optimum) out of direct light and leave without moving for 8- 10 days.* J. Remove the culture after washing your hands. K. Strain the tea into bottles and store in the refrigerator or in another cool place (Frank suggests not filling the bottle all the way to the top and using corks which can be removed in case pressure should build up). If the cap is tight enough (use an old champagne bottle and tie down the top), the drink can become sparkling, but be cautious when taking the top of f. L. Leave the yeast sediment in the original container , but once a month it should be poured out as well and the container washed with hot water . At this time, wash the culture with cold water and then replace it in the container . M. Keep approximately 10% of the tea in the fermentation container (unless it needs to be washed, in which case it may be poured back in after the container is washed). *Some people contend the tea should be poured off after 6 days in winter and after 3-4 days in summer , when it should be allowed to sit in glass containers for another 3 days before drinking. Frank writes that after 12-14 days, the sugar is completely converted and the taste similar to dry wine\u2014and it is easier to digest at this stage. Also, Russianresearchers have reported that the antibiotic activity found in Kombucha is at its highest peak on the 7th and 8th days (Frank, 1991). There are no clinical trials to support the effectiveness of Kombucha in cases of cancer , although it is being promoted as an \"effective biological cancer therapy .\" After careful studies of the available literature, as well as other obtainable information, the Swiss Society for Oncology and the Swiss Cancer Associa tion have not found data that would support Kombucha' s use in the treatm ent of cancer . After my own thorough search, I must come to the same conclusion, though further studies and experience may prove me wrong. For weakened digestion, Rosina Fasching suggests drinking 1-2 glasses of Kombucha first thing in the morning and after meals at noon and at night. Its taste has been described as thirst-quenching, delicious, and slightly sour. In the 1940s Irion recommended taking about 1/2 cup on an empty stomach in the morning and another 1/2 cup both after lunch and after dinner . A reduc tion in the number of colds has been observed by some people taking the tea as a preventive remedy (Fasching, 1994). Also, because of its reputed purifyin g effects, it is reported to be a good protectant against the daily assault on our bodies from various environmental pollution . Some use kombucha once a year as one would take a spring tonic. During the 1960s the Waischenfelder Apotheke was recommending Kombucha to be taken daily as a preventative and therapeutic remedy for such diverse ailments as the onset of arteriosclerosis, constipation, physical and mental fatigue, low sex drive, and convalescence. Hans Irion, who was then director of the Brunswick Pharmaceutical Academy , also advocated its use for high blood pressure, nervousness, overweight, sports activities, excessive mental activity , and symptoms of aging (Fasching, 1994). Hagers Handbuch (List & H\u00f6rhammer , 1973) states that \"Combucha\" is used as a folk remedy for edema, arteriosclerosis, gout, const ipation, and stones. It is reported that Russian, Japanese, and Indian Kombucha afficionados consume approximately 11 oz per day (Frank, 1991). According to thisdosage, one would drink 3.5 oz 3 times each day, once upon arising, once either before or after the midday meal, and once before going to bed. Note: Smoking in the same room where the Kombucha is growing is reported to cause it to mould or dissolve. Zeller (1924) warned against using alternative mixtures of tea or sugar , as substitutions can disrupt the delicate balance of yeasts and bacteria. The Swiss pharmacist, Bergold, also cautioned against using older fungi, which might be contaminated by various molds. Apparently cultures of dubious origin exist on the market. Although some critics caution against making the beverage at home or drinking Kombucha tea, it is certainly no more difficult than making yogurt or sauerkraut. Preparing food and medicine with our own hands (just make sure they are clean!) certainly has its merits and eliminates the endless environmentally-unfriendly packaging we are constantly having to deal with. As Gunther Frank points out, the making of Kombucha has been successfully handed down from generation to generation by the Chinese for over 2000 years without any sterile lab techniques. Several tests for pathologica l organisms occurring in traditional fermented foods have consistently shown that they are safe (Frank, 1991; Hasseltine & Wang, 1986). Stamets (1994) reports that after experimenting with Kombucha he has observed spontaneous contamination of batches with various green, pink, or black molds. He suggests either throwing the batch out or rinsing a portion of the organism thoroughly with cold water and reintroducin g it into a fresh batch of tea and sugar . He mentions that a firm rubbery texture is a good indicator of whether the Kombucha organism has been degraded by infection from potential pathogens. If the organism falls apart when handled, it is best to discard it. Procur ement: See the Resource Section. LACTARIUS, by waxy gills and brittle flesh that snaps cleanly like a piece of chalk. Chemically , many contain a series of fatty acid esters produced when anunstable sesquiterpene called velutinal is acted on enzymatically after the mushroom is injured in any way. These compounds include the pungent isovelleral and velleral which have strong antibacterial (against Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida utilis) activity , as well as the less active isovellerol and vellerol, and comprise 80-90% of extracts made more than 5 minutes after grinding (Sterner et al, 1985). It is well-known that a number of specie s from these two gener a have a sharp, biting taste when eaten raw. I have observed that the sharp taste develops a few minutes after putting a piece of the fruiting body in the mouth, the exact period depending on the species. Some species only develop a sharp taste after a minute or two. It is also known that many of the species of Lactarius and Russula that are considered poisonous but are rendered edible when well-cooked (McIlvaine, 1973). According to one group of researchers in Sweden (Sterner et al, 1985), the acrid sesquiterpenes break down over time to ones that are much less biting and toxic. As mentioned previously , some Lactarius species have been used for treating tuberculosis, a use that is supported because of the strong antibacterial activity present in these mushrooms. Although we have very little experience with these genera in clinical practice, it woul d seem that for their stimulating and antim icrobial properties, the fungi should be prepared as a tincture about 5-15 minutes after grinding (in a blender) to destroy enzyme s that might break down the active compounds. The resulting prepar ation should have an acrid taste and be used in small amounts (10-25 drops several times daily). With only a few clinical reports from 19th century European medicine and in vitro laboratory tests on its antimicrobial activity to go by, it is still impossible to say much about the effectiveness of these genera in clinical practice. I would also advise caution in the use of these fungi for food or medicine unless they are thoroughly cooked. Procur ement Available only from the wild. MORCHELLA ESCULENTA (L.) PERS. MORELAccording to TCM (Ying et al, 1987) as recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica , Morchella esculenta is sweet in taste, cold in property and non-toxic, tonic to intestines and stomach, reduces phlegm, and regulates the flow of vital energy. Studies show that Morchella esculenta has 7 phyenylalanine, phreonine, and as the sterol brassicasterol (Yokokawa, 1994). Procur ement Available from the Morel PHALLUS IMPUDICUS L.: PERS. STINKHORN The stinkhorn is aptly named. Both the common and Latin epithets have decided significance, for some species erupt from the earth looking ever so much like a slimy-headed malodorous phallus or horn. Other common names include \"wood witch,\" and \"stinking polecat.\" When young, they often are encased in a white skin or \"peridium\" which ruptures as the fruiting body expands. Some are ornamented with nets and some are brightly-colored. The spores are produced in the slimy mass that adheres to the \"head\" of the fruiting body .The stinkhorns have a reputation throughout history as folk-remedies for various ailments, and even Arora, who mentions little about the medicinal qualities of fungi in Mushr oom Demystified says of them, \"They've been used in countless ointments and potions, e.g., as a cure for gout, epilepsy , and gangrenous ulcers. They've been blamed for cancer and prescribed as a sure-fire remedy for it.\" A number of references cite stink horn as an aphrodisiac. Porcher (1854) reports that a western doctor had success with a tincture of the fungus as an antispasmodic to relieve pain during attacks of renal colic. In TCM , the fresh fruiting body is soaked (220 g/500 g of 50 proof liquor) to produce a liquid extract. The preparation is soaked for 10 days and pressed, when it is used for alleviating the pains of rheum atism in the dose of 9-15 grams three times daily (Liu & Bau, 1980). Although stinkh orn preparations take on an aura of the cure-all, there is some clinical experience and scientific interest in the use of it in ointments for the treatment of cancer . According to a translation of an article in a Latvian newspap er, Laiks, June 19, 1993, the stinkhorn has been a Latvian folk remedy for centuries to heal cuts, wounds, gastric ulcers, asthma, rheumatism, gout, and other ailments. It was used for similar purposes in other parts of Europe (Tyler, 1977). In the 17th century , the German physician Karo successfully used it to treat cancer of the internal organs (Townsend Letter , Oct., 1994). In Latvia, Katzen and Gurvich experimented with an ointment made from 25% fresh juice of the stinkhorn mushroom in the 1960s and 1970s for malignant tumors with promising results. Information from Russia about the stinkhorn mushroom ointment states that its scope of application includes wound healing, benign ovarian cystomas, uterine fibroids, as well as ovarian, uterine, and breast cancers (Tauki, 1994). The author states that if the ointment does not produce a result after 1 month, further use is pointless. Recent research being performed in Riga, Latvia at the Latvian Medical Academy on the fermented succus of the stinkhorn has shown one active fraction to be a glucomannan called PI-2. Sterols and phenol-carbolic acids were also identified. In laborato ry tests with animals, the succu s stimulated cytotoxic T-cells, and enhanced the activity of natural killer (NK) cells,demonstrated an anti-stress and adaptogenic activity as well as an antitumor effect with sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and reduced the hemotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent, 5-FU (Kuznetsovs & Jegina, 1993). Studies on the acute toxicity of stinkhorn fermented juice on animals demons trated an LD50 between 1.5 to 50 ml/kg, depending on the species. Chronic administration of the juice did not lead to demonstrable mutagenic, teratogenic, cancerogenic or allergenic effects related species, Phallus rugulosus Fisch. is considered antiinflammatory and is used in Chinese medicine as a scabies remedy (Hanssen & Sch\u00e4dler , 1982), and P. aurantiacus Mont. is used to treat leprosy by Y oruba traditional healers in southwestern Nigeria (T yler, 1977). Procur ement Available from the wild; prepared creams, and liquid products are available in PIPTOPORUS commonly grows on birch in the northern U.S., Europe, and China. The fresh fruiting bodies are eaten by forest rodents, and they are actually quite palatable when fresh and young, with a slight bitter aftertaste. A numb er of constituents have been isolated from this fungus, including polyporenic acid A, B, which are triterpenes, and a acid. Animal studies have shown polyporenic acid A to have antimicrobial and antiphlogi stic activity (Efimenko et al, 1961a), and the fruiting body has demonstra ted an anti- tumor effect (Ying, 1987). Crude RNA isolated from the fruiting bodies of this fungus induced interferon which had a virus-protective effect when injected into mice (Kawecki et al, 1978).Piptoporus betulinus from Text-Book of British Fungi by W . Del isle Hay, 1887. Pentacyclic triterpenes from the fruiting body have demonstrated antineoplastic effects (Wandoka nty & Utzig, 1958). In Poland, the extract was given orally (3 grams/day) to female dogs with Sticker 's tumors of the vagina, which were observed to completely disappear after 5 weeks (Utzig & Samborski, 1957). After roasting until black, the powder was applied to wounds to stop bleeding. Procur ement Not commercially available, but common on birches throughout the eastern U.S., Europe and Asia. POLYPORUS MYLITTAE COOK, ET MASS. Also known as Omphalia lapidescens, this polypore produces sclerotia that weigh up to 40 lbs. It grows in Australia, where it is called \"black- fellow' s bread,\" because of its use as a food by the native Australian people (Arora, 1986). In Asia, it is used in TCM, under the name lei wan, where it is prescribed in the amount of 6-9 grams in decoction as an anthelmintic, often with Semen Arecae catechu to kill tapeworms, hookworms, and roundworms, and for easing pains in the stom ach and intestines associated with worms (Hanssen & Schadler , 1982; Bensky & Gamble, 1986). P. mylittae has also been reported to have aphrodisiac properties (Dragendorf f, 1898).The active ingre dient is thought to be a proteinase, soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. The compound is inactivated by heat and is more effective when extracted in a slightly alkaline watery solution. The enzyme destroys the cell nucleus in worms but is harmless to host tissues (Ying, 1987). An anti-inflamm atory and immunostimulating polysaccharide called S4001 has also been isolated from the fungus (W ang & Zhu, 1989). Procur ement Can be found in the wild in Australia, Asia, Europe, and probably other areas of the world. PYCNOPORUS SANGUINEUS (L.:FR.) MURR. This .) Pil\u00e1t, is popular ly used throughout Asia and is recommended in TCM to lower fever , reduce dampness and swelling, and as an antidote for toxins. The decoction is made by simmering pieces of the fruiting body (9-15 grams daily) in water and is recommended for rheumatism, arthritis, gout, and fungus diseases. Externally , the fine powder is applied on wounds to stop bleeding and prevent infections (Liu & Bau, 1980). It is also said to invigorate the body' s vital energy, activate the blood circulation, and stop itching (Ying et al, 1987). A cultured mycelium filtrate (called polyporin) (Bose, 1946) and an aqueous extract of the fruiting body (Sevilla-Santos, 1964) has been found to be particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus, S. albus, Streptococcus salivarius, aqueous extract also demonstrated in vitro antitumor activity (Sevilla-Santos, 1964). In Malaysia, the fruiting body is used to alleviate pimples and skin ailments when there is a red color , perhaps because of the bright red color of the fungus. In Johore, it is powdered and added to eau de cologne as an application to heal leprous tubercles. The fruiting body is also boiled and used internally as an astringent and applied externally for eczem a. In Java, the reme dy is used to help with symptoms associated with venereal disease and colic. It is extracted in warm oil and applied to knotty swellings (Burkill, 1966).Procur ement Outside of China, this species is only available in the wild. USTILAGO MAYDIS (DC) CORDA CORN SMUT Various species of smuts, which are parasitic fungi, attack rye, barley , wheat, corn, and other grains throughout the world. Smut was known in Europe at least since the 17th century , though Gerard does not mention any therapeutic uses of it. He calls it \"burnt corn\" or \"blasted corn\" and says that it \"is altogether unprofitab le and good for nothing, an enemy unto corne, there is nothing else but blacke dust, which spoileth bread, or whatsoever is made thereof,\" and that \"burnt Rie hath no one good property in phisicke...,\" though it is unclear which kind of smut he was describing. The word \"corn\" seems to enco mpass any of the ears of grain, not simple Zea mays L. Corn Smut fr om , circa 1860. Ustilago had a brief period of popularity among physicians in the U.S., Europe, and Mexico during the last decade of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century for enhancing contractions of the uterus during labor . It was considered similar but weaker (and consequent ly safer) in action to ergot (Wood, 1890; Shoemaker , 1891; Martinez, 1959). Therecommended dose was 1 to 3 droppersful of the fluid extract. The fungus is also used in Mexico as a uterine stimulant (Lozoya, 1976). Corn smut was a favorite remedy of the Homeopaths, who were credited for introducing it into clinical practice. Ellingwood of the Eclectics was also fond of it as a uterine tonic and used it extensively before labor, as well as postpartum to control hemorrhage (Felter & Lloyd, 1898). Other indications in the previously mentioned work include ovarian irritation, ovaritis, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, premature menstruation, metrorrhagia, and uterine catarrh. Ustilago was also said to be useful in \"alopecia (abnormal falling of hair), scalp diseases, with dryness, urticaria, with large, pale welts.\" The recommended dose of the strong tincture was 5 to 30 drops (several times daily). Corn smut is also known in Chinese medicine, perhaps for thousands of years. Eaten in stir-frys, it is said to have a cold energy, and be a tonic to the liver, stomach, and intestines. When eaten regularly , it is thought to cure hepatic and gastroenteric ulcers, as well as having a mild laxative effect (Liu & Bau, 1980; Y ing et al, 1987). Despite its monstrous appearanc e, corn smut is considered a delicacy in Mexico where it is known as cuitlacoche. Rob McCaleb, director and founder of the Herb Research Foundation, first alerted me to its popularity in Mexican cooking at an Iowa herb conference. We were able to locate a small patch of garden corn infec ted with U. maydis with the help of a local herbalist. The fungus upon first appearance seems quite unappetizing. We later stewed the smut with local garden-fresh tomatoes and packed them into corn tortillas. Most of us were pleasantly surprised at the fine flavor , which was like a cross between mushrooms and corn. Corn smut appears to have significant nutritional value, containing sixteen kinds of free amino acids in good quantity (Y ing et al, 1987). A similar species of Corn smut (U. zeae) contains ustilagic acid, which is an antibiotic compound that shows in vitro activity against Candida albicans and other fungi (Windholz et al, 1976). Recently , Ustilago maydis has been reported to have antitumor activity in animal studies, and to improve digestion and alleviate constipation (Y ing et al, 1987). Corn smut produces ustilaginic acid, which is a starting material for artificial musk synthesis (Liu & Bau, 1980).Procur ement Corn smut grows on cultivated corn in many parts of the world . In Mexico it is available dried, canned, and in restaurants. VOLVARIELLA VOLVACEA (BULL.:FR.) SING. STRA W MUSHROOM Commonly called the straw mushroom, this is one of the most widely cultivated edibl e mushrooms in the world. In China, cultivation can be traced back to the early 1800s, and it was probably introduced throughout other Asian countries in the early 1900s. It contains the cardiotoxic proteins, volvatoxin A, A1 and and 24-methylcholesta-7-en-3- methylcholesta-7en-3-01 and -ergostenol (Huang, B. H. et al, 1985). The proteins are heat sensitive, and their toxicity is reduced after the mushrooms are cooked. The V olvariella cardio-active proteins are known to lower blood pressure and inhibit Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (Cochran, 1978). In Asian countries, it is an important source of protein, and one of the easiest of all mushrooms to cultivate, with a crop completed from spawning to harvest in 10 days (Chang & Chiu, 1993). Procur ement The straw mushroom is available in markets and restaurants throughout the world, especially in Asia. The following table lists other species that have been subjected to scientific or clinical research and have a history of traditional use.
