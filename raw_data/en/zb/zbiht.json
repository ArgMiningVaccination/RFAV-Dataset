EXECUTIVE SUMMARY While the age of majority in California is 18 years old, the State has enacted several statutes allowing minors to consent to various services without the authorization of their parents and without disaffirmance upon reaching the majority age. These statutes reflect a policy determination that, in some situations, the minor's interest in obtaining medical care outweighs their parent's interest in preventing them from obtaining that care. Existing statutory exceptions include allowing minors aged 12 and older to consent to mental health treatment and to consent to medical care relating to the treatmen t or prevention of a sexually transmitted disease, including vaccines for hepatitis B and t he human papilloma virus (HPV). ( See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6924, 6926.) This bill expands on those existing laws by authorizing minors aged 12 and over to consent to and re ceive vaccines without parental authorization, provided that the vaccine is approved by the FDA and meets the recommendations of the ACIP. The bill permits any authorized vaccine provider to provide qualified vaccines to a consenting minor aged 12 and up, and clarifies that the vaccine provider may not provide otherwise -unauthorized services along with the vaccine. This bill is sponsored by GENup, MAX the Vax, ProtectUS, and Teens for Vaccines, and supported by many medical professionals' organizations , community organizations ; a coalition of over 80 Indivisible groups and affiliated organizations ; and two individuals . This bill is opposed by nearly 40 organizations , including certain school districts and counties, as well as approximately 3,1 00 individuals. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 2 of 15 PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE LAW Existing law: 1) Defines \"minor\" as an individual under 18 years of age. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6500.) 2) Provides that minors may consent to specified medical treatment without the consent of their parent or guardian1 as fo llows: a) A minor who is 15 years of age or older, living separately from their parent , and managing their own financial affairs including medical or dental care may consent to medical or dental care. i. The minor's parent is not liable for payment for the medical care obtained by the minor under this provision. ii. A physician, surgeon, or dentist may share information about the minor's treatment with the minor's pare nt without the minor's consent if the minor has provided information about their parent's loc ation. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6922.) b) A minor who is 12 years of age or older may consent to mental health treatment or counseling when the mental health professional determines that the minor is mature enough to participate and that the minor poses a danger to them selves or is the victim of incest or child abuse. i. The mental health treatment or counseling shall involve the parent unless the treating professional determines parental involvement is inappropriate. ii. The minor's parent is not liable for payment for the care obtained under this provision, except to the extent the parent participates in the care. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6924.) c) Any minor may consent to medical care related to the prevention or treatment of pregnancy, with the exception of sterilization services. (Fam . Code, \u00a7 6925; American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1997) 16 Cal.4th 307, 314.) d) A minor who is 12 years of age or older may consent to medical care related to the treatment or prevention of a sexually transmitted disease. i. The minor's parent is not liable for medical care obtained under this provision. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6926.) e) A minor who is 12 years of age or older and who is alleged to have been raped may consent to medical care related to the treatment and diagnosis of the condition of, as well as the collection of medical evidence related to, the alleged rape. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6927.) f) Any minor who is alleged to have been sexually assaulted may consent to the treatment and diagnosis of the condition of, as well as the collection of medical evidence relate d to, the alleged sexual assault. 1 Going forward, this analysis will use the term \"parent\" to include both \"parent\" and \" guardian, \" and the plural as well as the singular. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 3 of 15 i. The professional providing medical treatment shall attempt to contact the minor's parent, unless the professional reasonably believes the parent committed the sexual assault. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6928.) g) A minor who is 12 years o f age or older may consent to medical care and counseling relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a drug - or alcohol - related problem. i. The treatment plan shall include the minor' s parent when the treatment professional determines it is appropriate. ii. The minor's parent is not liable for payment for the care provided under this provision, except to the extent the parent is involved in the care. iii. When a minor' s parent determine s that a minor needs treatment for a drug - or alcohol -related problem, the minor's lack of consent does prevent the parent from seeking that treatment for the minor. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6929.) h) A minor who is 12 years of age and who states that they have been injured as a result of intimate partner violence may consent to medical care related to the diagnosis or treatment of the injury, as well as the collection of medical evidence with regard to the alleged intimate partner violence. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6930.) This bill: 1) Authorizes a minor who is 12 years of age or older to consent to a vaccine t hat is approved by the FDA and meets the recommendations of the ACIP without the consent of the minor's parent. 2) Authorizes an authorized vaccine provider to administer a vaccine to a consenting minor as provided in 1). a) \"Authorized vaccine provider\" is defined to include: i. A person licensed pursuant to Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code; ii. A clinic or health facility licensed pursuant to Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code; or iii. Any other provider authorized by the state. 3) States that the bi ll does not authorize a vaccine provider to provide any service that is otherwise outside the vaccine provider's scope or practice. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 4 of 15 COMMENT S 1. Author's comment According to the author: Senate Bill 866 gives young people the autonomy to receive life -saving vaccines by allowing people age 12 and older the ability to consent to vaccination when the vaccine is approved by the [FDA] and meets the recommendations of the [ACIP] . Existing Cali fornia law gives minors 12 and older the autonomy to make critical and even life -saving decisions about their own bodies under certain circumstances. For example, minors 12 and older can consent to receive the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (our most e ffective tool for preventing HPV, which can cause cervical cancer) as well as the hepatitis B vaccine. Yet, minors cannot consent to other vaccines and can only be vaccinated with consent from a parent or guardian. By contrast, various states allow minors to access vaccines without parental consent. For example: Rhode Island (16), South Carolina (16), Oregon (15), Alabama (14) and Washington DC (11). In California, even if a teenager desperately wants a vaccine \u2014 and even if not being vaccinated pre vents a teen from participating in sports, music activities or seeing friends \u2014 a parent can simply refuse to allow the teen to get vaccinated. Parental consent requirements for vaccines are also a barrier in cases where a child is experiencing medical ne glect, or because working or busy parents are not available to take their children to medical visits. Low -income children may experience longer waits to get vaccinated because their parents work longer hours \u2014 often without paid time off \u2014 and can't take t hem to a vaccination site as soon as they are eligible. Additionally, despite advancements in medical treatment and vaccines, deadly and preventable diseases like measles \u2014 once considered eliminated in the U.S. \u2014 continue to be reintroduced in California . This is largely due to rising vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Measles spreads efficiently among unvaccinated youth, whose parents have chosen to block them from receiving a potentially life-saving vaccine. Vaccination misinformation and hesitancy has also led to tragic outcomes during the COVID -19 pandemic. Since early 2020, California has experienced surge after surge of COVID -19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Since March 2020, California has experienced over 6 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 and over 76,000 deaths. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 5 of 15 California law should allow minors age 12 and older to consent to preventative medical care of all types, not only for se xually transmitted infections. Senate Bill 866 does this by permitting minors 12 and over the abili ty to consent to vaccination when the vaccine is approved by the FDA and meets the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC. By doing so, this bill expands the autonomy of young people over 12 already have over their sexual health, and allows them to receive additional life -saving vaccines if they choose. SB 866 protects the rights of youth to make choices about their health, helps keep schools open and safe, and brings us one step closer to ending this horrific pande mic. 2. California law currently allows minors to make certain health care decisions without parental consent \"At common law, minors generally were considered to lack the legal capacity to give valid consent to medical treatment or services, and conseque ntly a parent, guardian, or other legally authorized person generally was required to provide the requisite consent. \"2 This general rule was intended to \"protect the health and welfare of minors, safeguarding them from the potential overreaching of third parties or the improvidence of their own immature decisionmaking, and leaving decisions concerning the minor's medical care in the hands of his or her parents, who were presumed to be in the best position to protect the health of their child. \"3 But parent al autonomy is not absolute. \"Under the doctrine of Parens patriae , the state has a right, indeed, a duty, to protect c hildren. [Citation] State officials may interfere in family matters to safeguard the child's health, educational development and emotiona l well -being. \"4 Over the last 70 years, California has adopted a number of statutes that allow minors to seek medical care in certain situations without parental consent.5 The broadest grant \u2014 in the narrowest circumstance \u2014allows a minor who is 15 years of age or older, does not live with their parent, and is fully financially independent from their parent to consent to virtually all medical and dental care without also needing parental consent.6 This exception has been in place since 1968.7 In addition to this general rule for independent minors, California has several statutes authorizing minors to obtain specific types of medical care without parental consent. 2 American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1997) 16 Cal.4th 307, 314 -315. 3 Id. at p. 315. 4 In re Phillip B. (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 769, 801. 5 American Academy of Pediatric s, supra , 16 Cal.4th at p. 316. 6 Fam. Code, 6922. 7 American Academy of Pediatrics , Cal.4th at p. 316. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 6 of 15 Minors of any age can consent to medical care relating to the treatment or prevention of pregna ncy (except sterilization) and the treatment of injuries foll owing an alleged sexual assault without parental consent.8 Minors 12 years of age or older can consent to mental health treatment or counseling, medical care related to the treatment or preventio n of a sexually transmitted disease, medical care related to the treatment of injuries arising from an alleged rape, medical care and counseling related to a drug - or alcohol -related problem, and medical care related to injuries arising from intimate partn er violence.9 As explained by the California Supreme Court, these statutes \" reflect a long -standing legislative recognition that (1) minors frequently are reluctant to disclose to their parents medical needs arising out of the minor's involvement in sexual activity and may postpone or avoid seeking such care if parental consent is required, and (2) as a consequence, the health of minors generally will be protected best in this setting by authorizing minors to obtain medical care relating to such activity wi thout parental consent.\"10 California is not unique in allowing some minors to consent to a range of medical treatment s. Many states also have minor -consent laws for specific types of care, such as treatment for sexually transmitted diseases,11 mental heal th services,12 and treatment for drug - or alcohol -related problems.13 Other states go further in allowing minors to obtain medical care without parental consent: Ark ansas generally allows any uneman cipated minor who is determined to understand and appreciate the consequences of the medical care to consent to the care;14 Alabama allows minors 14 years of age or older to consent to any authorized medical, dental, or mental health services, except for 8 Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6925, 6928; American Academy at p. 314 (California's constitutional privacy right invalidates statutory requirement of parental consent for a minor terminate a pregnancy ). 9 Fam.

SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 7 of 15 vaccination and abortion ;15 and Oregon allows minors 15 years o f age or older to consent to any authorized medical services, and for minors of any age to obtain birth control.16 3. This bill authorizes minors 12 years of age and over to consent to federally approved vaccinations without parental consent This bill allows minors aged 12 and older to consent to vaccinations that have been approved by the FDA and meet the recommendations of the ACIP. Existing law already permits minors to obtain the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines,17 so this bill will merely expa nd the list of vaccines minors who are 12 years of age or older can obtain without parental consent. The bill authorizes that a vaccine provider may provide any vaccination permitted by this bill and clarifies that the provider may not provide additional s ervices to the minor other than the vaccination.18 As discussed above, the California Supreme Court has approved California's general approach of giving minors control over certain health decisions. There does not appear to be any reason to believe that SB 866 would be treated differently. Some opponents suggest that this bill should be reviewed under the same precedent that applies when the state makes a medical decision for a child,19 but that misunderstands the nature of the bill: SB 866 does not replace the parent's judgment with the judgment of the state, but rather gives the child themselves the right to decide to get vaccinated.20 Some o pponents of the bill also note that the District of Columbia's minor vaccine statute was recently struck down in fed eral district court.21 For a number of reasons, it this district court's opinion is not a clear -cut impediment that should give the Legislature serious pause. For starters, the District's statutory scheme is significantly more intricate than this bill, incl uding provisions that, among other things, require a healthcare provider to leave blank certain portions of a health record for children whose parents have submitted a religious exemption to vaccines.22 The district court held that that provision violated t he parents' right to freely exercise their religion;23 but since SB 866 has no similar provision, that portion of the order has no bearing on this bill. 15 See Ala. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22-8-4, 22-8-11, 26-21-3. The exemption for vaccines was added in November 2021. (See Ala. Act. 2021 -560, \u00a7 1.) 16 Or. Stats. \u00a7 109.640. 17 See Fam. Code, \u00a7 6926. 18 This provision would not prevent a provider from providing other care that a minor can consent to under existing law, of course. 19 See Troxell v. Granville (2000) 530 U.S. 57, 66. 20 According to the sponsors of the bill, medical practitioner guidelines already prevent a provider from vaccinating a person, even a child, against their will. 21 See Booth v. Bowser (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2022) \u2014 F.Supp.3d \u2014, 2022 Id. ) Page 8 of 15 The order also ruled that the District's minor vaccine law was preempted by the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa -1 et seq.) (NCVIA).24 The order concedes that the NCVIA does not expressly preempt state laws authorizing minors to consent to vaccines , nor does it present a field preemption concern.25 Instead, the order rul es that portions of the NCVIA that address materials intended to be given \"to the legal representatives of any child or to any other individual to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine\"26 and determines that this conflicts with the District' s minor vaccine consent law.27 That analysis ignores, however, that states have had statutes authorizing minors to consent to vaccines prior to the enactment of the NCVIA and throughout its 36 -year history.28 The fact that the federal government was content, for 36 years, to allow state law to dictate the age of vaccine consent strongly suggests that Congress did not intend, in language only incidentally addressing the question of children receiving vaccines, to intrude into the traditional state function of regulating the health and safety of its residents.29 For all of the above reasons, it does not appear that there are clear constitutional or precedential barriers to SB 866. At the policy level, many opponents raise concerns that children obtaining vaccin es without parental consent could be harmful because some children might not know they had adverse reactions to vaccines. Committee staff, however, have not received information suggesting that adverse reactions to vaccines are more prevalent than adverse reactions as a result of the other types of medical care a minor can consent to already, or that adverse reactions to vaccines are so prevalent as to warrant additional concern. Additionally, many opponents raise concerns that minors aged twelve and up have a range of maturities and abilities to understand what they are consenting to. For example, A Voice For Choice Advocacy argues, \"[w]hile some 12+ year old minors may be able to make rational, informed decisions, minors of the same age have varying 24 Id. at p. *12. 25 Id. at pp. *8 -9. also determines that the District's law's requirement that the provider create \"alternative\" materials for minors consenting to a vaccine without parental consent gives rise to conflict preemption ( id. at p. 13), but again, because SB 86 6 contains no such requirement, that portion of the order is not relevant here. 28 For example, Alabama's statute authorizing minors aged 14 an d over to consent to all medical care was enacted in the 1970s, but only amended to exclude consent to vaccines in 2021. ( See Ala. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22-8-4, 22-8-11.) This authorization far predates the NVCIA's enactment in 1986. ( See Pub. L. No. 99 -660 (Nov. 14, 1986).) 29 See, e .g., Wyeth v. Lev ine (2009) 555 U.S. 555, 574 (If Congress believed that state law provisions posted an obstacle to labeling requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), \"it surely would have enacted an express preemption provision at some point duri ng the FDCA's 70 -year history\"); see also Medtronic, Inc. v. Hohr (1996) 518 U.S. 470, 485 (\"In all pre -emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has legislated in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear a nd manifest purpose of Congress\" (i nternal quotation marks, alternations, and citation omitted).) SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 9 of 15 levels of maturity. Furthermore, the significant changes in adolescent brains mean 12+ year old minors are, more than any other age, disproportionately swayed by peer pressure, lack of self -regulation and rewards.\" Bill opponent Educate.Advocate also notes that minors with cognitive impairments, intellectual disabilities, or even conditions like anxiety can be particularly susceptible to vaccine programs offering incentives for vaccination or peer pressure to do so . This particular concern appears unique to the C OVID -19 vaccine, given its newness and the statewide push to get people vaccinated; however, going forward, the author may wish to consider amending the bill to add guardrails to protect minors whose ability to consent might be compromised. 4. Arguments in support According to a coalition of over 80 Indivisible groups and affiliated organizations: The COVID -19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the need for wider access to vaccination. This deadly disease has killed more than 76,000 Californians, among more than six million infected. We now have vaccines so effective that unvaccinated people have approximately 20 times higher risk of death from COVID than those who have received full immunization. Yet more than 900,000 California youths age 12 to 17 remain unvaccinated, putting themselves and those they contact at risk. In addition to sickness and death, unvaccinated teens are at risk of disruption of their education and social development. Vaccinating as many people as possible is an essential public health goal as well as an individual need for full participation in society. There are many reasons parents may not act to secure vaccine protection for their children. Misinformation and disinformation contribute to a worrisome extent, but many parents may jus t be overburdened and under -resourced. Whatever the reason, it benefits both individuals and society to provide an alternate path to vaccination. California law already allows teens to consent to medical treatment in situations that involve sexuality or d rug abuse. Vaccination is explicitly part of that provision, but only against venereal diseases. We must also allow young people to protect themselves from threats that are not sexually transmitted. According to the National Youth Law Center, writing in s upport: Despite incredible advancements in medical treatment and vaccines, deadly and preventable diseases like measles \u2014at one time considered eliminated in the U.S. - --continue to be reintroduced in California. Measles spreads efficiently among unvaccinated youth, whose parents have either chosen to block them from receiving a potentially life -saving vaccine or have not been able to consent on their children's behalf. SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 10 of 15 In the context of COVID -19, vaccines are the best way to prevent COVID infectio ns and avoid hospitalizations and deaths. Unvaccinated people are up to 20.8 times more likely to die from COVID -19 than fully vaccinated people. Despite their eligibility and clear evidence demonstrating the efficacy of COVID - 19 vaccines in preventing inf ection and death, 28.6 percent of youth between the ages of 12 -17 remain unvaccinated. This number relates to roughly 905,542 people out of an eligible population of over 3 million... The current consent rules serve as a significant barrier to teen health i n California, in situations where parents and children hold conflicting views about vaccines. Parental consent requirements for vaccines can also be a barrier in cases where a child is experiencing medical neglect, or in situations in which working or othe rwise busy parents are not available to take their children to medical visits. Children may experience longer waits to get vaccinated simply because their parents work longer hours \u2014many without paid time off \u2014and can't take them to a vaccination site as soo n as they are eligible. Allowing minors 12 and older to consent to FDA -approved and ACIP - recommended vaccinations, regardless of the disease or infection in question, is crucial for the safe return of students to K -12 campuses and for the health of Califo rnians at large. Empowering young people with the autonomy to receive life-saving vaccines, regardless of their parents' beliefs, availability, or work schedules, is essential to keeping students in school and for their physical and mental health. 5. Argu ments in opposition According to California Catholic Families 4 Freedom CA, writing in opposition: We strongly oppose the SB866 bill for the following reasons: The prop osed bill would infringe on the sacred parent -child relationship. Neither the state no r medical personnel can replace the guidance and interests of parents. Teens lack the necessary maturity to make sound medical decisions and are generally more vulnerable to coercion than adults. This legislation does not protect children in their need for information that is extensive enough and age appropriate so that they can make a choice regarding the actual medical short and long term risks vs. the benefits of vaccination. If parents are not aware that their child has recently received a vaccine, their ability to properly monitor that child for any side effects is hampered and may cause a delay in timely treatment. SB 866 would allow authorities such as medical practitioners and school personnel to be able to entice, pressure or coerce our children to take the shot, without regard to parental concerns, family medical history, and SB 866 (Wiener ) Page 11 of 15 other medical contraindications, including prior reactions to vaccines that could cause injury and even death. SB 866 would undermine parental consent once again, under existin g law allowing minors to override parental consent for the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmissible diseases, expanding it under Section 6931 of the Family Code, to include vaccines, specifically the new Covid - 19 vaccine, and possibly more in the future, including boosters and new vaccines. SB 866 would authorize a \"vaccine provider\" such as a clinic or licensed heath facility to administer a vaccine to a 12 -year -old child, and up, without parental knowledge or consent. And there is zero liability for the vaccine provider \u2014leaving parents completely responsible for treatment of any injuries from adverse effects! According to the Eagle Forum CA, writing in opposition: On behalf of Eagle Forum CA and its attendees and members we oppose SB 866 because it allows kids to consent to the new COVID injection and the HPV shot without proper guidance, and care of a parent or guardian. Both are procedures with serious risks and children should not be getting these procedures without a parent's knowledge, [or] without a primary care provider showing the insert sheet and reading over the benefits and risks. Any time someone receives a procedure they should be watched and followed to make sure they are doing well afterward. Minors are too young to logically consen t with the complete grasp of the possible long -term ramifications if they are susceptible to an adverse event. Sometimes susceptibility is predictable and sometimes it's not. There are no long -term safety studies on either of these injections and the possi ble ramifications such as infertility, hormone dysfunctions, cancer, and autoimmune issues [ sic]. Basically, we are allowing children to subject themselves to being the test subjects for pharmaceutical companies and taking advantage of their naivety. This should never happen to minors. Minors are called minors because they still need the protection and guidance of loving adults in their lives and this is an adult decision only to be made when fully informed.
