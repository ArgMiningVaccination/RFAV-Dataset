In our modern day lifestyle, many of us have shifted away from this state of balance because we are distracted and often miss the signals of distress. Ayurveda believes that by creating an optimal environment inside and outside our bodies, we can speed up our natural healing process. In Ayurvedic medicine, performing a gentle cleanse periodically, once per month or every three to six months, is considered a healing practice. A simple 7-Day Ayurvedic Cleanse resets our digestive system, rejuvenates the body, and helps to create sustainable weight loss and lasting energy. It is also suitable for pacifying and rebalancing each mind-body constitution to remove Dosha. What is Panchakarma The cleansing procedures of Ayurveda are called Panchakarma. They can greatly help if your body suffers from following problems : congestion, fatigue, poor digestion, insomnia , allergies, skin problems, etc. Panchakarma is a process of cleansing the human body of the toxins that accumulate over time due to over-eating, indigestion and pollution around us in water, air and soil, etc. During these 10 days, try to remain as stress-free as possible and remain calm and relaxed. You will be eating and drinking various foods and beverages for your most prominent dosha. It also helps to do your favourite enjoyable things to do during your detox. Try to read a light fun book, watch inspirational movies, a morning/ evening walk etc. Think of various nature walks you can enjoy, and organize a calm area for meditation/ yoga There are several recipes you will have to prepare ahead of time. These are ghee, and khichdi. You will also be making herbal tea based on your dosha. Flaxseed is also useful during your detox and adds a nutty crunch to any dish. Your eating plan i.e. diet to consume will be based on your dominant dosha. Only eat the foods on the list on the days permitted, and do not overeat. Drinking plenty of water is recommended. The Ayurvedic Detox Cleanse Day 1 Morning Get up and have a warm, not hot shower. When finishing the shower, turn the water to cold and rinse your hands and feet to help ground your energy. Then head to the kitchen to consume 3 tablespoons of warm ghee. If you are Vata, add a dash of salt. If you are kapha, add a pinch of the Ayurvedic remedy trikatu. If you have high cholesterol, high BP or diabetes, eat 2 spoons of flaxseed 15 minutes before you eat breakfast. Breakfast Oatmeal served with water or basmati rice with some coconut milk. Afternoon Enjoy a dosha-supporting meal. If you are Vata, eat fruit as a snack on its own 2 hours after eating. Evening Before your meal, place 1 teaspoon of Triphala powder into a cup and add 1/2 cup of boiling water. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes, then drink warm. It will serve as a mild but nourishing laxative. Enjoy a dosha supporting dinner. If you are Vata, wait 2 hours and then have your fruit for dessert. Go for a walk after your meal. Enjoy some relaxing reading. Don't watch TV or work on the computer for at least 2 hours before you go to sleep. Day 2 Shower, then sit in a comfortable place to meditate for 10 minutes. Do a simple breathing meditation. Try to be focused and relaxed. Eat ghee or flaxseed as on the first day, and breakfast. Eat a dosha supporting meal at lunch and dinner. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. About an hour after dinner, try some simple yoga poses such as Mountain, Tree and the various warrior poses. Head for bed in due time. Day 3 Do the same as Day 1. Day 4 Today you should try some exciting recipes. Take a shower and get ready to cook breakfast. Cook the good old khichdi and eat nothing else for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It should be enough to last the whole day. Drink your herbal or green tea that you like. Have one cup with each meal, and plenty of fresh water throughout the day. Throughout the day, practice mindfulness meditation in whatever way comfortable to you. Go for a walk after your evening meal. At bedtime, try to give yourself a massage for 15 minutes with several ounces of warm essential oil. Vata person should go for sesame oil, pitta for sunflower oil and kapha should go for corn oil. Wait 5 minutes so your skin can absorb the oil. Then take a warm shower or bath with pure unscented liquid Castile soap or glycerine soap, but allow some oil to remain on your skin. After your shower or bath, head to the kitchen. Mix 1 teaspoon of triphala powder with 1/2 cup of boiling water. Drink it warm and head to bed. Day 5 Day 5 is the same as Day 4. If you are lacking in energy, try inhaling some essential oils like Grapefruit or peppermint to uplift your spirit. Day 6 Day 6 is again the same as Day 4, except this time, you can add a couple of vegetables to your khichdi according to your dosha. Add about 10 minutes before the mixture is fully cooked. Do easy yoga poses an hour after dinner. Day 7 The last day of the detox - Vary your vegetables. Instead of yoga, go for a walk. When you get back home, practise breathing meditation for 15 minutes. During your shower today, concentrate on clearing your sinuses. Run the shower as hot as it will go for about 1-2 minutes before you get in, so the bathroom temperature rises. Turn down the temperature until it is warm and shower as usual, but try to blow your nose into your hands several times to clear any congestion. Today you will be using a longevity tonic Rasayana to your day cleanse. Use the Rasayana designed for your dosha. Today you can eat unlimited steamed vegetables for every meal, according to your doshic diet. Do yoga in the evening and enjoy some light reading or movie. Take your Rasayana again before bed. Post Cleanse Having done the 7 day detox, you are probably wondering what's next? Ayurved experts suggest you gradually add more foods to your diet and to take your Rasayana for 30 to 60 days. They also recommend avoiding anything with yeast, try to use oatcakes or rice cakes instead of bread. Continue taking the Triphala for 2 to 3 months after your detox. Continue eating according to your dosha type as much as possible. It may also seem self-indulgent to spend so much time on yourself and doing things you enjoy, like reading, walking, and yoga, but the truth is you can't care for others if you don't take care of yourself first. Invest the time and effort and see what a difference an Ayurvedic detox can make in your life. Ayurvedic detoxes can be fulfilling for your gut, mind & body balance.
