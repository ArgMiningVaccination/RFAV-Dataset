The \"science is still evolving\". Such a call is \"premature\" while high-risk individuals in most of the world have not yet completed a first course of vaccination, Swaminathan said. [Delta coronavirus variant becoming globally dominant, WHO says](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3137965/delta-coronavirus-variant-becoming-globally-dominant-who-chief?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) Data from countries introducing precautionary extra inoculations later this year - particularly for vulnerable people whose immunity to Covid-19 may wane faster - will inform WHO's guidance, she said. Covid-19 booster shots are likely to be rolled out in Britain in the fall to avoid another winter surge. Seven different vaccines are being tested in volunteers in England in the world's first booster study, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last month. The UK, which has inoculated a larger proportion of people than any other major economy, has been forced to delay a planned lifting of coronavirus restrictions amid a resurgence of cases driven by the delta variant. The strain, first reported in India, is the most infectious reported to date. More-transmissible variants, including the beta strain that emerged in South Africa, require higher antibody levels to prevent infection, prompting vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna to test whether tweaked versions of their existing shots will provide broader immunity. One dose of Novavax's variant-directed vaccine may provide sufficient protection against the beta strain in individuals previously immunised against Covid-19, according to preclinical research released this month by scientists at the Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The modified shot also has the potential to provide broad protection against various strains if used as a primary vaccine regimen, said Gregory M. Glenn, Novavax's president of research and development, in a June 11 statement. [Which Covid-19 vaccine is the best? That's a complicated question](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3137619/which-covid-19-vaccine-best-thats-complicated-question?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) So far, the existing US-approved vaccines work well enough to protect against beta, delta and two other strains that the WHO has designated as variants of concern, said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. \"Nobody is saying you need a booster today,\" Collins said in an interview with biologist Lee Hood at the Precision Medicine World Conference on Thursday. \"But boosters might very well be in our future at some point, and they might be here sooner if other variants pop up\" that aren't covered as well by existing vaccines. As a minimum, vaccines will need to protect against hospitalisation, ICU admission and death, according to Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"With that bar, we probably would need a vaccine maybe every three to five years,\" he said in a STAT biotech podcast on Thursday. Immunisation with a combination of vaccinations may offer longer immunity or fewer side effects for certain individuals, Offit said. Early data from Britain, Spain and Germany suggest a \"mix-and-match\" regimen using two different types of vaccines generates more pain, fever and other minor side effects compared with two doses of the same inoculation, the WHO's Swaminathan said. Still, the so-called heterologous prime-boost combinations appear to spur a more robust immune response, leading to both higher levels of virus-blocking antibodies and the white blood cells that kill virus-infected cells, she said.
