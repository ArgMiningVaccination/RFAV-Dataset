I NTRODUCTION 1.1 Objectives of the Guideline The purpose of this guidance is to provide informat ion to assist in the design of an appropriate program of nonclinical studies for the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals. The guidance provides recommendati ons for nonclinical evaluations to support the development of anticancer pharmaceut icals in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced disease and lim ited therapeutic options. This guideline aims to facilitate and accelerate th e development of anticancer pharmaceuticals and to protect patients from unnece ssary adverse effects, while avoiding unnecessary use of animals, in accordance with the 3R principles (reduce/refine/replace), and other resources. As appropriate, the principles described in other I CH guidelines should be considered in the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals. S pecific situations where recommendations for nonclinical testing deviate fro m other guidance are described in this document. 1.2 Background Because malignant tumors are life-threatening, the death rate from these diseases is high, and existing therapies have limited effective ness, it is desirable to provide new, effective anticancer drugs to patients more expedit iously. There have been no internationally accepted objecti ves or recommendations on the design and conduct of nonclinical studies to suppor t the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals in clinical trials for the treatmen t of patients with advanced disease and limited therapeutic options. Nonclinical evalua tions are conducted to: 1) identify the pharmacologic properties of a pharm aceutical; 2) establish a safe initial dose level for the firs t human exposure; and 3) understand the toxicological profile of a pharma ceutical (e.g., identification of target organs, exposure-response relationships, and reversibility). In the development of anticancer drugs, clinical st udies often involve cancer patients whose disease condition is progressive and fatal. I n addition, the dose levels in these clinical studies often are close to or at the adver se effect dose levels. For these reasons, the type, timing and flexibility called fo r in the design of nonclinical studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals can differ from those elements in nonclinical studies for other pharmaceuticals. 1.3 Scope This guideline provides information for pharmaceuti cals that are intended to treat cancer in patients with serious and life threatenin g malignancies. For the purpose of this guideline, this patient population is referred to as patients with advanced cancer. Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 2 The guideline applies to both small molecule and bi otechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (biopharmaceuticals), regardless of the route of administration. This guideline describes the type and timing of nonclini cal studies in relation to the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals in patients with advanced cancer a nd references other guidance as appropriate. It descri bes the minimal considerations for initial clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer wh ose disease is refractory or resistant to available therapy, or where current therapy is not considered to be providing benefit. The nonclinical data to support Phase I and the clinica l Phase I data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase II and into second o r first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. The guideline also describes furth er non-clinical data to be collected during continued clinical development in patients w ith advanced cancer. When an anticancer pharmaceutical is further investigated i n cancer patient populations with long expected survival (e.g., those administered pharmac euticals on a chronic basis to reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer), the recommendati ons for and timing of additional nonclinical studies depend upon the available noncl inical and clinical data and the nature of the toxicities observed. This guideline does not apply to pharmaceuticals in tended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemothera peutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guideline should be fol lowed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guideline, but some of the principl es could be adapted. 1.4 General Principles The development of each new pharmaceutical calls fo r studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans. Modification of \"standard\" nonclinic al testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associat ed with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans. The manufacturing process can change during the cou rse of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclin ical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the a ctive substance to be used in the clinical trials. In general, nonclinical safety studies that are use d to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance wi th Good Laboratory Practices. 2. S TUDIES TO SUPPORT NONCLINICAL EVALUATION 2.1 Pharmacology Prior to Phase I studies, preliminary characterizat ion of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies as well as anti-tumor act ivity of the pharmaceutical should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical nee d not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation. Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 3 These studies can: provide nonclinical proof of principle; guide schedules and dose-escalation schemes; provide information for selection of test species; aid in start dose selection and selection of invest igational biomarkers, where appropriate; and if relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations. Understanding the secondary pharmacodynamic propert ies of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate. 2.2 Safety Pharmacology An assessment of the pharmaceutical's effect on vit al organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous sys tems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in non-rodents ar e generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases wh ere specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant a dditional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described i n ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing. 2.3 Pharmacokinetics The evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameter s (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule and escalation during Phase I studies. Further information on absorption, distr ibution, metabolism and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development. 2.4 General Toxicology The primary objective of Phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase I as sessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxi city (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NO AEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly i nfluenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical sc hedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in Se ction 3.3 and 3.4. Assessment of the potential to recover from toxicit y should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reve rsible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 4 at approximate clinical exposure and recovery canno t be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential. For small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and non- rodents. In certain circumstances, determined case- by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targe ting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat- dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceutica ls, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied. Toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as app ropriate. 2.5 Reproduction Toxicology An embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted t o communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmace uticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these s tudies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatme nt of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicit y studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental to xicity. For small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethalit y or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted. For biopharmaceuticals, an assessment in one pharma cologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropri ate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature a ssessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the bio pharmaceutical, or other factors. A study of fertility and early embryonic developmen t is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information availabl e from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical's effect on reproductive orga ns should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility. A pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. 2.6 Genotoxicity Genotoxicity studies are not considered essential t o support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanc ed cancer. Genotoxicity studies Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 5 should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S 2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticals. I f the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted. 2.7 Carcinogenicity The appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are n ot warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patien ts with advanced cancer. 2.8 Immunotoxicity For most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design com ponents of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immun otoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmaceuticals, a dditional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be inclu ded in the study design. 2.9 Photosafety testing An initial assessment of phototoxic potential shoul d be conducted prior to Phase I, based on photochemical properties of the drug and informa tion on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk , appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafe ty risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provid ed prior to marketing. 3. N ONCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND MARKETING 3.1 Start Dose for First Administration in Humans The goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use . The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available noncli nical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection base d on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecu les, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharm aceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parame ters might be appropriate. For biopharmaceuticals with immune agonistic proper ties, selection of the start dose using a minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) should be considered. 3.2 Dose Escalation and the Highest Dose in a Clini cal Trial In general, the highest dose or exposure tested in the nonclinical studies does not limit the dose-escalation or highest dose investiga ted in a clinical trial in patients with cancer. When a steep dose- or exposure-respons e curve for severe toxicity is observed in nonclinical toxicology studies, or when no preceding marker of severe Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 6 toxicity is available, smaller than usual dose incr ements (fractional increments rather than dose doubling) should be considered. 3.3 Duration and Schedule of Toxicology Studies to Support Initial Clinical Trials In Phase I clinical trials, treatment can continue according to the patient's response, and in this case, a new toxicology study is not cal led for to support continued treatment beyond the duration of the completed toxi cology studies. The design of nonclinical studies should be appropr iately chosen to accommodate different dosing schedules that might be utilized i n initial clinical trials. It is not expected that the exact clinical schedule always wi ll be followed in the toxicological study, but the information provided from the toxici ty studies should be sufficient to support the clinical dose and schedule and to ident ify potential toxicity. For example, one factor that can be considered is the half-life in the test species and the projected (or known) half-life in humans. Other factors could include exposure assessment, toxicity profile, saturation of receptors, etc. Tab le 1 provides examples of nonclinical treatment schedules that are commonly used in antic ancer pharmaceutical development and can be used for small molecules or biopharmaceuticals. In cases where the available toxicology information does not support a change in clinical schedules, an additional toxicology study in a sing le species is usually sufficient. 3.4 Duration of Toxicology Studies to Support Cont inued Clinical Development and Marketing The nonclinical data to support Phase I and the cli nical Phase I data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase II and into second o r first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. In support of continued development of an anticance r pharmaceutical for patients with advanced cancer, results from rep eat dose studies of 3 months' duration following the intended clinical schedule s hould be provided prior to initiating Phase III studies. For most pharmaceuticals intende d for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 mont hs duration are considered sufficient to support marketing. When considering a change in the clinical schedule, an evaluation of the existing clinical data should be conducted to justify such c hange. If the clinical data alone are inadequate to support the change in schedule, the f actors discussed in Section 3.3 above should be considered. 3.5 Combination of Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals planned for use in combination shou ld be well studied individually in toxicology evaluations. Data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. In g eneral, toxicology studies investigating the safety of combinations of pharmac euticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer are not warranted. If the huma n toxicity profile of the pharmaceuticals has been characterized, a nonclinic al study evaluating the combination is not usually warranted. For studies i n which at least one of these compounds is in early stage development (i.e., the human toxicity profile has not been characterized), a pharmacology study to support the rationale for the combination should be provided. This study should provide evide nce of increased activity in the Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 7 absence of a substantial increase in toxicity on th e basis of limited safety endpoints, such as mortality, clinical signs, and body weight. Based on available information, a determination should be made whether or not a dedic ated toxicology study of the combination is warranted. 3.6 Nonclinical Studies to Support Trials in Pediat ric Populations The general paradigm for investigating most antican cer pharmaceuticals in pediatric patients is first to define a relatively safe dose in adult populations and then to assess some fraction of that dose in initial pediatric cli nical studies. The recommendations for nonclinical testing outlined elsewhere in this document also apply for this population. Studies in juvenile animals are not usu ally conducted in order to support inclusion of pediatric populations for the treatmen t of cancer. Conduct of studies in juvenile animals should be considered only when hum an safety data and previous animal studies are considered insufficient for a sa fety evaluation in the intended pediatric age group. 4. O THER CONSIDERATIONS 4.1 Conjugated Products Conjugated products are pharmaceuticals covalently bound to carrier molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars. The safety of the c onjugated material is the primary concern. The safety of the unconjugated material, i ncluding the linker used, can have a more limited evaluation. Stability of the conjuga te in the test species and human plasma should be provided. A toxicokinetic evaluati on should assess both the conjugated and the unconjugated compound after admi nistration of the conjugated material. 4.2 Liposomal Products A complete evaluation of the liposomal product is n ot warranted if the unencapsulated material has been well characterized. As appropriat e, the safety assessment should include a toxicological evaluation of the liposomal product and a limited evaluation of the unencapsulated pharmaceutical and carrier (e.g. , a single arm in a toxicology study). The principle described here might also app ly to other similar carriers. A toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as app ropriate. If possible, such an evaluation should assess both the liposomal product and the fr ee compound after administration of the liposomal product. 4.3 Evaluation of Drug Metabolites In some cases, metabolites that have been identifie d in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabol ites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer. 4.4 Evaluation of Impurities It is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the establi shed limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidelines could be appropr iate for anticancer Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 8 pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be prov ided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being t reated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacolo gic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatmen t, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualificat ion assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration t ested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer . Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with adv anced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified. Table 1: Examples of Treatment Schedules for Antica ncer Pharmaceuticals to Support Initial Clinical Trials Clinical Schedule Examples of Nonclinical Treatment Schedule 1,2,3,4 Once every 3 -4 weeks Single dose Daily for 5 days every 3 weeks Daily for 5 days Daily for 5 -7 days, alternating weeks Daily for 5 -7 days, alternating weeks (2 -dose cycles) Once a week for 3 weeks, 1 week off Once a week for 3 weeks Two or three times a week Two or three times a week for 4 weeks Daily Daily for 4 weeks Weekly Once a week for 4 -5 doses 1 Table 1 describes the dosing Phase. The timing of the toxicity assessment(s) in the non-clinical studies should be scientifically justi fied based on the anticipated toxicity profile and the clinical schedule. For example, bot h a sacrifice shortly after the dosing Phase to examine early toxicity and a later sacrifi ce to examine late onset of toxicity should be considered. 2 For further discussion regarding flexibility in th e relationship of the clinical schedule and the non-clinical toxicity studies, see Section 3.3. 3 The treatment schedules described in the table do not specify recovery periods (see Section 2.4 and Note 1 regarding recovery). 4 The treatment schedules described in this table sh ould be modified as appropriate for molecules with extended pharmacodynamic effects , long half-lives or potential for anaphylactic reactions. In addition, the potential effects of immunogenicity should be considered (see ICH S6). Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceutica ls 9 5. N OTES 1. For nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consi st of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if app ropriate (see Section 2.4). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should b e given for specific omissions. 2. A common approach for many small molecules is to set a start dose at 1/10 the Severely Toxic Dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) in rodents. If the non-rodent is the most appropriate species, then 1/6 the Highest Non-Severely Toxic Dose (HNSTD) is considered an appropriate starting dose. The HNS TD is defined as the highest dose level that does not produce evidence of lethality, life-threatening toxicities or irreversible findings. "}
