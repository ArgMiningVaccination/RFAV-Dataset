Also called biomedicine, conventional medicine, mainstream medicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine. Osteopathic Medicine (DO) Osteopathic physicians differ in the philosophy of medicine learned during their training - a holistic approach that focuses on \"finding health\" rather than only treating illness. Their education also includes extensive additional training on the role of the neuromusculoskeletal system (bones, muscles and nerves) as the foundation upon which the body's overall health depends. Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the body has an innate capacity to fight disease and heal itself. Naturopaths improve health and treat illness by treating the person holistically, tapping a person's own internal body, mid, and spirit resources. Naturopathy comprises a blend of different therapies, all attempting to restore the body to health in the most natural, noninvasive way possible by stimulating the body's own healing powers.
