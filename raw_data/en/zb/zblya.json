As no vaccine is available for COVID-19, the de-velopment of directly acting antiviral agents and preventivestrategies have to be considered. Nature provides a huge res-ervoir of anti-infectious compounds, from which we can de-duce innovative ideas, therapies, and products. Anti-adhesivenatural products interact with the receptor-mediated recog- nition and early interaction of viruses with the host cells, lead- ing to a reduced internalisation of the virus and reduced infec-tions (e.g., procyanidin-B 2-di-O-gallate against influenza and herpes virus). Lignans like podophyllotoxin and bicyclol showstrong antiviral activities against different viruses, and essen-tial oils can directly interact with viral membranes and reducethe host s inflammatory responses (e.g., 1,8-cineol). Echina- ceaextracts stimulate the immune system, and bioavailable alkamides are key players by interacting with immunomodu- lating cannabinoid receptors. COVID-19 and SARS CoV 2i n - fections have, in part, successfully been treated in China bypreparations from traditional Chinese medicine and, while itis too early to draw conclusions, some promising data areavailable. There is huge potential, but intensified research isneeded to develop evidence-based medicines with a clearlydefined chemical profile. Intensified research and develop- ment, and therefore funding, are needed for exploiting na- ture s reservoir against viral infections. Combined action for basic research, chemistry, pharmacognosy, virology, and clin-ical studies, but also supply chain, sustainable sourcing, andeconomic aspects have to be considered. This review calls forintensified innovative science on natural products for the pa-tients and for a healthier world!Challenges at the Time of COVID-19: Opportunities and Innovations in Antivirals from NaturePerspectives 659Hensel A et al.

Published online: 2020-05-20might be meaningful adjuvant approaches, especially in milder forms of such respiratory infections. For example, enveloped viruses (e.g., coronavirus, influenza virus, or RSV) have an envelope of a lipid bilayer derived fromcellular membrane systems of the host cell [1]. These virus enve-lopes are relatively easily attacked by many exogenous com-pounds (e.g., solvents, detergents, lipophilic substances such asessential oils). The lipid layer often also contains (glyco)proteins, which can protrude in an exposed manner [1]. In many cases, these proteins are responsible for the highly specific recognitionof the respective host cells, the associated physical interactions,the subsequent adhesion, and thus ultimately also for the invasionof the virus into the host cell [2]. Well-known examples are thehaemagglutinin of influenza viruses [3] or the S-proteins of coro-naviruses [4]. The typical point of entry for such pathogens viadroplet infection is the nasopharynx. For influenza viruses, the subsequent colonisation of the epithelia is more likely to occur in the bronchial area, whereas COVID-19 infections, for example, be-come manifest by interaction of the viral envelope proteins withcomplementary binding structures in the throat area. Why not consider protecting the mouth and throat area against the penetration of such virus particles? Enveloped virusparticles can be attacked by exoge nous noxae -would it be con- ceivable to achieve a certain degree of protection through a topical treatment of the oral mucosa? In the field of natural substances, we know some drugs that contain large amounts oftannins. This very heterogeneous group of natural substances in-cludes the proanthocyanidins (syn. condensed Lamiaceae tan-nins They all have in common that they interact withproteins and are able to considerably change or inhibit proteinstructure and functionality. Tannins therefore often have nonspe- cific antimicrobial effects but can also inhibit the functionality of viral envelope proteins. Inhibitory effects of condensed tannins orextracts containing tannins on the influenza virus or RSV areknown from several (procyanidin B2-3- that this polyphenol rather specifically inhibits the bind-ing domain of haemagglutinin of the influenza A virus, whichmakes it impossible for the virus particle to adhere to the host cell [7]. Similar effects have also been reported against herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1), where the corresponding adhesion proteins inthe virus envelope could as well be considered as a target [8 -10]. Such proanthocyanidins are quite widespread in the medicinalplant green tea, common sorrel, Cistus spp., Pelargo- nium spp., etc.). Of course, cannot be used as a ther- apeutic agent for manifesting viral infections. In the authors view, it would be quite conceivable to use dosage forms to locally apply concentrated tanning extracts for local application in the oral cav- ity for prophylaxis and as an adjuvant therapy (provided that thereare no risks of interactions). Sorrel prepared as lozenges or chew-ing gums, which contain proanthocyanidins in the highest possi-ble concentration, offer such opportunities. In addition, otherpharmaceutical preparations like gargle and mouthwash solutionscontaining such extracts have been used locally and traditionallyand may offer novel opportunities. One could argue that such prophylactic methods only offer short-term protection as long asthe lozenge is sucked, or the gargle solution is kept in the mouth. However, one can expect that such preparations reduce the path-ogen load in the oral cave and these measures could be used dur-ing a possible exposure or immediately thereafter. There are fur-ther possible points of attack, but this would have to be furthersubstantiated by specific investigations, especially in human vol-unteer studies. Tannins also interact with protein components inthe oral cavity, e.g., salivary proteins and with surface proteins of the mucous membrane epithelia [11]. Everyone is certainly aware of the change in how the mouth feels after ingestion of prepara-tions containing tannins (e.g., long-brewed black tea). In princi-ple, this is due to tannin interactions on and with the epithelialcells, i.e., we slightly tan the buccal and tongue surface easily.The tannins are naturally immobilized on the epithelia, so theyshould be present for a longer period of time and perhaps also re-tarded. Perhaps this could also inhibit an incoming virus from adhering? This remains to be investigated, but there is a good chance that this hypothesis could be correct. In addition, lignans play an important role as potential drug candidates for the development of antiviral compounds. Highlyactive representatives of this natural product class are podophyl-lotoxin, a typical lignan from the group of the arylnaphatelenes,and biclycol, belonging to the uncommon subclass of dibenzocy-clooctenes, which are highly active against HIV and human papil- lomavirus (HPV) in vitro [12]. These natural products have been clinically studied for their antiviral activity against venereal wartsand hepatitis B causing chronic hepatitis B. Podophyllotoxin was found and validated as a potential anti- neoplastic natural product [12]. This lignan has already been men-tioned as a drug against topical venereal warts ( Condyloma acumi- natum ) caused by 1942 [13] in regulated drugs. Podophyllotoxin is also the active ingredient in Condylox liquids and Wartec ointments, registrated for the treat- ment anogenital warts and anogenital warts in immunocompe-tent patients. Bicyclol was shown to have antiviral activity in vitro but also in vivo in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Preliminary studies in mice have started using a combination of bicyclol andheat shock proteins as a potential adjuvant and, in some reports,the wide use in China since 2004 is mentioned [14]. Bicyclol might be active against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well, but contrac- tionary data published do not give full evidence for the safety andefficacy of the drug [15]. The mechanism is still unclear, althoughmodulation of MHC I-mediated cytotoxicity of T cells against virus infected cells is discussed. In the case of HIV-1, lignans have beenshown to inhibit reverse transcriptase activity [16]. al.[16] lignans that the lactone pharmacophore is essential and later, Eich et al. [17] documented that the pattern and number of aro- matic hydroxyl substituents are important for the antiviral activityas well. Besides these two most important lignans, others havebeen studied and tested as well. Some with significant antiviral ac-tivities are listed in Table 1 . Besides tannins, certain essential oils also appear to have anti- viral potential against enveloped viruses [18, 19]. In addition, inthis case, the interaction with viral envelope proteins, which re- duces the docking or uptake of the viruses into the cell, is of par- 660Hensel A et al.

Most of the investigations were performed on herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1/2), but for 1,8-cineol, the main component of eucalyptus oil, protective effects were also ob-served in mice infected with influenza virus C (IFV C) [20]. These effects seem to be mainly caused by a reduction of the inflamma- tory reactions that affect the lungs during pneumonia rather thanby a direct antiviral effect. Some high-quality preparations areavailable in some markets, and there is a huge potential for im-proved and novel products. Furthermore, of course, there are sub-stantial differences in the phytochemical composition and thus inthe biological activity of essential oils. An interesting example inthe current situation is the in vitro activity of laurel oil against SARS CoV. The essential oil from the aerial parts of the laurel tree (Laurus nobilis ) inhibited the replication of the virus in vitro more strongly than other essential oils from other species investigated[18]. Laurel oil contains larger amounts of the monoterpenes 1,8-cineol and -ocimen and the sesquiterpene dehydrocostus lac- tone rich in 1,8-cineol, showed a weakereffect [18]. Inhalative applications of laurel oil would therefore beconceivable here, but its allergenic potential should be consid- ered. In addition to essential oil, sage leaves ( Salvia officinalis L.) contain tannins (depsides), so preparations such as gargle solu-tions could also be applied successfully. So why not investigate and develop novel pharmaceutical preparations at a time of a hardly controllable virus pandemic?Why not simply develop lozenge preparations containing tanninsor essential oils or try appropriate gargling or rinsing solutions?Not as medicines, as in this case we would need official approvals, but simply as a food supplement, albeit with a sound scientific and specifically pharmacological and pharmaceutical basis.In the current situation with a shortfall of surgical masks, there is an urgent need for protection strategies for populations at highrisk such as the elderly, immunocompromised patients, or pa-tients with respiratory disease as well as for personnel in nursing homes, ambulatory care, and hospitals. Placebo-controlled ran- domised clinical trials to assess the efficacy of shelter strategiesusing natural products are ethically problematic to conduct ingroups at high risk for infection. This would mean to withhold apossible effective product in half of the subjects. However, theuse of such preparations in high-risk groups could be accompa-nied by non-interventional observational studies. This could gainat least some knowledge on the feasibility of such a protection strategy using natural products. What about activating a compromised immune system by nat- ural products or medicinal plants? It is primarily our immune sys-tem that protects us from viral infections. As soon as the immunesystem notices a viral infection, it begins to fight the invaders, forexample, with antibodies and proteins that prevent docking andpenetration into the cells [21]. These blocked viruses are then ren-dered harmless by various leukocytes. Host cells that are already infected by viruses begin to produce interferon and release it to neighbouring cells, which slows down the multiplication of vi-ruses. Interferons also attract natural killer (NK) cells detectand eliminate virus-infected cells [22, 23]. Anything that weakensthe immune system, therefore, makes us more susceptible tocolds and viral infections. Also, with advancing age, starting atabout 60 years, the formation of B- and T-lymphocytes is reduced,resulting in a higher susceptibility to infections. It is of special in- terest in the current situation that obesity also obviously impairs the functionality of NK cells [24].Table 1 Lignans tested for antiviral activity.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Therefore, modulation of the immune system may be a prom- ising approach in the prevention of viral infections [25]. However,since the pathology of late-stage SARS is associated with an over-reaction of the immune system and a cytokine storm with symp-toms of sepsis [26, 27], only stimulating the immune system mayalso be a risk. There are many natural products and medicinal plants that are supposed to modulate immune functions [28, 29]. Preparations from Echinacea species are probably most widely used and best in- vestigated. They have traditionally been used against sepsis andhave shown direct antiviral effects under in vitro conditions, and also modulatory effects on macrophages and NK cells [30 -33]. Some of them have been clinically effective in the preventionand treatment of viral infections [34 -36]. There has also been in- tensive research on the active principles. Alkamides seem to play amajor role. They are readily bioavailable and bind to cannabinoid receptors, which are the key to stimulating the immune system [37, 38]. Therefore, Echinacea is an excellent example of how nat- ural product research from bench to bedside can create a lot ofscientific evidence for the usefulness of herbal medicine in viral in-fections. There are many more such plants used in global ethno-medicine that still wait for evaluation. Globally, local and traditional medicines remain a major source of health care [39]. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has already played an important role treating SARS CoV and SARS- CoV2 infections. During the first SARS epidemic in Guangdong, allpatients received Chinese medicine treatments over differentstages of the disease in addition to biomedical treatments. Themost commonly used formulations were San Ren Tang, Yin Qiao San, Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang, Gan Lu Xiao Du Dan ,a n d Qing Ying Tang , containing mixtures of many different herbs. In Hong Kong, a combination of Sang Ju Yin and Yu Ping Feng San , plus two other have been used with success to protect high-risk hospital workers against Sars-CoV infection [40]. According to asurvey from 2007 [41], during the first SARS CoV crisis in China, 40 to 60% of the infected patients received Chinese medicinetreatment on top of standard modern medicine treatment atsome stages of the disease. The results indicate positive but in-conclusive indications about the efficacy of the combined treat- ments using Chinese medicine as an adjuvant [41]. Evaluation of the published literature within this study for the observed positiveeffects point to better control of fever, quicker clearance of chestinfection, lesser consumption of steroids, and relief of othersymptoms [41]. On the other side, many more clinical studieshave to be performed with Chinese medicinal preparations as anadjuvant to provide adequate evidence-based therapeutic con-cepts. During the recent SARS CoV 2 infections, TCM has been again widely applied in China. According to a recent report, more than85% of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have received TCM treat- ment in China [42]. The used formulations and natural productshave been recently reviewed [42]. In one survey, Luo J. Sm. were the ten most commonly used Chinese medicinal plants in thetreatment of COVID-19. Yang et al. [42] concluded that moreand better controlled clinical studies are needed to evaluate theefficacy of TCM in the treatment of SARS CoV. In addition, stan- dardised products should be used rather than self-prepared for- mulations. They also recommended that the safety of TCM treat- ment should be evaluated. It shows that there is huge potential,but a lot of basic and clinical research is still needed to understandthe mechanisms of action in order to end up in evidence-basedmedicine. Importantly, the underlying philosophical concepts dif-fer [44] and it is certainly difficult to assess many of these ap-proaches in bioscientific terms. At the same time, it would benegligent to just ignore this large body of scholarship and, more importantly, the widespread use of preparations derived from, in this case, TCM. There is a tremendous research agenda with whichwe need to engage, and this will be a core task for research to de-velop novel therapeutic approaches. Medicinal plants and natural products provide a huge potential to fight against pathogens! During evolution, plants and also oth-er organisms have developed excellent and highly efficient de-fence mechanisms and antipathogenic defence compounds. We should strengthen activities to explore and to develop this poten- tial. This needs more and intensified science for pinpointing theactive medicinal plants, identifying active compounds, and inves-tigating potential synergistic effects when dealing with complexmixtures. We also have to explore the chemistry behind the activeingredients. We have to develop sustainable technology for effi-cient production (not only milligrams are needed, but economi-cally relevant amounts at affordable prices), and we have to ini- tiate preclinical, toxicological, and clinical trials. There is definitely a long way to a more evidence-based phytotherapy or integrationof highly active natural products into clinical practice. Key players should not be individual scientists in their \"ivory tower \", but much more coordinated consortia including biolo- gists, pharmacognosists, natural product chemists, syntheticchemists, toxicologists, clinicians, and governmental officers.Nature provides us with a huge reservoir of great antipathogenic resources, we just have to raise this treasure [45]. It is worth a try. We also want to caution against the increasing drive for exotic medicines and supplements, often with high-level claims and alow level of evidence. Numerous products are advocated, andthere can be no doubt that there is a need to develop novel prod-ucts, but there can be no quick fix solution without a detailed sci-entific investigation of the quality, safety, pharmacological ef-fects, and therapeutic benefits. We also have to urgently develop research on medicinal plant production and the respective sourcing. Initial evidence points toan increase in the demand of many popular herbal substances.Medicinal plants such as Echinacea (see above) are seeing a dra- matic rise in demand, but this cannot be met with the existingsupply systems. This raises important questions about the integ-rity of the value chains relevant for the production of such healthcare products. The challenges are multiple, from an increased de- mand on the consumer side to problems related to the health of 662Hensel A et al.

Not only the breeding and produc-tion of the materia prima, but also the supply with authentic high-quality finished products will need much more attention asa consequence of this global challenge. Let us start working -for an innovative science, for the pa- tients, and for a healthier world. Clearly it is also essential thatadequate funding is made available to ascertain that the potential of natural products and herbal medical products is explored in greater detail.
