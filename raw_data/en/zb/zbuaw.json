Program Descripti on The Healthy Communities Grant Program was launched in 2003 and supports EPA's mission by integrating many EPA New England programs including Air Quality Outreach, Asthma and Indoor Air, Children's Environmental Health , Clean, Green and Healthy Schools I nitiative, Energy Efficiency Program, Pollution Prevention, Sustainable Materials Management, Toxics and Pesticides, Urban Environmental Program, and Water Infrastructure (Stormwater, Wastewater, and Drinking Water). The goal of the program is to combine available resources and best identify competitive projects that will achieve measurable environmental and public health results in communities across New England. Eligible applicants are invited to apply to EPA New England for funding consideration under this competitive grant program . The Healthy Communities Grant Program anticipates awarding approximately 15 cooperative agreements from these project application s in 20 22. The Healthy Communities Grant Program is EPA New England's main grant program to work directly with communities to reduce environmental risks to protect and improve human health and the quality of life, advance resilience, and preserve/restore important ecosystems. The Healthy Communities Grant Program will achieve these go als through identifying and funding projects that: Target resources to benefit communities at risk [areas needing to create community resilience, environmental justice areas of potential concern, and/or sensitive populations (e.g., children, elderly, tr ibes, urban and rural residents, and others at increased risk)]. Assess, understand, and reduce environmental and human health risks. Increase collaboration through partnerships and community -based projects. Build institutional and community capacity to understand and solve environmental and human health problems. Achieve measurable environmental and human health benefits. 3 The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is to protect human health and to safeguard the natural envir onment (air, water, and land) upon which life depends. EPA's purpose is to ensure that: All Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work. National efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available scientific information. Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are enforced fairly and effectively. Environmental protection is an integral consideration in U.S. policies concerning natural resou rces, human health, economic growth, energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy. All parts of society (e.g., communities, individuals, business es, state and local governments, tribal governments) have access to accurate information to effectively participate in managing human health and environmental risks. Environmental protection contributes to making our communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable and economically productive. The United States plays a leadership role in working with other nations to protect the global environment. EPA New England takes these broad goals and applies them directly to service the needs of New England resi dents in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont , and federally recognized tribes in New England. Within the broad landscape of these states and tribes, EPA New England recognizes that not all communities share the same env ironmental and public health conditions. For example, in urban, rural , and environmental justice communities throughout New England, residents are exposed to a multitude of environmental and public health hazards, ranging from lead in paint, soil , and dri nking water to rats on vacant lots to asthma aggravated by poor indoor and ambient air quality. Another concern is the ability in New England to successfully manage large -scale water quality problems on a watershed basis when governance institutions are based on home rule and local control. All communities need to plan for and address community resiliency to prepare and adapt to extreme weather events (e.g. , flooding, drought, hot and cold temperature extremes) and climate change . Cumulative environmen tal impacts are difficult to assess and address because of limited data, independent planning across state and municipal jurisdictions, and limited capacity to implement integrated projects. Measures that would positively affect water quality consideratio ns are challenged by the lack of common goals and an effective platform to measure program effectiveness and track improvements. Cumulatively, the effects of these hazards on urban residents and other sensitive populations such as children, the elderly an d tribal populations are compounded by issues including environmental injustice, limited economic development opportunities, and social ills. Some suburban and rural communities also face significant risks from industrial, commercial, agricultural or tran sportation activities in or near their communities. These types of conditions result in disproportionate health risks to residents and stress on the quality of the air, water, and land. To maximize effectiveness and resources, many EPA New England progra ms are working in partnership to improve environmental conditions for residents across New England. EPA New England's Air Quality Outreach , Asthma and Indoor Air, Children's Environmental Health and Clean, Green and Healthy Schools Initiative, Energy Effi ciency, Pollution Prevention, Sustainable Materials Management, Toxics and Pesticides, Tribal, Urban Environmental Program, and Water Infrastructure Programs (Stormwater, Wastewater, and Drinking Water) are working together to competitively identify projects that will achieve measurable environmental and public health results in Target Investment Areas and Target Program Areas across New England (see Section I, B, 4 Target Investment Areas & Target Program Areas, for more details). These participating programs share a focus on preventing and reducing environmental and hu man health risks and/or advancing ecosystem resilience. Staff and leadership from each of these programs will jointly review and select projects for funding using the criteria listed in Section V of this announcement. Please read the descriptions below to learn more about each participating program. More information on each participating program's activities, projects, and accomplishments is available at www.epa.gov/region01 . Air Quality Outreach: The Air Quality Outreach program aims to increase public awareness of air quality issues so that people can take steps to protect their health and reduce their contribution to air pollution. For example, EPA works with state air agencies to provide real -time air pollution levels, as well as forecasts, to warn residents of poor air quality in their area. EPA also works with states to mitigate wood smoke pollution by promoting measures that individuals can take to reduce emissions from residential wood burning . These measures include encouraging the change -out of old wood burning appliances for newer, more efficient models and tips for better burning practices that result in more efficient use of wood, lower emissions, and safer burning. Asthma and Indoor Air: The Asthma Program supports asthma and healthy environmental interventions that promote the management of asthma and the reduction of asthma triggers and other indoor air pollutants, assists with the training of asthmatics, their fa milies, and healthcare professionals on asthma trigger management and the effectiveness of comprehensive asthma management programs . In addition, the Asthma Program promotes healthy homes training opportunities; encourages the support and development of sustainable home intervention programs; promotes sustainable financing for home intervention programs; and promotes awareness of primary prevention for asthma. Collaboration among stakeholders is encouraged if it provides a means to reduce the burden of as thma on a regional level. Children's Environmental Health Program: The Children's Environmental Health Program has the fundamental goal to ensure that all EPA actions and programs address the unique vulnerabilities of children and to support projects and activities that have a durable impact to protect children's environmental health across many stakeholders, inclu ding the intersection of children's health and climate change and environmental justice. Clean, Green and Healthy Schools Initiative: Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Title IV, Subtitle E, Healthy High -Performance Schools, the Clea n, Green and Healthy Schools Initiative is integrated across all EPA programs to address children's environmental health at K -12 schools and to improve school environmental health through EPA resources, including the EPA School Siting Guidelines and EPA St ate School Environmental Health Guidelines, such as Tools for Schools. Energy Efficiency Program: Energy Star is a joint program of the EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE) that has worked with residents and businesses to reduce air pollution through energy efficiency since 1992. This partnership program delivered $24 billion in savings in 2012 alone. Pollution Prevention: The Pollution Prevention Program is designed to provide technical assistance to businesses and their facilities to help them de velop and adopt source reduction practices. Pollution Prevention includes any practice that reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant from entering any waste stream or otherwise being released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment or disposal. Pollution prevention techniques aim to reduce the amount and/or toxicity of pollutants or contaminants entering the environment, to reduce the use of water, energy and other raw 5 materials and to lower business costs. These practices reduce hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants. Sustainable Materials Management : Sustainable materials management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire life cycle to find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources and reduce cost. In 2022, the New England SMM program has three priority areas: the built environment, sustainable food management, and sustainable packaging. The built environment focus is to conserve materials and develop community resiliency to climate change through constructi on, maintenance, and end -of-life management of roads, buildings, and infrastructure. The s ustainable management of food seeks to reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufactu ring, sales, consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final disposal. Sustainable packing looks to increase the quantity and quality of materials recovered from municipal solid waste and develop critically important collection and processing infrastructure. EPA's 2021 National Recycling Strategy is a critical effort in work to build a circular economy for all. Learn more about it here: https://www.epa.gov/recyclingstrategy . Toxics and Pes ticides: The Toxics Program regulates and provides oversight over a variety of different toxic chemicals (e.g., lead, asbestos, mercury, PCBs, etc.) regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The Pesticides Program regulates and provides ov ersight over registration and use of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Urban Environmental Program: The Urban Environmental Program has worked since 1995 to facilitate partnership development with communities, government and other stakeholders to address environmental and public health problems including lead poisoning, asthma and indoor air quality, a mbient air quality, open space and green space, vacant lots, environmental justice, and urban rivers and wetlands in targeted New England urban areas across Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Water Infrastructure Program (Stormwater, Wastew ater, and Drinking Water): The Water Program works with regulated entities including municipalities, wastewater systems, and drinking water systems to protect the environment and public health. Through regulations, technical assistance, outreach, funding , and training, EPA's Water Program works with federal, state and local partners to sustain the adequacy and integrity of water infrastructure in communities throughout New England. Particular emphasis has been placed on working with communities to assess vulnerabilities and adapt stormwater, wastewater, and drinking water infrastructure to ensure these critical services will be maintained, even in extreme weather events. An additional focus is working locally in partnerships with water utilities to identi fy private lead pipes and other contaminant threats, and build capacity to apply for and manage state and federal funds for mitigation. Statutory Authority The Healthy Communities Grant Program consists of activities authorized under one or more of the following EPA grant authorities listed under Clean Air Act, Section 103(b)(3); Clean Water Act, Section 104(b)(3); Safe Drinking Water Act, Sections 1442(a) and (c); Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, Section 20; Solid Waste Disposal Act, Sec tion 8001; Toxic Substances Control Act, Section 10; Marine Protection, Research, & Sanctuaries Act, Section 203; Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act; and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Sections 311(b) & (c).

The Healthy Communities Grant Program seeks to fund projects that are in and/or directly benefit one or more of the Target Investment Areas of Areas Needing to Create Community Resilience, Environmental Justice Areas of Potential Concern, and/or Sensitive Populations in one or more of the EPA New England States of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, R hode Island, Vermont and/or tribal lands. Every application must clearly identify and explain how the project will link to one or more of the Target Investment Areas listed and described below. Target Investment Areas: Areas Needing to Create Community Resilience, Environmental Justice Areas of Potential Concern, and Sensitive Populations a. Areas Needing to Create Community Resilience : For purposes of this grant program, \"Areas Needing to Create Community Resilience\" include areas that are located withi n the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 500 or 100 -year flood zones and United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Hurricane Inundation Zones, or other areas that have been designated as having a risk of flooding through local, state or federal studies. Areas may also be designated as needing to create community resilience and prepare for extreme weather events based on past impacts experienced or if it is an area with high levels of impervious cover, stormwater runoff, and/or has experienced c ontamination from bacteria, nutrients, and/or other pollutants of concern (e.g., sediment, heavy metals, 7 phosphorus, nitrogen, etc.) that is negatively impacting, or expected to impact local water quality (e.g., rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands, etc.). To qualify under this Target Investment Area, applicants must demonstrate that their project will directly involve and/or benefit an area at risk from extreme weather impacts as described above. b. Environmental Justice Areas of Potential Concern: For the purposes of this grant program, \"Environmental Justice Areas of Potential Concern\" refers to communities, neighborhoods, geographic areas or tribes in New England that potentially have been disproportionately affected by environmental and/or public health burdens in a defined geographic area. EPA New England is committed to promoting and supporting Environmental Justice which is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with re spect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no group of people, including any racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group, should bear a disproportionate share of the neg ative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs and policies. \"Meaningful Involvement\" means that: (1) potentially affected community residents have an appropriate opportunity to participate in decisions about a proposed activity that will affect their environment and/or health; (2) the public's contribution can influence the regulatory agency's decision; (3) the concerns of all participants invo lved will be considered in the decision -making process; and (4) the decision -makers seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected. To qualify under this Target Investment Area, applicants must provide a description of the character istics of the population and challenges facing the community, neighborhood, or tribe benefitting from the proposed activity, an identification of the potential environmental and health burdens experienced, and an explanation of how the proposed project wil l address the identified burdens to demonstrate that their project will provide fair treatment and meaningful involvement to members of communities, neighborhoods, or tribes in New England that potentially have been disproportionately affected by environme ntal and health burdens. c. Sensitive Populations: For the purposes of this grant program, \"Sensitive Populations\" refers to populations including infants, children and/or others at increased risk that are more susceptible to the effects of pollution and/or places where sensitive populations are located or spend significant time (e.g., homes, schools, day cares, etc.). EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment. However, health -based environmental standards are generally based on risks to h ealthy adult males, not sensitive populations. Infants and children are more susceptible to the effects of pollution because pound -for-pound, they eat, drink and breathe more than adults and their brains and nervous systems are still growing and developing . Tribal members may be more susceptible to risks because of traditional cultural practices and traditions including, but not limited to fishing and hunting practices and potential exposure to many sources of environmental pollution on tribal lands. To qua lify under this Target Investment Area, applicants must clearly describe how the proposed project will clearly benefit and help protect sensitive populations to reduce and/or minimize exposure to environment and/or public health risks. Every application must clearly identify how the proposed project will achieve measurable environmental and/or public health results in one or more of the Target Program Areas described below.

Sustainable Materials Management: Projects that advance the sustainable use of materials to minimize waste and environmental impacts. These projects should support the SMM priorities of supporting the development of a circular economy, preventing food loss and waste through source reduction and/or food rescue, decreasing plastics and packaging usage, or conserving materials and/or developing community resiliency to climate change thro ugh improvements to construction, maintenance, and end -of-life management of our nation's roads, buildings, and infrastructure. Please note that under this announcement, federal funds may not be used to purchase recycling program infrastructure such as co llection bins and trucks. Project Examples: Develop and implement a program to promote deconstruction over mechanical demolition. Develop and implement a training program for contractors to become certified deconstruction contractors. Host a workforce development training program for deconstruction workers. Support market development for salvaged construction materials. Projects that prioritize actions organizations can take to prevent and divert wasted food based on the Food Recovery Hierarchy. Each tier of the Food Recovery Hierarchy focuses on different management strategies for wasted food. The top tiers of the hierarchy are the best ways to prevent and divert wasted food because they create the most benefit for the environment, society, and the economy. Develop a project to increa se public awareness of the environmental, social, and economic benefits of reducing wasted food. Conduct a technical assistance project by reducing, diverting, or minimizing wasted food and other recyclable commodities in a business and/or institution util izing EPA's food recovery hierarchy (source reduction, feed the people, feed the animals, industrial uses, composting). Focus would be on a geographic area (e.g., community, state, municipality, etc.). Design and conduct an education and outreach campaign to increase diversion of food and/or solid waste from disposal and increase recycling rates in a community or defined geographic area (e.g., environmental justice area of potential concern, urban, rural, etc.). Develop methods to reduce the generation of packaging waste. Distribute information to public or private buyers of materials or products about buying packaging products with recycled content. Develop methods to improve market information and/or connection between markets (e.g., differ ent geographic locations or industries) for recovered packaging products. Address known problems and knowledge gaps in relation to plastic packaging (including flexible film) working with project partners and actors from across the supply chain. Research packaging design innovation, including design for reuse. Investigate or test process innovations, e.g., reusable packaging systems, zero packaging, behavioral change. 14 Output Examples: Pounds of material (municipal solid waste) being diverted, reused, recycled or composted. Pounds of food recovered through projects with schools, businesses and institutions aimed at reducing food waste, diverting food from disposal and encouraging food donations. Metric tons of greenhouse gas eliminated (calculated via the Waste Reduction Model ).

Each application will be rated under a points system, with a total of 100 points possible. An average score will be calculated for each application and then it will be ranked accordingly. The Selection Official will receive a list of t he highest ranked applications. Limited funding is available for qualified projects. EPA New England expects to receive many applications, and it will not be possible to fund all applications received. EPA New England reserves the right to reject all ap plications and make no grant awards under this announcement . 26 C. Other Factors Final funding decisions will be made by the Selection Official based on the ranking but may also consider other factors including funding availability, geographic diversity of funds, programmatic priorities. Once final decisions have been made, a funding recommendation will be developed and forwarded to the EPA award official. SECTION VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION A. Award Notification EPA anticipates notification to successful applicants will be made via telephone and/or email by July 31, 202 2. The notification will be sent to the original signer of the application, or the project contact listed in the application . This notification, which informs the applicant that its application has been selected and is being recommended for award, is not an authorization to begin work. The successful applicant may need to prepare and submit additional documents and forms (e.g., work plan), which must be approved by EPA, before the grant can officially be awarded. The official notification of an award wil l be made by EPA Region 1's Award Official. Applicants are cautioned that only a grants officer is authorized to bind the Government to the expenditure of funds; selection does not guarantee an award will be made. For example, statutory authorization, fu nding or other issues discovered during the award process may affect the ability of EPA to make an award to an applicant. The award notice, signed by an EPA grants officer, is the authorizing document and will be provided through electronic or postal mail . The time between notification of selection and award of a grant can take up to 90 days or longer . B. Combining Applications into One Award If an applicant submits applications for multiple tasks/ activities under this competition, and is selected for multiple tasks/activities, EPA may award a single assistance agreement that combines separate applications for different tasks/activities. C. Reporting All recipients must attend an information session for new recipients and submit quarterl y reports and a final report for EPA Project Officer approval. Specific reporting requirements (e.g., Final Technical Report and Financial Status Report) will be described in the award agreement. EPA will collect, evaluate, and disseminate recipients' final reports to serve as model programs.
