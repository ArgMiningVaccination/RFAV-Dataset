Since 1984 more women have died from cardiovascular disease than men. Healthy lifestyle changes can reduce our risk of heart disease by as much as 80%, which means we have more control over heart disease than we think! The Cardiopulmonary Science department (CPS) dedicated the entire month of February 2015 to heart health within the School of Allied Health Professions (SAHP). The month included weekly activities, seminars and demonstrations. The goal? An interactive heart health awareness campaign for students, staff and faculty. The outcome? Success! Heart Health month kicked off with a \"Selfie\" wall in the CPS hallway. Students, staff and faculty were encouraged to snap shots while wearing red. The craziest red outfits posted to Instagram were awarded prizes such as water bottles, wristbands and personal training sessions at the Drayson Center. SAHP staff and faculty also posed for a \"Go Red\" portrait in front of Nichol Hall. National Red Day was celebrated in the halls of CPS with decorations, balloons, heart-healthy snacks and information handouts. Staff and faculty were treated to a heart-healthy lunch made by Chef Cory Gheen during Faculty Forum.REDUCE HEART DISEASE BY 80% WITH A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.Several lectures were organized during Heart Health month. Dr. Hildemar Dos Santos spoke on Tuesday for Lunch Power and concentrated on healthy eating and the importance of grains.

I started as an emergency medical technician and firefighter before moving up the rank as a paramedic, critical care paramedic (CCEMTP) and then physician assistant (PA-C). I have a Bachelor of Sciences in Emergency Health Services from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and a Masters of Medical Science from Saint Francis University. From 2011 to 2015, I lived and worked in Australia as an academic, researcher and paramedic working for Charles Sturt University, Central Queensland University and New South Wales Ambulance teaching pharmacology, clinical science and critical care. My area of expertise is pharmacology and I'm most known for producing the first emergency and paramedic focused pharmacology reference text and then reference App in Australia (Emergency & Paramedic Pharmacology Guidelines or EPGuidelines) and presenting conference topics in pharmacology throughout Australia. I've spent the last five years in academia, but this is my first year with LLU. Dr. Richard Nelson, BSRC, MD, RRT-NPS, RCP, is currently under contract as Professor, Office of the Dean, serving as Director for Loma Linda University in Saudi Arabia. He is also Assistant Professor of Cardiopulmonary Sciences. Dr. Nelson will become the Program Director for the BS Respiratory Care entry level program effective from Winter Term, 2015-2016, when David Stanton retires. He has been a pioneer in international allied health education and has served overseas for more than 20 years including speaker/ coordinator for programs in 26 countries. Dr. Nelson has been a faculty member of Loma Linda University for 27 years. Prior to that, he worked at St. Helena Hospital, Loma Linda University Medical Center and medical centers in the Middle East. He is married to Dr. Anna Nelson, MPH Program Director. They have four boys. Personal interests include explorations, SCUBA, boating and humanitarian projects. NEW ON THE TEAM? Your Risk seminar. The seminar focused on cardiac risk factors and was presented twice - once in Nichol Hall and a second time alongside Dr. Anthony Hilliard, LLUMC cardiologist, at Martha Green's Restaurant in Redlands. Events throughout Heart Health month were unique and inspirational. The Heart Healthy Cooking Demo allowed students to prepare delectable, healthy recipes first-hand with a thorough demonstration led by Chef Cory. At the Drayson Center, Charles Rollins lead two intense fitness contests: Burpee Your Heart OUT! and Planking Perfectionist. The winner of the burpee contest received a free month of Cross Training with Charles Rollins Fitness, and the winner of the planking contest won a FitBit Flex. In addition, The Camp Transformation Center located in Redlands, organized a Fitness After Dark - ALL Heart event, which raised $1,000 for American Heart Association's Go Red campaign. Heart Health month ended on a high note with the Red Cross Blood Drive, which successfully acquired 49 blood donations. To put that number in perspective, one person is capable of donating enough blood to save the lives of three individuals. That means, with 49 blood donations, nearly 150 people have the potential to receive life-saving blood. The power of giving is truly amazing! Perhaps the most exciting event during Heart Health month was the Flash Mob Heart Compression Demo. CPS faculty collaborated with Life Support Education, American Medical Response, American Heart Association, Loma Linda Fire, Colton Fire and countless SAHP student and faculty volunteers, to encourage students who were already BLS certified, to learn \"quality\" heart compressions. Students exited chapel to find a large group of animated volunteers performing quality compressions on mannequins to the song Staying Alive. Many students joined in the demo and voiced a clearer understanding of how to correctly perform heart compressions in the case of cardiac arrest. With the success of this past year under our belt, plans are underway for Heart Health month 2016. Stay tuned as we anticipate more diverse and interactive events next year. $1KRAISED FOR AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S GO RED CAMPAIGNSAVES 150 PEOPLE49 BLOOD DONATIONS PROGRAM Chest Compression Flash Mob group photo THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016 8CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCE Saying Goodbye We regret to inform you that R.

One of only six such programs in the nation, this is the first Clinical Doctorate program in Speech-Language Pathology being offered in the state of California. The Program will be offered online, with a two week on campus intensive each year. This degree program is being offered for Masters-level clinicians who want to increase their depth of knowledge in the field of speech-language pathology, and want to acquire clinical research experience. Graduates of the program will be trained for positions such as master clinicians, clinical researchers, or university faculty. Advanced knowledge in the field of speech-language pathology, with specialized training in evidence based practice, critical thinking and leadership, legal and ethical issues and clinical problem solving will be provided to current practitioners. As a Doctoral student, skills such as analyzing and synthesizing existing research literature as they conduct their own research in their own area of interest will be gained. Doctoral students will increase their skills in analysis and synthesis by examining current literature while conducting research in their own area of interest.

The SLDP is not as rigorous as a PhD degree. Our program provides all the training and skills needed to conduct clinical research but does not have the scope of a PhD. This means that it is much more manageable with regard to time commitment (most PhD Degrees take 5+ years as a full-time student to complete.) What is the course load like? How long does it take to complete the program? The SLDP program is designed to be 2 courses per academic quarter, for 9 quarters (2.25 years) with a total of 53 Graduate Units. We can, however, accommodate students who wish to take courses at a more measured pace. What is the program like? Is there a dissertation required? The first year is primarily made up of core content courses. In the second year, the Capstone sequence begins. The Capstone Project (sometimes referred to as Applied Dissertation) is a written manuscript in publishable form, documenting a research project designed and carried out by the student. It is comparable to a dissertation, but less ambitious in scope (dissertations typically consist of multiple studies). How many students do you accept each year? This varies depending on the strength of the applications we receive, as well as the availability of faculty to mentor in a given area of interest. In order to ensure the quality of the program, we will be restricting the number of students we admit (at most, 8 per cohort).When is the application due for Fall 2016 acceptance? The deadline for applications is May 1, 2016. Is admission rolling? No. Screening of applications will not begin until after the deadline; the best applicants will be contacted to set up an interview, sometime in late June. Is the program traditional (face-to-face), on-line, or hybrid/blended? Aside from orientation and a few onsite intensives, it is 100% on-line. How much does the program cost? Will there be funding available? The program is projected to cost approximately $20,000 per year ($40,000 total). We hope to have funding available to students in their second year to assist with conducting research, but there is no definite internal funding. Is this program accredited by ASHA? No. ASHA does not currently accredit SLDP programs. Why should I pursue an SLDP degree? The SLDP is beneficial to individuals who wish to take on a role as master clinicians, clinical educators, clinical administrators, or who wish to conduct their own independent research.

She did not know what to do about the property and asked a senior development officer in the Office of Philanthropy if there was any way this property could benefit Loma Linda University Health (LLUH). This simple conversation sparked the creation of a team that would encompass seven departments across LLUH. Their work transformed a destroyed house into an opportunity to further Shaffer's passion for Loma Linda University Health and the School of Allied Health Professions. Philanthropy departments, Major Gifts and Planned Giving worked with Shaffer to identify her goals for turning the property into a gift. Todd Mekelburg, director of Planned giving, involved Kevin Fischer, executive director of Real Estate at the Foundation, to estimate the value of the house. Brian Kirk, Director, Real Estate Management, renovated the house for Shaffer. The renovations were managed by Graydon Todd, University Administration Management Resident, and were overseen by both Fischer and Kirk.Working with Kenny Iwakoshi, director of Trust Administration, Shaffer set up a trust for the property gift to be split three ways toward: Renovation costs An outright gift to the School of Allied Health Professionals A trust that will pay Mrs. Shaffer income for life with income to her daughter for 20 years with the remainder to be given to the School of Allied Health Professions. This collaboration allowed Loma Linda University Health to maximize the value of the gift. Most importantly, the team enabled Shaffer to give more than she had ever imagined while benefiting a greater number of future students than she thought possible.HEALTH INFORMATICS & INFORMATION MANAGEMENT A Transformational Team Front row: Audrey Shaffer, Melwida Rodrigo, Kenny Iwakoshi.

Being a recipient of the Shaffer Outreach Fund allowed me to expand my mind and fulfill the ministry of teaching abroad that Loma Linda University is so well known for. My experience could not have been possible without the generous heart of Audrey Shaffer. It is wonderful people like Audrey who provide students with once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that truly make Loma Linda University a presence worldwide. I encourage anyone who has the chance to provide a student with the means to serve in the states or abroad to do so. It will be an unforgettable experience for both the student and the sponsor. -Jacqueline Cruz-Hernandez From left: Jacquline Cruz-Hernandez, Audrey Shaffer, Veronica Lily Galvan I would never have had the opportunity to visit Hangzhou, China had it not been for Audrey Shaffer and the Health Informatics and Information Department (HIIM) at Loma Linda University's School of Allied Health Professions. The Shaffer Outreach Fund enabled me to not only visit historical sites within Hangzhou, but also allowed me to understand the inner workings of the HIIM Department in the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. The people I met, the places I walked, and the knowledge gained, all contributed to a better understanding of myself, and my role to affect this world in a positive manner. In the end, I learned to rely on my instincts, find creative ways to problem solve, trust in the unknown, and be inspired by Audrey Shaffer, herself, to live life to the fullest. It is scholarships like these that can change people and expand their horizons. I will forever be grateful for the memories I accumulated during my stay in Hangzhou, China, and I hope to one day be able to bless a student with a life-changing opportunity like the one I was given. -Veronica Lily GalvanHangzhou, China A Life-Changing Gift 14 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCEPROGRAM Dietetics students from Japan and LLU prepare Japanese cuisine By Larry Kidder Nearly two dozen dietetics students from Niigata University of Health and Welfare, located in Niigata, Japan, visited Loma Linda University Health for a tour of the campus on Monday, March 30. This was their second visit to Loma Linda. After walking the campus with public relations tour guide Mary Clement, the group headed for lunch at Nichol Hall, as well as a \"joint practical experience in Japanese food preparation\" with dietetics students from Loma Linda University School of Allied Health Professions. The LLU students were class members of \"Food Systems Organization and Management,\" taught by nutrition and dietetics instructor and master chef Cory Gheen, MS. Donning stylish cooking hats, the Japanese students began pulling out food items in unusual shapes and colors. Teams were formed to prepare various courses of the meal, comprising both Japanese and LLU dietetics students.The meal began with a traditional Japanese soup and, four courses later, ended with noodles topped by colorful vegetable garnishes more typical of a celebration. Smart phone cameras captured the Japanese dishes, as well as informal group photos of the collaborators. Teams worked side by side. The finished meal was laid on the table. Each Japanese team leader explained the ingredients and cooking procedure to the group. And then they shared a meal together. \"Food is universal,\" commented Bert Connell, PhD, Executive Director of Nutrition Services, at LLU Children's Hospital, who helped organize the experience.

As a professor in the Nutrition and Dietetics Department at Loma Linda University, he was admired and loved by us all. On November 30, 2013, Dr. Burke passed away, only four weeks after being diagnosed with cancer. He died in his home surrounded by love ones. Dr. Burke was a man of integrity, wisdom, full of knowledge, yet humble, empathetic, and generous. His contributions to the science of food are extensive. Dr. Burke developed the recipes and menus for the first nut studies at Loma Linda University. Now San Joaquin Valley farmland has been converted to thousands of acres of nut tree orchards, which produce millions of tons of tree nuts. This may never have happened if Dr. Burke had not spent hours calculating calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein for those isocaloric menus. Many are grateful for Dr. Burke's evidence-based responses to all manner of nutrition-related inquires sent to the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics. Always kind, he responded with respect and accurate information to the latest wild claim made on behalf of nutrition. He was called a \"walking encyclopedia\" with the invitation to write a book entitled, Everything - Nutrition. The wide-spread acceptance of vegetarian diets may in part be attributed to Dr. Burke. He was one of the two authors of the first position paper on vegetarian diets published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, which stated well-planned vegetarian diets would support growth and health. Drs. Burke and Connell continued to advance the acceptance of vegetarian diets through the International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition. The team of two garnered funds from multiple fruit and vegetable commissions, identified leading scientists to shed light on various aspects of vegetarian nutrition. They along with the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics produced the first three Congresses. Students will remember his typical response to, \"Good Morning, Dr. Burke. How are you?\" He would come back with, \"I'm fine, but I'll get over it.\" Dr. Burke leaves a legacy of understanding the interplay of chemistry and biology, with foodstuffs, and with single If you wish to make a donation the following areas were dear to Dr. Burke's heart: (Please include a note indicating it is in memory of Dr. Burke.)

The first is his wife, Jackie, and the second is Erika Carbajal, a second year student in the M.S. degree program in nutrition and dietetics. One morning, Jackie stopped by a booth Erika had set up in the lobby of Drayson Center to draw attention to weight loss and nutritional counseling services offered to the community. One thing really caught Jackie's eye.\"It's called 10 pounds of ugly fat,\" she explains. \"It's a molded plastic replica of a yellowish blob of fat; about the size of a large loaf of bread. The visual aid really got my attention.\" I wondered if my husband could make the connection with the aids Erika displayed.\" Erika showed Jackie the My Plate graphic - a plate divided in half with fruits and vegetables on one side and grains and proteins on the other - and depictions of the hidden salt and sugar in processed foods. As Erika explained that interactive visuals help make learning fun, Jackie became convinced John needed to meet Erika. \"I thought hearing about it from someone other than me might motivate him to lose weight,\" Jackie said. John, however, was not so sure. Nevertheless, one fateful day in August 2014, he accompanied Jackie to meet Erika. He was very defensive when he realized it was a one-on-one meeting and not a class. But Erika put him completely at ease. \"She gave me a 'healthy' recipe for tamale pie and showed me the 10 pounds of ugly fat, and that was all it took,\" said John.

And I am thrilled when my path crosses something to use for morning worship that perfectly displays God's divine plan of six days of work and a seventh day of rest. As you might conclude from our department title, our students are naturally interested in health and nutrition. With that in mind I shared an article with my students on rest written by personal trainer, Dominique Wakefield, published in the American Council on Exercise in February 2015. In the article, Everything You Need to Know about Rest, the author emphasizes four types of rest: sleep, vacation, daily rest, and weekly rest. SLEEP: The article started with the author pointing out the benefits of adequate sleep, which include cellular repair, a recharged brain, and the body's proportional release of vital hormones. The author goes on to delineate the negative consequences of inadequate sleep such as depression, weight gain, and weakened immune system, to name a few. VACATION: The author suggests that taking a vacation induces higher productivity, better wellbeing, decreased death incidences from coronary causes, decreased psychosomatic illnesses, and reduced risk of diseases. DAILY REST: According to the author, daily rest should be a complete detachment from work and daily life. She recommends taking a few minutes each day to take a mental vacation and suggests finding a quiet space to pray, spend time in nature, or visit with someone that is enjoyable to be around. WEEKLY REST : The fourth type of rest is what I was especially excited to share with the students. The author stated that biological conditions \"circulate through a seven-day-rhythm, including heartbeat, blood pressure, hormone levels and more.\" The author made mention of individuals who make this a regular practice. She said that \"Seventh-day-Adventists, who celebrate a weekly Sabbath from the rigors of daily life, have been studied in great detail due to the increased levels of health and well-being experienced by this population.\" It was a joy to share scientific proof of what Seventh-day Adventists have known and cherished for quite some time. I consider the first three types of rest to be very important, but taking time to celebrate our Creator on a weekly basis and honoring the rest He wants us to take in communion with Him far outweighs them all.attachment to food. The question: What recommendations would you give if your client's diet was ten cheeseburgers a day, \"That's an extreme example, but you have to meet clients where they are. Asking them to cut out all cheeseburgers and switch to salad wouldn't be realistic, so I would start by asking them to cut back to five burgers a day,\" says Erika. John started applying Erika's recommendations right away. Almost immediately, he began losing weight and feeling better. But after a few weeks, the weight loss slowed. That's when he started following her advice about exercise. \"I had been pretty sedentary,\" he admits, \"but now I ride a stationery bike 35 to 45 minutes three times a week and hit the treadmill for another 20 to 25 minutes. I also do light weights, but the cardio workout is what's most important.\" Early in the program, Jackie told Erika she was concerned John might possibly be pre-diabetic. \"He gets grumpy when his blood sugar drops,\" she explains. Erika took the information seriously but said that John just needed to increase his protein intake. \"He used to come home from the gym all tired out,\" Jackie remembers. \"But then he started taking a protein snack to eat during the workout, and a water bottle. So now, he's getting better nutrition during the workout.\" The benefits have been tangible and sustainable.\"Right now, I'm right at 20 pounds lighter than before I started,\" John reports. \"But between the holidays and vacations, I gained some of it back.\" Erika isn't worried. \"John is on the right path,\" she insists. \"He'll lose the weight again and keep it off because he isn't on a diet; he's found a new, healthy lifestyle.\"CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCEPROGRAM The benefits have been tangible and sustainable.THE REST OF YOUR LIFE By JeJe Noval THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016 18 By Nancy Yuen Service learning reaches back to the very beginning of Loma Linda University Health. As current students follow the path of thousands of alumni traveling outside of the Loma Linda University Health campus to volunteer, they support the organization's mission, \"to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ.\" While many students say that time spent volunteering with people and populations in need has changed how they will provide care after graduation, for some the experience has been transformational. \"This experience [volunteering in an elementary school] further reinforced the value of each individual,\" writes one Allied Health Professions student, \"and showed me that there truly is a need for community services.

Juan Carlos Belliard, PhD, assistant vice president and Liane Hewitt, DrPH, OTR, chair, occupational therapy department, School of Allied Health Professions oversee the committee's work. As part of the process, committee members are reviewing outlines for all of the university's service learning courses. Brenda Spoelstra, qualitative research assistant, Institute for Community Partnerships, is leading the coordination of the course review process. Spoelstra says that two faculty members have completed the course designation project, and their courses have been approved. The first course to be approved, \"Cultural immersion for physician assistants,\" is taught by Yasmin Chene, DHSc, MPA, a faculty member in the master of physician assistant program at Loma Linda University. \"The service learning committee was very supportive and encouraging throughout the process,\" says Chene. \"Initially I felt that I might not have time to complete the process as I was in the middle of a busy quarter. However, the process was very smooth and the information requested didn't take much time to put together.\" The second course to receive the committee's approval, Program Development and Design I, is taught by Dr. Hewitt. \"Going through the service learning course designation process was very informative,\" says Hewitt. \"The committee reviewed my course syllabi and gave me really good feedback about what's working and where modifications would be beneficial to help clarify items such as critical reflection and reciprocity.\" The experience of another School of Allied Health Professions student reinforces the impact of service learning. \"My perspective of human worth has definitely changed,\" she writes. \"I have learned that no matter what the circumstance, every human is valuable and should be given opportunities to grow and flourish. At-risk youth may be pushed aside as delinquents, but they are human and have feelings just as any other person does. We should try to help those in need and build better communities to show that each and every person is valuable and has positive potential.\" \"Service learning has been a core thread in our OT curriculum for many years,\" says Hewitt. \"We truly recognize and embrace that the community is our extended classroom and have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities working with the various community agencies. It is always such a great learning experience for all of us.\" \"I have learned that no matter what the circumstance, every human is valuable and should be given opportunities to grow and flourish.\" 20 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016Students participate in annual human anatomy memorial service Vestibular Rehabilitation SeminarCARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCEPROGRAM On Thursday, April 16th, Loma Linda University School of Medicine's division of human anatomy hosted its Annual Memorial Service to honor the donors from the \"Bodies for Science Program.\" This program demonstrated the broad impact these donors have on health education at Loma Linda University.

Yet, he faces life with an infectious enthusiasm. Now 4 years old, Sammy was born with Down syndrome, though he is described as high functioning. At less than a month old, he was already receiving developmental therapy from an infant teacher at the Inland Regional Center and has continued to work with specialists from the center ever since. His respiratory and heart ailments, typical of many Down syndrome children, suddenly seemed rather insignificant this past September when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia. Following a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, he is now thankfully in remission. However, a recent daylong fever brought him back to the hematology/oncology unit in Loma Linda University Children's Hospital for a few days.CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCEPROGRAM On this particular day, Sammy was enjoying his lunch with his mother, Christy Ellis, who spends the majority of her time in his hospital room. Her husband, Micah Ellis, is taking care of Sammy's little brother, Mark, at their home in Lucerne Valley, on the backside of Big Bear, California. Lunch was over and Sammy was on to the next activity. Just at that moment, Christiana Smith, a communication sciences and disorders student nearly finished with her master's, arrived for Sammy's speech therapy session. She was accompanied by Gary Lucas, MS, a speech pathologist, who is her clinical supervisor. Sammy seemed overjoyed. He launched into an excited conversation, sharing all that had happened since he last saw Christiana. He described lunch and what he had \u2014 including a banana. He shared his toys, including a basket of plastic fruit. As he handed out the fruit, he was prompted to name each type.

He pointed to the pictures and identified the subjects while she read the words. At this rate, he will soon be able to read on his own. Then Sammy's occupational therapist arrived. He seemed overjoyed again at the prospect of time with another friend. Yvette Paquin, OTD, placed a colorful mat on the floor. Sammy sat on the mat and, together, they practiced skills like unscrewing the cap of a green marker and coloring a picture. Sammy may not realize it's therapy, but he is benefiting from the expertise of these trained professionals who know how to turn fun into learning. During the months of April and May, the therapists who work with children like Sammy, as well as patients of all ages, are being recognized. April is Occupational Therapy Month. Occupational Therapists (OTs) like Yvette Paquin work with patients of all ages who have experienced an illness or injury that makes the activities of daily living difficult for them. For children like Sammy, OTs design personal plans to help them with activities like playing or eating. \"We have gotten to know Sam very well,\" she explains. \"It's fun to see how much he has grown and accomplished over the past few months.\"CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCEPROGRAM May is Better Hearing and Speech Month. Speech pathologists like Christiana Smith and Gary Lucas also work with patients of all ages to help them better verbalize their thoughts, needs, feelings, and desires. This year's theme, \"Early Intervention Counts,\" seems tailor-made for Sammy. His verbal skills will continue to increase even while he is at LLU Children's Hospital, thanks to their efforts. \"He is such a joy to work with,\" shares Christiana. Sammy seems unfazed by it all. The fun with his therapists ends and he goes back to \"just hanging out with Mom.\" The next poke, prod, or procedure - he'll still be smiling when it's over.

A Haitian girl taught me that this week as we were working on building steps for her orphanage home,\" said Lisa McMillian, 3rd year Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) student. \"Her small hand slipped into mine as she looked up at me with a bright smile. We made our way back up the dusty path to refill our buckets with more sand. Back and forth we went until it was time to begin creating the steps. As I bent down to lay a block into wet cement I felt a hand gently wipe my skin. I looked down and there was, Isamarie, cleaning a small cut I had received. We had hardly been there for 2 hours, yet she didn't hesitate showing her thoughtfulness and care. It was a simple moment, but she showed me that first day what an impact one can make if we only take the time to love in the moment.\" Lisa and a team of seven other DPT and three Orthotics & Prosthetics (O&P) students spent a week in Haiti July 25th through August 1st, 2015. They went in part to complete a structure started the year before by DPT student, Samantha Willis Moore. She raised money to redo the front of the Adventist school in Haiti, Universite Adventiste d'Haiti. The school has 199 students with 17 living in the attached orphanage. The students spent a busy week building three walls to complete the school, a set of steps and a sidewalk to replace a long, steep dirt path to the entrance, one day teaching for the Rehab Technician Training program, which will soon graduate its fourth cohort, one day divided between the Hopital Adventiste d'Haiti and the Club Foot Clinic attached to the hospital, and evenings playing with the kids in the orphanage. \"My prayer before arriving in Haiti was that God would allow me to be useful, especially in the clinic setting,\" recalls O&P student Andre Chambers. \"When we arrived at the hospital we were given a tour and then split into our respective fields. The O&P students were placed in the Club Foot Clinic. The clinic was comprised of babies whose feet were internally rotated so badly that the toes were facing each other and pointed toward the ground. I was allowed to cast three babies that day. About Haiti Population: 9,996,731 Religions: Roman Catholic 80%, Protestant 16%, none 1%, other 3% Languages: French and Creole I realized as the casting was taking place that I was playing a small part in healing the bodies of these small children. The experiences were both humbling and exciting! I walked out of the clinic with a glow, realizing I had put into practice all that I had learned in my classes at LLU. It was God's divine hand that supplied my desire to be useful and I am thankful that I was able to make a small difference in the life of someone who will never remember that I was there.\" While on the trip Andre says he was constantly reminded of Ephesians 3:20 - Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us. (KJV) The trip was sponsored through the SAHP Outreach Fund and faculty. The students raised $3,060 for building materials by hosting a bike ride from Loma Linda to the beach and selling t-shirts. They also filled ten suitecases with clothing and shoe donations. At the end of the week the students carried on the tradition of giving the on-site workers their work shoes. At the start of the week, morning devotionals were lead by Everett Lohman, Director of Post-Professional Physical Therapy and Heather Appling, Assistant Professor in the O&P Program, then the students lead out the rest of the week. In the first devotional of the trip, Everett told the students to focus first on building relationships, and then on building buildings. That message must have really hit home because when it came time to leave not a dry eye was seen from the orphanage kids who clung to their student companions. It was a very emotional and unforgettable experience.Haiti 28 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016Mission Trip to Honduras About Honduras Population: 8,098,000 million 51.4%, Spanish Shani Denny Torrez, Administrative Assistant and Travel Logistics Coordinator, and Elsy, one of the children the group enjoyed spending time with. Honduras\"I want to make a change, even if it is a slight change.\" That was the attitude of the 19 students who participated in the 2015 SAHP Interdisciplinary Mission Trip that partnered with Pan American Health Service, a non-denominational Christian, non-government organization. PAHS focuses primarily on childhood malnutrition and basic education for people with few resources in the Pena Blanca region of Honduras. The work of PAHS starts with providing nutrition and medical assistance to starving children. Some do not return to their family home after recovery and are afforded the opportunity to live and grow up on the Pe\u00f1a Blanca Campus in the PAHS Homes. Heather Roese, Occupational Therapy faculty, took on a specific request made by PAHS administration for a duel occupational and speech therapy project, while Dr. Brenda Boyd, trip leader and Program Director for the Medical Radiography program, conducted a spiritual renewal and leadership training program for the on-site staff and administration. The students also stayed busy with a favorite and very important aspect of the trip: daily care for and activities with the children at the facility. Some of the activities were softball, jump rope, coloring, lighting of the lanterns at night, bedtime stories and prayer. The students also fed, bathed, and dressed the ten babies who live in the home. The whole group worked to frame in the doors and windows of the children's home, Heather and the OT students worked with the babies in truly transformative ways, and the Medical Radiography students had the opportunity to visit the only x-ray clinic in town, which allowed the students to deliver a donation of lead shields provided by one of the clinical sites for the Medical Radiography program. At the close of the week, Anita Youngberg, one of the administrators for PAHS, said \"I feel that this trip was very successful. We asked the group to do some very specific tasks based on the needs we have here, and we are so happy with the outcome and that they came to help us.\" Students go on mission trips for many reasons. Here are some comments from some of this trips participants: \"I was so excited to go on this trip because of what I hoped to learn as a result,\" said a student who traveled outside the U.S. for the first time. \"I would like be able to spread compassion to those who have so much less,\" said another student. \"My biggest take away spiritually was that without God I can do nothing. There is a constant reliance that you take for granted stateside, but really grasp when you are on a mission trip.\"\"I wanted to go on this trip to reconnect with God, and to gain a stronger will to be who He wants me to be.\" \"This trip was a gift. I was so blessed by being able to work with the women and children at PAHS and use the skills that I am learning and developing at LLU as an Occupational Therapist. I have such a deeper understanding of my calling and how our professions impact everyone we come into contact with. I learned so much more than just a classroom could have ever taught me. This trip truly was a holistic learning opportunity.\" \"I wanted to go to Honduras to experience another culture and better understand the needs and lives of people outside of my immediate sphere.\" At the end of the week of spiritual renewal, the School of Allied Health students and faculty provided cake and ice cream for the staff at PAHS, to honor the continued effort to help children with nutritional needs. Mission Trip Student Breakdown This is our fourth SAHP interdisciplinary mission trip. Other trips have taken us to Haiti, Belize, and a different part of Honduras. Our Mission is to intentionally create a transformational experience that includes international clinical service, as well as experiences for physical, mental, social, and spiritual renewal. Our Vision is that students who go on these trips will grow their relationship with God, integrate the values of compassion, humility, teamwork, and wholeness into their lives, and experience a personal metamorphosis just by showing up to selflessly serve. 6 Medical Radiography 1 Nutrition & Dietetics1 Cardiopulmonary Sciences1 Radiation Technology 2 Communication Sciences & Disorders 1 Health Informatics and Information Management 7 Occupational Therapy 30 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016New Vending Machine Options Will Support Wholeness By Larry Kidder It's been more than a year in the planning: Loma Linda University Health will be changing its vending machines to reflect the emphasis on wholeness, embodied in the \"Live It\" campaign. \"In our commitment to whole health and well-being,\" says Daniel Fontoura, MBA, vice president for wholeness, \"we have selected a vendor specializing in healthy snacks and beverages.\" Over the past year, a cross-section of Loma Linda University Health nutrition experts and leaders have taken part in creating dietary criteria, listening to presentations by vendors, sampling their products, and ultimately recommending a single vendor for the entire organization. \"From late January to March, we will be transitioning,\" explains Fontoura. \"The vendor already serves several Loma Linda University Health sites, and going to a single vendor will provide better consistency and lower pricing of healthy vended products for the campus.\" Fontoura continues, \"We know these are small changes, but hopefully they are ones that will make it easier for you to 'Live It' when it comes to your journey of health.\" Fontoura wants to reassure those who enjoy the current choices of sodas, candy bars and other assorted snacks that the new options will be equally fulfilling.\"We want to assure you,\" he emphasizes, \"that the replacement items are designed to not only be healthier, but at the same time provide sweet, savory and satisfying choices to keep you going until your next meal.\" Additional information regarding these and other changes will be shared as they occur in the future. 31 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016Potential Students Plan Their Dreams at LLU Open House By Heather Reifsnyder Looking back, professionals often remember the moment their dreams for a future career were solidified. For hundreds of individuals at the beginning of professional life, their moment may have come on Jan. 25 when they attended Loma Linda University's 10th annual open house. The approximate 1,800 guests \u2014 potential students and their families \u2014 arrived at the Centennial Complex, toured the Medical Simulation Center and campus, and had the option to attend financial aid seminars. Awaiting them next was a helicopter landing on the campus mall. The chopper was a Mercy Air medical transporter, and riding in on it was Roger Hadley, MD, dean of the School of Medicine. After guests checked out the helicopter and learned about emergency air service, they went into Loma Linda University Church to hear inspirational presentations from Dean Hadley as well as Distinguished Professor Leonard Bailey, MD, from the School of Medicine. Bailey pioneered infant heart transplantation. He spoke of his professional journey and about finding one's destiny, while Hadley talked about changes in health care education and the importance of all health care disciplines working together. Lunch and a K-9 security demonstration followed, after which the guests dispersed to learn about their career interests. Loma Linda University offers more than 200 programs, which were all represented through dozens of sessions. Prospective students could select two sessions to learn about health care disciplines of interest to them. About 100 current LLU students volunteered for the day. According to Stephanie Larsen, planner of the open house, \"Every year, some volunteers say, 'I was a prospective student last year, and now I'm volunteering because it's such a great day.'\" She adds, \"It's a day where students can get a true sense of Loma Linda University and what they can expect as a student. It makes many feel that 'This is where I want to be.'\"Potential students interested in allied health careers follow an LLU volunteer to a session to learn more. Guests at the open house had dozens of information sessions to choose from representing all the different health care disciplines. 32 THE LINK - Winter/Spring 2016Winner of the 3rd Annual Senior Hoodie Ceremony Photo Contest In case you haven't heard, the Senior \"Hoodie\" Ceremony, in which seniors receive an SAHP logoed, hooded sweatshirt is our much anticipated new tradition.
