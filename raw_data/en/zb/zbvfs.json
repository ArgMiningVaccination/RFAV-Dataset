The word naturopathy is a Latin-Greek hybrid which can be defined as 'being close to or benefiting from nature.'\" \u2014 Stewart Mitchell, Naturopathy: Understanding the Healing Power of Nature A traditional naturopath specializes in wellness. That is to say, teaching clients how an application of a natural lifestyle can act to facilitate the body's own natural healing and health building potential. The traditional naturopath does not undertake to \"diagnose\" or \"treat diseases,\" but rather recognizes that the majority of sub-health conditions are cumulative lifestyle effects, and that the underlying cause of what we call \"disease\" (or, \"dis-ease\") is improper diet, unhealthy habits, and external environmental factors which cause biological imbalances leading to a weakening of the bodies' natural defenses and subsequent breakdown in health. The practice of Traditional Naturopathy is not considered the practice of medicine and is currently legal in all 50 states. Although the term \"Naturopathy\" originated in the late 19th century, the art can be traced back through Germany into Greece, to Hippocrates himself, and even beyond. There have always been people who understood that healing occurs naturally in the human body, if it is given what it truly needs \u2014 proper diet, pure water, fresh air, sunlight, exercise, and rest. For these people, the emphasis has not been on finding a disease and killing it, but rather on helping the body establish its own state of good health. Today, these people are known as Traditional Naturopaths. Traditional Naturopaths recognize that allopathic health care is, at times, necessary. They also know that many people can maintain good health through the use of naturopathy. What does a Traditional Naturopath not do? A Traditional naturopath avoids procedures common to medical care. Among them are: diagnosing disease, treating disease, prescribing drugs and pharmaceuticals, and performing invasive procedures. In determining the root cause of a client's problems, Traditional Naturopaths do not diagnose or treat disease, but instead focus on health and education. They teach clients how to create an internal and an external environment that is conducive to good health, enabling the clients to make their own choices. Traditional naturopathy is not a medical practice. Major and minor surgery, prescribing drugs and pharmaceuticals, giving injections and drawing blood should be limited to medical doctors only and not performed within the scope of naturopathy.

Healing Power of Nature \u2014 There are powerful, natural healing mechanisms in the body and mind that maintain and restore health. We will work together to support and restore these inherent and powerful healing systems, using methods, natural medicines and techniques that are in harmony with natural processes. First Do No Harm \u2014 Naturopathic practitioners prefer non-invasive treatments which minimize the risks of side effects. By recommending lifestyle activities that promote prevention of disease, I can help you to maximize your energy and strengthen your immune function. Find the Cause \u2014 Naturopaths can often identify the underlying cause of disease in aspects of your diet, lifestyle, environment, or habits. This approach can help you eliminate the actual cause of disease instead of merely treating the symptoms. A Person as a Whole\u2014 When the whole person is addressed, not just the symptoms, true healing can occur. Health comes from a complex interaction of the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual self. These include dietary, environmental, lifestyle and relationship factors. A Naturopath is a Teacher \u2014 My role is to educate and empower you to actions that improve the quality of your life and health. Preventive Approach \u2014 The Naturopathic approach to health is prevention. Together we will discover a lifestyle and diet that can provide you with principals specific to your unique body and needs for a long and healthy life.
