Good Thinking SKEPTICALITY EPISODE 262 In this episode of Skepticality, Derek has a discussion with past guest Guy P. Harrison on his latest book, [Good Thinking: What You Need to Know to be Smarter, Safer, Wealthier, and Wiser](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1633880648/?tag=skepticcom20-20). In this book, Guy took on the challenge of discovering more about human brain evolution, and sought out what the current, best science is on how we can keep our brains healthy and working optimally. Maybe you shouldn't be eating that extra scoop of drive-through ice cream after-all... About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Richard Grigg explains why he thinks Douglas Navarick's empirical [God-hypothesis](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/) fails. If you haven't yet read [Navarick's article](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/), or the [previous debate between Dave Matson and Navarick](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-09-30/#feature), you may want to read those first, then come back here and read Grigg's challenge (below), followed by [Navarick's response](#Navarick-responds). Navarick's article \" [The 'God' Construct: A Unifying Science and Theology](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/),\" appeared in [Skeptic magazine 20.3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.3/) (2015). Why Douglas Navarick's Empirical God-Hypothesis Fails by Richard Grigg In his \" [The 'God' Construct: A Testable Hypothesis for Unifying Science and Theology](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/)\" that appeared in [Skeptic (Vol. 20, No. 3, 2015)](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.3/), Douglas J. Navarick lays out a laudably clear and thorough argument on behalf of what he regards as an empirical approach to at least one, potentially unorthodox, version of theism. He is to be congratulated for coming up with something genuinely new to say on a subject that has been nearly talked to death over several thousand years of Western debate. At the same time, Navarick's approach contains a fatal flaw, one that brings down not only his own enterprise but any version of theism that suggests that a supernatural force has even the least influence upon the natural universe. Navarick zeroes in on the question of whether the claim that the origin of life on Earth is to be explained through abiogenesis has sufficient evidence to back it up. \"Biogenesis\" is a word that we derive from the Greek \"bios,\" life, and \"genesis\" meaning origin or source. When the Greeks put an \"a\" (the Greek alpha) in front of a word, the so-called \"alpha privative,\" it reverses the word's meaning. Most contemporary scientists assume that the first truly living thing, something more than a virus\u2014specifically a living cell\u2014arose via abiogenesis. This suggests that a chemical soup that did not itself contain any living things came together in such a fashion that a living cell emerged. Of course decades of laboratory experiments that have attempted to reproduce the conditions of the early Earth that might have led to the appearance of the first cell have all come up empty handed, in that no mixing of likely precursor chemicals has ever actually resulted in a living cell. All of the living cells ever observed have derived from other living cells. This, argues Navarick, is absence of evidence, an absence that is sufficiently potent to register as evidence of absence. Perhaps life cannot come from something not itself living, then, but only from something of a quite different order. And, if so, perhaps it is an empirically defensible hypothesis that a God, one that need not be conceived in any more than the most minimalist terms, had to create the first cell or cells. Navarick defines his minimalist god as \"a force that operates both through and independently of natural laws.\" [1](#note01) The fatal flaw in Navarick's argument is already visible in this brief definition, as it is in his earlier admission that \"A precondition for conducting a scientific analysis of the evidence of God is an acknowledgement that science is capable of identifying supernatural influences in the natural world.\" [2](#note02) What brings both of these formulas to grief is none other than one of the most basic laws of physics, the first law of thermodynamics, articulated in the 19th century: energy can be neither created nor destroyed; it can only change its form. The energy stored in the bonds of the gasoline molecules in my car's gas tank, along with the energy in the oxygen molecules in the air, can make my car move down the road. Chemical energy is turned into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. But if we could add up every bit of energy with which we started and every bit with which we ended up, we would come up with the very same amount in each case. Things get tricky here in real-world examples, because the energy stored in fuel and oxygen doesn't get completely translated into the energy of motion; much gets transformed into friction and heat energy, for example. But at the end of the day, energy has been neither created nor destroyed, just changed from one form into others. Now any claim that a supernatural entity can have an influence within the natural world or can use already existing natural entities and phenomena in order to effect a new state of affairs immediately runs afoul of the conservation of energy. Let us begin with a simple analogy. There is a rake intended for raking leaves hanging on a hook in my garage. If I reluctantly pick up the rake, head out into my front lawn, and begin raking, what is actually moving the leaves? Proximately or most immediately, it is the rake. But the rake would still be hanging in my garage and would not be moving back and forth across my lawn if it were not for the energy that my body contributes to it. My body most definitely adds energy to the equation, even though one might choose to say that I work through the rake, that I am the \"primary cause\" utilizing a \"secondary cause\" to accomplish my purpose, language found in Medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas who believed that God was the primary cause who acted through secondary causes, the latter being finite, natural objects. But here is the rub: if we consider my actions and that of the rake in artificial isolation from the rest of the world, the law of conservation of energy appears to be violated\u2014I have not just changed the form of the energy contained in the rake (the inert rake's energy includes, for example, the rapid motion of its constituent atoms and the potential energy it has by being suspended in a gravitational field). Rather, I have actually added new energy to the rake, and it has been necessary for me to do so if the rake is going to be used for its intended purpose of cleaning the leaves off of my yard. But when we remove the artificial brackets and place the energy that my body expends and the rake's inherent energy within the whole surrounding natural universe, the conservation of energy holds. For instance, the energy that my body produces through cell metabolism is not a matter of creating new energy out of whole cloth, but of changing the form of the energy contained in the food stuffs that I imbibe and the air that I breathe. Now take the idea central to Navarick's contention, and to all claims that a supernatural being has effects within the natural world: the supernatural cannot act \"through\" the natural world and its physics without violating conservation of energy. Just as the rake wouldn't move without my adding energy via my bodily motions, so the purely natural interaction of purely natural entities must obey the conservation law. But if the natural universe is left in this way to its own devices, Navarick wants to argue that these purely natural phenomena can never produce the first genuinely living thing. For that to happen, Navarick suggests, the supernatural must interact with the natural. But that will involve the supernatural adding energy (not just changing the form of energy) from outside the natural world as surely as my going to work with the rake adds new energy to the energy that the rake already possesses. But where my body's interaction with the rake, when considered within its total natural environment, does wholly obey the conservation law, Navarick's scenario does not: a supernatural entity, by definition, stands outside the closed physical world in which the laws of physics apply. And even if it were possible to imagine a deity not subject to those laws within that God's own internal nature, the moment that that deity attempts to utilize or work through phenomena in the natural world, energy is being illicitly transported into that world from outside it, and not simply changing form. The conservation law is violated. This is a gargantuan \"woops!\" That is, we should not underestimate the impossibility of countenancing any violation of the first law of thermodynamics. If energy were not conserved and could appear ex nihilo in our universe, whether via a supernatural agent or some other source, our reality would be a very different one from the reality in which we do in fact reside. But would the sort of violation of energy conservation implicit in Narvarick's proposal necessarily be detectable? And if it were not, might it be possible to argue that Navarick's hypothesis still has a chance of being correct? Perhaps even if it violates the first law of thermodynamics, the fact that we could never detect that violation renders the problem null and void, especially given the school of philosophy which holds that \"laws\" of nature are nothing more than generalizations derived from what we observe in the world around us. Perhaps this invisible contradiction between supernatural action within the natural world on the single matter of the origin of life and conservation of energy is akin to the contradiction between General Relativity and quantum theory. Each theory appears to hold within one segment of reality. An overly simple but oft-stated description of this situation is to say that quantum theory applies on the level of the very small, such as the atomic and subatomic realms, whereas General Relativity applies on larger scales. But note how physicists react to this particular apparent contradiction. They do not simply shrug their shoulders and forget about the problem. Rather they tend to choose one of two options: either quantum theory and/or General Relativity is not a complete theory; there is some yet undiscovered theory that will be able to unite them. Or\u2014and this is a smaller group of physicists\u2014they conclude that there may be some conundrums that are simply beyond the capacity of the human mind to resolve; after all, there is no survival value to understanding these matters (but, of course, neither is there any obvious survival value to being able to solve many perfectly solvable mathematical equations). But suppose we grant that if a supernatural force violated the first law of thermodynamics when it brought the first living thing into being, that violation would be invisible. It turns out that this only makes Navarick's argument weaker. Being unable to observe any violation of the conservation law here is a lack of evidence for that violation, and when we find ourselves in that situation, it is certainly the more rational choice to adhere to an established physical law. But wait, there's more! While I have thus far confined myself to the origin of the very first cell, from which I am presuming all life on Earth derives, Navarick actually holds that the supernatural force that he suggests interfered in our world in order to create that first cell actually has to be present in all cells that will ever exist. That is, he wants to reinstate the long-abandoned philosophy called vitalism. Navarick argues that he has made \"a reasonable case for the existence of a supernatural force that produced the first living cell and since then has continued to produce cells in such numbers that they now penetrate virtually every nook and niche of the planet.\" [3](#note03) If a supernatural force entered into the birth of the very first cell, that would be a violation of the conservation of energy, but it would be an undetectable violation. By contrast, if a supernatural force is inserting itself into the natural processes going on within every living cell, that would be a violation of energy conservation that is in principle quite detectable. If such vitalism were to occur, and a biologist carefully examined the energy transactions in a cell, he or she would find that more energy was being expended than was contained within the natural components of the cell. I am not willing to hold my breath on that discovery. [4](#note04) References - Navarick, D.

Biogenesis vs. Abiogenesis, Not Thermodynamics, Decides the Issue of Life's Origin by Douglas J. Navarick Richard Grigg presents a challenge to my science-based \"God\" construct that he claims refutes both my hypothesis and any form of theology stating that a divine power interacts with nature. He argues that to alter a natural system, a supernatural power would necessarily violate the first law of thermodynamics\u2014conservation of energy\u2014which holds that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. According to Grigg, the violation would occur because the power would have to add energy to the system that it was changing from a source outside the natural universe. (Actually, no energy would have to be added, as will soon be shown.) Although the issues Grigg raises are important to address, it is not because they challenge the validity of the \"God\" construct. The issues are irrelevant. The test is whether life can be produced from non-life. If abiogenesis failed, then a supernatural (non-material) power in the universe would be established by default and physics would simply have to find a way to accommodate this new reality. So in terms of assessing the evidence for the \"God\" construct, it's all about artificial life. Hypothetical violations of conservation of energy are not a substitute for researchers' continuing inability to demonstrate that abiogenesis really happens. Still, if a supernatural power interacted with cells as required by the \"God\" construct, and its actions were to be understood within a scientific framework, then the dynamics of this influence would eventually need to be described in empirical terms, and ideally without requiring a violation of conservation of energy. In [a follow-up article](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-09-30/#Navarick-responds) [1](#note01-2) to the one discussed by Grigg, I have already outlined such a process involving no transfer of energy from the supernatural power to the cell. Here I will elaborate on the evidence and explore its scientific and theological implications. The cryopreservation model. As I previously discussed, life is either an emergent (material) or a transcendent (non-material) property of cells. Emergent means that life is the product of relationships that exist among the cell's structures and biochemical reactions. Transcendent means that life is an independent property and requires no biochemical activity to sustain it. I cited evidence for transcendence from the process of cryopreservation. Life appears to act as a kind of catalyst that permits biochemical reactions to begin, at which point natural processes take over. Here's the evidence: In cryopreservation, single cells and tissues can be frozen to the point where metabolism stops but the cells remain alive if the cell wall is intact. This shows transcendence. When living cells are thawed, the pre-existing property of life allows metabolic activity to resume. This transcendent influence on the cell adds no energy to it. If molecular biologists suspected that the first law of thermodynamics was being violated during the reactivation of cells, then it would have to be a very closely held secret. Evidence for transcendence from the Venter Institute. The J. Craig Venter Institute is a genomic research organization located in Rockville, Maryland and La Jolla, California. Perhaps its most famous accomplishment has been the creation of a synthetic bacterial cell that replicated itself using manufactured DNA. In May, 2010 some media outlets misinterpreted Venter's demonstration and breathlessly announced that Venter had achieved synthetic life, a claim repeated by Venter himself in a 2010 \"Ted in the Field\" presentation viewable on YouTube (but later clarified to dispel any misunderstandings about whether life had been created). There was such a strong public reaction to the news that President Obama asked his Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to examine the implications of artificially creating life. Here is what they said [2](#note02-2): \"Q: Did the Venter Institute scientists \"create life?\" A: No. In our deliberations, we heard that while Venter's achievement marked a significant technical advance in demonstrating that a relatively large genome could be accurately synthesized and substituted for another, it did not amount to the \"creation of life.\" The researcher's man-made genome was inserted into an already living cell. The synthesized genome itself was a variant of a genome of an existing species. The technical feat of synthesizing a genome for its chemical parts so that it becomes self-replicating when inserted into a bacterial cell of another species, while significant, does not represent the creation of life from inorganic chemicals alone. In addition to constituting a concession to biogenesis, Venter's achievement provides further evidence that life is a transcendent property of the cell. To insert the new DNA, Venter had to remove the cell's existing DNA. Yet even without this critical structure, the cell remained alive. If life emerged from a cell's structure and biochemical reactions, then Venter's cell should have died abruptly with removal of the DNA. As with cryopreservation, life transcended material reality. Maimonides may have had it right. The cryopreservation model represents life as a supernatural influence that acts as a catalyst rather than by participating directly in the cell's functions. The 12th-century philosopher and theologian, Moses Maimonides, seems to have envisioned such a process in his efforts to explain how an incorporeal being could bring about changes in the natural world: There are actions that do not depend on impact, or on a certain distance. They are termed 'influence' (or 'emanation'), on account of their similarity to a water-spring...[that] sends forth water in all directions...and continually waters both neighboring and distant places...whenever an object is sufficiently prepared, it receives the effect of that continuous action, called 'influence' (or 'emanation'). [3] In cryopreservation, a cell that is structurally intact is \"sufficiently prepared\" to receive the influence that life will have on its biochemical activity when the cell thaws. There is no necessity for life to physically act on the cell by adding energy to it the way Richard Grigg would have to add energy to the rake in his example that purports to illustrate the \"fatal flaw\" in the \"God\" construct. \"But wait, there's more!\" I have proposed that the supernatural power that produced the first living cell has continued to produce them. Grigg maintains that this concept of continuity in supernatural influence is indefensible because if the supernatural continued to act upon cells, researchers would have observed that the cells were expending more energy than they contained. However, cryopreservation shows that life can bring about biochemical activity in a cell without adding to its store of energy. This process can explain why researchers have observed no anomalies in cell reproduction. At the close of my article on the \"God\" construct I suggested the possibility that life is God. From a strictly scientific point of view the life-is-God concept has the theoretical advantage of parsimony. Rather than speaking of two theoretical principles, abiogenesis for the first cell and biogenesis for all subsequent cells, we would only need one, biogenesis. If a theistic God existed before the first cell became active, and God = life, then that cell and all subsequent cells would be instances of the same principle\u2014life comes from life.

Guns in the U.S. We're Better at Killing Americans Than Our Enemies Are by Michael Shermer If your gut tells you that mass public shootings are alarmingly common, your gut's right. The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines a mass murder as four or more deaths during a single incident with no distinct time period between killings. By this definition, according to Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, between 1980 and 2010 there were an average of 20 mass murders per year, or an average of one every 2.6 weeks. Now it looks like that interval is shrinking. According to shootingtracker.com, there were 30 mass public shootings with four or more dead in 2014, and there have been 31 this year through the Oct. 1 tragedy in Roseburg, Ore., or one every 1.6 weeks. No wonder President Obama feels like he's repeating himself with sullen regularity in his post-shooting speeches. Our gun problem of course extends beyond mass violence. In 2014 alone, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 11,208 people shot to death, 33,636 injured by gunfire and 21,175 who killed themselves with a gun. That's a total of 66,019 people who were killed or injured by a gun, which comes out to 1,269 per week, 180 a day or 7.5 per hour. Add up all the gun fatalities since 1970 (approximate annual average of 30,000, according to the CDC) and you get the staggering figure of 1.35 million dead, which is disturbingly close to the figure of 1.39 million Americans who have died in all wars since the American Revolution. Perhaps this is the gruesome price of freedom. The 2nd Amendment guarantees us the right to own a gun, and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld that right in two recent cases.

After a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease Dr. Richard Paul passed away. Richard was the founder and iconic force behind the [Foundation for Critical Thinking](http://www.criticalthinking.org/), headquartered in Sonoma County, California. This is going to sound like a strange way to begin a tribute, but in the 15 years that I knew him, Richard never taught me a thing. And yet I learned so much. In fact, it would be difficult to adequately describe the profound effect he and his work have had on my life. This notion about the differences between teaching and learning is one of the things that I took from my work with Richard and the Foundation. It is not a minor contrast in mindset or approach\u2014it affects everything. Learning is active, participative and rewards questioning. Perhaps most importantly, learning is how humans construct knowledge of the world. He saw the teacher as a coach to support learning and not an oracle of information to be pleased with predetermined correct answers. As he used to say, \"If the coach is sweating, there is a problem.\" It is the learner who should be doing the work. Many classrooms are unfortunately full of sweating teachers. So are conferences and other \"learning\" events. Dr. Paul saw critical thinking as a way of understanding thinking in general, applying standards to thinking, and where needed improving thinking. No one sets out to think poorly, of course, and yet we do. Critical thinking is an antidote to this problem. His conception of critical thinking was the most complete that I have encountered. Richard did not conceive of critical thinking as simply a tool for solving particular problems, but as a way of understanding and working on all of life with a purpose. That purpose was to make life better for the living. He felt that in order to achieve this purpose, critical thinking could [CONTINUE READING THIS POST...](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/richard-paul-tribute/#more-31509) Science a Critical Thinking Giant: Richard Paul (1937-2015)](#Tribute) [Announcement: CSI Names 10 New Scientists and Scholars as Fellows](#CSI) Brain Surgeon\u2014or Brain Addled? by Donald R.

But as the detailed investigation showed, he made all sorts of statements that showed his \"trip to heaven\" was a hallucination. Even worse, he said things demonstrating that he doesn't seem to know the first thing about neurophysiology; he appears to just know how to cut brains. Then there are other weird beliefs by otherwise well educated doctors. Take, for example, Dr. Paul Broun of Georgia. He was elected to Congress, yet he said \"All that stuff I was taught about evolution, embryology, Big Bang theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of hell. It's lies to try to keep me and all the folks who are taught that from understanding that they need a savior. There's a lot of scientific data that I found out as a scientist that actually show that this is really a young Earth. I believe that the Earth is about 9,000 years old. I believe that it was created in six days as we know them. That's what the Bible says.\" Unsurprisingly, Carson, Broun, and the other fundamentalist M.D.s in politics not only deny evolution and Big Bang cosmology, but also climate change and other aspects of science that doesn't fit the party line... TWO WONDERFEST HALLOWEEN EVENTS Skepticism & the Supernatural: A Dialogue 5 PM, Saturday, October 31, 2015 Brava Theater, 2781-24th Street, San Francisco Join Michael Shermer and Jamy Ian Swiss as they discuss the supernatural \u2014 on Halloween \u2014 with science and skepticism in mind. Halloween is the perfect day for a deep and magical dialogue on the supernatural! Michael Shermer is the founder of The Skeptics Society, and monthly contributor to Scientific American magazine. He has written many books, including [The Moral Arc](https://moralarc.org/) and [Why People Believe Weird Things](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b062PB), and he has appeared on The Colbert Report, Dateline, and Charlie Rose. Jamy Ian Swiss is a world-renowned magician and skeptic. He has been featured in print in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, and on television on 48 Hours, PBS's NOVA, The Today Show, and he was a comedy writer and chief magic consultant for Penn & Teller. The Official Houdini S\u00e9ance 8 PM, Saturday, October 31, 2015 Brava Theater, 2781-24th Street, San Francisco Can the greatest escape artist even escape death? In the spirit of scientific skepticism, two on-stage s\u00e9ances will summon the ghost of Harry Houdini \u2014 on Halloween, the anniversary of his death. The first s\u00e9ance will be earnest, conducted by a professional \"psychic medium.\" The second will be full of illusion and special effects, conducted by master magician Paul Draper. Other magicians will perform: Brian Brushwood, Robert Strong, and Justin Willman. Skeptics and scientists will speak: Michael Shermer, Jamy Ian Swiss, and Dr. Melina Uncapher (UCSF neuroscientist). Even if/when we don't make contact with the great Houdini, this spectacular event will be a memorable evening of science, skepticism, and wonderful magic. TICKETS: Order S\u00e9ance tickets via the [Kickstarter campaign](https://tinyurl.com/houdinikickstarter) for $29 each until the campaign ends at 11:59pm on Thursday, October 15, 2015 PDT. After that, tickets will be $39 via Eventbrite. NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COLUMN ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM The Electric Universe Acid Test: Discerning Science from Pseudoscience Newton was wrong. Einstein was wrong. Black holes do not exist. The big bang never happened. Dark energy and dark matter are unsubstantiated conjectures. Stars are electrically charged plasma masses. Venus was once a comet. The massive Valles Marineris canyon on Mars was carved out in a few minutes by a giant electric arc sweeping across the Red Planet. The \"thunderbolt\" icons found in ancient art and petroglyphs are not the iconography of imagined gods but realistic representations of spectacular electrical activity in space. These are just a few of the things I learned at the Electric Universe conference (EU2015) in June in Phoenix. The Electric Universe community is a loose confederation of people who, according to the host organization's website, believe that \"a new way of seeing the physical universe is emerging. The new vantage point emphasizes the role of electricity in space and shows the negligible contribution of gravity in cosmic events.\" This includes everything from comets, moons and planets to stars, galaxies and galactic clusters. I was invited to speak on the difference between science and pseudoscience...

After a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease Dr. Richard Paul passed away. Richard was the founder and iconic force behind the Foundation for Critical Thinking, headquartered in Sonoma County, California. This is going to sound like a strange way to begin a tribute, but in the 15 years that I knew him, Richard never taught me a thing. And yet I learned so much. In fact, it would be difficult to adequately describe the profound effect he and his work have had on my life. This notion about the differences between teaching and learning is one of the things that I took from my work with Richard and the Foundation. It is not a minor contrast in mindset or approach\u2014it affects everything. Learning is active, participative and rewards questioning. Perhaps most importantly, learning is how humans construct knowledge of the world. He saw the teacher as a coach to support learning and not an oracle of information to be pleased with predetermined correct answers. As he used to say, \"If the coach is sweating, there is a problem.\" It is the learner who should be doing the work. Many classrooms are unfortunately full of sweating teachers. So are conferences and other \"learning\" events... ANNOUNCEMENT Two of Skeptic's Own Named CSI Fellows The Skeptics Society is pleased to announce that Skeptic Magazine Contributing Editor Donald R. Prothero, and Junior Skeptic Editor Daniel Loxton have been elected as Fellows of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) among ten distinguished scientists, scholars, educators, and investigators from five countries. Other newly selected fellows include: John Cook, Krista Federspiel, Julia Galef, Stephan Naomi Oreskes, James L. Powell, Stuart Vyse. Fellows of CSI are selected for their \"distinguished contributions to science and skepticism.\" These new fellows join a list of notable CSI fellows that includes: astronomers Neil de Grasse Tyson and Jill Tarter; biologists Richard Dawkins and E.O. Wilson; Nobel laureate physicists or chemists Leon Lederman, Murray Gell-Mann, Steven Weinberg, and Sir Harry Kroto; philosophers Daniel C. Dennett, Susan Haack, and Mario Bunge; anthropologist Eugenie C. Scott; psychologists James Alcock, Ray Hyman, Steven Pinker, and Richard Wiseman; magician/author James Randi; science educator and television host Bill Nye; Cosmos creator/writer Ann Druyan; plus many prominent physicians and medical scientists who critique questionable medical claims. About Prothero and Loxton Donald R. Prothero is a paleontologist and geologist associated with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a prolific writer and author. He received his PhD in the geological sciences from Columbia University. His scientific specialty has been mammalian paleontology. He became involved with the skeptical movement in the early 1980s defending evolution and later serving on the editorial board of The Skeptics Society. His trade books include [Evolution](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b127HB) (2007), [Catastrophes!](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b147HB) (2011), [Reality Check: How Climate [Abominable Science!](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b150HB) (with Daniel Loxton), and [The Story of Life in 25 Fossils](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231171900/?tag=skepticcom20-20) (2015). He's also written six geology textbooks, including [Evolution of the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0072826843/?tag=skepticcom20-20), in its sixth edition. Recent awards include the Shea Award (2013) for writing in geoscience and the Gregory Award (2015) for service to vertebrate paleontology. Daniel Loxton is editor of the Junior Skeptic section in Skeptic magazine, and a Canadian writer and artist. He is lead author (with Donald Prothero) of the 2013 book [Abominable Science!](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b150HB), a scientific look at cryptozoology heralded as one of the best books about the origins of myths about Yeti, Nessie, and other famous cryptids. His book [Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b136HB) won the $10,000 Lane Anderson Award, Canada's top national award specific to children's science writing. His book [Pterosaur Trouble](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b149HB) won the $5,000 Bolen Books Children's Book Prize at the Victoria Book Awards. Loxton has also become a kind of unofficial historian of the modern skeptical movement, with online papers such as \" [Why Is There a Skeptical Movement?](https://www.skeptic.com/downloads/Why-Is-There-a-Skeptical-Movement.pdf)\" (2014) exploring the roots, founding principles, and purposes of scientific skepticism. of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time. What is it with brain surgeons? The strange ideas of leading GOP presidential candidate and retired brain surgeon Ben Carson have been making the headlines a lot lately. I have [previously written](https://www.skeptic.com/insight/proof-of-heaven/) about about brain surgeon Dr. Eben Alexander, who launched a new career on the lecture circuit after writing a bestselling book, [Proof of Heaven](https://www.skeptic.com/insight/proof-of-heaven/), in which he claimed he visited heaven while in a coma, then come back to life.

The debate will eventually be posted online for viewing. In the meantime, in this week's eSkeptic, we present Michael Shermer's notes for the debate. Michael did not have time to cover the morality of the New Testament (compared to the Old) but we include his notes here nonetheless in case readers would like to use this material. Much of it comes from his book [The Moral Arc](https://moralarc.org/). The Battle in Seattle Do We Need God? by Michael Shermer Do We Need God? No. Thank you. Okay, seriously, there are at least 10 reasons why we do not need God... 1. Ben Carson, or Religious Ignorance. Only belief in God could infect a brain as smart as the renowned neurosurgeon and prominent Presidential candidate Ben Carson to mangle the Big Bang theory and preposterously propose that Darwin's theory of evolution is a trick of Satan. 2. Kim Davis, or Religious Bigotry. Only belief in God could convince an otherwise decent and loyal civil servant that her personal interpretation of the Bible trumps the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the law of the land. 3. ISIS, Al Qaeda, & Islamism, or Religious Extremism. Only belief in God could lead large groups of people to believe that the most moral thing they can do is to murder people in the most gruesome manner imaginable\u2014beheading\u2014anyone who does not believe their barbaric and primitive religious tenets, such as capital punishment for apostasy. 4. Crusades, Witch Hunts, and Wars, or Religious Violence. Only belief in God could lie behind these catastrophic moral blunders: the Crusades (the People's Crusade, the Northern Crusade, the Albigensian Crusade, and Crusades One through Nine); the Inquisitions (Spanish, Portuguese, and Roman); witch hunts (the execution of tens of thousands of people, mostly women); Christian conquistadors (extermination of native peoples by the millions); the interminable European Wars of Religion (the Nine Years War, the Thirty Years War, the Eighty Years War, the French Wars of Religion, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the English Civil War); the American Civil War (in which Northern Christians and Southern Christians slaughtered one another over the issue of slavery); and the First World War (in which German Christians fought French, British, and American Christians, all of whom believed that God was on their side\u2014German soldiers, for example, had Gott mit uns\u2014God with us\u2014embossed on their belt buckles.) And that's just in the Western world. There are the seemingly endless religious conflicts in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, numerous countries in Africa, and of course Islamist terrorism. 5. Slavery and Civil Rights, or Religious Intolerance. Only belief in God kept the slave trade alive through religious and biblical arguments that blacks were inferior to whites, that slavery was good for black souls, that slavery gave blacks civilization, that blacks liked being enslaved, or, later, that blacks should not have the same civil rights as whites (such as equal treatment under the law\u2014interracial marriage was illegal until 1967) simply because the pigment in their skin was darker. 6. Women's Rights, or Religious Suppression. Only belief in God would lead otherwise good men to think that women should not have the same rights as they, which is what almost all Christians believed until the women's rights movement of the 20th century (and many today still believe in wanting to control women's sexuality and reproductive choices). Like the meddling Puritanical control freaks of the Early Modern Period there are still men today who think they should decide what women do with their vagina. Women flourish in societies that are either not very religious or those, like the United States, that have separation of church and state; i.e., less religion equals more rights and equality. 7. Gay Rights, or Religious Moralizing. Only belief in God could cause otherwise decent Christians to become perversely obsessed with what other people do with their genitals in the privacy of their bedrooms, and that if these people don't insert their genitals into the biblically correct orifice, or if genitals are stimulated in a biblically unapproved manner, they should not have the same Constitutional rights as straights. 8. Tribalism, or Religious Xenophobia. The world's religions are tribal and xenophobic by nature, serving to regulate moral rules within the community but not seeking to embrace humanity outside their circle. Religion, by definition, forms an identity of those like us, in sharp distinction from those not us, those heathens, those unbelievers. Most religions were pulled into the modern Enlightenment with their fingernails dug into the past. Change in religious beliefs and practices, when it happens at all, is slow and cumbersome, and it is almost always in response to the church or its leaders facing outside political or cultural forces (slavery, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights). 9. Absolutism, or Religious Dogmatism. The foundation of the belief in an Absolute Morality is the belief in an Absolute Religion grounded in the One True God. This inexorably leads to the conclusion that anyone who believes differently has departed from The Truth and thus is unprotected by our moral obligations; even more, they must be forced to see the Way, the Truth, and the Light. Unlike science, religion has no systematic process and no empirical method to employ to determine the verisimilitude of its claims and beliefs, much less right and wrong, so it can never self-correct its mistakes, which are legion. 10. Preposterous Moral Rules, or Religious Immorality. The morality of holy books\u2014most notably the Bible\u2014is not the morality any of us would wish to live by. Put into historical context, the Bible's moral prescriptions were for another time for another people and have little relevance for us today. In order to make the Bible relevant, believers must pick and choose biblical passages that suit their needs; thus the game of cherry picking from the Bible generally works to the advantage of the cherry pickers. In the Old Testament, for example, the believer might find guidance in Deuteronomy 5:17, which says, \"Thou shalt not kill\"; or in Exodus 22:21: \"You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" But the handful of positive moral commands are desultory and scattered among a sea of violent stories of murder, rape, torture, slavery, and all manner of violence, such as occurs in Deuteronomy 20:10-18, in which Yahweh instructs the Israelites on the precise etiquette of conquering another tribe: When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it. And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you. But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it; and when the LORD your God gives it into your hand you shall put all its males to the sword, but the women and the little ones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty for yourselves.... Nice. Or consider what Moses did with an army of 12,000 troops Numbers, 31:7-12: They warred against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and slew every male. They slew the kings of Midian ... And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and they took as booty all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods. All their cities in the places where they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burned with fire, and took all the spoil and all the booty, both of man and of beast. Then they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses. That sounds like a good days pillaging, but when the troops got back, Moses was furious. \"What do you mean you didn't kill the women?\" he asked, exasperated, since it was apparently the women who had enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful with another God. Moses then ordered them to kill all the women who had slept with a man. \"But save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man,\" he commanded, predictably, at which point one can imagine the thirty-two thousand virgins who'd been taken captive rolling their eyes and saying, \"Oh, God told you to do that, did he? Right.\" Was the instruction to \"keep the virgins for yourselves\" what God had in mind by the word \"love\" in the \"love thy neighbor\" command? I think not. Of course, the Israelites knew exactly what God meant (this is the advantage of writing scripture yourself\u2014you get to say what God meant) and they acted accordingly, fighting for the survival of their people. With a vengeance. What about the New Testament? The angry, vengeful God Yahweh of the Old Testament, Christians claim, was displaced by the kinder, gentler New Testament God in the form of meek and mild Jesus, who two millennia ago introduced a new and improved moral code. Turning the other cheek, loving one's enemies, forgiving sinners, and giving to the poor sounds like a great leap forward in moral progress. Yet, nowhere in the New Testament does Jesus revoke God's ludicrous laws. In fact, quite the opposite (Matthew 5:17-30 passim): \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\" Jesus doesn't even try to edit the commandments or soften them up: \"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\" In fact, if anything, Jesus' morality is even more draconian than that of the Old Testament: \"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.\" In other words, even thinking about killing someone is a capital offense. In fact, Jesus elevated thought crimes to an Orwellian new level (Matthew 9:28-29): \"Ye have heard it was said by them of old time, Though shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" And if you don't think you can control your sexual impulses Jesus has a practical solution: \"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\" May I see a show of hands of those who agree with this moral precept? As for Jesus's own family values, he never married, never had children, and he turned away his own mother time and again. For example, at a wedding feast Jesus says to her (John 2:4): \"Woman, what have I to do with you?\" One biblical anecdote recounts the time that Mary waited patiently off to the side for Jesus to finish speaking so that she could have a moment with him, but Jesus told his disciples, \"Send her away, you are my family now,\" adding (Luke 14:26): \"Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.\" Charming. This is what cultists do when they separate followers from their families in order to control both their thoughts and their actions, as when Jesus calls to his flock to follow him or else (John 15:4-7): \"Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.\" But if a believer abandons his family and gives away his belongings (Mark 10:30), \"he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands.\" In other passages Jesus also sounds like the tribal warlords of the Old Testament: Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one's foes will be members of one's own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. (Matthew 10:34-39) Even sincere Christians cannot agree on Jesus' morality and the moral codes in the New Testament, holding legitimate differences of opinion on a number of moral issues that remain unresolved based on biblical scripture alone. These include dietary restrictions and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine; masturbation, pre-marital sex, contraception, and abortion; marriage, divorce, and sexuality; the role of women; capital punishment and voluntary euthanasia; gambling and other vices; international and civil wars; and many other matters of contention that were nowhere in sight when the Bible was written, such as stem-cell research, gay marriage, and the like. Indeed, the fact that Christians, as a community, keep arguing over their own contemporary question \"WWJD\" (What Would Jesus Do?) is evidence that the New Testament is silent on the answer. Middle Statement Empirically speaking we can see why we don't need God: - Millions of Americans have no belief in God whatsoever, and 10s of millions have no religion and they're doing just fine. There are no measures that believers are more moral than non-believers. - Tens of millions of people in many Northern European countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Holland, and Germany have no belief in God or religion and not only are they doing just fine, by any measure they are far healthier societies than the most religious nation in the Western world: America. - Gregory S. Paul study: 17 first-world prosperous democracies in the Successful Societies Scale database (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States). 25 indicators of social health and well being 1-9 scale: homicides, suicides, incarceration, life expectancy, gonorrhea and syphilis infections, abortions, teen births, fertility, marriage, divorce, alcohol consumption, life satisfaction, corruption rates, adjusted per capita income, income inequality, poverty, unemployment. - Religiosity 1-10 scale: belief in God, biblical literalism, church attendance, prayer frequency, belief in an afterlife, and belief in heaven and hell. - U.S. most religious by far & highest rates of homicides, suicides, incarceration rates, STD rates, teen pregnancy rates, abortion rates, divorce rates, income inequality rates & poverty rates. - If belief in God & religion is such a powerful force for societal health, then why is America\u2014the most religious nation in the Western world\u2014also the unhealthiest on all of these social measures? If religion makes people more moral, then why is America seemingly so immoral in its lack of concern for its poorest, most troubled citizens, notably its children? Concluding Statement (From Chapter 4 of The Moral Arc) The Bible is one of the most immoral works in all literature. Woven throughout begats and chronicles, laws and customs, is a narrative of accounts written by, and about, a bunch of Middle Eastern tribal warlords who constantly fight over land and women, with the victors taking dominion over both. It features a jealous and vengeful God named Yahweh who decides to punish women for all eternity with the often intolerable pain of childbirth, and further condemns them to be little more than beasts of burden and sex slaves for the victorious warlords. Why were women to be chastened this way? Why did they deserve an eternity of misery and submission? It was all for that one terrible sin, the first crime ever recorded in the history of humanity\u2014a thought crime no less\u2014when that audacious autodidact Eve dared to educate herself by partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Worse, she inveigled the first man\u2014the unsuspecting Adam\u2014to join her in choosing knowledge over ignorance. For the appalling crime of hearkening unto the voice of his wife, Yahweh condemned Adam to toil in thorn and thistle-infested fields, and further condemned him to death, to return to the dust from whence he came. Yahweh then cast his first two delinquent children out of paradise, setting a Cherubim and a flaming sword at the entrance to be certain that they could never return. Then, in one of the many foul moods he was wont to fall into, Yahweh committed an epic hemoclysm of genocidal proportions by killing every sentient being on Earth\u2014including unsuspecting adults, innocent children, and all the land animals\u2014in a massive flood. In order to repopulate the planet after he decimated it of all life save those spared in the ark, Yahweh commanded the survivors\u2014numerous times\u2014to \"be fruitful and multiply,\" and rewarded his favorite warlords with as many wives as they desired. Thus was born the practice of polygamy and the keeping of harems, fully embraced and endorsed\u2014along with slavery\u2014in the so-called \"good book.\" As an exercise in moral casuistry, this perspective-taking question comes to mind: did anyone ask the women how they felt about this arrangement? What about the millions of people living in other parts of the world who had never heard of Yahweh? What about the animals and the innocent children who drowned in the flood? What did they do to deserve such a final solution to Yahweh's anger problem? Many Christians say that they get their morality from the Bible, but this cannot be true because as holy books go the Bible is possibly the most unhelpful guide ever written for determining right from wrong. It's chockfull of bizarre stories about dysfunctional families, advice about how to beat your slaves, how to kill your headstrong kids, how to sell your virgin daughters, and other clearly outdated practices that most cultures gave up centuries ago. It's time we all gave it up now. Won't you join me?

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Dave Navarick's article \" [The 'God' Construct: A Testable Hypothesis for Unifying Science and Theology](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/),\" which appeared in [Skeptic magazine 20.3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.3/) (2015). If you havent yet read that article, you may want to [read it first](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/), then come back here and read Matson's challenge (below), followed by [Navarick's response](#Navarick-responds). Debating The \"God\" Construct by Dave E. Matson Douglas Navarick has obviously given some thought to \" [The 'God' Construct](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/),\" but the howlers I encountered robbed it of any credibility. For example: \"Abiogenesis must be considered speculative considering that every cell ever observed has come from another living cell.\" I have yet to hear anyone in the science of abiogenesis claim that a living cell could appear naturally from scratch without benefit of prior cells! Given the complexity of even the simplest prokaryotes, such a claim would be preposterous. The goal of abiogenists is to recover the long pathway that eventually led to the first cells. If that is no longer possible, then the hope is to discover workable pathways. Navarick's demand that abiogenists produce a living cell from scratch, comparing that to the failure to find compelling evidence for ESP, demonstrates a profound ignorance of abiogenesis. Yes, cells come from cells even as cats come from cats. However, the conclusion that cats cannot credibly come from non-cats (based on the observation that every single cat studied traces to a prior cat) is absurd in the light of evolution. Here we have a perfect analogy to Navarick's attempt to discredit abiogenesis! Abiogenists will never witness a cell arising naturally from scratch; we will never observe evolution producing a cat from scratch. Neither predicts as much. Either path is a long, winding story! Navarick derides abiogenesis for lacking a mechanism. In fact, there are plausible mechanisms now being sketched out. One can hardly expect all the bugs to be ironed out at this early stage; it's a difficult field. Plausible mechanisms, complete with problems, are all that any science has to work with in exploring new areas. Do not confuse plausible mechanisms (with their inevitable problems) with \"no mechanism in sight.\" The reason for keeping a supernatural deity out of science is that God is an ad hoc story that is compatible with everything and, therefore, explains nothing! Opening the door to supernatural \"explanations\" of any kind, which by definition cannot be investigated by the laws of nature\u2014the only tool box we have\u2014would turn science into a debating society unable to settle anything. We need not be dogmatic. If we observed a swimming pool that froze solid after the last person left, and became usable the instant someone jumped in, we might reasonably call it a \"supernatural\" event! However, we can't even assume that such an event had a cause (let alone an intelligent, living cause) since that falls back on natural principles that might not apply to a supernatural event. Even if a supernatural event could somehow be certified, it could never be a part of any scientific explanation. It would forever be an isolated, odd-man-out fact sitting in a corner by itself. Any demand that scientific explanation include the supernatural is, therefore, totally wrong-headed. Navarick's minimalist construct of God is \"A force that operates through and independently of natural laws.\" Natural law is our best verification, within an appropriate range of measurement, as to what nature actually does. It is supported by countless laboratory experiments that are often done with unimaginable accuracy, and many experiments are conducted under extreme conditions. These experiments and measurements are done by highly trained observers who follow each others' work in scientific journals, who are inclined to check the more interesting results by duplicating the experiments. To claim that a force exists that is not bound by natural law is to throw out the best attested facts in the world in favor of rank speculation! If Navarick's unclear statement does not advocate the occasional suspension of natural law, then he must shear God of his super-powers. God then becomes another fixture in the natural world. In reply to Stenger's statement that there is no reason to assume that life could not have come from non-life, Navarick adds \"But there is also no reason to assume that life could not have come from a supernatural source.\" With every bit as much evidence, namely zero, we could have said \"There is no reason to assume that life could not have come from a hair-brained Easter Bunny with magical powers!\" Logically possible, I suppose, along with Bertrand Russell's orbiting teapot, but hardly credible. Yet, if the Easter Bunny idea had an army of apologists refining it for two thousand years, if it were a part of everyone's upbringing, it would have been the respectable story and God the silly one. In that sense the supernatural is not a legitimate alternative; it commands no more evidence than our hair-brained Easter Bunny. Countless apologetic works\u2014complete with the usual errors, plus huge amounts of wishful thinking and cultural acceptance\u2014do not establish scientific credibility. Presently, after we subtract the wishful thinking, and the naive thinking, scientific evidence for God is no better than that for a hair-brained Easter Bunny who possesses magical powers. The \"assumption\" that abiogenesis will eventually show how life emerged from non-life should be seen as a practical conclusion rather than a philosophical dictum. Scientists who seek a career in abiogenesis do so precisely because the evidence is so suggestive, virtually begging for scientific explanations to connect the dots. These guys are not running on dogmatic gas despite some careless statements! They are motivated by evidence, evidence strong enough to risk a career on. In sum, current problems in abiogenesis cannot be taken as support for a supernatural \"alternative.\" At present, to the extent that it is even a coherent concept, the supernatural is not a credible alternative at all. Evidentially\u2014as in \"zip\"\u2014it is on par with our hair-brained Easter Bunny sporting magical powers. Insightful theologians will often admit that God must be taken on faith, and science can't run on that kind of faith. Therefore, trying to unify science and theology is like trying to unify apples and oranges. If they are squeezed together to such an extent that you can no longer tell the difference, then we no longer have apples and oranges. We have a mess! About the Author Dave E. Matson, a navy veteran and former programmer for Hughes Aircraft Company, graduated from San Diego State University in mathematics, his enthusiasm for the sciences almost supplying enough credits for an additional degree. Another major interest took in the study of Christian apologetics and creationist arguments which led to various informal publications scattered about the Internet, a study that gave him some feeling for epistemology (how we know). In recent years a continuing study of the sciences (introductory university textbooks\u2014fat, serious, and still fun) with morning tea went hand in hand with photographing wild flowers throughout Southern California. Occasionally, Mr. Matson will drag out his ancient telescope (Celestron 5) to view some event, usually with a few friends, and he is always good for a vigorous game of chess. Abiogenesis: Hypothesis or Doctrine? by Douglas J. Navarick Matson's objections to my article are based largely on misinterpretations of it and a gross oversimplification of the \"God\" construct, confusing it with stock conceptions of the supernatural and failing to recognize its potential for integrating diverse lines of research and for suggesting new insights. Listed below are my replies to Matson's objections. 1. Complexity of chemical precursors. Matson writes, \"Navarick's demand that abiogenists produce a living cell from scratch, comparing that to the failure to find compelling evidence for ESP, demonstrates a profound ignorance of abiogenesis.\" I never demanded that researchers produce a living cell from \"scratch.\" As shown in the second row of the table in my article, I considered evidence for the revival of dead cells. The level of chemical complexity that researchers started from was irrelevant. What mattered was creating life out of nonliving matter. The source of this misinterpretation may be that for the first row of the table, creating a living cell from chemicals, I highlighted the famous line of research beginning with the Miller-Urey experiments on producing amino acids from inorganic chemicals. However, the next row of the table, never mentioned by Matson, shows that I intended to include the broadest possible range of chemical precursors to life. As for the ESP comparison, the evidence for ESP is arguably even stronger than that for abiogenesis. For ESP the evidence ranges from non-existent to weak (Daryl Bem's studies: statistically questionable and many failures to replicate but something may be there) whereas for abiogenesis the evidence is, for now, simply non-existent. I have not attempted to \"discredit\" abiogenesis as Matson claims. My goal has been to challenge the treatment of abiogenesis as an unassailable doctrine and return it its former status as a testable hypothesis as conceptualized by the originator of the term, Thomas H. Huxley, in a presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870: And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine\u2014that living matter may be produced by not living matter\u2014the hypothesis of Abiogenesis. [1] Biogenesis can be refuted by a demonstration of abiogenesis. What would it take to refute abiogenesis, or at least make it seem less plausible? If no contrary evidence was possible\u2014if 100 more years could pass without a demonstration of abiogenesis and yet it remained as believable as ever\u2014then clearly it would be functioning as doctrines do in religions, as sources of comfort for the faithful, insulated from the harsh realities of empirical testing. It seems to be serving that function now. Calling abiogenesis a \"practical conclusion rather than a philosophical dictum\" does not make it any less a doctrine. 2. Building the \"God\" construct, one empirical step at a time. Matson writes, \"the supernatural is not a legitimate alternative; it commands no more evidence than our hair-brained Easter Bunny.\" My article shows how the \"God\" construct can be elaborated in the same way as any construct in science, by adding properties to it based on empirical evidence. The initial statement of the construct was simply, A force that operates both through and independently of natural laws. The evidence (not proof) against abiogenesis implies that this force is also creative; it makes things. In addition, the evidence against multiple genesis events discussed in my article implies that random processes may not have been responsible for producing the first living cell. The alternative to random in this context would be willful. So a tentative, more elaborated version of the \"God\" construct could be stated as follows: A willful, creative force that operates both through and independently of natural laws. Each property is tied to empirical observations and subject to falsification. In addition, the \"God\" construct makes stronger predictions than the widely accepted, materialist alternative: The \"God\" construct predicts that efforts to create a living cell, no matter how sophisticated, will fail. Researchers doing these studies may be working on \"plausible\" ideas about the underyling mechanisms but no one could predict that any particular mechanism would work. The same strong predictions apply to searches for shadow life on earth (weird organisms that came from a different genesis event than all known organisms) and searches for life elsewhere in the universe, including SETI, newly rejuvenated by a $100 million grant from Russian physicist and entrepreneur, Yuri Milner, for a 10-year multifaceted project called Breakthrough Listen. If after 10 years of Breakthrough Listen projects there was still no evidence for life beyond earth, how should those 10 years of negative results be interpreted, as evidence of absence or as absence of evidence? In item 5, below, I will propose an additional property for the \"God\" construct based on empirical evidence, transcendence. It's a crucial step because it serves to distinguish between chemical and non-material characterizations of life. 3. Cats from non-cats = ? Matson's next paragraph about the cats coming from non-cats constructs bizarre analogies to make an unnecessary point. The disagreement Matson is expressing is with an argument I didn't make. I did not suggest that the only acceptable evidence for abiogenesis would be to reconstruct the convoluted molecular pathways that supposedly led to the first living cell. Any strategy that created life out of non-life would settle the issue. 4. A multiplicity of ideas about mechanisms. Matson writes, \"Navarick derides abiogenesis for lacking a mechanism.\" What I actually said was that there was \"no clearly established mechanism.\" If, as Matson suggests, researchers have plausible ideas about underlying mechanisms, then we are not yet at the stage where there is a clearly established mechanism. 5. The next step: Is life an emergent or transcendent property of cells? Life is generally seen as an emergent property of the structures and biochemical reactions that make up living cells and not the product of any specific parts of the whole. [2](#note02) Emergent means that a phenomenon depends on the relationships that exist among a set of elements. For example, in psychology there is the famous phi phenomenon that Gestalt psychologists used to support their principle that \"the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\" When two lights are turned on and off in rapid alternation, they are perceived as one light moving back and forth and not as two blinking lights. In our world of perception, 1 blinking light + 1 blinking do not equal 2 blinking lights. The appearance of movement is an emergent property of the temporal relationship between the two flashes of light. For living cells, the \"God\" construct suggests a non-material alternative to emergence\u2014transcendence. It is suggested here that life may be an add-on to the cell, an independent property that acts as a catalyst and allows biochemical reactions to occur without itself participating in those reactions. Life precedes the reactions; it does not result from them. Is the transcendence principle just one more instance of the \"rank speculation\" that some see as part and parcel of any concept of the supernatural? Consider the following evidence. Cryopreservation is a process of preserving living cells and tissues by freezing them in a way that keeps them structurally intact, i.e., prevents ice crystals from forming that could damage the cell wall. A wide variety of cells is routinely preserved in this manner, including fungi, bacteria, stem cells, oocytes, sperm cells, and embryos. All or most biochemical activity ceases in cryopreservation but the cells remain alive. As stated by D. E. Pegg [3](#note03) in an article on the methodology of cryopreservation, \"Unprotected freezing is normally lethal...#8221; but by adopting appropriate procedures \"cooling can be used to produce stable conditions that preserve life.\" Cells that remain alive in the absence of biochemical activity are evidence that life is not a product of, or equivalent to, biochemical activity. As the cell is thawed, the pre-existing property of life enables biochemical activity to resume. It is in this sense that life acts as a catalyst for the cell's biochemical reactions. In light of this evidence, we may further elaborate the \"God\" construct as follows: A willful, creative force that transcends material reality and operates both through and independently of natural laws.

Navarick](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| [Comments (22)](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-god-construct-a-testable-hypothesis-for-unifying-science-and-theology/#comments) In this article from [Skeptic magazine 20.3](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.3/) (2015), California State University, Fullerton Psychology Professor Douglas J. Navarick presents the case that the current pattern of evidence for the origin of life is consistent with the interpretation that life started just once in one place and was not the result of natural and random processes. Although philosophers and scientists have long struggled to define \"life,\" most scientists would probably agree with astrobiologist Caleb Scharf [1](#note01) that \"it's a \"natural\" means \"material\" and \"supernatural\" means \"non-material.\" So if we concurred with Scharf's view, we would essentially be saying that life is reducible to material reality, to the elementary particles that make up matter and energy and operate in accordance with the laws of physics. But if we weighed the evidence from diverse lines of research on the origin of life (as distinct from the origin of species after life started, and defining life in terms of a living cell meeting all seven of the generally recognized criteria for life), the evidence arguably could point us in precisely the opposite direction\u2014toward a supernatural force that animates the machinery of living cells in accordance with the laws of physics but is itself not constrained by those laws. In other words, the evidence could point us back to [CONTINUE READING eSkeptic: Sea and whales! Oh my!

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Harriet Hall examines the [statements about vaccines](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/16/annotated-transcript-september-16-gop-debate/) made by four candidates in the recent GOP debate. They all demonstrated a poor grasp of vaccine science, and advocated delays in the vaccine schedule that would represent a danger to the young, the immunocompromised, and to the herd immunity that is a mainstay of our public health. Dr. Harriet Hall, MD, the SkepDoc, is a retired family physician and Air Force Colonel living in Puyallup, WA. She writes about alternative medicine, pseudoscience, quackery, and critical thinking. She is a contributing editor to both Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, an advisor to the Quackwatch website, and an editor of Sciencebasedmedicine.org, where she writes an article every Tuesday. She is author of [Women Aren't Supposed to Fly: The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon](http://amzn.com/0595499589?tag=skepticcom20-20). Her website is [www.skepdoc.info](http://www.skepdoc.info/). Fact-Checking Vaccine Statements in the GOP Debate by Harriet Hall, M.D., The SkepDoc 1. Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, said that there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated any correlation between vaccines and autism. TRUE. He said certain vaccines are very important: those that would prevent death or crippling. He said others don't fit in that category. FALSE. Although some vaccine-preventable diseases have the potential to do more harm than others, there is not a single vaccine that doesn't prevent a disease that can cripple or kill a percentage of its victims. He said there should be some discretion. NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. There is no reason to think \"discretion\" is warranted in following the recommended vaccine schedule, and there is clear evidence that not following the recommendations can lead to harm. If vaccines are delayed, the infant remains susceptible to a preventable disease until the vaccine is given. Decreasing the number of vaccinated children decreases the herd immunity of the entire population. It means that when a disease enters a community it is more likely to spread, and that harms 3 categories of people: infants too young to have been vaccinated for that disease; sick, elderly, and immunocompromised people who are more susceptible to infection and more likely to sustain serious harm if they catch the disease; and the small percentage of immunized people who may still be susceptible despite the vaccines, which are not 100% protective. He said \"but you know, a lot of this is pushed by big government.\" NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. In fact, I don't even know what he means. It is not \"big government\" that supports the current vaccine schedule, but the scientific and medical community. 2. Trump responded to Carson, saying autism has become an epidemic that has gotten totally out of control. FALSE. Most scientists interpret the evidence as showing the rate of autism has risen very little or not at all. The perception of an \"epidemic\" is due to wider awareness of the disorder, better identification of patients, and re-categorization of children who formerly would have had a different diagnosis. He said he was in favor of vaccines, but he wanted smaller doses over a longer period of time. NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. We know smaller doses would be ineffective or less effective, and there is no reason to think any advantage would accrue from spreading doses over a longer period of time. The current schedule has been carefully thought out by experts to provide maximum benefit and safety. He compared vaccinating infants to pumping in doses that look like they were meant for a horse. FALSE. Exaggeration for emotional effect. What a vaccine \"looks like\" has little to do with the number of antigens it contains. The volume of material injected is actually very small, both for infants and for horses. He claimed to know of several instances where vaccines hurt children, describing a beautiful 2\u00bd year old child who got a vaccine and a week later had a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, and is now autistic. FALSE. Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, more than 5000 families have sought compensation claiming that vaccines caused their children to become autistic, but the courts examined the most striking cases and found that even in those worst cases, there was no evidence that the vaccines had caused autism. The [details can be found online](http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/overview.shtml). 1a. Carson responded to Trump, agreeing with him that we are probably giving way too many vaccines in too short a period of time. He said \"a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and, I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.\" FALSE. It is never appropriate to deviate from the recommended schedule without a very good medical reason for a particular individual. Those pediatricians are bowing to parental pressure and doing the children a disservice. The [\"too many too soon\" argument is fallacious](http://shotofprevention.com/2013/03/29/study-concludes-concern-over-too-many-too-soon-is-unfounded/). Babies' immune systems are more than capable of handling the number of antigens in vaccines, and in fact their immune systems encounter far more antigens in the course of their daily life. Vaccines don't overload the immune system, they exercise and strengthen it. 3. Paul, an eye surgeon, said he was all for vaccines but he was also for freedom. \"Even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.\" IRRELEVANT. One of the principles of medical ethics is autonomy: patients always have the right to refuse treatment, even if it means they will die. We have freedom with respect to vaccines; no one is forcibly restraining people and vaccinating them without their permission. No one is being forced to get vaccines on schedule. People have the freedom to act on the basis of emotion rather than reason, even though spreading out vaccines is more likely to harm them than to benefit them. 4. Huckabee said \"there are maybe some controversies about autism...\" FALSE. There is no controversy about autism in the scientific medical community. There is only a \" [manufactroversy](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-06-03/#feature)\" about vaccines that has been sold to a scientifically illiterate public. \"...but there is no controversy about the things that are really driving the medical costs in this country.\" And he called for a war on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. IRRELEVANT. A blatant attempt to change the subject. What I wish they had said There is no evidence that vaccines cause autism. Vaccinating is safer than not vaccinating. The current vaccine schedule was carefully thought out by experts to safely maximize protection from vaccine-preventable diseases. I strongly recommend vaccinating on schedule because it protects others in the community and reduces the risk of avoidable tragedies like the recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland. These attitudes are bad enough coming from the scientifically illiterate, but it is shocking that two of the candidates are medical doctors whose education should have given them a more science-based approach. Worse, Carson is a creationist who has rejected some of the fundamental tenets of Darwinian evolution as \"incredible fairy tales,\" has claimed that mutations only lead to degeneration rather than improvement, and has [claimed that there are no intermediate species](http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/ben-carson-evolution-life-evolve-non-life-incredible-fairy-tales). As the world faces current and future challenges like climate change and epidemic infectious diseases, a solid understanding of science will be essential to making rational political decisions. The GOP debate was not grounds for optimism. THE BATTLE IN SEATTLE Michael Shermer v. Larry Taunton September 30, 2015 at 7 PM Benaroya Hall, Seattle Tickets: 206-215-4747 Fixed Point Foundation, a non-profit based in Birmingham, Alabama, revives an age-old question in the form of a debate - Do we need God? Michael Shermer of Skeptic magazine and Larry Taunton of Fixed Point Foundation meet at Benaroya Hall on September 30 to address whether the concept of God is beneficial or detrimental to society. Exploring the effects of the idea of God on humanity will bring these two participants to consider a variety of issues, including human suffering, morality, and meaning. With backgrounds in education and history, both Taunton and Shermer are well prepared to explore all of these topics, particularly as each relates to religion. Larry Taunton, Founder and Executive Director of Fixed Point Foundation, is a cultural commentator, columnist, author, and regular contributor to The Atlantic and USA Today. He is a frequent television and radio guest, appearing on CNN, CNN International, Fox News, Al Jazeera America, and BBC. Taunton's book, The Grace Effect, is a powerful and personal account of the effect one Christian can have on a spiritually dead culture. In it, he argues that without the Christian ideals of love, forgiveness, and grace, a society will quickly become the author of its own demise. According to Taunton, \"Every meaningful movement in the history of the West has been fueled by Christianity... because they all appealed to a higher law.\" God, he believes, is far from irrelevant. [Download more biographical details (PDF)](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/2015/images/15-09-02/Shermer-Taunton-bios.pdf). Michael Shermer, taking an opposing stance, asserts that religion is largely to blame for some of the worst atrocities in human history. His latest book, [The Moral Arc](https://moralarc.org/), maintains that science and reason will lead us to a virtuous and increasingly moral existence. According to Shermer, we are \"getting better at solving problems\" as we continue to evolve. A New York Times best-selling author, Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and has written thirteen books. He is also a monthly columnist for Scientific American, regular contributor to Time.com, and a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University. When he isn't writing or teaching, he travels frequently to speak and debate on a variety of topics.

Those of the opinion that man has 'outgrown' a need for God, and those who think that God provides the very moral foundation on which our society is based are both ensured a thoughtful and spirited exchange.

In this insightful look into the future Carol Tavris, one of today's most prominent social scientists and psychologists, considers how blinded we all are to the influences of the times in which we live. Dr. Ian Morris On the Future of War and Human Values Looking over the past 10,000 years historian and archaeologist Ian Morris reveals patterns in the past related to energy consumption and resources, and how our age of fossil fuels will likely be a temporary one as we transition to renewables, and how this transition may lead to new human values, including the value of peace in a long human history filled with war. Dr. Donald Prothero On the Future of Life on Earth The geologist and paleontologist who is expert in ancient climates turns his acumen to current environmental problems that must be solved before our civilization can move forward. The obstacles are considerable but not insurmountable. First and foremost we must deal with climate change and its consequences for our immediate future as the earth's population approaches 10 billion by 2050. Prothero offers some solutions as well as outlining the problems. About this week's eSkeptic Ebola is exotic, deadly, and has no known treatment. It is not surprising that the recent outbreak has caused an epidemic of fear. When fear takes hold, rational thought flies out the window. We want to believe, need to believe, that we can protect ourselves from Ebola. In this week's eSkeptic, we present Harriet Hall's column, \"The SkepDoc,\" from [Skeptic magazine 20.1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.1/) (2015) in which she discusses the quackery known as colloidal silver, now being promoted as a cure for Ebola. Dr. Harriet Hall, MD, the SkepDoc, is a retired family physician and Air Force Colonel living in Puyallup, WA. She writes about alternative medicine, pseudoscience, quackery, and critical thinking. She is a contributing editor to both Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, an advisor to the Quackwatch website, and an editor of Sciencebasedmedicine.org, where she writes an article every Tuesday. She is author of [Women Aren't Supposed to Fly: The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon](http://amzn.com/0595499589?tag=skepticcom20-20). Her website is [www.skepdoc.info](http://www.skepdoc.info/). Colloidal Silver, Smurfs, and Ebola by Harriet Hall, M.D., The SkepDoc Colloidal silver is back! It competed in the ring of science and was thoroughly clobbered. If it had any dignity, it would have stayed down for the count and admitted defeat; but like some bizarre whack-a-mole or zombie it keeps stumbling back to its feet, wanting to fight again. This myth that refuses to die is now being promoted as a cure for Ebola, on the basis of nothing more than wishful thinking. A Myth with a Silver Lining There is often a grain of truth behind a myth. The grain here is that silver ions kill bacteria in vitro. But as Rose Shapiro famously reminded us in her book [Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HREXJY6/?tag=skepticcom20-20), you can kill cancer cells in a lab with a flame thrower or bleach, but that doesn't mean doctors should use flame throwers or make patients drink bleach. Silver is useful in medicine for external use (e.g., silver sulfadiazine cream for burns) and to disinfect surfaces and drinking water. But when swallowed, it is not only useless but harmful. Naturopaths use colloidal silver. It's available on the Internet or you can buy a generator to make your own at home, using a silver bar purchased from a coin dealer and parts from Radio Shack. Promoters make bold claims: we are all suffering from \"silver deficiency,\" the depletion of silver from our soil has caused a drastic increase in immune system disorders, colloidal silver has been used successfully in the treatment of 650 diseases, it functions as a superior second immune system in the body. Testimonials abound for practically every known disease, but I couldn't find any scientific evidence that it has ever been used successfully to cure even one disease. The Natural News website calls it \"an antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral miracle.\" Mercola.com claims that some silver products are harmful but that \"true\" colloidal silver is harmless and effective for treating infections including MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Their evidence? A measly four studies that are not listed on PubMed and that only show that it kills MRSA in cell cultures and on surfaces in the lab; there are no studies in humans. There is hype about \"nano silver,\" but that's only a new name for the same old colloidal silver. Creating Smurfs By 1843 doctors had recognized that silver causes argyria, an irreversible discoloration of the skin. Rosemary Jacobs' doctor prescribed colloidal silver nose drops to treat her allergies back in the 1950s. The doctor na\u00efvely believed fraudulent ads from manufacturers and salespeople and apparently hadn't read the warnings in the medical literature. By age 14, Rosemary's skin had turned slate gray. Despite cosmetics and dermatologists, she remains strikingly gray today. Her appearance has caused serious problems in her life; it cost her jobs, she was refused lodging because people thought she had a contagious disease, and nurses in a hospital misinterpreted her color as an indication of a heart attack. Jacobs has dedicated her life to investigating colloidal silver and spreading the word. Her website rosemaryjacobs.com provides a wealth of information with references. She says, \"In searching that literature for thirty years I have never found any evidence that silver in a person's body benefits anyone other than the quack who sold it.\" Rosemary turned slate-gray, but Karl Karason looked more blue than gray. He was known as Papa Smurf; with his striking white hair and beard, he looked a lot like the cartoon character. If you want to look like a Smurf there are better options, like the entertainers in the Blue Man Group with their removable blue body paint. The Scientific Consensus Every reputable organization that has evaluated colloidal silver has rejected it. Even the CAM-friendly National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) warns against it: \"Scientific evidence does not support the use of colloidal silver to treat any disease, and serious, irreversible side effects can result from its use.\" In addition to argyria, they report that it may cause kidney, liver, or nervous system problems and can interfere with absorption of some drugs. The FDA has issued an advisory that colloidal silver is not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition. In 1999, the FDA prohibited the sale of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs containing silver. A few prescription drugs contain silver, but they are all for topical application, not for oral ingestion. The [Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database](http://naturaldatabase.therapeuticresearch.com/) says silver has no known physiological function. They rated it \"likely unsafe\" and found no credible evidence that it was effective for any condition. In the US and Australia, regulators have ordered colloidal silver manufacturers to stop making false claims. One company in Australia had to pay court costs and provide refunds to customers. Ebola Quackery Ebola is exotic, deadly, and has no known treatment. It is not surprising that the recent outbreak has caused an epidemic of fear. When fear takes hold, rational thought flies out the window. We want to believe, need to believe, that we can protect ourselves from Ebola. Quacks and charlatans come out of the woodwork to calm our fears with false promises. As infectious disease specialist Dr. Mark Crislip says, \"There seems to be a belief in the pseudo-medical world that if you just did everything right, ate the right food, took the correct supplements, and used the CAM du jour you would have a perfect immune system and never get an infection. Wrong.\" All sorts of remedies are said to cure Ebola or prevent it by strengthening your immune system, including selenium, magnesium, intravenous vitamin C, bicarbonate of soda, vitamin D, iodine, slowing the breathing down with a Breathslim breathing device, medical marijuana, infrared therapy, glutathione, coffee, fermented soy, homeopathic spider venom, genistein (found in medicinal mushrooms, probiotics, avoiding tap water/non-organic/GMO foods, drinking green vegetable juices and fruit juices, cinnamon bark, Rife therapy, and kogel mogel eggnog. Peter Chappell claims he can treat Ebola with healing sound by playing the violin. Natural News published instructions for a homemade homeopathic Ebola vaccine made from the spit or blood of an Ebola patient (since contact with bodily fluids is how you get Ebola, this is obviously not a good idea). The ruler of the Igala Kingdom in Nigeria recommends bathing before 4:00 am with hot water and blessed anti-Ebola salt, and reciting verses from the Koran. Faith healing with laying on of hands is another great way to spread the disease. In Sierra Leone, a traditional herbal healer treated an Ebola patient, caught Ebola and died. At her funeral, numerous others were infected; eventually a total of 365 Ebola deaths were traced back to her. In the US, an entrepreneur was inspired by an episode of the Dr. Oz show to invent \"Ebola-C shots\" as an energy drink; he reportedly grossed $480,000 in the first 2 weeks. Homeopaths sent teams to Africa, wrote letters to government officials, and circulated a petition begging the World Health Organization (WHO) to distribute homeopathic remedies to control the epidemic. A New Zealand politician signed the petition, was publicly ridiculed for it, and later admitted that signing it was \"probably pretty unwise.\" Chiropractors have claimed that Ebola can be prevented and cured by restoring spine alignment so innate intelligence can \"whack the offending pathogen immediately.\" Rotarians planned a humanitarian mission to Sierra Leone to train doctors there to provide ozone therapy. Natural News sold family pandemic protection kits for home use. The FDA sent warning letters to three companies that were making fraudulent claims about Ebola cures. One, Natural Health Solutions, was selling a $24.95 bottle of Nano Silver for the \"cure, treatment and prevention for Ebola virus.\" The other two, DoTERRA and Young Living, were selling \"essential oil\" Ebola cures derived from cinnamon bark, peppermint, sandalwood, eucalyptus, and rosemary. The Natural Solutions Foundation complained that authorities had blocked shipments of Nano Silver to Sierra Leone. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, calls that a double standard, since the government allowed patients to be treated with ZMapp. He asks \"How exactly is it that an unproven pharmaceutical is okay to use as a treatment for Ebola, but an unproven herb or natural remedy is completely unacceptable and possibly illegal?\" There's a simple answer: ZMapp is expected to work because it contains antibodies to the Ebola virus. Ebola Conspiracy Theories Conspiracy theories range from improbable to insane: there's no such thing as Ebola; it's all a lie intended to limit our freedom and control us with restrictive laws. It's a plot to kill Africans. Ebola turns people into zombies, which somehow benefits big government. Big Pharma and government plan to force an Ebola vaccine on everyone. President Obama wants to infect white people and make the US more like his \"home\" in Africa. Ebola is a plot to divert attention from vaccine fraud at the CDC. Ebola will be intentionally introduced into the US by ISIS terrorists. Those sick people don't have Ebola; they have malnutrition and damaged immune systems due to wars, toxins, and poor sanitation. Ebola can be transmitted through the air. (This idea ignores particle size and scientific knowledge about disease transmission.) The US government holds a patent on Ebola, so it must have originated the disease. (It patented a different strain, back when organisms could be patented, as a preemptive strike so private companies couldn't patent it and withhold it from other researchers.) Colloidal silver is not a cure for Ebola or for anything else. Yet a Google search for \"Ebola silver\" turned up 139,000,000 hits. Good grief! THE BATTLE IN SEATTLE Michael Shermer v. Larry Taunton September 30, 2015 at 7 PM Benaroya Hall, Seattle Tickets: 206-215-4747 Fixed Point Foundation, a non-profit based in Birmingham, Alabama, revives an age-old question in the form of a debate - Do we need God? Michael Shermer of Skeptic magazine and Larry Taunton of Fixed Point Foundation meet at Benaroya Hall on September 30 to address whether the concept of God is beneficial or detrimental to society. Exploring the effects of the idea of God on humanity will bring these two participants to consider a variety of issues, including human suffering, morality, and meaning. With backgrounds in education and history, both Taunton and Shermer are well prepared to explore all of these topics, particularly as each relates to religion. Larry Taunton, Founder and Executive Director of Fixed Point Foundation, is a cultural commentator, columnist, author, and regular contributor to The Atlantic and USA Today. He is a frequent television and radio guest, appearing on CNN, CNN International, Fox News, Al Jazeera America, and BBC. Taunton's book, The Grace Effect, is a powerful and personal account of the effect one Christian can have on a spiritually dead culture. In it, he argues that without the Christian ideals of love, forgiveness, and grace, a society will quickly become the author of its own demise. According to Taunton, \"Every meaningful movement in the history of the West has been fueled by Christianity... because they all appealed to a higher law.\" God, he believes, is far from irrelevant. [Download more biographical details (PDF)](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/2015/images/15-09-02/Shermer-Taunton-bios.pdf). Michael Shermer, taking an opposing stance, asserts that religion is largely to blame for some of the worst atrocities in human history. His latest book, [The Moral Arc](https://moralarc.org/), maintains that science and reason will lead us to a virtuous and increasingly moral existence. According to Shermer, we are \"getting better at solving problems\" as we continue to evolve. A New York Times best-selling author, Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and has written thirteen books. He is also a monthly columnist for Scientific American, regular contributor to Time.com, and a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University. When he isn't writing or teaching, he travels frequently to speak and debate on a variety of topics.

NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COLUMN ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM Forensic Pseudoscience: How trustworthy are DNA and other crime scene tests? The criminal justice system has a problem, and its name is forensics. This was the message I heard at the Forensic Science Research Evaluation Workshop held May 26-27 at the AAAS headquarters in Washington, D.C. I spoke about pseudoscience but then listened in dismay at how the many fields in the forensic sciences that I assumed were reliable (DNA, fingerprints, and so on) in fact employ unreliable or untested techniques and show inconsistencies between evaluators of evidence. The conference was organized in response to a 2009 publication by the National Research Council entitled [Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf), which the U.S. Congress commissioned when it became clear that DNA was the only (barely) reliable forensic science. The report concluded that \"the forensic science system, encompassing both research and practice, has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure that supports the forensic science community in this country.\" Among the areas determined to be flawed and in need of more research are...

NEW FROM MICHAEL SHERMER ON HUFFINGTONPOST.COM Science and Hollywood: When the Martian Met the Earthlings Andy Weir's gripping tale of a NASA astronaut stranded on Mars (entitled, simply enough, [The Martian](http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/the-martian)), is coming to Hollywood on October 2, and it is going to be another Ridley Scott blockbuster. I listened to the unabridged audio edition of the book, brilliantly narrated by R. C. Bray, who supremely navigates through multiple voices and actually sounds a bit like Matt Damon, who plays the novel's hero Mark Watney in the film. It well deserves its rating of 4.7/5 on an almost unbelievable 45,790 ratings on Audible.com. Add to that the 4.6/5 rating from 14,536 customer reviews on Amazon and you have a genuine cultural book event. A lot of people have read this book. And if the NASA scientists at the August 18 press conference at the La Canada theaters and JPL are right, this could translate to a new generation of scientists from the ranks of young people sure to flock to this action-adventure science fiction film. Just like \"Scotty\" on Star Trek inspired a generation of kids to go into STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), Damon's Watney is sure to do the same as he cuts a heroic action figure loaded with math and engineering skills enough to, as he says, \"science the shit\" out of the problem he finds himself in. The Science-and-Hollywood connection was evident at the press conference, starting with comments from the Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Charles Elachi... FOLLOW MICHAEL SHERMER ON [Insight](https://www.skeptic.com/author/michael-shermer/) [The Moral eSkeptic, Stephen reviews Joshua film [The Look of Silence](http://thelookofsilence.com/), produced by Signe Byrge, Executive Producers Werner Herzog, Errol Morris, Andre Singer S\u00f8rensen, Presented by Drafthouse Films, Participant Media, and Final Cut For Real, 103 minutes. The above image is a still from the film. Stephen Beckner is a screenwriter and filmmaker. He is best known for his feature film [A.K.A. Birdseye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257355/). He is currently developing a feature film project based on the American militia movement of the early 1990s. In addition to his work in film, he has collaborated on video games, notably as head writer for the award-winning multi-platform adventure game [Perils of Man](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/perils-of-man-adventure-game/id919457017?mt=8&at=10l6ex). Anatomy of a (Mass) Murder by Stephen Beckner Let sleeping dogs lie, the old saw goes, but judging from his latest documentary, writer/director Joshua Oppenheimer doesn't subscribe to that particular bit of folk wisdom. No, for all its impartial probing and careful emotional inquisitiveness, [The Look of Silence](http://thelookofsilence.com/) aims to stir things up. In fact, it wants to raise the dead. Like its companion piece, the 2012 Academy Award nominated [The Act of Killing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/act-killing-directors-cut/id738016086?at=10l6ex), Oppenheimer's subject is Indonesia's anti-communist purge, a frenzy of violence and butchery at the hands of vigilante youths cum organized death squads. Between 1965 and 1966, with the explicit consent of the Indonesian military, anyone suspected of being a communist, harboring communist sympathies, or in some cases just knowing a suspected communist, was rounded up and delivered to busy backrooms that functioned as human clearing houses, where zealous young men\u2014many of them gangsters before the Suharto regime found a suitable use for their dubious skillsets\u2014saw it as their duty to beat, stab, and/or garrote the evil offenders. Corpses were then rendered into mass graves, or heaved into local rivers under cover of darkness. For years, the scale of the mass killings was not known to the outside world, but is now estimated at more than a million dead. Fifty years on, there has been no moral or legal reckoning\u2014the killings are still missing from Indonesia's official history, though the killers themselves live as heroes amongst their fellow citizens, revered by some, feared by many. As topics for documentary go, political pogroms are nothing new, but then Oppenheimer's films are not political. What sets these documentaries apart, and what makes them of particular interest to skeptics, is Oppenheimer's analytical approach to his subject. His characters are not players in service to a political argument so much as psychological test subjects. In The Act of Killing, Oppenheimer treats his participants\u2014former killers all\u2014with a clinician's emotional distance. We watch in astonishment as the now-aging men are given a grant to confront their violent pasts by making personal films ostensibly reenacting their \"heroic\" deeds, and proceed to lose themselves like mice in a laboratory maze of their own making. The principal figure of the film, Anwar Congo, casts himself as a noir gangster, and demonstrates the evolution of his killing techniques as demand for his services increased. But when he briefly steps into the role of one of his victims, the look in his eyes changes, his psychological armor slips away. Oppenheimer's steadfast refusal to judge the participants increases their trust in the process and in turn they make themselves more emotionally available. What emerges is at a once a rending human tragedy, and a forensic debriefing on the mechanics of guilt and the psychological contortions men put themselves through to avoid it. Oppenheimer's camera works like a scalpel, cutting through the layers of rationalizations to expose the underlying psychological anatomy of...not killers, but of ordinary men who became killers, and who have tried in vain for five decades to become ordinary men again. When Hannah Arendt was covering the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for The New Yorker, she famously employed the phrase \"banality of evil\" to underscore Eichmann's ordinariness. The context of Eichmann's trial was personal guilt for a state-sponsored crime. The crime itself was never in doubt. But in Indonesia the evil prevailed, the orchestrators of their genocide were never brought to justice, and no crime was ever acknowledged. As a consequence, the banality of evil is on full display, and The Look of Silence gives us the opportunity to witness it up close. Here Oppenheimer shifts the point of view from the perpetrators to the survivors, focusing on the family of Ramli, one of the rare victims whose murder was witnessed and whose remains rest in a marked grave near the Snake River. Because of this, Ramli has come to represent all the victims. His brother Adi, born a year after Ramli's death, sets out to meet the killers, who openly boast about the unspeakably brutal execution. One of the men, concerned that his place in history may be overlooked, has even self published a memoir with hand drawn illustrations depicting the night's gruesome proceedings. Meeting Adi was fortuitous for Oppenheimer, who understood early on that his strength of character and remarkable composure under pressure made him the ideal person to conduct these encounters. A practicing optometrist, Adi visits the killers under the guise of checking their eyes. As he edges closer to the subject of his brother, he never allows anger or resentment to dominate the conversations, even when he has every right to do so. Instead, it is Adi's abiding sadness that prevails. More than anything, he simply wants to make sense of it all. But inevitably, when the men learn that Adi is the brother of Ramli, their stories change. We see their minds suddenly racing to rationalize their behavior. They were merely agents of the state, they say, acting for the greater good, purging a societal evil, etc. In the psychological denuding that ensues, even their boasting is revealed as a coping mechanism to assuage their guilt. And should all these fail, threats to Adi and his family serve to shift the blame. In perhaps the most vivid example of the lengths to which these men went to avoid moral culpability, many claimed that it was common practice for the killers to drink the blood of their victims. Failing to do so resulted in certain madness, they averred, and those who abstained from the vampiric ritual were avoided or shunned. As shocking as these confessions are, the film never surrenders to its most lurid details. Oppenheimer's gaze remains detached, constantly seeking out broader, and ultimately scarier moral implications. We are reminded that silence has its price. If you let sleeping dogs lie, then lie they will. They will lie mostly to themselves at first, but eventually the lies will proliferate. For some in the skeptical community, there's a certain morbid satisfaction to be derived from seeing individual cognitive biases so incisively exposed. But any temptation to rubberneck quickly fades when those biases are blatantly enlisted on a societal scale by the state in the service of death. In a telling NBC news report from that time, one Indonesian official claims that many of the communists came forward and asked to be killed\u2014an invocation of the notion of atonement that slyly connects communism with religious sin. Many death squad members later claimed that they knew their victims were communists because they didn't pray. This convenient narrative equating godlessness with communism has now been institutionalized in Indonesia by a federal blasphemy law aimed not only at making atheism a capital offense, but also at rationalizing the current regime's murderous origins. For all its forensic power, The Look of Silence remains a deeply compassionate film. It is provocative, but what it's trying to provoke finally, is understanding. The titular silence is a closed door that prevents that understanding, trapping perpetrator and survivor alike. Crucially, Oppenheimer never gives us the easy out of dehumanizing the killers. They are not depicted as creatures apart, monsters stalking the wrong side of some unseen but impenetrable moral barrier. No, they are ordinary men, banal men, who became killers in a specifically identifiable way. This viewer could not escape the chilling conclusion that we are, all of us, only a couple of rationalizations away from the killer inside.

Find out more about how a conservative from rural Alabama came to be such a major champion for science and critical thinking. In this week's eSkeptic, Harriet Hall reviews [The Myth of Mirror Neurons: The Real Neuroscience of Communication and Cognition](http://amzn.com/0393089614?tag=skepticcom20-20), by Gregory Hickok. This review first appeared on the [Science-Based Medicine Blog](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/mirror-neurons-and-the-pitfalls-of-brain-research/) and also in [Skeptic magazine 20.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.2/) (2015). Harriet Hall is a retired family physician and Air Force Colonel living in Puyallup, WA. She writes about alternative medicine, pseudoscience, quackery, and critical thinking. She is a contributing editor to both Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, an advisor to the Quackwatch website, and an editor of Sciencebasedmedicine.org, where she writes an article every Tuesday. She is author of [Women Aren't Supposed to Fly: The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon](http://amzn.com/0595499589?tag=skepticcom20-20). Her website is [www.skepdoc.info](http://www.skepdoc.info/). The Use and Abuse of Mirror Neurons a book review by Harriet Hall, M.D. I couldn't say it any better than Steven Pinker did on the jacket blurb of this important book: Every now and again an idea from science escapes from the lab and takes on a life of its own as an explanation for all mysteries, a validation of our deepest yearnings, and irresistible bait for journalists and humanities scholars... Hickok puts an end to this monkey business by showing that mirror neurons do not, in fact, explain language, empathy, society, and world peace. But this is not a negative expos\u00e9\u2014the reader of this book will learn a great deal of the contemporary sciences of language, mind, and brain, and will find that the reality is more exciting than the mythology. Mirror neurons were discovered serendipitously during a study of macaque monkeys where researchers were recording the activity of individual brain cells. They found single cells that fired when the monkey grasped an object. Then they happened to notice something they hadn't expected: the cells also fired as the monkey observed the experimenter grasping an object to set up the next trial. In all, they recorded data from 184 neurons in the F5 motor area of the brain. Almost all of them fired when the monkey performed some kind of action, just as would be expected from cells in the motor cortex. But 87 of these also responded to some type of visual stimuli: 48 responded to seeing objects and 39 responded to seeing actions; of these, 12 neurons responded most strongly when the monkey grasped an object and also when it observed the researcher performing the same action. The initial interpretation of the scientists: one of the functions of that part of the brain is to retrieve appropriate motor acts in response to sensory stimuli. Monkeys have rich social interactions, so it makes sense that the brain has a mechanism for communicating information about perceived actions of others to motor areas that code self-actions for execution. So far, so good. But they went on to suggest that their findings might have implications for two areas of human research that seemed to show a similar observation/execution correspondence: - Limb apraxia, where patients unable to perform an action had been reported to have deficits in understanding the limb gestures of others. - The motor theory of speech perception, the idea that we perceive speech by reconstructing the motor gestures that generated those sounds. Hickok suggests that the experimental setup had trained the monkeys to associate their own grasp with a reward, and to associate the grasp of the researcher with an upcoming new reward. What the researchers had observed might be merely a reflection of how the brain stores, organizes, and retrieves memories and learned motor patterns. They could have been seeing a generalized phenomenon of association rather than anything mirror-like. If so, the association process itself would be a more promising area for further research. The findings in monkeys were replicated in other primates but not in humans. Researchers assumed that humans also had a mirror neuron system, but that assumption is supported only by indirect evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, PET scans, and the observation that patients with damage to Broca's area had pantomime recognition defects. Hickok points out that those findings are not enough to prove that humans have mirror neurons, and that they might well have non-mirror explanations. Speculation soon ran amok and mirror neurons became wildly popular. Hickok says the idea was seductive because of three factors: - You could explain it in one line: \"We understand action because the motor representation of that action is activated in our brain.\" - It promised to bring this simplicity of explanation to many complex problems. - It was grounded in hardcore animal neurophysiology, providing a neural mechanism for human cognition and revealing an evolutionary pathway. Mirror neuron research studies proliferated. Mirror neurons were soon implicated in everything from contagious yawning to autism. Hickok lists 37 areas of mirror neuron research and provides citations. I won't copy the whole list, but it includes schizophrenia, sexual orientation, cigarette smoking, political attitudes, felt presence, the degree of male erection, spectator sport appreciation, drug abuse, and \"misattribution of anger in the music of avant-garde jazz saxophonists.\" It's an astonishing body of speculation to have developed from an interpretation of those 12 original macaque neurons, an interpretation that Hickok thinks was probably wrong. He describes a number of anomalies that are inconsistent with mirror neuron theory. You'll have to read the book for the details, but I'll just mention one of his points that made me laugh. When a man sees someone kicking another man in the balls, it doesn't prompt him to mirror the kicking behavior; it prompts him to display a very different behavior, to cringe and protect his own groin. Hickok acknowledges that anomalies don't necessarily prove a theory wrong, but in this case the sheer number of anomalies is cause for concern and should lead us to explore alternative explanations. To give one example, mirror neurons seemed to provide a convenient explanation for autism. Autistics appear to lack the ability to understand the goals and intentions of others, to read their emotions, to empathize, and to share attention with others. It is said that they lack a \"theory of mind\" because of a deficit in mirror neurons. But there is really no good evidence that mirror neurons have anything to do with these abilities, and autistics don't behave as the mirror theory would predict. There is a false-belief test where children are asked to predict where another person will look for an object when only the child knows it has been moved. Young children who can't pass the false-belief test lack the ability to understand what is going on in another person's mind, but they don't behave as if they are autistic. Hickok favors another hypothesis: that autism is not a matter of deficits at all, but of hypersensitivity to sensory inputs. This concept has been called \"the intense world syndrome.\" Maybe they don't pay attention to human faces because it is painful for them to be flooded with the associated emotional sensations. Maybe the repetitive behaviors, fixations, and other features of autism are protective measures to numb them against the onslaught of overwhelming sensory input. This tallies with Temple Grandin's \"squeeze box\" she invented to calm her when she felt anxious and overstimulated. Instead of claiming that he understands autism, Hickok merely proposes a hypothesis for investigation. Perhaps the best thing in the book is this sentence: \"I remain a skeptic, even of my own ideas.\" The words of a true scientist! The case of autism brings up a point that applies across the board: we must be careful when making inferences about behavior. If an autistic person doesn't appear to recognize emotions in others, that doesn't necessarily mean that he can't recognize them. We can observe a behavior, but we shouldn't be hasty about assuming we know why the behavior occurs. If a person doesn't drink milk, we might infer that he doesn't like it; but it might be that he loves milk but is lactose intolerant. Similarly, when a part of the brain lights up on a PET scan, it indicates increased metabolic activity, but the neurons might be more active because they are working to suppress a response rather than to augment it. Hickok shows in detail how the research on mirror neurons may have gone astray because of false assumptions and jumping to unwarranted conclusions. [The Myth of Mirror Neurons](http://amzn.com/0393089614?tag=skepticcom20-20) is a fascinating, game-changing book. It explains the details of research studies and its reasoning is thoroughly backed up by citations from the scientific literature. It is not an easy read; some of the concepts are hard to grasp at first, especially for those not familiar with the relevant literature and the terminology. But it offers a valuable lesson in how scientists can be led down the wrong path and how errors can be compounded. It shows how important it is to make sure research data justify the conclusions, to search rigorously for disconfirming evidence, and to make sure alternative explanations have been considered and adequately ruled out. The book accomplishes two goals: it sheds serious doubt on almost everything that has been written about mirror neurons, and it describes cutting edge neuroscience research that may eventually lead us to a better understanding of how communication and cognition really work. No real answers, but plenty of questions. And after all, one of the most important things in science is knowing which questions to ask. [Gregory Hickok](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/gregory-hickok/), eSkeptic Paulette Cooper could be called the poster child for Scientology's \"fair game\" abuses against a critical journalist. The story has been told many times with varying levels of detail, in most books about the history of Scientology written in the past four decades. But the story has, until now, been incomplete. In this week's eSkeptic, Jim Lippard reviews Tony Ortega's Cooper's story. [The Unbreakable Miss Lovely: How the Church of Scientology Tried to Destroy Paulette Cooper](http://amzn.com/1511639377?tag=skepticcom20-20). Jim Lippard is a long-time skeptic who works in the information security field. He founded the Phoenix Skeptics in 1985, and has contributed to Skeptic, Reports of the National Center for Science Education, Skeptical Briefs, The Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, Joe Nickell's book [Psychic Sleuths](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879758805/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0879758805&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkId=5ZOMVSBXSMFLW7ER), and [other posts on this blog](https://www.skeptic.com/author/jim-lippard/). Scientology's Worst Abuses Against a Journalist Revealed by Jim Lippard Paulette Cooper was harassed, tricked, sued, and lied to, but was not destroyed. The Church of Scientology's \"fair game\" policy, originally written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1965 and elaborated in a series of policy letters over subsequent years, stated that \"suppressive persons\"\u2014defined as anyone interfering with the Church's activities\u2014are \"fair for \"any action\" taken against them, including being \"deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. [Such persons] May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\" [1](#note01) Paulette Cooper wrote an article for the December 1969 issue of the British magazine Queen titled \"The Tragi-Farce of Scientology.\" [2](#note02) The Church of Scientology responded by suing her in Great Britain in 1970. When she turned her article into a 1971 book entitled [The Scandal of Scientology](http://amzn.com/B000ICZJCY?tag=skepticcom20-20), they sued her again. And again. Repeatedly. Scientology harassed Cooper over the telephone, put her telephone number on bathroom walls, distributed fliers to her neighbors accusing her of prostitution, and monitored her movements and telephone calls. They broke into her psychiatrist's office and copied records of her college counseling sessions. They gained access to her apartment and copied embarrassing passages out of her teenage diary and delivered them to her adoptive father's office. They moved undercover operatives into her apartment building, who then befriended her and continually kept the Church updated on her behavior and emotional state. They framed her for bomb threats against Scientology in an attempt to have her imprisoned or committed to a mental institution. Because they used stationery with her fingerprints and her typewriter to create a threatening note, she was indicted and under threat of prosecution for years. The Church planned \"Operation Freakout\" to frame her again for bomb threats, this time against the Embassy of a Middle Eastern country\u2014plans that were not carried out before Scientology itself was raided by the FBI in 1977 and Cooper was finally cleared of the charges that had been hanging over her. Most of the above details are parts of a fairly well-known narrative of Cooper's battles with Scientology, which make her the poster child for \"fair game\" abuses against a critical journalist. The story has been told many times with varying levels of detail, in most books about the history of Scientology written in the past four decades. [3](#note03) But the story has, until now, been incomplete. Journalist and blogger Tony Ortega, former editor of the Village Voice, executive editor of [The Raw Story](http://www.rawstory.com/), and now executive editor at [TheLip.tv](http://thelip.tv/), has written a new book, [The Unbreakable Miss Lovely](http://amzn.com/1511639377?tag=skepticcom20-20), which is a comprehensive account of Paulette Cooper's story. By tracking down sources no previous investigator had interviewed, digging into neglected documents, and with some help from individuals who have left Scientology as well as from his subject, Ortega has written the definitive account of the lengths to which Scientology went in its ultimately failed attempts to destroy Paulette Cooper. Ortega was ideally suited to write this book. His blog, [The Underground Bunker](http://tonyortega.org/), [4](#note04) is the most popular blog on Scientology. His daily posts document its decline, and he has cultivated numerous sources that include former senior officials in Scientology and even sources still inside the organization. Ortega followed Cooper's path tracking down the sources she used to write her book and interviewing people who had been in her life\u2014friends, family, and Scientologists operating covertly, such as Nancy Many and Len Zinberg, both of whom have now left the Church. Many's own book revealed her refusal to break into Cooper's psychiatrist's office for Scientology's Guardian Office (their covert operations and dirty tricks unit). [5](#note05) Zinberg, who joined Scientology as a teenager, was the person who delivered Cooper's teen diary excerpts to her father, an action he now regrets and for which he has apologized to Cooper. [6](#note06) [The Unbreakable Miss Lovely](http://amzn.com/1511639377?tag=skepticcom20-20) contains three main narratives\u2014Paulette's life story, focusing on her interactions with the Church of Scientology; the story of her biological parents, who were murdered by the Nazis during WWII; and the story of the Scientology's Snow White Program, a project to infiltrate government offices and obtain information about its plans regarding Scientology. Each of these stories contains previously unpublished information; even Paulette didn't know the details of what had happened to her biological parents before she came to the U.S. from a Belgian orphanage in 1948 at the age of six, and was separated from her older sister who grew up in Belgium. The first narrative is the shortest, told in a prologue and part of a chapter mid-way through the book. The second, on the Snow White Program, is told in two chapters, while the third makes up the bulk of the book. Ortega's account of the Snow White Program uncovers new details about how the FBI discovered Scientology's government office break-ins, because he was the first journalist to interview Special Agent Christine Hansen. Hansen was the one who cracked the case, when, after she obtained warrants for the arrests of two suspicious men using fake identification cards in government offices, she noticed one of the two men at the main IRS building in Washington D.C. and arrested Gerald Wolfe on June 30, 1976. A year later, on July 8, 1977, the FBI simultaneously raided the Church of Scientology's offices in D.C. and Los Angeles, carting out truckloads of boxes of documents, including plans of covert operations against Paulette Cooper, the unexecuted \"Operation Freakout,\" and the earlier bomb threat frame-up, \"Operation Dynamite.\" While the book is a highly sympathetic portrait of Paulette Cooper, it is not a hagiography. Cooper sometimes comes across as gullible, as she repeatedly falls into Scientology's traps. This appearance is no doubt partly accounted for by hindsight bias\u2014in the 1970s Cooper did not have the benefit of knowing the lengths to which Scientology was willing to go to attack and harass her that we've learned from the FBI raid documents and the growing literature exposing Scientology's activities. But many may find her gullible [7](#note07) for signing a 1980 employment contract for a D.C. private investigator, Richard Bast, containing a clause that \"expressly gives to the Employer her prior consent to intercept any of her wire/oral communications.\" Bast, who claimed to be working for a wealthy Swiss man whose daughter had killed herself after joining Scientology, paid Cooper $2,000 a month to work for him, allowing her to quit freelance writing work and focus on researching Scientology. In fact, Bast was working for Scientology, and therefore so was Cooper, unwittingly. Everything she uncovered was funneled to Scientology, giving them a heads-up on potential trouble and the ability to find out what their critics were up to. More recently, in 2011, former Scientology senior leader Marty Rathbun asserted that Vanity Fair writer John Connolly, who Ortega writes \"regularly checked in with...Cooper\" to discuss Scientology (p. 385), was also reporting back to the Church. Rathbun quoted the text of a 2006 Scientology document reporting a meeting by Connolly with Andrew Morton, purportedly to get details about the book Morton was working on about Tom Cruise. More disturbing than the evidence of gullibility is the evidence of Cooper's willingness to sometimes be ethically flexible about telling the truth, which comes out in the recordings Bast made of her. Ortega's book recounts some of the more embarrassing excerpts, in which Cooper talks about planting drugs inside Scientology's D.C. church and belittles her friend Nan McLean for her \"stupid honesty\" in paying a huge $800 bill for copying documents from the FBI raid while Cooper lied about how much she copied and paid only $89.50. She also criticized McLean for being unwilling to feign lapses of memory during depositions in Scientology legal cases. Ortega notes (p. 380) that some ex-Scientologists could not understand why he was writing a book about her, that they considered her to be unimportant and a \"bad person.\" While the exposure of the Bast tapes damaged Cooper's credibility, she still resolved her lawsuits with Scientology and received a substantial settlement before Hubbard's death in 1986, and turned to writing about dogs and cats. Others have taken up writing about Scientology, but her book remains the earliest substantial critique of Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, a classic of what is now becoming a well-populated genre. Ortega's book, his first, now joins the ranks of the best of these, and Ortega has been on a speaking tour for the book, sometimes with the company of Paulette Cooper herself, often speaking to local skeptical groups.

NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COLUMN ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM The Meaning of Life in a Formula: Can Science Help Us Overcome the Terror of Existence? Harvard University paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who died in 2002, was a tough-minded skeptic who did not suffer fools gladly when it came to pseudoscience and superstition. Gould was a secular Jew who did not believe in God, but he had a soft spot for religion, expressed most famously in his principle of NOMA\u2014nonoverlapping magisteria. The magisterium (domain of authority) of science \"covers the empirical realm: what is the universe made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory),\" he wrote in his 1999 book [Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/034545040X/?tag=skepticcom20-20). \"The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value.\" In part, Gould's motivations were personal (he told me on many occasions how much respect he had for religion and for his many religious friends and colleagues). But in his book, he claimed that \"NOMA represents a principled position on moral and intellectual grounds, not a merely diplomatic solution.\" For NOMA to work, however, Gould insisted that just as \"religion can no longer dictate the nature of factual conclusions residing properly within the magisterium of science, then scientists cannot claim higher insight into moral truth from any superior knowledge of the world's empirical constitution.\" ...

Surely that many people can't be wrong, can they? In this week's eSkeptic, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Harris examines some of the vocabulary often invoked by mystics in the quantum healing community, and contrasts their usage of that vocabulary with current scientific definitions. This article appeared Skeptic magazine 20.1 in 2015. [Order the back issue](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.1/). J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Harris is a Ph.D. student in quantum photonics under the Canada Excellence Research Chair in quantum nonlinear optics, at the Max Planck - University of Ottawa Centre for Extreme and Quantum Photonics.

Can Superpositions of Quantum Consciousness Unlock Your Brain's Hidden Nonlocal Potentiality? by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Harris They were once called snake oil salesmen. Today, proponents of mystical healing and alternative medicine offer remedies for a plethora of diseases and conditions, promising pain relief, lifelong health, and even in some cases the prospect of life after death to anyone \"open-minded\" enough to pay for non-standard treatment. Modern-day mystics have at their disposal a vast and ever-growing arsenal of scientific vocabulary, and employ it liberally in arguing for such practices as quantum healing and energy medicine, variants of which have in recent decades grown into billion dollar industries, supported by millions of consumers. Surely that many people can't be wrong, can they? In what follows, we will look at a sample of quantum mechanical vocabulary often invoked by mystics, and contrast the correct scientific meaning of the terms with their usage in the quantum healing community. Quantum Superposition In a report on her lecture at the European Quantum Energy Medicine Conference in 2008, Mae-Wan Ho, director of the Institute of Science in Society, wrote: \"The quantum wave function that describes the coherent organism is a superposition of all possibilities. It implies that the future is entirely open, and the potentials infinite. That's just what a healthy person should feel like.\" [1](#note01) This may sound like an impressive claim, but what exactly is meant by \"superposition of all possibilities\"? Among the more counterintuitive features of quantum theory is its prediction that particles\u2014and sometimes groups of them\u2014can exist in multiple states at once. Hence, while we humans seldom find ourselves both asleep and awake simultaneously, the same cannot be said of the microscopic entities that comprise the quantum world. For instance, it is possible for a subatomic particle, such as an electron, to be bound to two or more different atoms at once; indeed, this arrangement is precisely what is involved in the formation of typical chemical bonds. As well, electrons and many other subatomic entities may in some contexts be thought of as small rotating spheres. The direction of their rotation is referred to as their \"spin\". An electron, for example, may spin clockwise or counterclockwise, in which case it is respectively referred to as occupying the \"spin up\" or \"spin down\" states. Remarkably, the electron may also spin in both directions simultaneously. Loosely speaking, one might think of such an electron as possessing some clockwise spin character, and some counterclockwise spin character. To understand this apparent impossibility, it may be useful to draw a concrete analogy. Imagine that we can represent quantum states by colors, white corresponding to the spin up state, and black to the spin down state. An electron might be described by the color white, the color black, or any combination thereof\u2014some shade of grey. This shade may be more black than white, or vice-versa, or an exact 50/50 mix of the two colors. A particle or physical system that exists in multiple quantum states simultaneously\u2014like the\"grey electron\" in our analogy\u2014is said to represent a quantum superposition of these states. With this in mind, let's return to Mae-Wan Ho's use of the term \"superposition\" and to her conclusion that the \"potentials\" are infinite and the future \"entirely open\", due to the existence of a superposition of states. The term \"potential\"\u2014ubiquitous physics shorthand for \"potential energy\"\u2014simply refers to energy stored in a physical system, like the elastic energy of a compressed spring. In quantum theory, the wavefunction (a mathematical object that describes a physical system) is determined by the potential energy, and not the other way around, as Ho seems to imply. Finally, Ho makes no attempt to explain the purported connection between the psychological state of a healthy person, and the \"infinite\" nature of the \"quantum potential\". Instead, she flatly states this connection as fact, without elaboration or evidence. Observer Effect How is the observer effect discussed among quantum mystics? As with much of their jargon, it is difficult to find a consistent usage. That said, the following quotation\u2014an excerpt from Deepak Chopra's 2010 Huffington Post article entitled \" [Which is Real, the Moon or God?](http://huff.to/1p7aNrR)\"\u2014is a fairly representative example: [2](#note02) \"The observer is non-local consciousness, and that consciousness collapses its own possibility waves into a measurable event.\" What does this mean? In our everyday experience, we are used to the idea that the measurement of any physical quantity invariably gives just one result. When we step on a scale and read the dial, we obtain a single number: a weight. Likewise, if we were to measure the direction in which a spinning top rotates, we would obtain a single result: clockwise or counterclockwise. Curiously, this remains true at the quantum level\u2014even measurements carried out on quantum superpositions yield only one outcome. If we measure the spin of an electron that is initially rotating both clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously, we always obtain one of two results: spin up or spin down. To return to our earlier color analogy, this means that a grey electron, despite being part white and part black, will be found to be either white or black upon measurement. It is as if the electron, having originally spun in two directions at once, is forced to \"choose\" one direction over the other for the purpose of the measurement. In some sense, it is polarized from its initial grey state to a pure black or white state. And, it turns out, the darker the electron's initial shade of grey, the more likely it is to yield the \"black\" result upon measurement. Some therefore suggest that the measurement process itself leads to the destruction\u2014or collapse\u2014 of superpositions, and their replacement by a single quantum state. In our analogy, this would correspond to replacing a grey electron with a black or white one. [3](#note03) This apparent connection between the measurement process and the collapse of quantum superpositions is sometimes referred to as the observer effect. In essence, it is said, the observer can induce a physical system to collapse into a single state simply by measuring it. How does this understanding square with Deepak Chopra's claim that \"the observer is nonlocal consciousness, and that consciousness collapses its own possibility waves into a measurable event\"? That an observer might constitute a \"non-local consciousness\" is at best an ambiguous claim, and at worst reflects a profound misunderstanding of the observer effect. As we have seen, the true definition of the observer effect makes no reference to the nature of the observing entity. It need not necessarily be a conscious person; it can be an unconscious machine. [4](#note04) The role that might be played by \"non-locality\" with respect to consciousness in this case is also unclear. This expression seems to simply have been misused\u2014a remarkable achievement given the frequency with which it appears in Chopra's writing. Non-Locality Noah McKay, quantum healer and author of Wellness at Warp Speed, invokes the concept of nonlocality in a medical context, as follows: \"Non-local, invisible, energetic interactions with the body include everything from ECG [electrocardiograms], CT [X-ray computed tomography] and MRI Qi-Gong, prayer, and psychic healing.\" [5](#note05) It may be somewhat surprising to learn that the MRI and CT scans to which many of us have been subjected operate by \"non-local...energetic interactions with the body.\" Indeed it should, because it is not true. So what is locality? Einstein's theories of special and general relativity tell us a lot about our universe. Among the myriad of fascinating and counter-intuitive features of relativity theory is the fact that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, including the very forces of nature. As a consequence, two objects sufficiently far away from each other have no way of interacting\u2014and cannot feel one another's presence\u2014 until enough time has passed for light from one object to reach the other. The sun, for example, is about 93 million miles away from Earth. Since light travels at around 11 million miles per minute, this means that it takes the sun's rays about eight minutes to reach us. As a result, according to relativity theory, it takes a full eight minutes for us to feel any effect that the sun may have on our planet\u2014including its gravity. So, if the sun were to disappear now, it would take eight minutes for the sky to blacken around us. Our planet would even continue in its regular orbit for eight minutes, before being ultimately flung out into the cosmic darkness. The sun therefore has a near-immediate impact only on its local surroundings: the further an object is from the sun, the longer it takes for it to be influenced by the state of solar affairs. We therefore refer to relativity as a local theory, since it does not allow objects separated by a significant distance to interact instantaneously. What, then, does it mean for an effect to be non-local? In short, any effect that propagates instantaneously, and which is therefore not limited by the speed of light, is said to be non-local. Now returning to McKay's statement, it is worth noting that ECGs, CT scans, and MRI all operate by measuring electromagnetic fields, whose effects propagate no faster than the speed of light. There is nothing nonlocal about these phenomena. It is also not clear what McKay means by the \"non-locality\" of \"Qi- Gong, prayer, and psychic healing,\" as the concept would appear to have no relevance whatsoever to meditation or related practices. Quantum Entanglement Fred Garcia, founder and Medical Director of Quantum Medical Associates, a Los Angeles-based alternative medicine clinic, gives his account of the discovery of quantum entanglement\u2014and its purported healthcare implications\u2014in the following excerpt from his [clinic's webpage](http://www.drgarciaquantumhealing.com/): [6](#note06) \"The quantum entanglement of body, mind & spirit was proven almost 100 years ago by Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrodinzer [sic], Werner Heisenberg, Neils Boar [sic] & Wolfgang Pauli.\" As a point of historical fact, quantum entanglement was first discussed by Einstein, Podolski and Rosen in 1935, and not by Einstein, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Bohr and Pauli as Garcia claims. But what is quantum entanglement? Quantum entanglement simply describes a correlation between two or more particles, or groups of particles. Recall our spinning electrons: it is possible for two electrons to be spin-correlated in such a way as to make the total spin of the pair zero. In this case, to use our color analogy, if the electrons' spins are measured, one electron will be white (spin-up), and the other black (spin-down). This pair of electrons would appear grey overall, since it is composed of one white and one black electron. When measured, one electron of the pair will be found to be black and the other white. As a result, if we find electron 1 to be black, we know electron 2 to be white, and vice-versa. But we cannot know which electron is which until we actually make a spin measurement. For this reason, the individual electrons themselves remain grey until measured. The result is that a measurement of one electron's spin will force both to collapse out of their grey superposition into opposite\u2014black and white\u2014 states. By measuring the spin state of one electron, we have effectively measured its partner simultaneously. Notice that in so doing we collapsed the second electron out of its initial grey state without ever having interacted with it directly\u2014electron 2 is collapsed because of a measurement executed on electron 1. Electrons whose spins are correlated in this way are said to be entangled. This collapse effect must also be instantaneous; the moment we measure one electron's spin, its partner immediately collapses out of its grey state, and assumes an opposite spin direction. These electrons might, in principle, be separated by a great distance at the time of the measurement, so the measurement of our electron's spin must have a non-local effect on its partner. It is precisely this phenomenon that was so famously described by Albert Einstein as \"spooky action-at-a-distance.\" But this has nothing whatsoever to do with Garcia's notions of \"mind and spirit.\" Entanglement simply represents correlations that can be observed between physical systems. In addition, before entanglement could be \"proven\" between the body, mind and spirit, one would first need to demonstrate the existence of the mind and spirit. If this feat were ever to be accomplished, you would not likely be reading about it for the first time on a relatively obscure quantum healing website. Complementarity In a 2013 Huffington Post article entitled, \" [Can Reality Set Us Free? The Puzzle of Complementarity](http://huff.to/14ZNLu9),\" Deepak Chopra asserts: \"Among many other things, complementarity tells a physicist why two particles separated by vast distances in space manage to act instantaneously together, as if they were next to each other, communicating with each other. By implication this seemingly technical term also applies to two neurons talking to each other far apart in the human brain, and indeed to all biological systems.\" [7](#note07) Let's define complementarity to see if this makes sense. Imagine that you are shown a photograph of a baseball just released from a pitcher's hand. You are asked to determine where the ball will be one second after the picture was taken. What would you need to know about the baseball to answer correctly? In our day-to-day classical world, we need to know two things about an object in order to predict its future trajectory: the position of the object at some earlier time (in this example, at the time the photograph was taken) and the object's speed\u2014or, more appropriately, its momentum\u2014at that same earlier time. Position and momentum together can be used to provide a complete description of a classical object's trajectory through space. It is in this sense that they may be thought of as complementary quantities. However, when we enter the sub-microscopic scale of the quantum world, a funny thing happens: we find that notions of particle \"position\" and \"momentum\" quickly become murky and difficult to define. As it turns out, it is impossible to know with certainty the position or momentum of a sub-atomic particle. Further complicating matters, the higher the degree of precision with which we measure a particle's position, the lower our certainty will be about its momentum. Consequently, the more we know about the particle's momentum, the less we can know about its position. This trade-off is sometimes referred to as the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. So the principle of complementarity comes down to this: in order to get a complete understanding of the state of a physical system, it is necessary to have complete information about a pair of complementary properties, such as position and momentum. However, the uncertainty principle prevents us from measuring complementary properties simultaneously at the sub-atomic level, so we must be content with a limited state of knowledge with respect to any physical system we may wish to study. We are now in a position to see that Chopra's description of complementarity has little, if anything, to do with its actual meaning. Chopra appears to have confused two of quantum mechanics' foundational concepts: the principle of complementarity and the notion of quantum entanglement. He goes on to suggest that this principle must somehow apply to neurons, brains, and biological organisms. This assertion constitutes a remarkable leap in logic, particularly given that quantum entanglement has never been demonstrated between biological systems. The Quantum Cure The rise of quantum mysticism has exploited a fatal flaw in human reasoning, which may be partly to blame for our species' broader superstitious bent. Unfortunately, we all too often assume that ideas which lie beyond our immediate intellectual reach must somehow be mutually supportive, or connected in some way. No real progress is made when we choose to explain one mystery by another.

Are We All Potentially Evil? A new dramatic film based on the Stanford Prison Experiment reveals why good people turn bad by Michael Shermer The barbaric acts of ISIS in the Middle East and elsewhere (including lone wolf acts here and in Europe) have renewed the use of an adjective most commonly affiliated with Nazis\u2014evil. In fact, British Prime Minister David Cameron evoked Hitler in his recent speech outlining a five year plan to combat Islamic extremism, starting with the acknowledgment that it is an ideology, and \"Like so many ideologies that have existed before\u2014whether fascist or communist\u2014many people, especially young people, are being drawn to it. So we need to understand why it is proving so attractive.\" Another way to say it is this: why do good people turn bad? Anyone who has taken an introductory psychology course or has ever glanced at the scientific literature on the psychology of evil is familiar with Philip Zimbardo's now-famous experiment conducted in a make-shift prison in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University in August, 1971, in which the social psychologist randomly assigned 24 student volunteers to be either guards or prisoners. The experiment was to last two weeks but Zimbardo had to terminate it after six days when these intelligent and educated young men were transformed into cruel and sadistic guards or emotionally shattered prisoners. Not a formal experiment per se\u2014with control and experimental groups for comparison\u2014a flip of a coin to determine whether a student subject would be assigned to play guard or prisoner allows us to draw conclusions about the power of the situation to effect similar people dissimilarly. Over the decades much has been written about the Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE), both in scholarly journals and in popular publications, and a number of documentaries have been made using archival footage shot by Zimbardo's team. But now for the first time [a major motion picture has been produced](http://www.prisonexp.org/) by IFC Films, directed by Kyle Patrick Alvarez and written by Tim Talbott, with script consultation by Zimbardo and based on the transcripts of the dialogue between guards and prisoners reprinted in his 2007 book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. ( [Order the book from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812974441/?tag=skepticcom20-20) or [Watch the lecture now](http://lectures.skeptic.com/72786958), on Vimeo on Demand.) Unlike most filmic reenactments of real-life events in which considerable poetic license is taken to punch up the drama, none is needed for this film because the subjects themselves produced enough gravitas to keep the narrative arc moving toward its shattering conclusion. The tight-space cinematography well captures the claustrophobic nature of the faux basement prison, the editing and music pulls the audience into the prison cells and connecting hallway, and the coarse and profanity strewn dialogue (all real) shows the thin patina of civility covering the potential incivility that lies within even the most well-balanced psychologically healthy middle-class white college students (Zimbardo had them all tested for normalcy before the experiment began). If you, like most people (myself included) think \"I would never do such a thing to another human being\", see this film and think again. The evidence from the SPE and research since indicates otherwise\u2014the potential for evil is in all of us. In this sense The Stanford Prison Experiment engages us on both emotional and intellectual levels to consider the nature of good and evil from a scientific perspective, In brief, as outlined in my 2015 book [The Moral Arc](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b162HB), the dispositional theory holds that evil is the result of bad dispositions in some people (a few bad apples), whereas the situational theory holds that evil is the product of corrupting circumstances (bad barrels that corrupt apples). The dispositional theory of evil is the one most commonly embraced by religion (original sin), medicine (internal disease), psychiatry (mental illness), and the law (personal culpability), whereas the situational theory of evil is more conventionally invoked by social psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists sensitive to the diversity and power of environments to shape human behavior. In point of fact both of these theories contain an element of truth: by disposition we have the capacity for good and evil, with the behavioral expression of them dependent on the situation and whether we choose to act. That is, we all have the capacity to commit evil deeds, but the expression of such acts very much depends on circumstances and conditions. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn observed in [The Gulag Archipelago](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061253804/?tag=skepticcom20-20): If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart? In my model of morality, our dual dispositional nature of good and evil arose from our evolutionary history as a social primate species practicing within-group amity and between-group enmity. In order to survive as individuals we must get along with our fellow in-group members, and this led to the evolution of such moral emotions as empathy, cooperation, and trust. These pro-social tendencies gave us a good disposition. But because of the very real threat that strangers posed in the environment of our evolutionary ancestry natural selection also shaped us to have such emotions as xenophobia, competitiveness, and violence. These anti-social tendencies gave us an evil disposition. When I entered a graduate program in experimental psychology in the late 1970s Philip Zimbardo was already a legend. In an extensive interview I conducted with him in 2007 while researching my book [ The Mind of the Market ](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b126HB) (summarized here), Zimbardo explained how he became interested in this dark subject. Born in the south Bronx and raised in poverty by uneducated Sicilian parents, Zimbardo saw first hand the bleaker side of humanity, expressed when people find themselves in impoverished environments with unenforced laws and openly expressed distrust. As a young professor just recently hired by Stanford University, he returned to his old haunts to set up an experiment to see what would happen to an apparently abandoned vehicle left there, compared to one parked on the streets of the upscale neighborhood of Stanford's Palo Alto. In the Bronx, the car started being stripped before the research team could finish setting up their hidden cameras. In only one day there were 23 assaults on the helpless automobile. In Palo Alto, by contrast, the car went untouched until Zimbardo finally gave up and drove it back to campus, at which time three neighbors called the police to report an abandoned car was being stolen. Such a striking difference cannot be the result of differential dispositions between New Yorkers and Californians. Quite obviously the difference was in the neighborhoods. What were those differences? This is the question Zimbardo set out to answer in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. To add to the realism, the students assigned to be prisoners were arrested at home by members of the local Police Department, were brought to the prison in squad cars, then were sprayed for lice and forced to stand naked during orientation before they were finally given drab prison garb and crammed into 6-by-9 foot cells. For their part, the guards were given clubs, whistles, keys to the prison cells, and mirrored sunglasses (\"an idea I got from the film [Cool Hand Luke](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/movie/cool-hand-luke/id282715645?at=10l6ex),\" Zimbardo explained). Over the next couple of days these psychologically well-adjusted students were transformed into either the role of violent, authoritative guards or demoralized, impassive prisoners. The experiment was to last for two weeks. Zimbardo's girlfriend at the time (now his wife of nearly 40 years), Christina Maslach, after seeing the guards abusing the prisoners during their late night toilet run\u2014with bagged heads and chained ankles\u2014insisted that Zimbardo end it before someone was seriously hurt (\"She told me she wouldn't marry me if I was the sort of person who would allow such a thing to happen\" he recalled). At that moment he realized that he had become part of the experiment in the role of prison superintendent. \"I called off the experiment not because of the horror I saw out there in the prison yard,\" he explained in the technical write up of the experiment, \"but because of the horror of realizing that I could have easily traded places with the most brutal guard or become the weakest prisoner full of hatred at being so powerless that I could not eat, sleep, or go to the toilet without permission of authorities.\" I asked Zimbardo how he views the experience decades later. \"The message of my little Stanford Prison Experiment is that situations can have a more powerful influence over our behavior than most people appreciate and few people recognize,\" he began. \"Social psychologists like myself have been trying to correct the belief that most people hold that evil is located only in the disposition of the individual\u2014in their genes, their brains, their essence\u2014and that there are good apples and there are bad apples.\" But, I rejoined, there are bad apples, no? Yes, of course, Zimbardo conceded the point, but the vast majority of evil in the world is not committed by those few bad apples; instead, it is ordinary people doing extraordinary things under certain circumstances. Zimbardo prefers to err on the side of granting people the benefit of the doubt. \"Before we blame individuals, the charitable thing to do is to first find out what situations they were in that might have provoked this evil behavior. Why not assume that these are good apples in a bad barrel, rather than bad apples in a good barrel?\" How can we tell the difference between good and bad apples, and between good and bad barrels, I pressed? \"When I launched my experiment at Stanford we knew these students were good apples because we gave them a battery of tests\u2014personality tests, clinical interviews, we checked their background, etc., and every one of them was normal. Then we randomly assigned them to be guards or prisoners. So, on day one they were all good apples. Yet within days, the guards were transformed into sadistic thugs and the prisoners were emotionally broken.\" Zimbardo's bad barrel turned good apples rotten. The Stanford Prison Experiment film stays in its time period and offers little in the way of deeper reflection on its meaning, but what pushed Zimbardo to finally write a deep analysis of what he discovered was the atrocities at Abu Ghraib that came to light in 2003. The shocking photographs reminded him of the SPE. \"Believe me,\" he told me, \"what we have all seen on television is just the tip of the iceberg. The abuses were much worse than you can imagine when you see all of the uncensored photographs.\" He shared some of these photographs with me and it's true\u2014these uncensored scenes almost beggar description. You wince when you see them. How could the people who did this not embody pure evil? It depends on what we mean by evil. Zimbardo defines it in The Lucifer Effect thusly: \"Evil consists in intentionally behaving in ways that harm, abuse, demean, dehumanize, or destroy innocent others\u2014or using one's authority and systemic power to encourage or permit others to do so on your behalf.\" More succinctly, and incorporating room for free will and moral culpability, evil is \"knowing better but doing worse.\" When the Abu Ghraib story broke it wasn't long before the media made the same connection to the Stanford Prison Experiment that its Principle Investigator had, and Zimbardo soon found himself on NPR and other media outlets to discuss the similarities. Shortly thereafter he was contacted by one of the attorneys representing Staff Sergeant Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick, the military policeman in charge of the night shift on Tiers 1A and 1B, the most abusive cellblocks in that most abusive of Iraqi prisons. Without denying Frederick's culpability in the Abu Ghraib abuses (Frederick admitted his own guilt), Zimbardo wanted to go deeper to explore the environment that enabled the torture, abuse, and humiliation of the prisoners there. Zimbardo did not so much defend Frederick as implicate the chain of command above Frederick with complicity in the crime. Zimbardo agreed that Frederick should have been punished for his actions, but the punishment should fit the crime and we should hold accountable Frederick's superiors who enabled or even encouraged such abuses. Instead, those who fashioned the environment in which Frederick acted walked free while Frederick was given an eight-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth (he was released after four years). Research psychologists typically employ what is known as an A-B-A experimental protocol, that is, pre-test\u2014test\u2014post-test. Pre- and post-test comparisons with the behaviors during the test allow us to tease out causal variables. In this model, Zimbardo told me that before he went to Iraq, Chip Frederick was an all-American patriot, \"a regular church-going kind of guy who raises the American flag in front of his home each day, gets goose bumps and tears up when he listens to our National Anthem, believes in American values of democracy and freedom, and joined the army to defend those values.\" Frederick, in fact, was a model soldier, earning numerous awards, including the Army Achievement Medal three times, the Army Reserve Components Medal four times, the National Defense Medal twice, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, and others. He was about to receive a coveted Bronze Star when the Abu Ghraib abuse story broke. After the story broke about the abuses at Abu Ghraib, Zimbardo arranged for a military clinical psychologist to conduct a full psychological assessment of Frederick through a battery of tests, as well as bringing Frederick and his wife, Martha, to San Francisco in order to better know the person behind the MP uniform. The psychological assessments of Frederick indicated that he was by all counts a perfectly normal guy, average in intelligence, average in personality, with \"no sadistic or pathological tendencies,\" and with only one outlier trait: \"Validity scales indicate the patient presented himself as a morally virtuous individual.\" To Zimbardo, these results \"strongly suggest that the 'bad apple' dispositional attribution of blame made against him by military and administration apologists has no basis in fact.\" After he was convicted Frederick penned a letter to Zimbardo from prison in which he confessed (in The Lucifer Effect): \"I am proud to say that I served most of my adult life for my country. I was very prepared to die for my country, my family and friends. I wanted to be the one to make a difference.\" In the A-B-A model, before Abu Ghraib Chip Frederick was normal. At Abu Ghraib he was abnormal. After Abu Ghraib he was once again normal. What does this tell us? \"There is absolutely nothing in his record that I was able to uncover that would predict that Chip Frederick would engage in any form of abusive, sadistic behavior,\" Zimbardo concluded. \"On the contrary, there is much in his record to suggest that had he not been forced to work and live in such an abnormal situation, he might have been the military's All-American poster soldier on its recruitment ads.\" Pulling back from this specific case to the general principles behind evil, Zimbardo posits a triad of factors\u2014the Person, the Situation, and the System\u2014and how together and in interaction with one another they can lead a good person to perform evil acts. Here we see an integration of the dispositional theory of evil (the Person), the situational theory of evil (the Situation), and a third component Zimbardo only added after his investigation of Abu Ghraib\u2014the larger context in which the person and situation co-exist (the System). \"When I was reading the reports about Abu Ghraib I wanted to know who creates these situations that enables evil?\" he recalled in our interview. \"The system is the bigger barrel: legal, economic, historical, political forces that gives these situations legitimacy. And most systems have a shield so that there is no transparency. Top politicians like Bush and Cheney have to cater to particular voters and donors, and those voters and donors will be part of a political or religious or corporate system that enables them to say, in essence, if you want our votes or our dollars, you have to go along with what we believe.\" Wait, I wonder aloud. Does this mean that everyone from George W. Bush and Dick Cheney at the top to Chip Frederick and Lynndie England at the bottom are absolved of responsibility? Does explanation equal exoneration? Sensing my unease at the implications of where all this science leads, Zimbardo quickly rejoined: \"What happened at Abu Ghraib was inexcusable, but it was not inexplicable. I cannot repeat this caveat enough: to explain something is not to excuse it.\" He recalled an incident in Washington D.C. when he was testifying in another matter when he was accused of being an \"excuseologist.\" The label stung. \"We're not excusing anything. We're scientists who, like all scientists, want to understand the cause of things, in this case evil behavior.\" Watching The Stanford Prison Experiment film you will be tempted\u2014as I was\u2014to moralize about the accursed guards and sympathize with the guiltless prisoners. Such is the power of a good film. But after your moral emotions subside think like a scientist and consider why good people turn bad, and what we can all do to prevent future evils. [The Apostate](https://youtu.be/9T8mTQL4bE8) Would anyone knowingly join a religion with a draconian apostacy clause? I don't think so.

The entire dialogue is now available online, and includes discussions on: Materialism in Science, Mental Action at a Distance, and God and Science. Hello Reality SKEPTICALITY EPISODE 256 With The Amazing Meeting ending only a couple days ago, Derek doesn't wait to give you the first recorded interview from the event. Derek talks with Jim Baggott, author of many books on the nature of reality and physics. In his latest work, [Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth](http://amzn.com/1605985740?tag=skepticcom20-20), Baggott argues that there is no observational or experimental evidence for many of the ideas of modern theoretical physics: super-symmetric particles, super strings, the multiverse, the holographic principle, or the anthropic cosmological principle. These theories are not only untrue, they are not even science. It is fairy-tale physics: fantastical, bizarre and often outrageous, perhaps even confidence-trickery. FEATURE ARTICLE Fine-Tuning and the Multiverse For years theologians and Christian apologists have convinced themselves and their followers that they have a knock-out scientific argument for the existence of God. They claim that the parameters of physics are so finely tuned that if any one of these parameters were just slightly different in value, then life would not be possible anywhere in the universe. The solution to the fine-tuning problem that is regarded as the most plausible by physicists and cosmologists is that our universe is just one of an unlimited number of individual, uncreated universes collectively called the multiverse that extend for an unlimited distance in all directions and for an unlimited time in the past and future. We just happen to live in the particular universe that is suited for our kind of life. Our universe is not fine-tuned for us; we are fine-tuned to our universe. In this essay, as a follow-up to his book, [The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: Why the Universe Is Not Designed for Us](http://amzn.com/1616144432?tag=skepticcom20-20) (in which he showed that, based on our knowledge of this universe alone, divine fine-tuning claims are without merit), Victor J. Stenger brings the arguments up-to-date with a discussion of the eternal multiverse hypothesis.

For years theologians and Christian apologists have convinced themselves and their followers that they have a knock-out scientific argument for the existence of God. They claim that the parameters of physics are so finely tuned that if any one of these parameters were just slightly different in value, then life would not be possible anywhere in the universe. Assuming\u2014on no basis whatsoever\u2014that those parameters are independent and could have taken on any value over a wide range, they conclude that the probability of a universe with our particular set of parameters is infinitesimally small. Further assuming\u2014also on no basis whatsoever\u2014that the probability of a divine creator is not equally infinitesimally small, they conclude that a creator fine-tuned the universe for life. Note that there is also no basis whatsoever to assume [CONTINUE "}
