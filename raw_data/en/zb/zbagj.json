The physicochemical properties of the lipopeptide components were compatible with multi-dimensional using RP-HPLC, Edman sequencing, electrospray mass spectrometry, and 2D-NMR. Detailed analysis of the impurity profiles led to the detection and evaluation of the relative proportions of most by-products: several contaminants resulted from the formation of acetylated fragments, transpeptidation reactions with succinimide or piperidide formation, or methionine and/or tryptophan mono-oxidations. The first batch to be produced underwent extensive pharmacotoxicological testings to confirm its safety; this vaccine candidate has now been used in phase I clinical trials. Despite the complexity of such multi-lipopeptide vaccines, our findings suggest the possibility of preparing a clear and precise assignment of by-products to toxicologically qualified impurities in the eventuality of a future production of several successive batches.
