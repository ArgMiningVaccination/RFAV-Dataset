We've brought together a number of vitamins and minerals to form our Basic Balance supplement pack. WHY CHOOSE OUR DAILY SUPPLEMENT PACK? While it is possible to blend all of the supplements within our Basic Balance Pack into a single health supplement, this would remove a lot of the nutrients and balance that is provided from multiple supplements. Our daily supplement sachet provides a mixture of health supplements that all contain high-quality dosages of a number of essential vitamins and minerals. NEW GREENER PACKAGING As part of our ongoing commitment to becoming a more sustainable supplement company, we've updated our daily pack packaging. We've got rid of the bulky plastic tubs and replaced them with biodegradable pouches. We've still had to keep the individual plastic sachets inside, as we are yet to find a solution that keeps the supplements fresh. We're working on it. WHAT DO YOU GET IN OUR BASIC BALANCE PACK? Each sachet contains the following supplements: 2x Natural Vitamin E 400iu Capsule Vitamin E is a well-known fat-soluble antioxidant. It comes in eight forms, some of which are synthetic, while others are naturally obtained. We use D-Alpha Tocopherol Succinate in our vitamin E supplement.
