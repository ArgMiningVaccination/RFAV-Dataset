The single most important thing you can do to lower your risk for head and neck cancer is to stop smoking.

But when HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts and cancer. HPV is found in mouth and throat or oropharyngeal (OR-oh-fuh-RIN-jee-uhl) cancers in men and women. More than 7 out of 10 cancers found in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils, are HPV-related.
