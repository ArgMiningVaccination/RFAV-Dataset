We have used structure-guidedmethods to develop a lead molecule that targetsthe thioesterase activity of polyketide synthasePks13, an essential enzyme that forms mycolic acids, required for the cell wall of Mycobacterium tubercu- losis. Our lead, TAM16, is a benzofuran class of Pks13 with highly in vitro bactericidal activ-ity against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant clin-ical isolates of M. tuberculosis . In multiple mouse models of TB infection, TAM16 showed in vivo ef-cacy TB drug isoniazid, monotherapy and in combination with rifampicin. TAM16 has excellent pharmacological and safety proles, and the frequency of resistancefor TAM16 is /C24100-fold lower than INH, suggesting that it can be developed as a new antitubercularaimed at the acute infection. INTRODUCTION Drug-resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)i sa serious problem that threatens to worsen the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic ( World Health Organization, 2014 ). Although cur- rent six-month therapy for drug-susceptible TB can achieve acure rate of >90%, the treatment of drug-resistant strains is more protracted ( R2 years) and involves the use of costly andless effective second-line drugs that have signicant side effects (Zumla et al., 2013 ). Isoniazid (INH) is a frontline TB drug that has been a mainstay of TB therapy since its introduction in 1952 ( Bernstein et al., 1952 ). However, resistance occurs frequently with in vitro rates of about 1 in 10 /C05-10/C06, which translates to high levels of clinical resistance ranging from 9.5% to 62%, based on geography and disease burden ( Jenkins et al., 2011; World Health Organization, 2014 ). INH is a pro-drug that is activated by a catalase-peroxi- dase enzyme (KatG) produce a radical that dinucleotide (NAD) to al., 1998 ), an enzyme required for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids that are used to form mycolic acids ( Vilche `ze et al., 2000 ). Because INH is activated by the non-essential KatG, resistance to INH often arises through loss-of-function mutations in the katG gene ( Heym et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1992 ). Indeed, the most common cause of INH resistance is the loss-of-function mutation KatG-S315T, which has been found in as many as 94% of INH-resistant and up to 82% of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb clinical isolates ( Torres et al., 2015 ). In addition, mutations in the inhA gene and its promoter region, i.e., the c-15t base change, further complicate the treat- ment of drug-resistant TB, conferring resistance not only to INH but also to the second-line TB drug ethionamide (ETH) ( Banerjee et al., 1994 with reported frequencies of 35% and 55% in INH- and ETH-resistant clinical isolates, respectively ( Vilcheze and Jacobs, 2014 ). After 65 years of use, the widespread and very high levels of INH resistance underscore the urgent clinical need for the development of alternative cell wall-active antibi- otics for TB. Mycolic acids are critical for viability and virulence of Though these long-chain 13, 2017 \u00aa2017 The Authors.

In Mtb, mycolic acid biosynthesis occurs through the concerted action of more than 20 enzymes that are compo-nents of different multi-enzyme complexes ( Takayama et al., 2005 ). Therefore, this pathway represents an important reservoir of novel targets for the development of new TB drugs, especiallyin the context of the emergence of drug resistance. Polyketide synthases (PKS) are an important family of en- zymes that have not been exploited as drug targets for any mi-crobial pathogen. The Mtb H37Rv genome has about 24 PKS encoding genes ( Cole et al., 1998 ). Genetic and biochemical studies have now linked most of the mycobacterial PKSs to participating in complex metabolites form essential components of the uniquely lipid-rich and complex cell wall of Mtb, which has been proposed as a means for it to survive under harsh conditions in host mac- rophages while also imparting an intrinsic resistance against Figure 1.

It is comprised of ve domains, includingtwo acyl carrier protein domains, a b-ke- toacyl-synthase, an acyltransferase, and a C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain,that together contain all of the activities required for the condensation of two long-chain fatty acids. This activity has been shown to be essential both in vitro and in vivo ( Portevin et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2013 ). We recently discovered a small molecule that was active against Mtb H37Rv (TAM1; Figure 1 A) and identied that Pks13 was the target through whole-genomesequencing and recombineering of the resistance mutations (Ioerger et al., 2013 ). In another study, a series of thiophenes were identied that kill Mtb by targeting the N-terminal ACP N domain of Pks13. Wilson et al., 2013 , propose that the com- pounds function by blocking the interaction of ACP Nwith FadD32 protein, which transfers the meromycolyl chain. Theseresults substantiate Pks13 as a druggable target for Mtb and highlight its potential for the development of new TB drugs that interfere with the critical pathway of mycolic acid synthesis. In this paper, we describe the structure-based development of a highly potent and very safe lead compound, TAM16 ( Table 1), which targets Pks13. It MDR and exten- Mtb lack of cross-resistance with existing TB therapeu- tics. By inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis, it synergizes with other TB drugs, like rifampicin (RIF), likely by augmenting their 250 Cell170, 249-259, July 13, 2017penetration into Mtb. Importantly, in murine TB infection models, it demonstrates efcacy equal to INH. Furthermore, unlike INH, which shows a relative high frequency of resistance, TAM16 shows 100-fold lower frequency of resistance. Theseproperties, combined with the excellent pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity proles, will likely allow us to convert this lead into a rst-line drug. RESULTS TAM1 Inhibits Pks13 TE Domain Activity Two laboratory-derived mutant strains resistant to TAM1 were found to harbor non-synonymous mutations, i.e., either D1607N or D1644G, both located in the TE domain of Pks13.To characterize the precise mechanism of action of TAM1 on the TE activity, a recombinant-expression plasmid was con- structed to produce the domain for biochemical analysis. Thepure recombinant protein, consisting of the TE domain of the Pks13 (Pks13-TE), was enzymatically active and produced diffraction-quality crystals complexed to TAM1. An enzyme assay was developed for the TE activity fluorescent fatty acid was able to cleave the ester of 4-MUH, and kinetic analysisindicated mM(Figure 1 ). TAM1 Blocks the Active Site of Pks13-TE As a rst step to structure-guided medicinal chemistry on the benzofuran inhibitor, we solved the crystal structure of Pks13- TE complexed with TAM1 and rened it to high A ;Table S2 The crystals contained two monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (designated A and B). The over- all structure of Pks13-TE consists of a core domain and alid domain ( Figure 1 B). The larger core possesses a canonical a/b-hydrolase fold comprised of a central seven-stranded b sheet b1-b7) flanked by four The lid domain 1575-1645) is in- serted between strands b5 and b6 and consists of four ahelices, a4-a7, along two short helices, a8 and a9, 1665- 1675) present between the strands b6 and b7 of the core domain. Based on the analysis with VAST server ( Gibrat et al., 1996 ), the Pks13-TE lid domain appears to be relatively unique among TEstructures reported to date. The Pks13-TE active-site pocket is formed at the interface be- tween the lid and core domains. The catalytic triad was identiedto be Ser1533, Asp1560, and His1699, and N-atoms of Leu1534 and Ala1477. Extend- ing from the active site is a deep ( /C2430 A) hydrophobic groove that spans the full length of the lid domain, with a total surface area of/C241290 A 2(Figure S1 A). A similarly located surface groove (/C2420 A) in the a-helical lid domain of bovine palmitoyl-protein 1 ( Bellizzi et al., 2000 ). We observed unexpected electron density in this pocket of apo-Pks13-TEstructure that could be built as an eight-carbon fragment of poly- propylene glycol (PPG, C 8O5), an additive in the crystallization buffer. The fragment is located in the fatty acyl chain-binding site based on the superimposition of Pks13-TE structure withthe bovine PPT1 and human FAS TE (hFAS-TE) structures (Zhang et al., 2011 ). However, unlike the Pks13-TE acyl chain- binding site, the bovine PPT1 and hFAS-TE is not surfaceexposed. The PPG binding pocket is connected at the catalyticsite to a series of tunnel-like regions that could also bind an acyl chain ( Figure S1 B). The more elaborate system of binding grooves and tunnels is likely related to the very long carbonchains (C80-90) that make up the mycolic acid precursor, compared to PPT1 and hFAS ( C). TAM1 binds in the fatty acyl chain-binding groove at the entrance of the Pks13-TE active site, effectively blocking access of the substrate to the catalytic center of the enzyme ( Figures 1B-1D). Several differences were seen between the apo- and TAM1-bound structures of Pks13-TE, the most signicant beingin the side chain of Phe1670. Phe1670 is located at the end of he- lixa8 directly adjacent to the acyl binding pocket. The phenyl ring of Phe1670 flips by about 80 /C14in the TAM1 structure, compared to the apo protein, to form a slightly off-plane van der Waals stacking interaction with the furan ring ( Figure S2 A). The four different substituents attached to the benzofuran scaffold (P 1, P2,P3, and P 4;Figure 1 A) were found to interact with residues that line the substrate-binding cleft. Indeed, most of the binding interactions occur between amino acids from helix a7 of the lid domain and the two supporting helices a8-a9 along with the loop that connects them to strand b6 of the core domain ( Figures 1B and 1D). Overall, the structure showed that the phenyl group of TAM1 (P 1) is solvent exposed; P 2ethyl ester is partially solvent exposed, while P 3piperidine and P 4OH are completely buried in Pks13-TE. The Pks13-TE structure shows that the D1644G mutation con- fers resistance through the loss of a direct H bond between a carboxylate oxygen and the P 4OH of TAM1. The crystal S2 B;Table S2 ) explained its more subtle effect on binding, through the loss of ion pair inter- action between the carboxylate of Asp1607 on helix a6 and the guanidinium of Arg1641 (3 A ) located on the parallel helix, a7. Without this interaction, a7 shifts away from the substrate-bind- ing groove by about 3 A , moving Asp1644 out of hydrogen- bonding distance from the 4OH TAM1. pharmacological properties ( Table 1 ; Figure 2 ;STAR Methods ;Table S3 ). Briefly, the two major phar- macological liabilities of TAM1were the phenyl at P 1, which was hydroxylated in mouse liver microsomes (MLMs) to yield primar-ily the 4-OH ( Figure S3 A), and the P 2ester, which was cleaved to the inactive acid in mouse serum. The structure of the Pks13-TE- TAM1 complex indicated that the side chain amide of Gln1633was positioned in close proximity ( /C244A) to the para -position of the P 1phenyl ring, suggesting that 4-OH form of the inhibitor would retain enzyme inhibitory activity. Indeed, the P 14-OH- containing analog, TAM16, had greatly improved metabolic sta- bility July 13, 251Table 1. Preliminary P2 0.12 \u00b10.02 4.4 TAM3 OH 0.24 13.3 OH 7.3 \u00b11.9 TAM8 \u00b12.3 TAM9 next page ) 252 Cell170, 249-259, July 13, 2017potency, and potency compared with TAM1 ( Table 1 ). The structure also indicated that the bioisosteric replacement of the ester with a methylamide that would be stable in serum would be tolerated in the binding pocket. Indeed, the methyl amide of TAM12 was stable and showed similar enzyme-inhibitory activity (IC 500.3mM) as the ethyl ester analog TAM9; it exhibited betterwhole-cell Table 1 ). Among P 3groups, the piperidine was the most potent of the P 3substituents synthesized. Struc- tures of P 3substituted analogs showed that ve-, six-, and seven-membered rings at P 3led to variations in the van der Waals and stacking interactions with the planar side chain of Tyr1674, and these interactions were abolished in TAM6 withacyclic dimethyl amine at P 3. Thus, among the P 3analogs, the piperidine group was optimally located sandwiched between Tyr1663 and Tyr1674, and its protonated N appears to be abifurcated hydrogen donor, forming an intra-molecular hydrogenbond with the P 2carbonyl oxygen (2.9 A ) and another with the side chain oxygen of Asn1640 (2.9 A ). We also explored alterations to the P 4OH group. All P 4analogs at C-5 showed a dramatic loss in enzyme potency presumably due to loss of hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Asp1644. The result- ing molecule, TAM16, was the most potent and stable inhib-itor (IC 500.19 mM, minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0.09 mM) (Figures 2 and S3B). Low Frequency of Resistance, No Cross-Resistance, and Combination Potential of TAM16 Resistant mutants emerged at frequencies of 7 310/C07and /C2483 10/C08at 103and 203MIC, which were /C24100-fold lower than the frequency observed for INH (1 310/C06). Sequencing of two resis- tant mutants revealed point mutations in pks13 that resulted in a single non-synonymous amino acid substitution in Pks13(D1644G or D1644Y), and they retained sensitivity to INH and RIF (MICs 0.2 and 0.04 mM, respectively). We determined MIC values of TAM16 against 38 clinical Mtb strains representing a wide range of mutations covering all known molecular mechanisms involved in imparting resistanceagainst rst- and second-line TB drugs that form the core component of TB treatment regimen ( Tables S4 and S5). TAM16 of Mtb (MICs 0.06-0.250 mM). Most importantly, TAM16 was potent against all MDR and XDR clinical isolates of Mtb evaluated (MIC range of 0.05-0.42 mM;Table 2 ). The lack of cross-resistance of TAM16 with current TB drugs shows theimportance of developing new drugs with distinct modes of action. One of the advantages of drugs that target cell wall biosyn- thesis, like INH, is their ability to combine with other antibiotics to increase efcacy. We tested TAM16 in combination with INH, RIF, and EMB in vitro in two-drug combination studiesby the combination index (CI) method ( Chou, 2006 ) (wherein CI < 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 indicate synergistic, additive, and antag- onistic interactions, respectively). While TAM16 showed no syn-ergistic activity with INH and EMB, the two other drugs thattarget cell wall, the combination of TAM16 with RIF, which tar- gets the RNA polymerase, showed highly synergistic activity (CI = 0.55) against Mtb mc 27000 . Notably, at the combination ra- tio of 1:0.5, the MIC of RIF was improved /C243-fold to 0.011 mM compared to RIF alone (MIC 0.35 mM), while the MIC of TAM16 improved by 5-fold (0.022 mM) compared to TAM16 alone (0.10 mM). This synergy is likely based on increased permeability of the bacterial cell wall leading to enhanced RIF accumulation. Indeed, two-drug combinations of TAM16 with antituberculardrugs TMC207 (a diarylquinoline compound that inhibits ATP synthesis) and streptomycin (SM, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis) also showed synergistic activity(CI/C240.54 and 0.81, respectively). The combination of TAM16 and TMC207 (at a combination ratio of 1:0.5) improved the MIC of TAM16 in the presence of TMC207 by /C246.5-fold to 0.016 mM, and the MIC of TMC207 in the presence of TAM16 was improved 2.6-fold to 0.005 mM compared to the MIC of TMC207 alone (MIC 0.013 mM). Similarly, the combination of TAM16 and SM (at a combination ratio of 1:2) was synergistic:it improved TAM16 MIC by /C244-fold in the presence of SM, and the addition of TAM16 improved the MIC of SM /C242-fold toTable IC50values were determined using the Mtb Pks13-TE domain as described in the methods section.

Cell170, 249-259, July 13, 2017 2530.037 mM compared to the SM MIC when it was used alone (0.07 mM). Overall, these results are consistent with previously observed effects of cell wall inhibitors on improving the penetra-tion of anti- Mtb drugs Lechartier 2012 ). Pharmacokinetic macological properties ( Table 3 ). It showed low plasma protein binding in both mouse and human plasma and exhibited very low clearance in MLM and HLMs (human liver microsomes) (CL int< Table 3 ), two phenolic OH were not signicantly glucuronidated in the microsomalincubation assays ( Figure S3 C). Pharmacokinetic studies in Swiss Webster mice were per- formed with TAM16 dosed by oral administration at 100 mg/kgtwice daily. At this dose, maximum plasma concentration (C max) of TAM16 reached 3.6 mg/ml at 5 hr, and the AUC was 18.3 mg.hr/ml. At a single dose of TAM16, mouse exposure was higher than the MIC (34.3 ng/ml) for /C2412 hr. Pharmacoki- netic parameters determined after a single oral and intra- venous dose of 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively, inBALB/c mice showed that TAM16 had moderate total plasma clearance (37 mL/min per kg), a large volume of distribution (4.2 l/kg), good exposure, and oral bioavailability (28%) ( Table 3 ; Figure S4 ). not cytotoxic to mammalian cells at concentra- tions up to 100 mM, and it was well tolerated in BALB/c mice at up to 300 mg/kg administered orally once daily for 3 days. Furthermore, TAM16 had no observable inhibitory activity against most of assay ( Schmalhofer et al., 2010 ) displaying an IC 50of 21 mM. Additional off-target activity screening against a broad panelof therapeutically relevant enzymes and receptors did not revealany signicant issues related to human safety. Moreover, in a two-strain Ames fluctuation assay for genotoxicity, the com- pound did not exhibit mutagenic potential in the two strainswith or without S9. For an antitubercular compound to be effective, it is essential that it achieves high exposure in the infected tissue consistingof macrophages and other immune cells in the human host. Cellular uptake studies using the cell line THP-1 as an in vitro macrophage model ( Stokes and Doxsee, 1999 ) showed that, Figure 2.

The MIC 90values were determined using MGIT 960 system. 254 Cell170, 249-259, July 13, 2017on average, maintained high (>70 3MIC) concentrations of TAM16 ( R6.5mM when treated with 10 mM compound) for up to 24 hr, indicating that the compound is freely perme- able into the macrophage cytosol and can achieve high expo- sure. Indeed, TAM16 showed good activity in Mtb infected with glutathioneand methoxylamine ( Johansson et al., 2009 )(Figures S3 D and S3E). Moreover, TAM16 was stable after 4 weeks of incubation in vitro in low-pH buffered solutions (pH 3-5) at room tempera-ture. Thus, taken together, the stability data suggests that the Mannich substructure in TAM16 does not represent a signi- cant liability, consistent with previously reported stability evaluated TAM16 for in vivo efcacy in mouse models of acute and chronic TB infection. The TAM16 dosing regimens used in these animal studies were based on the maximum toler-ated dose and pharmacokinetic studies. We rst tested the in vivo activity of TAM16 using a mouse model of acute TB ( Dutta et al., 2014 ), representing a population of actively multiplying Mtb in the host. BALB/c mice lungs were implanted with a very high inoculum of Mtb (/C244.4 log 10bacilli), which multiplied to a peak lung burden of /C247.7 log 10CFU (colony-forming unit) 14 days after infection. Treatment of the mice was initiated2 weeks post-infection with once-daily oral dosing of TAM16 (200 mg/kg) or INH (10 mg/kg). After 2 weeks of treatment, the TAM16 treated group showed a signicant reduction in thelung CFU to /C246.8 log 10, which was indistinguishable from INH treatment, which reduced the lung CFU counts to /C246.7 log 10 (p > 0.05). Contrarily, all of the untreated control mice were mori- bund 1 week after treatment initiation due to uncontrolled bacil-lary growth in the lungs and were euthanized in accordance with institutional animal care regulations ( Figure 3 A). Histopathology of the mice post-treatment showed that TAM16 prevented thedevelopment of characteristic lung lesions ( Figure S5 ). We next tested the in vivo activity of TAM16 in a chronic TB infection model in which lungs of BALB/c mice were aerosol-in-fected with Mtb using low-dose inocula, and treatment was initi- ated 4 weeks later when a steady-state infection was established at/C247 log 10CFU per lung. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice treated with a once-daily oral dose of TAM16 (300 mg/kg) for 5 days per week showed a signicant reduction in lung CFU counts by /C240.9 log 10compared with the untreated control mice (p = 0.01) ( Figure 3 B). TAM16 treatment also signicantly reduced the spleen bacterial burdens by /C242.2 log 10CFU relative to that of the untreated control group (p < 0.001). Mice receiving INH (25 mg/kg) for 4 weeks showed a decrease in CFU counts by/C241.1 log 10and /C242.5 log 10in lungs and spleen, respectively, which again was statistically indistinguishable from the activity observed with TAM16 (p > 0.05) ( Figure 3 B). Because of the synergy that was observed between TAM16 and RIF in the in vitro assays, we evaluated the drug combination of TAM16 and RIF in a mouse model representing a chronic TBinfection. BALB/c mice were infected with a low-dose aerosol,and treatment was initiated 4 weeks post-infection with the com- bination of TAM16 (200 mg/kg) and RIF (10 mg/kg) in an 8-week study, where the combination was dosed orally once daily for5 days per week. After 4 weeks of treatment, the combination of TAM16 and RIF resulted in a dramatic 2.54 log 10CFU reduc- tion in the bacterial load in the mice lungs when compared to thatof the vehicle-only control (p < 0.001) ( Figure 3 C). We saw a further reduction in bacterial load when the combination was continued for an additional 4 weeks with an impressive overallreduction of /C243.9 log 10CFU in lungs over 8 weeks treatment when compared to the untreated control (p < 0.001). This was similar to the gold standard combination of INH and RIF thatshowed an efcacy of /C244.1 log 10CFU reduction ( Fig- ure 3 C;Table S7 ). Moreover, the combination of TAM16 and RIF was signicantly more active than RIF alone, with an additional decrease of /C241.5 log 10CFU counts after 8 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001). TAM16 as a single agent showed 9.95 Kinetic solubility ( mM) 74 (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) Plasma protein binding (%): Mouse 73 Human 72 Intrinsic clearance in liver microsomes(CL int) (mL/min/g 4.2 Oral bioavailability ( F) (%) 28 Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after administration of single oral (po) and intravenous (iv) doses of TAM16 at 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively, in female BALB/c mouse. concentration; Tmax, time to AUC, area under the concentration curve; Vss, TPSA, total polar surface area.

In this study, no overt toxicity was observed in treated mice. Compan- ion PK studies revealed a mean maximal drug concentration inplasma (C max\u00b1SD) of 6.21 \u00b11.5mg/mL and 6.30 \u00b12.3mg/mL with trough concentrations of 1.91 \u00b11.1mg/mL and 1.58 \u00b1 0.8mg/mL for TAM16 30 min and 24 hr following oral administra- tion alone, or 1 hr following prior RIF administration whensampled at steady state (week 8 of dosing), respectively. Thus, taken together, the efcacy data indicates that TAM16 has potent in vivo activity equivalent to INH, which is the most bacte-ricidal rst-line TB drug in current use, and highlights its potential for further pre-clinical development. DISCUSSION INH, an inhibitor of the mycolic acid synthesis, has been a main- stay of TB therapy for decades. Although, in general, INH is well tolerated, it has several limitations. Because it is a pro-drug whose activation requires an Mtb enzyme that is not essential, resistance arises frequently through loss-of-function mutationsin the activator KatG. Thus, a compound that targets mycolic acid synthesis and is not a pro-drug, such as the Pks13-targeting TAM16 developed in this study, should prove to be a better alter-native to INH. Indeed, the frequency of resistance is about 100- fold lower for TAM16 as compared to INH. Though several other such compounds, such as InhA inhibitors, that do not requireactivation have been described ( Guardia et al., 2016; Manjuna- tha et al., 2015; Pan and Tonge, 2012 ), none have advanced to the point where they can easily be compared with INH in animalstudies, unlike TAM16. TAM16 is a novel benzofuran class lead molecule with excel- lent drug-like properties and favorable pharmacokinetic and safety proles. It exhibits potent in vivo efcacy in both acuteand chronic mouse TB models when administered orally as a sin- gle dose, which is a highly desirable feature for a new TB thera- peutic as it simplies dosing regimen, encouraging patientcompliance. However, the primary advantages of TAM16 are the novel target and the fact that it is not a pro-drug. This unique mode of action means that there will be no pre-existing resistancein clinical strains. Our studies verify that TAM16 is potent against multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mtb strains. One of the advantages of drugs that target mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis is their potential to combine with other an-tibiotics to increase efcacy by improving their penetration. This makes compounds such as TAM16, which probably selectively Figure 3.

TAM16 combines well with RIF, a drug that kills different subpop-ulations of bacteria, suggesting that it is also likely to synergize with other drugs that have different modes of action. Indeed, TAM16 also showed synergistic activity in combination withother TB Thus, TAM16 has suitable attri- butes for inclusion into either the current or any newly developed combination therapy for TB treatment. Overall, the results pre-sented here demonstrate that TAM16 represents a promising candidate as a replacement of INH and validate Pks13 as a drug target in Mtb. Structure-guided drug development has proven to be a powerful approach to producing new agents but has had limited application in the process of developing new antimycobacterialcompounds ( Lechartier et al., 2014; Zuniga et al., 2015 ). These ndings re-emphasize the utility of structure-guided approaches for antimycobacterials when starting with compounds that have good whole cell and low toxicity. Whole-genome sequencing ofresistant mutants for target identication can quickly provide a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of new com- pounds with antibiotic activity as a path to turning these prom-ising molecules into drugs.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Animal studies All animal experiments described in this manuscript followed protocols approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee's at Colorado State University, Johns Hopkins University and Texas A&M University. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice Swiss-Webster female mice ( /C2420 g each) (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were used in the PK study. The formulation of TAM16 was pre- pared in 90% canola oil and 10% DMSO. Mice were dosed at 100 mg/kg by oral gavage at 0 hr and 4 hr time points in 0.1 mL aliquotsto yield a nal dose per day of 200 mg/kg. Three mice were used per time point. The mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xyalzine and /C240.1 mL of blood was drawn for survival bleeds at 0.5, 1.5, 5 hr, time points, and /C240.3 mL of blood was drawn for terminal bleeds at 4, 8 and 12 hr time points. Blood was collected from the brachial region. The blood samples were centrifuged (5,000 x g, 15 min) for plasma separation. 500 mL methanol containing 0.1% formic acid was then added to a 50 mL serum aliquot to precipitate the protein. The methanol precipitation step was performed twice to ensure maximum extraction of TAM16 from the serum. After removing the precipitate by centrifugation, the clear supernatant was evaporated to dryness. The dry samples were then reconstituted with 50 mL methanol and subjected to LC-MS analysis on a micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics hyphenated with an lent series HPLC with temperature controlled autosampler and photodiode array detector. 2.1 X 100 mm Atlantis T3, 5mm C18 HPLC column (Waters) was used in the analysis at a flow rate of 0.5 ml.min -1. The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid as Solvent line A and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent line B. The gradient conditions were main-tained as follows: 90% A, 10% B to 100% B 8 min; 100% B held for 4 min; 100% B back to 90% A, 10% B in 2 min; 90% A, 10% B held for 3 min. The injection volume of the analyte was 10 mL and MS was operated in the positive mode with electrospray ionization at source. Mass spectra were monitored in the range of (m/z) 50 to (m/z) 1000. Efcacy studies in mice BALB/c acute TB infection mouse modelFor this study, mice (Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA) were maintained under specic pathogen-free conditions and fed water and chow ad libitum. For drug preparation, isoniazid (INH, Sigma) was dissolved in sterile distilled water. A dosing solution of 1 mg/ml was prepared weekly and kept at 4 /C14C. TAM16 was suspended in vehicle of canola oil and 10% DMSO and stored at 4/C14C for up to 1 week. A total of 70 female BALB/c mice (7 -8 weeks -old) were aerosol -infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv using the Inhalation Exposure System (Glas -Col Inc., Terre Haute, IN) calibrated to deliver /C24104(high -inoculum) colony -forming units (CFU) per mouse lung. After aerosol infection, mice were blindly randomized into treatment groups: no drug (negative control) and drug treated (pos-itive control), and were treated daily via oral gavage administered in 0.2 mL 5 days per week for 2 weeks at 200 mg/kg once daily. Fivemice from each group were sacriced on the day after infection, on the day of treatment initiation (Day 0), and on day 14 after treat- ment to determine the numbers of CFU implanted in the lungs, pretreatment baseline CFU counts and the CFU counts after 14 days of treatment, respectively. Animal body weights were recorded at the time of sacrice. The lungs of sacriced mice were homogenizedin 2.5 mL PBS. Lung homogenates were plated on selective 7H11 plates (containing cycloheximide (50 carbenicillin trimethoprim (20 mg/ml)) for CFU enumeration. Statistical analysis was done on CFU data derived from 3 to 5 mice per group. Log -transformed CFU were used to calculate means and standard deviations. Comparisons of data among experimental groups were performed by Student's t test. Group means were compared by one -way analysis of vari- ance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's post -test (Day 0 or untreated controls versus treatment groups) or Bonferroni comparison (all treatment groups), using GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statisticallysignicant.Continued REAGENT or infection mouse model In this study, 6- to 8-week-old female specic-pathogen-free immunocompetent BALB/c mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were infected via a low-dose aerosol exposure to M. tuberculosis Erdman in a Middlebrook aerosol generation device (Glas-Col Inc., Terre Haute, IN). One day post aerosol infection, three mice were sacriced to verify the uptake of an average of about 100 CFU of bacteriaper mouse. Following infection, the mice were randomly divided into treatment groups. Negative control mice remained untreated. Positive control mice received INH (at 25 mg/kg of body weight). Each group consisted of ve mice at each time point. Treatment was started day 27 post aerosol and continued for 4 weeks. Five infected mice were killed at the start of treatment as pretreatment con-trols. Drugs were administered in canola oil, 5 days per week by oral gavage. To determine drug efcacies, mice from each treatmentgroup were sacriced after 4 weeks of treatment. The mice were humanely euthanized by CO 2inhalation. The spleens and left lung lobes were aseptically removed and disrupted in a tissue homogenizer. The number of viable organisms was determined by serial dilution of homogenates on nutrient Middlebrook 7H11 The plates were incubatedat 37 /C14C in ambient air for 4 weeks prior to determine the total number of culturable mycobacteria per organ. For statistical analysis, the number of culturable mycobacteria were converted to logarithms, which were then evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by a multiple-comparison analysis of variance by a one-way Tukey test (SigmaPlot software program). Differences wereconsidered signicant at the 95% level of condence. Combination studies in mouse model of chronic TB Six- to 8-week-old female specic-pathogen-free immunocompetent BALB/c (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were infected via aerosol exposure to M. tuberculosis Erdman ( /C2450-100 bacilli/mouse) the Glas-Col Inhalation Exposure System. One day post aerosol infection, ve mice were sacriced to determine bacterial uptake. Following infection, the mice were randomly divided into treatment groups of six mice each. Negative control mice remained untreated. At Day 28 post-infection 6 mice were sacriced to determine bacterial load in the lungs at the start of therapy. Therapy administered via oral gavage, was started day28 post-aerosol infection and continued for 4 and 8 weeks. Drugs were administered by gavage daily, for 5 days a week (Mon- Fri), in a volume of 200 ml/animal/drug. For animals receiving two drugs, RIF was dosed rst and then at least 1 hr later, the second drug was administered. To determine drug efcacies, six mice from each group (untreated, vehicle, TAM16, RIF, INH and combina-tion treatment mice) were sacriced after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment following a three day drug washout period after the last day of dosing. For the companion plasma PK studies (plasma collected at both C max/Cmin), test bleeds were performed via the submandib- ular route using a GoldenRod lancet during last week of treatment (week 8) from n = 3 mice from TAM16 only and TAM16+RIF treat-ment groups. For statistical analysis, the viable CFU counts were converted to logarithms, which were then evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by a pairwise multiple comparison using the Dunnett's test (SigmaPlot software program). Differences were consid- ered signicant at the 95% level of condence. Cell lines and bacterial strains Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF) cells were purchased from ATCC (catalog were cultured in were differentiated with PMA (100 nM) for 3 days prior to infection studies. For assaying hERG activity, an inducible hERG T-REx TM-CHO by AbbVie ThermoFisher (catalog number K1237). Cell lines obtained from ATCC were tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR Mycoplasma test kit (MD Bioproducts). Purchased celllines were not further authenticated. BL21(DE3)pLysS competent E. coli cells were from Novagen (catalog number 70236-3). M. tuberculosis mc 27000 (Sambandamur- thy et al., 2006 ) was obtained from in-house frozen stock ( /C080/C14C) at Texas A&M University. To obtain starter culture, a 1 mL aliquot of frozen cells was thawed and cultured in 7H9 media supplemented with OADC to an OD 600of 1-1.5. Clinical M. tuberculosis isolates were selected from the culture collections at the Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Stellenbosch University, South Africa, and at the Mycobacteriology Labo- ratory of the Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Switzerland (for a list of strains and mutations see Table S5 ). The identity of the isolates was determined by IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism ( van Embden et al., 1993 ) and their phylogenetic lineages were assigned by spoligotyping ( Kamerbeek et Streicher et al., 2007 Whole genome sequencing showed that all of the drug-susceptible isolates lacked high condence resistant markers which suggests susceptibility againstthe conventional rst- and second- line drugs. METHOD DETAILSCloning and overexpression of MtbPks13 TE domain constructs The TE domain construct corresponding to the predicted TE domain in Mtb pks13 gene (Rv3800c) was made by PCR from the Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA as the template CAC - DNA fragments Cell170, 249-259.e1-e20, July 13, 2017 e6were incorporated into the pMCSG-19b (LIC) to yield TEV protease cleavable N-terminal His 6- tagged TE domain construct ( Donnelly et al., 2006 ). The Pks13-TE-pMCSG-19b vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and the transformed cells were grown at 37/C14C in LB media containing carbenicillin (100 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34mg/ml) to an OD 600of 0.6. Expression of TE construct was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, and cells were harvested after 16 hr of growth at 20/C14C. The D1607N and D1644G mutants of Pks13 TE domain constructed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The mutations were conrmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant plasmids were transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and mutant proteins were expressed by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG at 20/C14C for 18 hr. Purication of Pks13 TE domain The harvested cells were resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and lysed by French press. The resulting cell extract was claried by centrifugation (15,000 x g) for 1 hr at 4/C14C. The cleared supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-afnity column and the His-tagged TE domain constructs were eluted with a linear gradient of 10-250 mM imidazole in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5 M NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and the His-tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with TEV protease in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM DTT). TheTEV cleaved passed through Ni-column to remove any uncleaved His-tagged protein using 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM BME. His-tag cleaved protein eluted in the flow-through and was concentrated for loading onto a Superdex- 200 gel ltration column (GE Healthcare). The 283 residue long TE domain starting from residue 1451 in full length Pks13 (referred toas Pks13-TE in this paper) eluted under a single peak as a monomer ( /C2432 kDa) from the gel ltration column and was > 95% pure as observed by SDS-PAGE. The puried protein was concentrated to 20-25 mg/ml, flash-frozen and stored at /C080 /C14C. The TE domain mutants were puried using the same protocol as for the wild-type Pks13-TE domain constructs. Both the mutants and the wt Pks13-TE domain protein constructs have the amino acids SNA from the TEV cleavage site appended to the N terminus. Crystallization and soaking with ligands Initial screening for crystallization conditions for the Pks13-TE domain was done using sitting drop method using 1 mL of puried pro- tein (15-20 mg/ml) and 1 mL of crystallization buffer from the well solution. The Pks13-TE crystals were obtained in crystallization buffer containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 2.0-1.8 M ammonium sulfate as precipitant. Crystals were further optimized by using polypropylene glycol P-400 as an additive at 2%-5% (v/v) in the original condition. To obtain Pks13-TE-inhibitor complex crystals,soaking of the inhibitors was done by transferring apo-Pks13-TE crystals into a drop consisting of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 2-2.2 M ammonium sulfate with 1-2.5 mM inhibitor added from a DMSO stock keeping the nal DMSO concentration at < 5%, and incubated at 18 /C14C for 4-48 hr. Crystals of the Pks13-TE:D1607N mutant were obtained by sitting drop method at 18/C14C. The crystallization drops contained an equal volume of the protein solution (15-20 mg/ml) and mother liquor (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 2%-4% (v/v) PEG 400, and1.8-2 M ammonium sulfate), and the diffraction quality crystals were obtained within 2 weeks. Data collection and processing For diffraction data collection the crystals were cryo-protected using Fomblin (Sigma) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. High reso- lution data was collected at wavelengths of 0.98 - 1.03 A on the beamlines 19-ID and 23-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of the Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL, USA. All the datasets were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Mi- nor, 1997 ). Analysis of the integrated and scaled data by Xprep ( Sheldrick, 2008 ) indicated that Pks13-TE crystallized 1212 space group. Solvent content analysis in CCP4 suite indicated the presence of two molecules (V M2.16, V S43.2%) in the asymmetric unit (Matthews, 1968 ). Determination of Pks13-TE structures and model renement The structure of the Pks13-TE domain was solved by molecular replacement method (MR) using E. coli EntF (PDB: 3tej) structure, as search model. A single MR solution was obtained using Phenix AutoMR ( Adams et al., 2010 ) which was input into the AutoBuild wizard to generate the initial model for apo-Pks13-TE. The initial model was improved by further manual rebuilding in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 ). The nal model was obtained after iterative cycles of model building and Phenix renement with simulated annealing yielding a 1.72 A resolution apo-Pks13-TE model with R crystof 16.9% and an R freeof S2 ). The nal rened apo-model has two chains, designated A and B, a fragment of additive PPG P400 and 471 water mol- ecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structures Pks13-TE-inhibitor complex structures, as well as the D1607N mutant structures were rened with simulated annealing (start temperature 5000 K, Phenix). Inspection of electron density maps showed clear jFo-Fcj positive difference density for the ligands which were t into the density using Ligandt routine in Phenix ( Terwilliger et al., 2006 ). The ligand model and geometry restraint les were created in ELBOW BUILDER of the Phenix suite ( Moriarty et al., 2009 ). Iterative cycles of model building and NCS-restrained maximum likelihood renement with simulated annealing yielded high quality models forPks13-TE-inhibitor complexes ( Tables S2 and S3). In all of the structures > 98% of residues are placed in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot (MolProbity, Chen et al., 2010 ). Figures of the structures were made with UCSF Chimera package ( Pettersen e7 PyMOL Molecular Graphics System version 1.4.1 (Schrodinger, LLC). Structural analysis of Apo Pks13-TE for the identication of tunnels and channels was done using CAVER 3.0 PyMol plugin ( Chovancova et al., surface potentials were calculated using APBS ( Baker et al., 2001 ) and displayed using the APBS plugin for PyMOL. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the reported crystal structures ( Tables S2 and S3) have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession (4-MUH, Sigma) as a fluorogenic substrate in a 96-well plate format ( Richardson and Smith, 2007 ). To make initial velocity measurements, Pks13-TE (1 mM) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7 buffer was incubated with different concentrations of 4-MUH (2-150 mM in DMSO) in a 100 mL reaction volume, and the fluorescence of the hydrolyzed product 4-methylumbelliferone was read (excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm) (PolarStar Omega plate reader BMG Labtech) at 5-10 min intervals over 80-120 min. The reaction rate was observed to be linear in the measured range. 4-MUH in buffer alone was included as a control to quantify its background hydrolysis. Data points were plotted as an average oftriplicates and each experiment was repeated twice independently. The initial velocity data was curve t to Michaelis-Menten equa- tion by nonlinear regression using Prism software (GraphPad) to determine the kinetic parameters K mandVmax. The assay and data analysis for Pks13-TE mutants was done the same way as that for the wild-type protein with the 4-MUH concentration varying from 2to 300 mM. IC 50determination To determine the potency of TAM1 and its analogs against wt Pks13-TE, the compounds were tested at concentrations ranging from0.012 to 20 mM in a 96-well plate format. The reaction mix contained 0.1 mM Pks13-TE in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7 buffer with 1 mL of each dilution of the compound or DMSO in a total volume of 99 mL. The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 mL of 2 mM 4-MUH in DMSO (20mM nal concentration) to the reaction mix. Initial velocity data was obtained by monitoring increase in the fluorescence due to hydrolysis of the substrate using PolarStar Omega plate reader at 10 min intervals over 110 min. The data points were collected in triplicate and the averaged value was used to generate concentration-response plots for TAM1 and its analogs. The IC 50value for each compound was obtained by nonlinear regression curve tting of a four-parameter variable slope equation to the dose-responsedata using Prism software. The IC 50values of TAM1 for Pks13-TE mutants were determined in the same way as that for wt Pks13-TE, using inhibitor concentration range of 0.04 to 40 mM. Whole cell activity and cytotoxicity testing Whole cell testing for determining MIC was done using Alamar blue assay in 96-well plates ( Franzblau et al., cells were grown to an OD 600of 1-1.5. The cells were then diluted into media with 600of 0.01 and dispensed into testing plates at 196 mL per well. Then the compounds were added (4 mL) as a 2-fold serial dilution in DMSO (2% DMSO nal in each well). The test plates also had a DMSO only control and a Rifampicin control. The plates were incubated with shaking at 37/C14C for 6 days and then stained with resazurin (Sigma) for an additional 2 days at 37/C14C. After staining the fluorescence of reduced nm, 590 nm) using PolarStar Omega plate reader. The fluorescence data were plotted as percent growth inhibition against the compound concentration and curve tting was done by nonlinear regression using Prism software. Minimum inhibitory concen- tration (MIC) values, dened as the concentration giving 50% growth inhibition, were determined from the tted curves. Compounds were tested for toxicity by the Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF) cytotoxicity assay. The 10% fetal setting the cytotoxicity assay, compound stocks were serially diluted starting from the highest concentration of 100 mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 10% DMSO. On the day of assay, HDF cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 64,000cells/ml in the media. Cells were plated, overlaid with the compound serial dilutions and incubated at 37 /C14C. After 48 hr, resazurin dye was added and the assay plates were cultured for another 24 hr. The next day the absorbance of the resazurin was measured on a microplate reader (BMG Labtech) cell death. monocytes were differentiated with PMA (100nM) for 3 days prior to infection and seeded at 40k cells/well in a 96-well dishcoated reporter mCherry were incubated with the THP-1 for 2 hr, washed gently, and incubated with gentamycin (10 mg/mL) for 2 hr to kill extracellular Mtb mc27000 . Cells were then washed and incubated with drug (1% DMSO nal). Fluorescence was measured on days 0 and 5 post infection using a GE IN Cell Analyzer2000 at 20x magnication and analyzed using the complementary GE software suite. Fold change in fluorescence was normalized torifabutin (10 mM) as the positive control. All experiments were performed with technical triplicates and were repeated six times independently. Cell170, 249-259.e1-e20, July 13, 2017 e8Isolation of resistant mutants of TAM16 resistant mutants, /C24109Mtb mc27000 cells were plated onto replicate 7H10 plates containing either 0.9mM (10x MIC) or 1.8 mM (20x MIC) of TAM16. In addition, serial dilutions of Mtb mc27000 culture were plated out on 7H10 plates containing no TAM16. Plates were screened for the appearance of resistant mutants after 3-4 weeks of incubation at 37/C14C, and the frequencies of resistance were determined by dividing the CFUs on TAM16 containing plates by the CFUs on TAM16-free plates. Genomic DNA from the mutants was extracted by CTAB-lysozyme method as described previously ( Larsen et al., 2007 ) and sub- jected ( Ioerger et al., 2013 ). In vitro activity of compounds against clinical M. tuberculosis isolates The Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube drug susceptibility testing system (MGIT 960 DST) was used to determine the MICs of TAM16 against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant clinical M. tuberculosis isolates with diverse genetic background. MGIT DST at University of Zurich Drug susceptibility was tested using the proportion method and MGIT equipped with EpiCenter TB eXiST as described previously (Springer et al., 2009 ). In brief, bacterial suspensions were prepared from MGIT subcultures. TAM16 was dissolved in DMSO and two-fold dilution series in DMSO were prepared. 0.08 mL of each drug dilution was inoculated into the MGIT vial (nal DMSO con- centration 1%) together with 0.5 mL of the bacterial suspension. For preparation of the drug-free growth control tube, the bacterial suspension was diluted 1:100 with sterile saline solution, and then 0.5 mL was inoculated into the MGIT vial together with 0.08 mLDMSO. Results were interpreted as follows: at the time the growth unit (GU) value for the drug-free control was > 400, the strain wascategorized as susceptible when the GU of the drug-containing tube was < 100 and as resistant, if the GU was R100. The MIC of each strain was dened at the lowest drug concentration that was categorized as sensitive per the denition above. The epidemio- logical cut-off (ECOFF) value is the MIC value identifying the upper limit for the wild-type type-population.MGIT DST at Stellenbosch University Bacterial suspensions were prepared from frozen stock ( /C080 /C14C) in MGIT 960 medium. These cultures were then sub-cultured and grown at 37/C14C for 2 additional days after the MGIT tube became positive before they were used as inocula ( /C2413105CFU/ml). The compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to obtain stock solutions of 1680 mM. Stock solutions were further diluted (1:20) to a concentration of 84 mM in 50% DMSO followed by serial 2-fold dilutions ranging from 84 mM to 1.3 mM. From each dilution, 0.1 mL was transferred into MGIT tubes containing 7.0 mL modied Middlebrook 7H9 broth base supplemented with 0.8 mLOADC. The tubes were then inoculated with 0.5 mL of the test organisms for nal 2-fold drug concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 0.015 mM. A drug-free 1:100 diluted inoculum was included per drug set as control to indicate 1% growth according to the proportion method. Results were based on a threshold growth unit (GU) reading of 400 by the drug-free control at 37 /C14C in MGIT 960. Drug-con- taining tubes with GU values of R100 at the time when the drug-free control reach a value of 400 were considered resistant and those with values < 100 were recorded as susceptible. The MIC was dened as the lowest drug concentration that inhibits growth of more than 99% of the bacterial inoculum. In vitro synergy evaluation TAM16 was evaluated in two-drug combination studies for interactions with INH, RIF and EMB in vitro against Mtb mc27000 by com- bination index (CI) method ( Chou, 2006 ). Briefly, TAM16 was combined at a constant ratio of 1:3; 1:0.5 and 1:30 with INH, RIF and EMB, respectively, based on the ratio of the MICs of the individual drugs to TAM16 to obtain equipotency combination ratios, and a 2- fold dilution series from the mixtures was prepared in DMSO. The dilution series of each drug combination as well as the serial di- lutions of individual drugs in the combination were then tested in the same 96-well assay plate to obtain dose response data. Frac-tional inhibition was calculated by dividing the fluorescence data from treatments by the fluorescence from the DMSO only controlwells. The CI and dose-reduction index (DRI) were calculated from the dose response data using CompuSyn software ( http://www. combosyn.com ) for determining the mode of interaction with CI < 1, CI = 1 and CI > 1 indicating synergistic, additive, and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Kinetic solubility determination The procedure for determining kinetic solubility of Pks13-TE inhibitors was derived and modied from methods described previously(Alelyunas et al., 2009 ). A 10 mM stock solution of TAM16 was prepared in 100% DMSO. 5 mL of the stock solution was added to 495mL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) taken in the wells of a 2 mL volume deep 96-well polypropylene plate (USA Scientic) to get a nal concentration of TAM16 of 100 mM and containing 1% nal DMSO concentration. A small stir bar was placed in the well and the plate was left on a stir plate with constant stirring for 24 hr at 25 /C14C. At the end of the 24 hr the plate was centrifuged at 1,000 x gto precipitate any un-dissolved material. The supernatant solution was diluted 10-fold in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and an aliquot was analyzed on the LC-MS as described under PK studies. TAM16 dissolved in methanol at 10 mM concen- tration was injected into the LC-MS and used as a single point calibration to estimate the concentration of TAM16 in the aqueoussolution. e9 Cell170, 249-259.e1-e20, July 13, 2017Plasma protein binding Protein binding of TAM16 in mice plasma was determined using a Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis (RED) kit (ThermoFisher Scientic) with LC-MS analysis. TAM16 (10 mg/mL) and mice plasma with 1% DMSO were added to one side of the single-use RED plate dialysis chamber having an 8 kD MW cutoff membrane. PBS was added to the other side of the membrane. The plate was sealed and left on ashaker at 250 rpm in a 37 /C14C incubator. After 5 hr of dialysis a 50 mL aliquot was collected from both sides of the membrane. 50 mL PBS was added to the plasma sample and 50 mL of plasma was added to the PBS sample in order to minimize matrix effect. Then 200 mL acetonitrile containing 1 mg/ml warfarin (internal standard) was added to precipitate the protein. The sample was mixed well and centrifuged. The clear supernatant was separated from the precipitate and 200 mL water containing 0.1% formic acid was added to the supernatant. 10 mL of the sample was used for LC-MS analysis as described above. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Calculation of plasma protein of TAM16 and Warfarin (Internal Standard) determined on the plasma side of the membrane. Bu= Ratio of mass intensities of TAM16 and Warfarin (Internal Standard) determined on the buffer (PBS) side of the membrane. Microsomal stability assay 20 mg/mL stock solution of mouse microsome S9 fractions (Life Technologies) were diluted to a 0.55 mg/mL working stock in 50 mMpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 0.5 mM nal concentration of the compound was used. Verapamil was used as a control drug molecule to validate the assay. The reaction was started by adding 1 mM (nal concentration) of freshly prepared NADPH solution. Two negative controls were used; microsomes inactivated by heating at 55 /C14C for 10 min in a water bath, and phosphate buffer in the place of NADPH. Aliquots were removed from this reaction mix at time intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. The aliquots were added to vials containing 37% acetonitrile, water and an internal standard (0.1 mg/mL warfarin). The mixture was centrifuged to re- move precipitated protein and the clear supernatant solution was evaporated to dryness. The dry sample vials were reconstitutedwith 50 mL methanol and used for LC-MS analysis as described in PK studies section. Calculation of Intrinsic Clearance Ratio of the mass intensities of TAM16 and the internal standard (Warfarin) were then plotted to t an exponential decay curve and therate constant (k) was derived from the curve. Intrinsic clearance was then calculated using the following equation: CLi/C0 ml:min /C01:g/C01liver/C1 =k3V3Microsomal protein incubation volume.mg-1protein added = 1 30.5/C01= 2 ml.mg-1protein Microsomal protein yield is a standard used for all species = 52.5 mg protein.g-1liver. Physicochemical properties calculations Physicochemical and pKa) were calculated using ChemAxon chemistry engine as implemented on the Collaborative Drug Discovery web portal ( www.collaborativedrug.com ) and are summarized in Table 3 . (GSH) and methoxylamine (MA) trapping Metabolic stability of was assessed following incubations with human liver microsomes (HLMs) (20 mg/mL, supplied by Xen- otech as a pooled batch of 50 donors). The incubations were performed in a medium containing 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) withTAM16 at a nal concentration of 10 mM in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL microsomal protein, 5 mM GSH/MA and a NADPH regenerating system (including 2.3 mM Glucose-6-Phosphate, 1.8 mM U/mL glucose 6-phosphate 2% bicarbonate). included and 17 a-ethynylestradiol (EE) for GSH trapping and Amodiaquine for MA trapping at a nal concentration of 5 mM. A 'no compound control' replacing TAM16/positive controls with DMSO was also included. Samples prepared in 96-plates were incubated on a shaking water bath/incubator at 37 /C14C for 60-90 min and after incuba- tion, reactions were stopped by adding acetonitrile (analytical grade). The incubation mixtures were then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for Cell170, 249-259.e1-e20, July 13, 2017 e1010 min at 4/C14C. A 150 mL aliquot of supernatant was added to 150 mL water before analysis by UPLC-MS/MS (Waters Acquity UPLC with DAD and Waters Xevo Q-TOF). was performed on a Waters BEH C18 (50 32.1mm 1.7 mm) column at a flow of 0.5 mL/min with an injection volume of 5 mL. Detection of metabolites was performed by analysis with Metabolynx XS software (Wa- ters) and by manual data searching. Analysis of positive controls was used to ensure that the assay was functional. Metabolic stabilityof TAM16 in mouse plasma was assessed in the same manner as that described for HLMs. Assessment of glucuronide metabolites Incubations were performed with addition of 5 mL TAM16 or positive control propranolol (from a stock solution of 0.5 M) to 450 mLo f HLMs (1.11 mg/mL) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 45 mL of cofactor uridine di-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) or UDPGA/NADPH added to wells of a 96 deep-well (2 mL) incubation plate. The samples were incubated at 37 /C14C and 50 mL aliquots from incubations were removed at 0, 60 and 120 min after addition of the test compounds for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS. Chroma-tography was performed on a Waters BEH C18 (50 32.1mm 1.7 mm) column heated at 40 /C14C with a flow of 0.5 mL/min and an injection volume of 2 mL. Processing of samples was performed either by MetaboLynx software (Waters), setting each compound at t = 0 min to Control, or by manual processing of the data. Initially, the positive control (propranolol) was analyzed to ensure that glucuronideconjugates CYP2C19, CYP3A4 was enzymes and known fluorescent probe substrates. Human EasyCYP bactosomes (1 nmol/mL, from E.coli were supplied by Cypex. Incubation mix (220 mL) containing expressed CYP enzyme and probe substrate in 0.05M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to each well of 96-well plate and place onto a ther- momixer kept at 37 /C14C. To this incubation plate, 5 mL of the serial dilution of the compounds was added, mixed well and the plate was incubated for at least 5 min at 37/C14C. Miconazole was included as the positive control. After incubation, 25 mL of NADPH regenerating system solution was added to each well of the incubation plate and measurement of fluorescent product was started immediately using the BMG Pherastar spectrophotometer with appropriate parameters ( Table S6 ). well was measured for production of fluo- rescent metabolite every min for 10 min. The data analysis was done using Xcel Fit to calculate the rate of fluorescence units per minas a % of the average rate of the solvent control wells. The % of solvent control values were then plotted against the concentration range and IC 50value were determined by nonlinear regression tting of the following 4 parameter logistic equation, y=Range/C14/C2 1+\u00f0x=IC50\u00des/C3 +Background hERG activity assessment The potential of TAM16 to inhibit the human cardiac hERG/IKr potassium channel functional activity was measured in an inducible hERG T-RExTM-CHO Cell line (ThermoFisher) using thallium influx as a surrogate indicator of potassium ion channel activity (Schmalhofer et al., 2010 ) at AbbVie, USA. Thallium enhances the fluorescent signal of BTC-AM dye (ThermoFisher). Cells were loaded with the dye for 90 min in a low potassium buffer, dye removed and compound added to the cells in a high potassium buffer in a 6 pt. dose response. After 30 min incubation with compound, channel activity was recorded upon addition of thallium buffer using a Tetra plate reader. The slope of the kinetic read was used to calculate channel activity.Broad panel activity screening Safety proling of TAM16 for assessment of off-target interactions was performed at AbbVie, USA. The compound was evaluated across a panel of 21 liability targets (39 functional assays) which included cell based GPCRs and ion channels in both agonistand antagonist readout, and biochemical functional assays for nuclear hormone receptors and phosphodiesterases. The IC 50results were greater than 10 mM for all assays. Ames mutagenicity assayThe two-strain Ames assay was a six-well modication of the standard Ames Petri plate incorporation test, reducing the volumes ofreagents for the smaller size well. Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100 were exposed up to 1000 mg/well under conditions with and without Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Chemical synthesis Materials and general methods TAM1 and its structural analogs TAM2-6 were purchased from a commercial vendor (ChemBridge Corporation, San Diego, CA). Forthe synthesis of analogs TAM7-24, all reagents and solvents suppliers Merck silica gel 60-F-254plates and spots were visualized with UV light. Flash column chromatography was In every case trimethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, dunits) relative to TMS solvent signal, and coupling constant ( J) values are reported in Hertz (Hz). Liquid chromatograph mass spectra (LCMS) were obtained using SHIMADZU2010 EV using methanol solvent. Analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Waters Separation Module 2695system equipped with an auto sampler and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Purity of the nal compounds was determined using chromatographic systems; column, Princeton SPHER- 100, C18 (particle size = 5 mm, pore size = 10 nm, dimensions = 50 mm x 4.6 mm); mobile phase A, water; mobile phase B, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and 0.1% ammonium formate. Using a flow rateof 1.0 mL/min, gradient elution was performed from 20% B to 80% B over 10 min. In every case, 10 mL of a 1 mM solution was injected.

DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the reported crystal structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession codes S1. Structural Features of the Pks13-TE Crystal Structure, Related to Figure 1 (A) Surface representation of the Pks13-TE structure colored by electrostatic potential (contoured at \u00b15 kT/e; red for negative and blue for positive) to illustrate the substrate binding groove ( /C2430 A, double-headed yellow arrow) on the lid domain. The zoomed view shows the bound PPG fragment (cyan) in the catalytic pocked formed by residues Ser1533, His1699 and Asp1560 along with the residues of the oxyanion-hole (Leu1534 and Ala1477) rendered as sticks; catalytic wat er shown as red sphere. The 2Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 1.2 sis shown for the bound PPG fragment. Hydrogen bond interactions are shown as black dashed lines.(B) Predicted tunnels in Pks13-TE structure by CAVER analysis ( Chovancova et al., 2012 ). The three potential tunnels are shown in pink, blue and green surface rendering. The largest of the tunnels (pink) opens onto the substrate binding surface groove and contained the bound PPG fragment.(C) Docking of mycolic acid on Pks13-TE lid domain. A molecule of mycolic acid (shown as yellow sticks) was docked using Molsoft ICM-Pro software todetermine a possible binding mode in the substrate binding groove. The zoomed view of the docking indicates that the surface groove can accommodate ac yl chains of the mycolic acid precursor attached to the C-terminal ACP domain and position the thioester for cleavage near the catalytic Ser1533 residue .Figure S2. Structural Changes in TAM1-Bound and D1607N-Mutant Pks13-TE Crystal Structures, Related to Figure 1 (A) Superimposition of Pks13-TE-TAM1 complex structure (purple) with Apo-Pks13-TE structure (yellow) shows that Phe1670 side chain (shown as stic k) flips by /C2480/C14upon TAM1 binding. TAM1 interacting residues are shown in line representation in purple color, and the corresponding residues from Apo structure are shown as lines in yellow color. Catalytic residues (Ser1533 and His1699) are shown as ball and sticks. TAM1 is omitted for clarity of presentation.(B) Superimposition of Pks13-TE-TAM1 complex structure (purple, TAM1 as yellow sticks) with the structure of D1607N mutant (pink) shows the conform ational change in Arg1641 of the mutant due to disruption of ion pair interaction with Asp1607. In the wt Pks13-TE structure, Asp1607 carboxylate forms an ion p air interaction with the guanidinium of Arg1641 which helps stabilize the C-terminal end of helix a7. This allows Asp1644 to form hydrogen bond interaction (shown as dashed black line) with TAM1. The mutation D1607N breaks the ion pair interaction mediated anchoring of helix a7 that causes Asp1644 to move away by /C243A (double-headed black arrow), consequently disrupting its interaction with TAM1.Figure S3. Metabolic Stability of TAM1 Analogs, Related to Table 3 (A) Metabolic stability studies of TAM12 in mouse liver microsomes showed that TAM12 was hydroxylated at P1 phenyl.

The gray mesh represents the 2 mF o-DFcmaximum-likelihood omit map, contoured at 1.2 s. Hydrogen bonds are shown as black dashed lines.(C) Glucuronidation of TAM16 was assessed in mouse liver microsomes with UDPGA (5 mM for 60 min). At 0, 30 and 60 min, 100 mL aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and placed in 100 mL of acetonitrile to terminate the reaction. Analysis by mass spectrometry for metabolite identication showed little metabolism of the parent compound (TAM16), the conjugate was barely detectable after 60 min incubation (peak A).(D and E) Metabolic stability analysis of TAM16 incubated with glutathione and methoxylamine (50 mM for 180 min) in the presence of mouse plasma and HLMs for possible retro-Mannich metabolites or adducts. The parent compound was seen to decrease slightly over time and two metabolites were detected. Formetabolite B the main ion see was at m/z 379 but a barely detectable ion was seen at m/z 397 indicating the metabolite may be due to oxidation which dehydra tes readily in the MS. No trace of the quinone-methide or potential GSH adducts was seen in any of the samples. a% of total peak area for parent and metabolite peaks of the proposed [M+H]+ions at 60 min time point. b% of total peak area for parent and metabolite peaks of the proposed [M+H]+ions at 180 min time point.Figure S4.
