Chairman's Opening Remarks Chairman Taylor It's always nice to recognize the good things that our members are do ing, so congratulations to all who received some formal recognition today. T hat brings us to the chairman's opening remarks and so let me be brief . General Schindler , General Weigl , Commission members , DMVA staff, good morning and welcome to today's meeting . This morning I was thinking that this is October , the beginning of the federal fiscal year , beginning of the military training year , and I thought this would be a good time to review what we've done as a Commission over these past 12 months . As your chairma n, I'm honored and privileged every Tuesday morning at 0830 to meet on V TC with G eneral Weigl, Mr . Ham p, Greg H oller, Mr. Mutschler , and other selected D MVA staff members . These weekly updates I think are most helpful and informative in terms of updates on the state homes , veterans ' programs , initiatives , and processes that are going on throughout the Commonwealth. M uch of the information that I receive in these briefings is passed along to you and in the V eterans R egistry , so I hope you're reading that because we're doing some good things . Ladies and gentlemen , you know ove r the last 12 months we've done some very good action- oriented things . We've changed the name of the existing Act 66 Committee to the V SO G rant C ommittee , the more properly name d the function of that committee . We've created four new standing committees to specifically address veterans ' concerns . We 've created a committee for women's veterans chaired by Ms. Lisa Kay e. W e've created a veterans ' health committee chaired by Mr . Mark Baylis. W e've established a governance committee chaired by Mr . Michael Brooker , and a transportation 3 committee chaired by Mr . William Hines . Mr. Mark Bayli s was approved by the Governor 's Office as the Pennsylvania State V eterans ' Commission representative to the L ong-term Care C ouncil . So, congratulations on that . We have representation on the G overnor's C hallenge for S uicide P revention and, if you recall , we participated in a suicide awareness event in September . Each new commiss ioner is now provided with a copy of Title 51 that explains our duties and responsibilities to better help you in what you think you should be doing. I wish I had that when I first came on this Commission in 2015. O ur Legislative C ommittee has provided feedback on no less than 12 H ouse and Senate bills that did or could directly affect veterans and our voices were heard . Our Real E state T ax Co mmittee provided a detailed series of recommendations that was approved and forwarded by the SVA to the House and Se nate Veterans Affairs and Emergency P reparedness Committees . There are several bills that have been signed into law by the governor recently that the Commission has been in favor of . I refer you to slide 11 in your read- ahead packet for t oday and it's on t he first page of the P olicy P lanning and L egislative A ffairs slide . I don't want to steal any t hunder , but there's some good some going on there . Going forward, I asked the L egislative C ommittee for the ir recommendations to this Commission for our 2023 goals , and please be prepared to discuss and maybe have a vote on these at the December 2nd Commission meeting . PA VETC onnect continues to receive praise and accolades as the Commonwealth 's premier information and referral network. T here's a slide with details in your read- ahead also. Let's not forget that in February of this year the Pennsylvania D epartment of M ilitary and Veterans Affairs received the prestigious Abraham Lincoln Award of Excellence from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for this initiative , and this was presented during the National Association of S tate Di rectors of Veterans Affairs midwinter conference by the United S tates Se cretary of Veterans Affairs himself , Mr. Dennis . So, kudos to all . What are we doing to assist our veterans ? The number of eligible amputee and paralyzed veterans increases every day . The disabled real estate tax exemption is at a five- year high with over 16,200 veterans enjoying the benefits from this program . There's legislation introduced for a monetary bonus for O peration Iraqi Freedom and Operation E nduring F reedom , OIF and OEF veterans . And today alone on behalf of the Commission , I approved 24 educational opportunities . Today we have a slightly different lineup. I had requested that each of the S tate H ome C ommandants be present to give us a short 5- to-10-minute briefing on the highlights of the homes , to highlight some positive events , what possibly needs improvement , and the major take- away of this is at the end of your briefing I would like each commandant to tell this Commission what you need our help with. W hat can we do for you? So, please think about that . If it's within our authority to do so, we will take it under advisement and we will give you the help that you need . And please don't be shy about this . Ladies and gentlemen , in conclusion let me say I'm excited and proud to be a member of this Commission and I believe that working together we have turned the corner and become a more action and result -oriented group, and I believe that the report in October of 2023 will showcase more , better achievements , all designed to assist our veterans and their families in this Commonwe alth. General Schindler , General Weigl, Mr. Ferraro, I thank you for your great support to each member of this C ommission , and please let me tell you your staff has contributed greatly to this Commission. We could not do it by ourselves. Questions/Discussion None. TAG's Opening Remarks MG Schindler Thanks, everybody. G ood morning, it's good to see everybody. N ick, thanks for your comments . Once again , congratulations to those who were presented with certificates . It's always great to recognize people that are out there doing outstanding work. W e don't do that enough quite frankly. W e don't say thank you enough and we don't recognize great work enough. S o, congratulations , I was very happy to do it in this forum . If you could just go forward a couple slides , there are some of our deployments . There's not a lot of change in the Air National Guard and Army National Gua rd deployments. Y ou know , we still hover around that 800 going in and out the door . Welcoming people back , sending people out . We have a couple deployments , larger ones . As you all know from publicity that we talk about this every quarter and being on the Commission, the Air National Guard deploys folks in smaller numbers , just more frequently and for shorter times . That's continuing. Y ou can see on the slides the Army, a little bit larger numbers : two major headquarters going out the door here virtually 4 at the same time , the 28th Division headquarters . I'll be at their event on Sunday , I believe . Sunday is their departure ceremony . And the 55th Maneuver E nhancement B rigade headquarters will also be going on the door, being mobilized at the same time . So. looking at about over 650 formations and I'm going up to Scranton to see them off on the plane . The Sergeant M ajor and I will be up there in Scranton to see them . I wan t to thank everybody that was here at the last meeting and thank your support and providing the press conference that we did have here and lighting candles for suicide prevention mont h. Quickly following that , we had a g reat conference I was able to attend and speak at with H ealth and A ging and E ducation and so on, where we also were able to highlight suicide prevention month and really get the word out there about the great programs and assets that are available across the Commonwealth . I promised to visit when I was there one of our colleges at Penn State University . I happened to be able to visit their V eteran s Center . It's simply outstanding for veterans that are in the area, veterans that go to school there . Our other veteran centers tremendous . You know , a lot of places you go to visit a college and it's a room . I got a tour of the facilities . They have first -rate facilities for offering services to veterans , bringing in help, whether you need doctors , whether t hey need medical support , whether it's veterans that just need to place to study, veterans that need access to rooms , bringing in potential employers . Just a great suite of facilities available there at Penn State University . People , it's certainly setting the standard for how they're taking care of veterans who decide to return to school , young people that are currently serving doing a great job at Penn State University . Towards the end of the month of September , we did have a great visit with approximatel y 50 to 60 Gold Star family members from Pennsylvania , and there were well over 150 when you combined West Virginia . They had a retreat I was able to go down to with the Sergeant Major and our wives and be able to talk to the Gold Star families and be able to thank West Virginia for partnering with us every year they sponsor this event . They got put on hold, but I know a lot of the Gold Star families in Pennsylvania love to go down there at the same time . So, a great visit with them. I f you follow any of the D MVA social media , Facebook, or my Twitter account or whatever , however you choose to get your information , it's out there . Some of these events we'll publicize , so I urge you to follow those . Just a few things to highlight on the veteran side . The last thing was a great Meeting the Guard event at the capital . We opened that up to government veterans to state employees . I had an opportunity to speak on the Senate floor , on the House floor and to recognize state employees , to recognize National Gua rd servicemembers that have done outstanding work, and to be able to do that in that forum as the only cabinet member aside from the governor to be able to speak on the House and Senate , I was really honored to be able to do that and recognize some outstanding veterans of tomorrow , currently serving members , and some state employees and be able to talk to the Senate and H ouse once again about the great work that is being done by everybody that's in this room as well as our servicemembers . So, a great opport unity to do that . We look forward to continuing that next year . Nick, that's all I have this morning, but thank you all for being here . It's great to see such a great crowd . Thank you to the commandants for showing up today also. I t's great to have you. I look forward to your comments too. Questions/Discussion None. Approval of the September 9, 202 2, Meeting Minutes Motion: Mr. Baylis , Member -at-Large, made a motion to approve the minutes. 5 Second: Mr. McDonald, AMVETS, seconded the motion. Questions/Discussion Chairman Taylor: There is something I would like to bring up and it's actually a correction to the record. L ast month I stated that I did not receive any official correspondence and that was incorrect . On or about the 20th of June, I received a memorandum from the Lehigh Valley M ilitary A ffairs C ouncil . The memo was signed by Mr. Richard Hud zinski , the chairman of the programs committee of that council , and the memorandum asked specifically , \"Does the state veterans grave registration record collection system managed by D MVA, and the counties continue to serve a useful purpose ?\" So, after coordination with DMV A personnel , I responded back in writing to Mr . Hudz inski and the council that \"In short , burial records are received from the counties on a routine basis that are then filed alphabetically by county and retained for a period of one year by DMV A prior to being sent to the Pennsylvania State A rchives . Pennsylvania State A rchives has a par tnership with Ancestry.com to digitize family history records , to include these burial records , and makes them available online . As a result , the D epartment's collection of this information serves the state historical preservation purpose that benefits the families and veterans and future generations .\" I hope that answered the question and I would like to have that entered as a correction for the minutes . Greg, if you could please ensure that that happens . The body agreed; m otion carrie d. M inutes approved. Reading of Official and Other Communications Chairman Taylor None . Deputy Adjutant General -VA Remarks BG (PA) Weigl Good morning, e verybody, great to see you all again . Those that were at the War Council yesterday, as the chairman mentioned , we're go ing to hear from the co mmandan ts this morning as part of my report . Having said that, in your folders is the PIRO report with a few exceptions I want to highlight . I want to remind everybody that on 2 November we will ha ve our final town hall this year . It is highlighting veterans' services and veterans , so I encourage all of you to join us that evening. A lso on 2 N ovember, we will be meeting with the GAC -VS and receiving their report to the G overnor's O ffice down at the governor's mansion, so a lot of work has been done with those committees and I'm excited to get their final year -end report . Additionally , I would like to thank Tim Li ezert for being here today and for his work with us . So, VISN -4 will be mailing out a few hundred thousand letters to veterans across the Commonwealth . Something we don't always have the luxury to do because we don't have their addresses and can't acquire that data, but PennDOT and VISN -4 funded it and sent the mailouts with information from D MVA on PA VETC onnect and other programs and resource information for all of our veterans . I just thank you s ir. At this time , I'm going to turn the mic over to Travis Davis . You've all met Travis , he is our executive director of long- term care, and he and Barbara Raymond our director of nursing, today. DMVA Bureau of Veterans Homes Mr. Davis Good morning, e veryone . I wan t to start off by thanking everyone for allowing our team from the Bureau of Veterans Homes to be here today to meet everyone . I also wan t to thank G en. Schindler and G en. Weigl, Mark, and the rest of the leadership team at D MVA for really giving us the support , the trust , and the tools that we need in order to keep our veterans safe in our homes and also ma ke our workplace a great place for our people to work within the Commonwealth. T hey've been so supportive , so we want to thank them for that . I want t o start off with just a really quick brief on the homes and then we're going to get into why we're here today with our leadership team . So, year -to-date, we have placed 337 veterans in our veterans' homes . I think that's a good number . We certainly want to be above that , but it's strong. I t's much improvement from what we saw during COVID. A s many of you know , we had to stop ad missions like many other nursing homes , so we've created that access for a lot of veterans , a 16% increase . I would still have about another quarter to go so we will 6 surpass last year's admission numbers which were around 340 , so we're on good track there. Our waiting list is at 299 today, last time I spoke to this committee we were around 330 . So, we're making some headway with that. The challenge that we have today is empty beds , and what I mean by that is we're at about 65% full across our six homes . The reason for that is staffing : we don't have enough staff right now to fill all of our ne eds, so that's a challenge. I t's an uphill battle . I think all the departments within the state are fighting this to some degree, within the healthcare workforce, especially long- term care, an even bigger challenge. So , what are we doing about it right now ? We'r e working with downtown and the O ffice of Administration o n these issues. We're also doing job fairs and awareness, so people know that we have these positions . I'm sure some of our comm andan ts have talked to you about maybe some things that you can do to help us on that . COVID : So, unfortunately for our industry this is not over . I mean , we're still battling COVID on the front lines every single day. In our six counties that we have veterans' homes , our county transmission rates remain high, t hat's over 10%, and what we have seen historically through COVID is when those rates go up our numbers go up. O ur resident numbers go up, our staf f numbers go up. S o, right now we are seeing a peak of cases . Luckily, we have the vaccine out there, we have the booster shot that's available and being given out . We have our flu vaccines . Our veterans ar e stable . A lot of our staff members are stable as well . Just minor costs , things like that , but yet for our staff and f or our residents it creates a lot of challenges in our homes . It's the PPE, wearing the N95s for an 8-to-12-hour shift . There's P PE burnout that we're seeing. T here's some isolation for residents , going into zones with PPE and enhancements . Unfortunately, we're still challenged with every single day and our team is doing a great job ens uring the safety of our veterans and our staff . So, while we're here today , and Barb will talk a little bit more about this too , but we have our six locations . There, at these six long- term care facilities , you have two main leadership positions : there are com mandan ts and our director of nursing. L ast year we've had four commandant changes and we've had three director of nursing changes in one movement . That's a significant amount of change and I'm going to let M ark talk a little bit about it too . So, I want to bring up the comm anda nts and our D irector of Nursing, B arb. I'm going to start with one of the biggest changes that we've made, the most significant thing that we've all felt and that was with Barb Raymond stepping down from her post up in Erie . Barb has worked many different roles within our veterans' homes, but as the D irector of Homes , I can say Barb is one of the most hard -working people in the Commonwealth and makes more personal sacrifices for our veterans and our staff . She's a road warrior . She's in our homes on weekly basis and I think all of us including the comm anda nts can say how much we appreciate her support and really her mentorship to our new wa ve of leadership , our nurses , our administrators , and that hands -on training that she's giving them every day. So, I'm going to pass this on to her to let her introduce the team . Ms. Raymond: G ood morning, everyon e. Thank you for allowing us to be here with you all toda y. Last time I was in this room with many of you here I was in a different role , I was in the commandant role. So, just about a year and a half ago , I moved into the D irector of the Veterans Homes. M y perspective on the homes is probably unique . I look at the team and look at everyone from a nurse's aid e to a nurse to a scheduler to the supervisor , and my perspective is quite unique because I've done all those roles , on all three shifts. S o, I truly do know what goes on in our homes . I know what happens. The COVID challenge has been a tremendous burden on our staff, our residents , and family members. F or the most part , our residents , thankfully, are st able with the new vaccine, the bivalent vaccine. W e have that available at all six of our state veterans' homes and we are proceeding to move to utilizing that bivalent vaccin e. I would encourage all of you to get that vaccine if you have not already. That vaccine is recommended for anybody that's already gone through their primary series , so even if you've had that third and fourth shot , the recommendation is that you still get that bivalent vaccine . Flu season is , of course , coming up, so we're focused on protecting our residents and veterans from the flu as well. And of course, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently changed some of their guidance where if your county transmission rate is not in the high category, nursing homes don't have to wear masks . All of our homes are still considered in that high transmission rate , so we are still in masks which is why we 're still concerned with PPE fatigue . Fortunately , our staff is used to that by now , but it is still a challenge to wear masks in the baths , showers , kitchens , over stoves , mopping floors . It's tough. Our folks are really struggling but some of the things we're looking at is where you guys can help us by working with your legislators to make sure we're pushing the envelope on sta ffing. The Adjutant G eneral has really pushed our hiring from his end as well as wages , so that is tremendously helpful . Some things that we can't do that the private sector can are 7 things like bonuses and those sorts of things . But we're very appreciative for his support as well as Gen. Weigel 's support to our mission where we can take care of our residents and veterans . Some of the leaders we unfortunately don't have with us today. Two are out for personal reasons. Cheri Spech t is our commandant up at the Erie facility. I was up there for 12 years. They thankfully have no staff members with COVID, but one resident with COVID in the hospital. They are keeping that resident in the hospital through his isolation. The staff that they have positive are thankful ly all stable and their new leadership team with the coming up there they have a new director of nursing and new deputy commandant they're all stable. Our other commandant that couldn't join us is Peter Ojeda. Peter has been with the Commonwealth for about 20 years , managing the Delaware Valley facility out in Philadelphia. He s tarted at that facility as Director of Nursing and then moved to the commandant role. His director or nursing at that facility will be retiring in a few months, so we are working wit h internal folks to grow an individual to take that role on. As far as his update, he does have six COVID positive residents in his facility. They are stable in the facility , and he has two out at the hospital currently. They both went out for other reasons besides COVID; however, we like to keep track of those individuals as well. S o those are the highlights from the two that aren't here, and I will pass this on to our comman dant at the S outhwest facility who has been with us from many years, R ich A dams . Mr. Adams, Southwest: I am not one of Travis's new people. It will be 42 years next month working in long-term c are, 3 8 of that as a licensed administrator. We're in a little bit of an outbreak with COVID in Pittsburgh. Nothing serious. We're dealing with it and doing just fine. Couple things going on at our place. We recently hooked up with the PGA, the Pro G olf Association wanted to do a program , adaptive golf for vets. They took some of our veterans, gave them chairs, a nd adaptive golf clubs for their hands. This program's gone on now for a couple of years, where they're taking vets to golf courses where wheelchairs are accessible. S o, they can go out and do that , and they spend s ome time indoors, whenever weather doesn't permit. We just had a veteran s' outreach program for the community a t the facility. T he VA was there a nd suppl ied us with some nurses to give vaccines for veterans in the community and any of our employees that wanted to get the booster. So, we thank them for being there. T he Red Cross was there, w e had guide dogs... 30 different organizations there to help veterans. We ha d that outside and it was a very good event . We r ecently went through V A and Department of Health survey s and we're both were very successful. W e're just following up with the VA on some issues that were brought up that were minor and we're moving in the right direction there. You asked me what the servic e organizations can do for us. What this Council can do. I did 25 years in the private industry before the last 15 here with the Commonwealth. What I saw when I came on board, it's amazing. What your service organizations are doing now at the veterans' hom es are above and beyond. The programs they support for activities, the funds they throw our direction , and all the volunteers that come in... t he private world doesn't have that. It's what sets us above and beyond, so keep doing what you're doing. A nd if e verybody in here wants to send me a nurse aide, I'll take it. Mr. Gula, Southeast: I'm the commandant at the Southeast Veterans Center. I've worked in long- term care the last 20 years . I started off as a dietary aid. And I've been at the south center. For about 18 months. Up until then, I worked for the private sector for profit organizations. And when I got to the Veterans Center, I was absolutely amazed about how well veterans were bein g cared for. The number of resources and funding they're getting , the best of the best . It just blows me away . There's so much going on in the homes that it's just incredible. To pick out one thing, we have remodeling being done with new order, we have new technology being installed, our activities program and our volunteer services are active every single day. We receive donations , volunteers coming in to help with activities, so it absolutely is amazing . My biggest problem is staffing. Just to give you an idea, at my home we're currently caring for 190 veterans. We have capacity of 290. What's holding us back is our staffing. We have excellent staffing ratios and car e for the patients we currently have. But , as Travis and Rich said , to get those staffing l evels up to provide the quality of care , we need more staff. S o, any support , we would appreciate that . Mr. Ruggiero, Merli (Scranton): I'm just going to keep repeating what everyone's already said. We need staffing, so let's just get that out of the way. As Barb said, I'm the new/old commandant. Back in 2014, I was commandant at G ino J. Merli. The old commandant had some regulatory issues that they couldn't get out of, so in my mindset, using your terminology, I had a mission and I had to complete that mis sion. From 2014 to 2016 8 with a lot of hard from support staff sitting here today, we accomplished that mission. In 2016, I went back to work as the administrator for the municipality I live in of about 15,000 people. But sitting there all those years later, I knew something was missing. And a ll of a sudden, it was ironic because I received the phone call that the position of c ommandant was open again and was, I interested in coming back? I asked myself why? Everybody was say ing, everything with COVID and all. Why? It's because of what I saw when I was there in 2014. You know, you go to school and r ead about the stuff that transpired in WWI and WWII and what our veterans did for us. And t o have that honor to serve those veterans in my capacity was some thing that I really took to heart. I was honored and humbled to do that . But to hear the stories , sitting and talking to all the veterans in our home. I never imagined. I t was a live story and a live history book. With that, as Rich and Brian said, both co ming from the private sector, the amenities that our veterans have is unbelievable. The s upport is unbelievable. Yes, we ha d COVID. Yes, we're dealing with that aspect , and we have a lot of tired staff and that's why we need staff because of the fatigue th at Travis and Barb spoke about. But uniqueness of working and able to provide service to our veterans and one of these six homes is the most humbling experience you can ever imagine. The amenities for our veterans . They're eating s urf and turf. Having golf tournaments. We were able to r aise $34,000 for our resident welfare fund. So, it's such an honor to be able to do that. Yes, we're dealing w ith COVID and a new roofing project. So, we just ask for your support. I'm sorry for repeating myself , but we have terrific leadership and all I'm asking for is your continued support. Mr. Dunkle , Holidaysburg: I'm the commandant at Holidaysburg Veterans Home in Blair County. I am a combat disabled veteran. I spent 23 years in the United States Army in infantry, intel, and special ops. After that I spent nine years in the CIA , in the special activities division , Africa division , and my last posting was at the National Counterterrorism Center . So, having done all that , what can I do next ? There's nothing better than serving veterans , so I came back to my hometown, and I've been here since 2013. I've been the commandant , starting my second year and it's an honor for me to be there and take care of those veterans . Holidaysburg is quite a challenge. W e have a large campu s with three resident buildings . Currently we have 238 veterans and spouses , and if you don't know, spouses are eligible to live in our vet erans' home , so I think that's a neat thing for families . We have 424 beds total . It's a great place and I invite you to come anytime . We have our Avenue of Flags up. W e put that up when we started the war on the virus and we're not going to take it down until we beat the virus . It's a sign of unity and strength. B asically, at Holidaysburg we're getting a new facility and I'm excited about that because if you didn't know it , Holidaysburg once was a hospital for the mentally challenged. It's very sterile if you will . It's nice , it's clean , but it's not really what you want in a home . So, the new facility is going to be a 200- bed facility , skilled care, and I'm excited about it . We have two main floors for the veterans with semi -private rooms . There are walls instead of curtains in between the two residents , and they will share a bathroom with a shower sink and a toilet. N ow we're in community scenarios , so it's going to be a significant upgrade for us . Over the last month and a half every organization who has oversight of the home visited... Department of Health , Department of Veterans Affairs, Li fe Safety , and D epartment of Human Services . We did well , I think, from my optic . We had tags from all of them , but they were low -level, minor , no harm to any veterans . Turnover is an issue . They're not leaving to go someplace else; they're leaving this community. They're ge tting out of nursing, getting out of being a CNA. S o, we're challenged with that . What I would ask of you is to be an advocate for us . We're open for business . If you know any nurses , any CNAs, send them our direction because that's our purpose , to take care of veterans and that's your purpose . So, help me help you help us. Thank you. Mr. Davis: S o, we heard a lot of similar challenges these homes are facing but there are also a lot of unique challenges these homes are facing every day. Morale, communication, regulatory issues.... Every campus has a very different workforce and very different challenge s every day. Nick, I just want to thank you, I appreciate the time , and quickly if anyone has any questions . Questions/Discussion Chairman Taylor: Travis , thank you very much and to all the commandants in the D epartment , thank you very much . It was very informative , and I would like to see this as an annual update . There's one common thread that I think all the commissioners heard through all this and it 's staffing . So, the question I have is , is it the hiring 9 process , is it the lack of applicants , what spe cifically do you think the problem is for the staff ing issues you're talking about? Mr. Davis , BVH: Since COVID our ent ire industry, and I'm specifically talking about nursing homes, we lost 15% of our workforce . You compare that to acute care, the hospita l space, it's in single digits , assisted living is at 7-8%. S o, we have significantly seen our pool of employees shrink. T hat is facing our whole , entire industry. So, what we're doing right now is we're thinking about the next generation , high school students , college students . Talking about the careers within the Commonwealth. Y ou've heard from a lot of these commandants. They' ve served in dietary, housekeeping, nursing , CNAs.... There is career development in the Commonwealth , and we must do a better job to get that word out . Governor Wolf signed a budget, and t his is the first time we've seen a Medicaid increase in ten years . That's significant for us to keep up with this. W e knew that reimbursement wasn't enough for Medicaid, but also our costs for labor haven't settled yet . They continue to rise . We saw th at with agencies through COVID . My wife is a nurse. I was happy for nurses . They're making a lot of money and they're going to continue to make money because the demand is so high. Mr. F oster, TAL: to all of you are our Advisory Council to positive thing in your facility and are we supporting them and sending you the best people yes . Ms. Raymond, BVH: T hey are. T he advisory members come in and they will give us their feedback. Many of the members will come in like Gen. Weigl and walk the floors . They won't have their name tags on they'll just come in on a random Sunday and the staff at the homes are very well versed in security. T hey may not know that individual , so they will stop that ind ividual and say what are you doing , what's your purpose here . Then they obviously will introduce themselves and staff let them go about their way. S o, the Advisory Council members they give us that feedback of what they see when they walk through our doors , what they see when they walk down the hallways , speak to our veterans and residents as well as our staff . So, it is very helpful to have them there, and the committee meetings . Many of the advisory members used to have me on speed dial and they have the commandants on speed dial . They will call and let us know what they see. S o, yes , the long answer is yes , they are very helpful . Mr. Hudzinski, VVA: W hat pending legislation at the General Assembly has the most impact on you, that could support you in this area of l abor acquisition and retention? Mr. Davis, BVH: I would say one thing that's making headway right now is the temporary nurse program . During COVID we were able to use temp orary nurses and count them as CNAs on staff. And then that waiver expired . Pennsylvania did put through a waiver through the federal government to have that accept ed and it was approved. A gain though, it's only buying us little bit more time . I think that was a big thing for our industry but also, we look at different requirements across different states . Personal care assistants in Florida , that's a tremendous impact they're able to use them in nursing homes and we are not. S o, I think, you know , we've been so focused on our CNA s, LPN s, and RNs , there's a lot of other people within their space that could provide care that haven't been counted in those staffing numbers and that's the thing that I think that we could work with legislation on , is what other positions could a nursing home benefit from. Mr. Hudzinski, VVA: So, is there a bill number that's being worked on currently in the subject area ? Ms. Raymond, BVH: N ot right now , sir. R ight now , it is a waiver that's been approved for us to continue to utilize those individuals . But there is not a bill at this point in time ? Mr. Hudzinski, VVA: W ho should I follow up with because I have some questions about this ? Mr. Davis , BVH: Sure, I wi ll touch base with you, sir. Mr. Johnson, DAV: My home is Del Val Veterans Home. Are we permitted now to go in and have activities? Ms. Raymond, BVH: Yes, absolutely. So, there are rules. If you're a volunteer, you have to follow the staff rules. So, you have to have a booster and that sort of thing. If you're simply a visitor, you just have to screen coming in. 10 Mr. Petrovich, DAV: What kind of a salary gap are you guys fighting against? Mr. Davis, BVH: That's a good question. In terms of salary, we're competitive. What we miss out on are things Barb mentioned... bonuses , incentives .... General Schindler has supported us on double -overtime incentives for some of the really critical, hard- to-fill positions like housekeeping or CNAs. But that's really the gap right now. It's not the salary, it's the things they're getting on top of that. Sometimes it's just appreciation, a lunch, a shirt. There are a lot of things outside of overtime that nurses are cashing in on. They might be getting overtime as well as a $50 gif t card. That stuff is rampant in the industry and our hands are just tied there. Mr. Heister, MOAA: Do you have any success selling the advantages of state employment, which is , besides the intangibles, great benefits plus pensions? Nobody gets a pension these days. Mr. Davis, BVH: T hat's something we're trying to create awareness arou nd. One challenge nursing homes have trying to recruit the younger generation is that they've never been anywhere before. So, if they have, it's not always been a great experience; they were visiting their grandmother or grandfather at the end of life or they've heard negative things about nursing homes. What helps us is when we get people into our homes. Because our care is a lot different than it is in an acute- care hospital . It's a lot more intimate and it 's a relationshi p. W e get to know these veterans , residents , and families on a different degree because they 're with us for a long period of time . That's a huge selling point for us , but without a younger person or student coming in and experiencing that, they don' t understand that benefit . And that 's one thing that we all love about working in long- term care. I teach long -term care to the University of Scranton and that's one thing I'm passionate about: we have to open more people's eyes to what long- term care and post -acute care really is. A lot of people think they understand it, but the only way to do it is to get them in. We are all committed to succession planning, mentorship, and getting some interns into our system. We have one intern now and that's a program that we need to grow . Mr. Ferraro, DMVA: So , to try to close some of the staffing stuff . Rich, to get it where you were talking about most of it's not legislative . It's policy. S o, we're working with the O ffice of A dministration but it's more po licy. The big three , DHS , DOC , and DMVA, that run 24- hour service centers , long- term care, corrections and whatnot , so we're working together as a group to try to come up with policies to deal with this . I'll throw it out, our lead on this really is Patty who is the D eputy for OA, working close with Travis and his team a nd Maureen . So, if you guys want to have a separa te discussion on this , let me know . And if there's some involvement that you want to get into, we can most certainly have Patty come in , sit down with you guys , and Kim Kreiser who's our director of HR , and go over all the different policies and things tha t we're working on and see where you guys could contribute if that's what you want . MG Schindler, TAG: L et me tell you something , although the y're employees of ours , they run more than just long- term care facilities . And I think that I may be speaking to t he choir here , but they are connected to families . Their facilities are like families , caring for families , caring for veterans , going the extra mile when, yes, they could make more in bonuses . It's not just them , it's who they represent . But they're conne cted like the National Guard is . They're connected to the communities that they're in also because they involve them in what they do. A nd I'm speaking to the choir here, to a lot of the organizations that support them , but I just publicly in this forum wanted to say thank you again for what you do and for who you represent . Because it's not just you. It's the DONs, it's the RN s, the LPN s, the activities coordinators , the maintenance personnel , the security personnel , I mean , you name it . There are so many people that you represent and so many people that go above and beyond to serve veterans . So, thank you once again thanks for taking the time . Approval of State Veterans' Programs Reports Motion: Mr. Fine , JWV , made a motion to approve the programs report. Second: Mr. Baylis, Member -at-Large, seconded the motion. The body agreed; m carrie Programs reports approved. VHA , VISN -4 Mr. Liezert 11 As part of the read -ahead, there's a lot of background here and maybe a little bit more background to t he items in the agenda . First with the leadership update , Ken Mortimer, associate director at the H ershel \"Woody\" Williams VA Medical Center continues to be detailed to Altoona as t he director as we recruit for that position . The CFO at Pittsburgh continues to serve as acting associate director during the recruitment process . That recruitment process , I think, is finalized and the new candidate will be announced in the very near future . Second topic , healthcare priorities . As Dr. Elnahol, our new Under secretary for H ealth , gets on board , he's been on board about 90 days , he's done a scan of the healthcare system and he's announced some priorities that have been fully ve tted with network directors and staff and they fall in the following or der, and they're not prioritized they're treat ed all equal , but these may seem familiar as we spend a lot of time talking about some of these things . Priority 1, hire faster and more competitively . Recently , the PACT Act for toxic exposures was announced. P art of that act includes a Title IX that enhances our hiring authorities . We are in the process of implementing those in regulation and implementation . And, as alluded to earlier , really the healthcare workforce in our country is waning. A s our average em ployee is up there , we're seeing a lot of retirements . The pandemic has added to the burden and quite frankly there's quite a bit of burnout in healthcare . So not only as you heard from the state , but from VA and even our community partners , some are struggling with the workforce challenge. O ur solution is to look and be competitive with salaries . Look at the training programs and build those up, and other things . There'll be a hiring stand- down the second wee kend November that you'll probably hear from VA . And that'll be our effort to look at this harder and move forward with that . movement hopefully. S econd priority: connect veterans to the soonest and best care. T hat is otherwise known as \" access ,\" and our m ost recent access report is part of the agenda , I think. Y ou'll also see that access has been redefined during the pandemic . Pre-pandemic, a ccess was defined as a point of care at a point in space and time . Through the pandemic , healthcare or access has be en redefined to \" anytime -any place -anywhere,\" through the emergence of virtual modalities and those type of technologies . So, as we roll out more virtual capabilities , and I have another announcement later in the agenda that is just an example of that , but more of them through providing access to our veterans . I mentioned t he passing of the PACT Act, and the third priority is serving veterans . We're rolling out the implementation of the PACT Act and what you'll see in the near future is a n emphasis on compl eting the healthcare or toxic exposure registry, i f you become interested in that and want to be assessed. T here's also a clinical reminder that will be rolling out to provider s. They' ll be asked to be done on a yearly basis , so as you meet with your primary care providers the re'll be a reminder and some questions around your exposures or experiences . Four th is accelerating our journey to high reliability. W hat is that? It is a cultural movement , it's a commitment to zero harm in hospitals when you have the convergence of equipment , staff, training, meditation s.... T here's a lot of things that come into play, and our commitment is to make sure that all those things come in and do not harm . That is establishing a culture that when somebody sees something wrong, they report it . So, there's psychological safety and no fear in reporting things that they're concerned about . It is a commitment to making sure that even when close calls happen , that we learn as a system . So, as we have on e site in N etwork 4 that experiences something , we share it with all nine sites so that we are aware. A nd that's all part of the cultural movement to make sure that we are providing safe and reliable care. Fifth is to support veterans ' whole health through caregivers and support our survivors . Whole health is a game changer and changes the conversation between a healthcare provider and the veteran into what's most important to them in the health care needs . Too often we find that maybe the healthcare plan i s driven by the provider and there's maybe not as much acceptance from the patient perspective. S o, this is a move to really change the dynamic to being veteran- driven and what matters most in the development of a healthcare plan. And then, finally , veteran suicide remains a top healthcare priority for VA, and we continue to work on that . As national healthcare system , it's very important that we have one standard of care across our s tates. With that, on September 1st , the VA submitted to the F ederal Register an interim final rule that will allow VA to provide access to abortion counseling and in certain cases abortions to private veterans and VA beneficiaries . Female veterans are our largest growing demographic . Currently more than 11% of our total population of patients that we serve are femal e. Many of them are of reproductive age, and this becomes a very serious safety issue . So, the authorit y specifically will allow VA to provide services that are deemed by the provider to be concerning and risky t o their health ( this is the health of the mom), and in cases allow abortion services and counseling to be provided . We're going through the process of doing what we call gap an alysis between what local 12 regulations are available in many parts of our VA. So, the local community provides and is able to provide adequate services , but in some states local laws do not permit the execution of those needed services . So, VA will provide it and stand up those services were needed to make sure that our veterans are ge tting care they need. Quick patient experience update, just want to brag a little bit. W e continue to do very well in meeting our veterans ' expectations through our trust score . We're currently rated as the second highest network among 18 throughout the country and the top compliment themes over the last 90 days were interactions with staff , quality of care , cleanliness of facilities , and satisfaction with special ty care. T here is a briefing in the read - ahead regarding caregiver support update . The important note here is that on S eptember 14 , the VA submitted to the Federal Register an interim rule that will extend the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers' eligibility through September 30, 2025. A great expansion of eligibility. I mentioned how access is changing to \"anytime -anywhere.\" I'm happy to talk about a partnership we have down in Greene County, a new ATLAS site ( Accessing Telehealth through Local Area Stations ). This is a collaboration between the county, the Clarksburg VA, and the Pittsburgh VA that allows telehealth to be provided at that site. That's our second ATLAS site to be brought online. The first one was at the VFW in Linesville. The VA portal is movi ng to VA.gov and details on that are in the read- ahead. I would like to thank you for your great support of VISN -4. Questions/Discussion Mr. Foster, TAL: I would just like to thank you for the VSO utilization survey by the VISN. I haven't distributed it to the organizations yet, but I will. I'm hoping you will allow the committee to send this to our people , get their concerns , and give you a reply to it. But we really appreciate it. The only thing I didn't see in there that I asked for are future . I know most of the facilities have a future . Mr. Liezert, VISN -4: Thank you. We talked about the recapitalization of some of our facilities and that continues to be a high priority with potential budget requests specifically for that. As we go about our facility planning for recapitalization, any impact to your spaces I would expect our directors to be talking to you about. I'll take that back and make sure. Mr. Brady, MCL: There's probably no short answer, but I had an opportunity to attend a meeting last week in Springdale and there was a representative from Volunteer Services at the Pittsburgh center, and he was telling us about the programs and opportunities to participate, except in Butler County. Curious as to why Butler County was carved out? Mr. Liezert, VISN -4: I'll have to go back and check. I suspect the county line is where Pittsburgh VA responsibilities stop and Butler begins, but I'll have to find out about that. Mr. Johnson, DAV: We spoke earlier, and I mentioned the presumptive diseases from Vietnam, Gulf War, 9/11. And on 9/11, it has melanoma as a presumptive. Vietnam veterans are also suffering from that disease. It's been deadly to us. If you can investigate that fo r us, why that's not on there? Thank you. Mr. Liezert, VISN -4: Thank you. I'll take that back and try to find out more. Mr. Petrovich, DAV: I want to thank you and Dave for putting that report together, also concerning the privacy issues in the hospital. B ruce and I must get together, take a look at that, adjust it and let some other folks take a look, but it's a great start. I just wanted to thank you. Committee Reports VSO Grant Committee Mr. Foster Mr. Chairman , thank you . We officially changed our name to the VSO O utreach C ommittee , but I want to take a minute to speak about Act 66 processing this year . I just don't understand , you know , normally we know what our budget allocation is going to be . I mean , it must wait for the budget to be passed in the end of June , but normally we get notified in March. T his year we were notified in August . There isn't an organization here that hasn't had to fund their program because we have yet to receive a payment , and I would be diligent in my duties if I did not bring that up here. I've been told it's because it must go through nine different sections for approval . Well, I would think we could ask for pre -approval because what we did to correct the situation was we moved the application period behind 60 days . So, to me , next year , if our timetable is the same as this year, the 13 organizations can't pay out of their pocke t, or be expected to pay out of pocket, for extended time periods. Enough said. We just need to look at our process. The next thing I wanted to say was just to thank you for allowing me to perform in this position through this year. We have transitioned in the American Legion. We have a great deal of confidence in this man. I will not entertain chairmanship in the next cycle. I make the recommendation to you that Matt should become the chairman of the committee. We need youth in the program and a good voice to carry on. We need to continue that. With that said, I do want to say that you opened my eyes to something. When we were told at the last meeting that we had to have our budget information in, we met that deadline. Then you wrote to me and said, you guys need to do justification. We published this book last year, the justification for urgency in this state. If you can't get our justification from there, we have failed. These are urgent times for veterans. 21,000 less veterans are receiving benefits this year than last year. Questions/Discussion Chairman Taylor : Mr. Foster, thank you very much for your service. Your request to not continue is noted. Matthew, if you are to be appointed, let's see what happens. On the first point, let me get you an answer. Ms. Pettis, DMVA OCC: On the VSO grant issue, this is not intended to be the sole source of funding for your programs . It is meant to augment your programs and typically well -run organizations have reserves for those situations . The Commonwealth will pay, we're good at paying. B ut we're a government organization, and it takes time signing agreements . I tell people it takes a minimum of 60 days . Once we get an agreement signed by TAG, it also must go through the O ffice of A ttorney G eneral and the O ffice of G eneral C ounsel , and by law they have 30 days and the other has 30 days . So, I explained that the expectation should be 60 days once you sign the agreement, and we get TAG to sign the agreement . Additionally , we are waiting until w e have a budget now before we sign these agreements . Because we don't know how much it's going to be that we're going to get in our budget for that line item, so it makes no sense for us to enter into an agreement that we will then immediately have to amen d thereafter . Additionally, we don't make any promises in any of our contracts about when somebody's going to get paid because it's a circuitous route to get things paid in the Commonwealth. I t must go through many different offices . It is just the reality of the situation . So, again the Commonwealth is not the sole or should not be the sole source for your VSO programs . That's not what the statute says , that was never the intent just to be clear. Chairman Taylor: I hope that answers your question. I hope you enjoy retirement, sir. Thank you for your many years of longstanding contributions to, not only The American Legion, but to this Commission. If it is within my purview, I would like to recognize you formally later . Mr. Googins, VVA: Thank you ver y much for explaining the situation. We have a small VSO program at Vietnam Veterans of America, so all we have are donations from veterans or other organizations . We do fund it if we don't get the money on time by taking out a loan, an interest l oan, not an interest free loan , so that we keep the program going. S o, I just want everybody to understand. So, let's get down in the trenches . I'm an Air Force guy. I hope I never get in a trench. I respect those that do . I totally support what Bruce was talking a bout and the way he explained it, so I just wanted to understand the process . I don't want to be rude , but I really don't care about the process . That's your job and you take care of it , and the TAG takes care of that process , and we're behind that . What I worry about and the other service organizations ... I think what Bruce might be asking... l et's see if we can do better in getting the funds rather than take the funds away from veterans . So, I appreciate that , Mr. Chairman . Bruce, I hope I didn't speak for you. Mr. Petrovich, DAV: F irst, I'd like to say to Bruce F oster , Groundhog Day , we've been here before ! And just a question to the C hief C ounsel : Elizabeth , I know we have kicked around over the years a year contract so that you don't run into these things. So, if you have a three- year contract , after year two you're negotiating the next three contracts , and nobody has to take money out of the pocket that has to go to other programs . We 've been supporting to fund this because , God love me , I've got two of them to do, the vans and the service officer s. So, maybe we can start this process, so we eliminate this mess ? Ms. Pettis, DMVA OCC: Absolutely. So, yes , two years ago we put out that idea of doing a contract . If we did a contract , you would get paid monthly . We wouldn't have to do contracts every year , they'd be five years . We 14 could set them up because we know it's getting ready to expire in five years and we could get the agreement done six months in advance so there woul d be no change in service . The problem is that this is set up as a grant program and grant programs take time and there are formal processes . And, yes, we must evaluate based on performance. A nd you must provide justifications every time for every section because we're doing grant programs . So, you're not entitled to the program , I mean to the money. W e must make sure that we are responsibly giving out grant money. Y ou just can't give that to everyone you have to prove that you're complying with the existing agreements . If there are situations where organizations are repeatedly not meeting the requirements of the contract , I must pull everybody aside , saying can we responsibly give money to this organization. I t's a lot involved. I t would be much easier for everyone involved if we went to a contract for services model and we just paid the veteran service organizations for the work that they perform for the Department . Chairman Taylor: I think everybody's in agreement with that. That's something perhaps I woul d respectfully submit that this Commission should pursue in 2023. Sam? Mr. Petrovich, DAV: General Weigl, this is th e part that's in your ballpark. W e set off to get started talking about this . Madame Ch ief C ounsel , you've given us a high level of descope, but we 've got to work our way down so everybody knows what's involved, what you're accepting, and what you're getting into. T hat way , I think we won't have these discussions anymore . So, if we could do that , Gen. Weigl, I'd appreciate it. W hen there is a committee in place, and basically it is the five service organizations anyway . I mean you see the same smiling faces no matter w here you 're coming from , the P WVC the SVC or just the independent organizations that meet with C hip every quarter . So, please, l et's get started . Ms. Pettis, DMVA OCC: As a final note , legislation would be required. J ust so everybody's clear , we would have to have legislation. W e would have to repeal the existing and just give the D epartment the responsibility to provide services , and then we have the inherent ability to contract with third parties to provide the services . RETX Committee Mr. Slep Mr. Chairman , I have no official report for you today, but I would just like to say that we've worked very hard the last couple years . The committee went through a lot of challenges , through COVID and all the other stuff we have to do. I'm very proud of current members and past members of the real estate tax committee . We were able to unify the Commission on a unanimous vote to make massive change moving forward as a Commission, and that's not to be confused because I can clearly state what we did again if I need to. B ut I want to thank the DMVA. I used to I used to wear them out every single day. T hey are doing a lot of great work. T hey're an excellent partner . And again , I wan t to thank everybody sitting around the table . My last little parting comment would be , always keep the best interest of Pennsylvania v eterans and their families as a priority . If you're sitting here at the table, voting for yourself or your organization or association as your priority , I respectfully ask you to pass the torch to someone else that will hold Pennsylvania first . That's all I have to say . Thank you. Questions/Discussion None. Legislative Committee Mr. Jackson Mr. Chairman, the Legislative Committee has no report right now. We are working on goals to presented to the Commission for next year . The PWVC has put on hold for one month its goals, and we want to make sure that the people in the P WVC get a chance to lo ok at them and vote . Then we'll be able to come back and give you something more substantial . Questions/Discussions None . Pensions /Relief/Grave Marking/State Military Cemetery Committee Mr. Googins 15 I'm going to have my partner over here helping. O ne thing and that I mentioned, and I hate to bring up the War Veterans Council, but they have a program for honor guard participation at the state cemeteries . I talked yesterday to John Getz about maybe expa nding that program . So, we we're going work on maybe a program on the honor guard at our state cemeteries. So, that be that'd be cool . One item that I need to learn a little bit more about is the little flags that we put in at the cemeteries , and someone h elp me , I just learn ed about this , they're supposed to be kept in until V eterans D ay. Is that correct , as far as anybody knows ? Some of the cemeteries take them out because it's hard to mow all around them , and from what I am gathering is that it's a push- pull from the direction from the state and the private sector sentence cemeteries to say I'm going do what they need to do is they got the mos. I don't know . I'll investigate that if it's ok, just to find out where the difference is . I think my partner here will help me out with that . It's been answered already , but if I can pass it on to you, I 've got one more thing. L ast meeting , I mentioned about a Vietnam Veterans memorial that was going to be put into I ndiantown G ap and Constance is going to update us on that because she's more familiar with it. I'm going to give you the microphone you can do it all . And I'll just remind you of one thing for the good of the order at the end . If anybody ha s any questions for me . Questions/Discussions Ms. Snavely, KPVA: T he dedication for the Vietnam memorial tomorrow at I ndiantown Gap National Cemetery is at the parking lot across from columbarium A and B . Some contexts with the little flags at private cemeteries : At least for Lebanon , the C ounty C ode says they come down in July after the 4th. H owever, a lot of the veterans' advisory councils for the areas let them stay up until after V eterans D ay. Again, speaking for Lebanon County, we remove them the Saturday after V eterans D ay. Now, putting on the hat of a person that manages a private cemetery ( I really need to learn how to retir e), I will keep a check on the flags at my cemetery . I keep a little stapler in each of my vehi cles so as I do a drive- through I can fix them or replace them . So, I think it would probably go by the cemeteries if they're removing them because the flag just didn't hold up. Some let them in until after Veterans Day, but the County C ode says they only need to be there through July 4th. S o, there's the answer . There's a lot of \" what ifs .\" Women Veterans Committee Ms. Kaye Thank you, Mr. Chairman . I have no official report this month. H appy three -day weekend to most of us . Questions/Discussions None . Veteran Health Committee Mr. Baylis The L ong-term C are C ouncil 's meeting is not until the 13th of this month. In November I'll have something to say on that one. I have been trying to come up with a way to come up with some legislation that we could recommend for suicide prevention, and I love this graph, by the way, from the CDC S uicide S tudy. It boils some things down really well , and if you use the categories that they use , there are four major categories of causal suicide: relationship collapse , long- term physical problems , overdose , and long- term financial struggles are the things that seem to remove hope , where veterans get tired of the strain and hurt themselves. T here's another study out of DoD done by Navy SEAL that entirely focuses on the loss of hope, and it talks a little bit more about feeling lost out here and a sense of loss of purpose and dire ction . So, if we used these five categories , I would like to have a little working group in December , prior to this meeting , where maybe we could bounce around some ideas targeting different areas . How to come up with some suggestions on legislation that may be able to help bring down the veteran suicide problem . It is my perception reading those studies that the countr y's doing very well clinically with therapies and medical treatments , but there's some things on the fringes that maybe we could do a better job and help with s ome legislation . I would like to meet early for the December meeting . I don't think I'd be up for it in November , but if anybody would like to do that in December , I would offer that possibility. I do a lot of homeless veterans , I don't know how many of you know that , but we do stand- downs in a lot of cities every month and we see an unusual trend in our num bers: the at -risk veterans of becoming homeless numbers participating in our stand -downs is going up . They used to 16 be about 5 to about 10% were actually homeless vets and we're seeing 25 to 35% more , which I don't know exactly what's causing it but the economy seems to be a glaring battlefield indicat or to me . Anyway, those are my main things I want to talk about . I'd like to introduce my son behind me . He's doing a civics project , so he's going to be reporting to his retired marine E -9 civics teacher about what we did here today. S o, if anybody has anything you want this civics teacher to hear , please let me know . Subject to any questions , that's what I've got . Thank you. Questions/Discussions Chairman Taylor: Adam, welcome. I hope we are providing you the information that you need for your school project . Thanks for being here with us today. Governance Committee Mr. Booker Good morning, everyone . My apologies , I've not been able to deliver on getting our committee together . I do have our draft bylaws and what I'm calling our operating procedures , which is an addendum to the bylaws . We just need to connect as a group to work on them , and I would ask members of the committee who are here to stay behind afterwards for a little bit and meet with R ick to discuss our way forward in our collaborative tools . Questions/Discussions None. PA War Veterans Council Update Mr. McDonald As per our conversation earlier today , it'll be monthly. A s of today, I don't have any business . But I'll keep it on a monthly basis if I deem something needs to be brought to the Veterans Commission. Questions/Discussions None. UNFINISHED BUSINESS None. NEW BUSINESS Chairman Taylor: I had a question that I proposed to Mr. Mutschler and the PIRO team about the use of professional titles in correspondence. S ome years ago, I asked about this, and I was told no, but verbally I was told yes . My concept was that there may be some forms of correspondence where the use of a professional title , like a master's degree or a doctorate degree or a military rank even may be appropriate to use in some kind of correspondence , and the response verbally that I got is yes . So, a little more about that to follow , but the whole purpose of me saying this is if there is some correspondence that needs to be put out , right now I have the approval to, if somebody is recognized as a Ph.D., they would be allowed to use doctor in their title. So, more to follow. And, just a reminder , on S unday the 6th of N ovember , there is the V eterans D ay ceremony here at Fort Indiantown G ap N ational C emetery . Catholic W ar Veterans has the lead for that , so if you are in the area and want to come out and participate, I'd encourage you to please do that . 2:00 to maybe 6:00 at the national cemetery . Good of the Order 17 Mr. Googins, VVA: There's an organization in southwestern Pennsylvania some of us have heard about , I know Gen. Weigl has, it's called the Veterans' Breakfast C lub. T hey started by doing breakfast once a month and the director would go around to veteran s to lea d them on and say for example , what did you do in the service, and ask questions and get them to expound on what they did to serve our country. It has become extremely successful and it's very interesting. A ll services they allow to just speak. It's now expanded. When COVID- 19 started , they went virtual and they continue virtual especially on Monday evenings at 7 PM and other times , and they still have live events . They have something like 80 live events now they're thinking about 60 including the virtual events . I know it's getting late however I brought a bunch of these magazines . It's a current one that just came out . They do a great job on a free magazine . By the way , this is all free , there's no expense , but you must pay for breakfast if you had breakfast and go to one of the live events . Anyway, the individual who started it is a history buff. He taught at Penn State Beaver for many years and then as he learned about veterans , he's now veteran supporter , and that is his life right now , and his families also. So, he's dedicated to this . The sole purpose is to recognize veterans and tell their stor ies. It is not one of those that is recorded. A ll of the virtual meetings are recorded but that's not the purpose . This is just a friendly group, and I'll tell you everyone go to I come home and tell my wife that's the best one yet . I don't know when that will hit the ceiling but what I'm getting at is that every one of them are interesting and someone a jaw dropping. I have a bunch of these magazines in the back of the room. They cost nothing. I highly recommend you take some time and just jump in. Mr. Heister, MOAA: MOAA is the lead organization of a military coalition in DC. W e have a dozen lobbyists . We represent officers of course , but the work we do benefits servicemembers , retirees , and veterans of all ranks . And something I want to draw your attention to is , those of you who are Tricare recipients , beneficiaries , Tricare is taking this action to eliminate 14,000 independent pharmacies around the country from participating in the Tricare pharmacy network , and what that's doing is that takes away your option to go down to your local independent pharmacy who probably charges you a lower copay, certainly than Express Scripts does , and probably less than Rite Aid or Walmart or G iant E agle or any of the other national drug stores , CVS and so on. This was done sort of as a stealth thing . I smell lobbyists at work hard at night but MOAA's fighting this . The action that you can take is to reach out to your Congress representative and your senators and ask them to insert themselves into this and stop Tricare from kicking out up to 14,000 independent pharmacie s. The rationale is , oh you got another pharmacy just down the street , so we don't need to have this one . Well, that other pharmacy just happens to charge more. That's it. Mr. Eisele, PASACDVA: Good afternoon, sir. I'm new to this table, but I have been doing this job for well over a decade and have been to the SVC many , many times over . The biggest thing I could ask going into the elections is to leave all the garbage the door and let's keep moving forward. W e are all doing the same job . We need to remember when we walk in to this door, we're team . Lead by example and get the job done so veterans stay in Pennsylvania and want to move to Pennsylvania . That's all I have to say . Mr. Brady, MCL: I j ust wanted to let you know that on November 11th, the Marine Corps L eague nationa lly is joining with the N ational Fla g Foundation in an event to highlight the 240th anniversary the Purple Heart award . Beginning at the Coppers B uilding in Pittsburgh, on the evening of November 11th, it wi ll be bathed in purple and a Marine Corps L eague color guard will participate in a ceremony . From there it goes to O ne World Trade Center in New York , to a small community in Arizona where buildings across the country will be either bathed in purple or red, white , and blue with a Marine Corps L eague color guard ( fingers crossed ). So, keep an eye on that . I'm aware that along with the one in P ittsburgh there will be an event in P hiladelphia . I'm not sure where yet but watch the social media postings of the M arine C orps L eague and the N ational Flag F oundation. And, also , until the next time we meet, Vets V ote! Mr. Hawk , AMVETS: I want to let everyone know that AMVETS is doing a homeless veterans clothing drive . There are boxes out through several locations in Lebanon County. O n November 5th, we will be down here at head quarters , right here on the base , building 3 -97. Anybody wants to bring any clothing or whatever , we're 18 going to gather everything up that day . We'll have some food available and stuff like that. So, everybody's welcome. Y our donations are welcome . They're definitely going to homeless veterans . Appreciate your help . Ms. Snavely, KPVA: T he Lebanon Valley Chamber of Commerce is having their annual veterans' breakfast on the 1st of November , if anybody who's local and available . The Indiantown Gap National Cemetery will be the recipient of the 2022 General S moker B eyond the Call Award that day also . The keynote speaker is Sergeant Earl Granville . He's a nine -year veteran of the Army National Guar d and Purple Heart recipient , if anyone's heard of him. H e's an amputee thanks to a roadside bombing and i s now a motivational speaker and a marathon runner . I couldn't run a marathon with two legs. S o, if anybody is interested, I ha ve information on that . Closing Remarks Chairman Taylor: W e have one more formal piece of process to do and that is the election. B ut before we do that, does anybody have any recommendations for the agenda for our next meeting? Our next meeting, as you can see on the program , is slated for Friday , December 2nd . If you don't have anything now , that's fine . If you do think of something, please send an e- mail to Mr . Greg Holler. A nd I'm thinking probably the Friday before Thanksgiving is when the team will get together to talk about the read -ahead. If any o f the commissioners have anything you'd like to add to the agenda that makes sense. And that takes us to the elections. Elections Chairman : Mr. Heister, MOAA, nominates Mr. Taylor, CWV.

For new patient appointments, average wait time is calculated from the earliest time a request for care is consistently recorded in the scheduling system to the date the appointment is completed -or the date it is scheduled to occur if not yet completed. For established patient appointments, average wait times are measured from the date agreed upon between a Veteran and provider for future care and ends on the date care is received, or the date that care is scheduled to occur if it has not yet occurred. The upgraded calculation makes the website more reflective of the complete process of requesting and receiving care. Averages are representative of general performance and may not represent individual experience. Average wait times are never used to determine eligibility for community care.VISN 4 CARE IN THE COMMUNITY > country > community > commonwealth Care in the Community Consults (Scheduled and Completed)Non 23,740 *Number of unique enrolled Veterans who receive community care at VA expense December 2022 UpdateFY23 data updated 11/13/2022 with consult info as of 11/11/2022.Title 43 Pa.

Code Ch. 5 Chapter 5 is proposed to be retitled from \"Bureau for Veterans' Affairs\" (which no longer exists) to \" State Veterans' Programs \" to provide consistency with Chapter 7, \"State Veterans' Home.\" Chapter 5 was last reviewed/amended in 1991, some 31 years ago. Statutory amendments have changed the organization of the Dept and important aspects of several of our programs over that time. Various interpretations and adjudication guidance have been issued in policy over that time which are now best addressed in regulation. We also find it advisable to structure the rules consistently: Definitions, Application, Adjudication, Appeal, and Administration.PROPOSED AMENDMENTS> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Subch. A, Veterans' Temporary Assistance When the Veterans' Emergency Assistance program was ended and turned into the Veterans' Temporary Assistance program in 2016, the regulations were never updated. Our proposed amendments codify the \"VTA Guidelines\" that we have been using since 2016, bringing the regulations current and in line with statute. Offer more detailed adjudication procedures, particularly with respect to determinations of need. Extends the reconsideration period from 10 to 30 days. Discusses the role of the VTA Fund Committee at DMVA.> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Subch. B, Educational Gratuity Address dual application and payment for students attending two or more educational institutions, as well as application procedure for students transferring between educational institutions. Describe approved educational institutions and proposed rules on full-time attendance. Create reasonable annual expense allowances in the financial need assessment for students residing off -campus Clarify Chapter 35 benefits are not a precondition to EG but are counted in the financial need assessment.> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Subch. C, Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Redefine \"income\" in the financial need assessment, limiting it to reportable income and specifically exempting veterans' benefits. Explain eligibility based on \"blind,\" \"paraplegic,\" and \"loss of two or more limbs.\" Ties these definitions more closely to those applied in the Blind and Amputee & Paralyzed Pensions programs. Create a rationale behind the cost -of-living allowance, tying it to amounts in the federal Maximum Thrifty Food Plan and Consumer Expenditure Survey; adjusted for inflation every two years. Provide a comprehensive list of acceptable expenses to eliminate ambiguity in the income/expense assessment.> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Subch. C, Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption (cont.) Add a definition of qualifying dependent tied to IRS rules. Return adjudication of eligibility back to the county, consistent with state law, along with clear guidance. (Assessment of financial need remains with DMVA, consistent with state law.) Appeal procedures more clearly address eligibility issues and issues concerning administration of the exemption that are properly appealed to the county boards of revision of taxes or assessment appeals.> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Subchs . D-E, Blind and Amputee & Paralyzed Veterans' Pensions Allow for application by spouse, legal guardian, or person exercising general power of attorney on behalf of a veteran unable to apply due to medical condition. Add clarity to the list of required supporting documentation. Hold DMVA to a 30 -day adjudication timeframe after receipt of a fully developed application. Clarify that pensions are not retroactive to effective date of VA disability ratings; they are effective on date of application to DMVA. Require timely notification of changes (i.e., a move or death). Provide procedure on reimbursement of debts.> country > community > commonwealth PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Military Family Relief Assistance Program Guidelines The authorizing statute for MFRAP specifically disallows formal rulemaking in favor of the publication of guidelines. These proposed amendments may be published as a simple notice (without the full formal rulemaking process) in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. There is a two -level approval process for MFRAP grants. The MFRAP VSS in the Programs office has authority to approve grants up to $1,500. An MFRAP Committee within DMVA can approve grants up to $3,500. The work group proposed adjusting the VSS's authority up to $1,600 to align with VTA approval authority.> country > community > commonwealth REGULATORY REVIEW WORK GROUP MEMBERS 1.

Flu Shots VA Health and Wellness Clinics annually sponsor the Flu Shot Campaign - the flu vaccine is given at many VA facilities, as well as community clinics and pharmacies. A link is included of where eligible Veterans can receive their flu shots. PACT Act Update Please assist in helping to spread the word on the expanded eligibility for Veterans exposed to toxic environments and other criteria made available through the PACT Act. The PACT Act is a historic new law that will help VA deliver care and benefits to millions of Veterans, and survivors, affected by burn pits and other toxic exposures. We at VA want Veterans and survivors to know three main things about the PACT Act. 2 First, we want Veterans and survivors to apply for their PACT Act benefits and care right now. Second, applying for PACT Act benefits will not affect your current benefits. Your current service connection will not be impacted. And third, any Veteran or survivor can learn more about the PACT Act at by visiting VA.gov /PACT or calling 1 -800-MY-VA-411. If Veterans, or a loved one, served during the Vietnam era, or the Gulf War, or in our post-9/11 conflicts, they may very well be eligible for additional benefits or care. Every Veteran enrolled in VA healthcare will get a five -minute Toxic Exposure Scre ening - a series of questions to help you determine if you might be eligible for additional benefits or care. This was made available at all VHA facilities and clinics starting Nov 8. VA is currently reaching out to Veterans and survivors to make sure tha t they know about this new law and what it could mean for them and their families. Because we want every eligible Veteran and survivor \u2014every one \u2014to get the benefits and care they've earned and deserve. PACT Act Awareness Events VA will host a minimum of 50 PACT Act awareness events December 11- 17, 2022. At least one in each state. Pennsylvania will host two events in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Each event will be held at a local VAMC and will be open to the media and livestreamed if possible. Veterans, Veterans families, caregivers, survivors and advocates will be encouraged to participate. Onboarding Surge Events A nationwide Onboarding Surge Event (OSE) w as held November 14 -18, a fast tracking of selectees' onboarding experience by coordinating all re quired pre -employment actions into a single -day event. Every VA facility will conduct at least one OSE with participation from the different areas involved (C&P, HR, OIT, Occupational Health, etc.), as well as senior leaders. On November 18, every VISN also hosted an in- person after action review and participate in the national OSE celebration. Patient Experience Update Nationally, VA's trust score over the last 90 days was 90%. In VISN 4, our trust score over the last 90 days was 93 which is the second highest VISN in the nation. The top 3 compliment themes over the last 90 days were quality of care, cleanliness of facilit y, interactions with staff, satisfaction with specialty care and Pulmonology Services. Caregiver Support Update Resources for Caregivers The Department of Veteran Affairs Caregiver Support Program (CSP) is excited to celebrate National Family Caregivers Month this November. Caregivers of Veterans are CSP's partners in providing first -class care to Veterans. Their efforts and sacrifices deserve to be recognized. Each facility across VISN 4 will host events for caregivers during the month. Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregiver (PCAFC) VA is reviewing and examining the current Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC), including a thorough review of the eligibility criteria and improving the overall Veteran and car egiver experience. VA announced it is extending the amount of time that Legacy Participants, Legacy Applicants and their Family Caregivers within the PCAFC will remain eligible for the program. This will include all services, supports and benefits until Se ptember 30, 2025. VA has suspended annual reassessments during a review of current eligibility criteria for all those enrolled in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC). VA will continue to initiate reassessments for Veteran s and family caregivers who request to be considered for an increase in stipend level or if there is evidence of an increased need for personal care services. During this time, VA will not remove anyone from the program or decrease any support based on the annual reassessments. As part of the VA MISSION Act, Phase II of program expansion occurred October 2022, expanding the program to include family caregivers of eligible Veterans from all eras who were seriously injured in the line of duty. New applications continue to be received. These are processed in a timely manner. In addition to the VHA Clinical Review Process, there are additional appeal options for Veterans and caregivers. The Caregiver Support Line (CSL) (1-855-260-3274) can assist Veterans and caregivers with navigating these additional options and with providing information about filing a review or appeal. 4 Program of General Caregiver Support Services (PGCSS) Facilities are continuing to develop, imple ment, and enhance services and education for caregivers. Caregiver Support Program staff, VA providers and professionals have received training in the Campaign for Inclusive Care, which engages caregivers as part of the Veteran's care team. Family caregiv ers of Veterans who aren't eligible for PCAFC can still receive support and resources through PGCSS. Connected Care Update Video Appointments : As we move closer to winter, we want to remind Veterans and their caregivers that when inclement weather hits, you can request your provider see you in your home through a VA Video Connect (VVC) visit. There is no co -pay required. Ask your provider or care team to do a video visit when inclement weather strikes. We should be able to accommodate most requests with s ome advanced notice. We want all our Veterans to be safe, and still access the care they need. Don't Risk It! Do a Video Visit! Open Slot Management: Open Slot Management (OSM), which was paused during the onset of the COVID -19 Pandemic, is being reinsta ted during December 2022 throughout Primary Care and various specialty services at each VISN 4 VA Medical Center. Open Slot Management allows Veterans meeting certain criteria (e.g. Veterans waiting for an appointment greater than 30 days, service -connecte d, new patient, etc.) to reschedule their medical appointment via SMS (Short Message Service which is a text messaging service component with mobile devices) for an earlier slot. Veterans will automatically receive these text messages as long as they have not opted out of the VEText program. This feature allows Veterans to reschedule their appointment for an earlier available appointment. By using the prompts provided in the text message, the Veteran can either reschedule or keep their current appointment. If the Veteran chooses to reschedule their current appointment, VEText will book/schedule the Veteran into the earlier slot and cancel the previously scheduled appointment. The use of Open Slot Management decreases wait times and improves the utilization of appointments. Closing In closing, I'd like to thank you for your continued support of VISN 4. Please let me know if you have any questions.

There was an outbreak in the DVVH location & I believe there is another one in SEVC, it did not surprise me at all. It will be with us for a long time. The good news is it is less fatalities. Now a pill (paxlovid) is being used, less people are dying from Covid. There are 3 pills to be taken 2 times per day , only used outside of the hospital and patients are benefitting from them. Hospitaliz ation decreases. You must be 18 years and older to use this medication, the outcome is tremendous , it is effective only 5 days. When a resident test po sitive they are isolated and put in a separate location. Everybody has my blessings. We in the window of getting influenza vaccinations in a month. Report from Yahvae Jones, Admissions/Marketing There are 83 Veterans on the waiting list. 2 Veterans are out of the State. 23 non -Veterans on the list. I did 5 events in May,3 in June and 6 in person events in July. I went to meet with Social Workers, to network and possibly get residents for our home or for one of the other Veterans homes. I can only take in five more. Report from Compliance Officer Beth We rner & Mia Woods was not available to attend the meeting. Beth sent an email. The e mail was read by Barbara Raymond . Compliance and other team members have completed four Facilities Performance Assessments and five more are scheduled for the rest of this year. For 2022, there have been 34 inquiries that were reviewed and 33 are closed with one still in progress as of 08/1/22. The Compliance department continues to keep this updated. Report from Travis Davis, Executive Director of Long -Term Care Gener al Weigl is in a meeting, she will try to get on before the meeting is over . Governor Wolf signed a budget last month, over $500 million invested for Long -term Care and N ursing facilities. 190 million towards recruitment and retention efforts . This is the first time in over a decade Medicaid got a significant increase. The Department of Health wanted to increase staffing from 2.7 to 4.1. That proposal was thrown out the door just a little bit. They have come to the table and set new goals, for where the staffing is going to be . In year one they will bump it up from 2.7 and it will be increased to 2.9, then 3.2 moving forward after that. Here at the Veteran s Homes , we are already well exceeding those numbers averaging over 3.8 , which is a strong number , and we are committed to making sure we are staffed , especially when we are looking at taking in new admissions . Things are moving in the right direction. Census - we surpassed 950 across the si x homes , we are doing a great job getting admi ssion and getting staff in the door. These are promising numbers. We were going through a little bit of a back log . It was not necessarily the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, it was more centralized in Harrisburg with getting postings out for jobs. It was a painful two months to go through at our homes. We were all affected by this throughout the Commonwealth. I am happy to report It is better than two moths ago, it is still taking time. We need to get 3 people in as quickly as possible. People are not waiting anymore 30 to 45 days . People will move on to the next employer, so we need to keep our foot on the pedal there. SEVC & Gino J. Merli are 4 Star s and DVVH & Erie are 5 Star facilities. We are trying to move in the right direction and pleased wit h the work from the team. Construction - There is a signed bill by President Biden it is called Build America, Buy America, a plan started less than 30 days ago. What they want is anyone who is receiving federal grants to buy products in America. I think we all would say we love that idea and we want to keep it that way . The challenge that we are faced wit h right now are price increases. We have a building that is going to be constructed in Hollidaysburg, we did a study to see what that would cost us if it was all American, it would cost 30% more. We believe we are going to meet an exemption on that building to keep it on track. SEVC have a big project coming up in the next five years , where the State matches part of that project. Three on going projects right now - SEVC we are putting in new flooring, it is now a carpeted building. Many of you can imagine that is not the best thing to have in a healthcare setting. Erie- we have a lot of things going on at Erie right now, the biggest is the dining room, we are about 78% through construction. Hollidaysburg - the big project is coming, and it will be one of the biggest in the State. The replacement of their existing s killed nursing facility to a new 200 bed facility. Report from Barbara Raymond, Director, Bureau of Veterans Homes The various Long -Term Care Advocacy groups, as well as the American Health Association is advocating to the government to continue on with the public health emergenc y until the October deadline . As of now October 13th the public health emergency is set to be over, which will affect some waivers that are in effect at the Nursing Homes. We are hoping it continue on particularly at that time frame as we gear up for Flu season and additional covid cases we are expected to have. Covid - Currently at the hom es we have 2 2 positive residents between SEVC and DVVH homes, those residents are stable . Within the last week we had 2 additional deaths that had covid listed on the death certificate. Covid was not listed as the primary cause, the individuals had other respir atory and cardiac concerns . That brings our total deaths for this year to 14 deaths throughout the six homes. We have 29 Staff members that are positive across the six homes currently. The residents are well above 95 percent vaccinated , they are very much continuing to take the booster to make sure they are up to date. We are only about 60 percent for that 4th dose, mostly because of timing. We did have a few residents that refused the 4th dose. The staff is in 100% c omplia nt with the federal mandate for vaccination. The staff is either vaccinated or have a religious or ADA accommodation. We are continuing to offer our staff the vaccination. We have 1 resident case of bacterial infection, it has nothing to do with seasonal type influenza. It is still spread by droplets, so that individual is in isolation , it showed up in his blood from a hospital visit. Our facilities are ready for our CMS phase 3 requirements. It went into effect pre -covid, so we have not been surveyed on them. We will start to get surveyed on them in October. The Phase 3 requirements are various things such as, quality programs, Infection control programs and the trauma - informed care have to be very specific. Survey - we just recently had our Hollidaysburg and DVVH survey through the VA. There were no major concerns, minor outtakes. We recently had our survey for the VA and DOH at our Pittsburgh facility, we are waiting the final report from the VA, we did receive our final result from DOH and both of those sur veys they did a very good job, minor things. We do have all 6 of our Commandants in place. We have a new Director of Nursing in our SEVC facility, she started a few months ago. Our SWVC facility we will have a vacant Director of Nursing position within the next few weeks, that individual is moving to a different position. 4 Report from Peter Ojeda, Commandant Over the past 3 months we had 1 7 admissions and 4 discharges. Monetary Donations for the past 3 months totaled $ 1425.00 . ACTIVITIES For the months of May , June , and July we had many events including seashell painting, painting with a twist, bingo, Wii bowling, ice cream social, DVVH glee club, virtual mass, devotions service, catholic hymns, our daily bread, outdoor exercise and the monthly bi rthday bash for the residents. We celebrated Certified Nursing Assistant Week and the CNA's received gift cards, refreshments and appreciation signs were posted throughout the building.

We were in compliance and have to give an explanation. If the explanation is not accepted we will have to go through it again in November. Dr Wally Quinlan to Peter- How long is the isolation for a positive covid now? Peter responded 5 days in isolation, then another test. If the test is negative they can come back by day 7. Mr. Knapp, Reside nt Peter, Debbie, Jack and Dr. B are 110% on top of things. Question from Mr. Knapp to Travis, is there any word on an increase for disability payments to veterans? It's been a while since we received an increase. Travis responded that is a good question for General Weigl when she gets on, she is more in tuned to that then I am. If for some reason she is unable to join us I will find out today. James Ritchie, Veterans of Foreign Wars The Commandant report , under activities, t he minutes have the tabletop horse racing was sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans. The guys who did it are Vietnam Veterans and they belong to VFW. It was sponsored by VFW . Daniel Murray, Marine Corps League We have some Advisory Council people that have not been here for years. Reach out to the organization that is sponsoring the Advisory Council Members that are not showing up. William McGoldrick, Volunteer Resource Coordinat or I have Bruce Boice contact information, physically he can not come in. Martina White, PA State Representative 143 million has been allocated for State Veteran Homes and there was an increase of 14.5 percent of the 5 00,000.00 for the Veterans Outreach Services. In my office every month we serve our local veterans onsite and try to help them get resources and what they are entitled to and even for the family members. We increased the honor guard detail funding. 5 You have been through a lot throughout the pandemic and I want to give credit to the Commandant and the General. I think that it has been a very challenging time for the State. I am glad Delaware Valley Veterans Home is in our district, having a five star rating is a proud thing we should continue to tell. I just want to say thank you and I know it has been a little while, I am here for you however I can be of service. Allan Abramson to State Representative Martina White; when you get a moment would you please reach out to me I have questio ns to ask you and some of my people have questions. State Rep took Allan Abramson telephone number to contact him. Allan thanked her for calling in. I do serve on the leadership team as the house majority. Sometimes I know in the past there has been time c onstraints on my end. I do care deeply about what you all do there at the Veterans Home here in the Northeast. I am here for you, sometimes I will send Kelly Kolodi from my office or a representative to make sure you have what you need. Call anytime and I will definitely follow up Allan. Thank you and have a nice day. Jeffrey Knapp to State Representative Martina white, when can you show up here I would like to speak to you personally? I was not sure what your policy was, I was going to have my staff call o ver to see what we needed to do to make sure we would be able to get in. I am happy to come over whenever the next meeting is. That is no problem. Mr. Knapp said thank you. Bill McGoldrick said to State Representative Martina White, he will set up an appointment with you to come back to the building again, I will come to your office. Douglas Craig, Military Officers Assoc. of America This will be my last Advisory Council M eeting I will be attend ing. I am being replaced by Claudette Campbell. Larry Holman, Jewish War Veterans My membership expires in Nov. Allan Abramson (President), Jewish War Veterans We hear in the news polio, monkey pox, infectious diseases are on the rise, what plans are being made? Barbara answered I am glad you brought that up, monkey pox in general , we are at very low risk. From a vaccine standpoint we would not be able to get i t because it is very limited and we would not be eligible at this time. The staff watch for unusual rashes. Travis respon se, the facilities added an Infection Preventionist of a corporate level who work with all six facilities. She goes to all six homes and help with audits, education and make sure we are all adhering to the same protocol . Barbara asked Allan did Ashley Dinges reach out to you yet ? He said no, Barbara said he will reach out to you. He works out of headquarters with Travis an d I. He is taske d with this variation.

Motioned by Russell Canevari and Richard Green . 2 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR Daniel Kazmierski reported that COVID is still dominating the news. We are having in-person me etings not so much because the transmission rates are d own b ut because most people are v accinate d. We have had 52 residents positive for covid year to date and most of those were earlier in the y ear. We have had 4 resident deaths . Our last positi ve resident was on June 9th. We are trying to get all our resi dents up to date on the ir vaccines which is the 2 original vaccines and 2 boosters. We have 131 out of 137 residents who are up to date. There are 6 residents who are not up to date. We have 85 staff positive for this year so far and no staff deaths. Our l ast staff positive was 8/10/22. We are very proactive with any positive staff; they are immediately sent home . We have a protocol that we follow f or allowing them to come back including rete sting, following symptoms and things of that nature. We have 214 s taff up to date with the vaccine and 98 are not. This d oes not mean that they do not have any vaccines, just that they do not have all the vaccines required for an up-to-date status (2 ori ginal shots with 1 booster or 2 boosters over 50 years old). We are continuing to have vaccine clinics weekly for not only residents and employees but also famil ies of all. It has been a very successful program. We will have FLU vaccines available September 1 5th. We are seeing high transmissible rates and high rates of co ntracting COVID, but we are clearly seeing less lethality and less powerful symptoms. We still must remain vigilant about it especially among our vulnerable populations. We are continuing our efforts of trying to avert physical and or verbal altercations among our residents . We had some bad resident to resident interactions in the past so we are trying to be proactive. We've been trying to transition all of our di abetic residents who are getting finger sticks to the Dexcom or Free Style system. Once we hav e the transition complete, we can monitor their sugars without having to stick thei r fingers. The VA discontinued primar y care visits. Previously, if anyone needed specialists, they had to see a primary care physicia n at the VA for a referral . They no long er need to do this. We continue our efforts for gradual dose reductions for antipsychotic, antidepress ant and antianxiety medications. We continue t o try and minim ize fo ley cathe ters to help minimize urinary tract infections . We continue to try an d minimize the use of antibiotics throughout the facility. o Russell asked what happens when someone refuses to get the vaccine. Dr. Kazmierski stated that we have very fe w and it is their right. We will undertake isolation precautions should there be an outbreak. We will move them to another unit. We onl y have 6 that are not up to date out of 137 residents. They all have some level of the vaccines, so they are not completely unprotect ed. Travis stated that Gino Merli has been the leader of vaccination rates since early on. One of the reasons why is education , they did a great job educating staff , family and residents helpi ng them overcome their fears. 3 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LONG -TERM CAR E Travis Davis reported that General Weigl is traveling but asked him to thank all the coun cil members for their dedication and for volunteering to serve our veterans . She said that she will be here f or the next meeting. Travis formally introduced himself to the council. He joined DMVA about a year and a half ago. He i s from Scranton and spent the last 7 years at Allied Services. It is a privilege to work with the veterans here at Gino Me rli. Having veterans in his family, he know s the reputation of this place and he is really impressed with the team. The governor 's budget p assed in July. This year there was over a 500-million -dollar investment in long term care . This is the first time in well over a decade, that long term care has been a pr iority . 190 million is going toward retention bonuses, professional development, and r ecruitment eff orts. This is important as our biggest challen ge right now is getting employees in the door. We have a lot of vacant beds in our ho mes and a lot of people on our wait lists. The challenge we have is having the staff to fill all the beds. A big portion is going towards Medicaid is getting a 20% increase which will impact us to some degree but more so the pr ivate industry. Department of Health is propos ing to increase the minimum staffing requireme nts. For many years we have been at a 2.7 minimu m requirement, and t hey want to increase it to a 4.1 which is a substanti al jump. At this t ime all our homes average around a 4.0 so we are in a pretty good position if that were to happen but DOH has met with advocacy gro ups and has agreed to a 3.2. Year one they will move into a 2.87 and then to a 3.2. Our goal is to staff above that and keep a minimum of a 3.8. Census across the homes is 962. We have a compliment of about 1500 beds, so we are around 65% occupancy. We are growing in all 6 of our homes. We are a bit landl ocked in 2 of our hom es due to construction and some occupancy surveys. Gino Merli and Southeastern has bumped up to a 4-star rating . Hollidaysburg and Southwe st are at 3 stars and Erie and Delaw are Valley are a t 5 stars. We are pleased wi th those results. Recruitment is a priority, and we have a statewide campai gn going on. We are working closely with the governor 's office and the office of administration on being unique in competing with the p rivate industry . We have had some speed bump s to overcome with delays in post ing, it still takes a while for us to get an employee in the door and people aren't waiting. There is a new federal bill signed by President Biden called Build America b y America. This bill basically states that if you receiv e any federal dollars for construct ion, your materials must be purchased withi n the United States. Right now, we have a b ig construction pl an set for Hollidaysburg where we are re placing one of the buildings with a new 200 bed home. When we ran the numbers for purchasing in the United States it drove up the cost 29%. We are going to appl y for a waiver through the federal VA to get around this ne w law but going forward we are going to have to start planning far in advance. REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE B UREAU OF VETERANS ' HOMES Barb ara Raymond introduced herself to the council. She stated that she had b een the commandant of Erie for the past 12 years. 4 Currently we have a COVID outbreak at 2 of our f acilities. We have a small outbreak of 6 residents at our Southeast facility and we have 2 residents at our Hollidaysburg facility. All those reside nts are currently stable . We are using Paxlovid in several of our facilities including t he ind ividuals at our Southeast fa cility, however they were still positive. We did have an outbreak at our Delaware Valley facility however all those individuals are current ly ou t of isolation . We have had 14 deaths since January of this year with the 2 most recent at Southeast. We are gearing up for the CMS phase 3 regulations. Regulations came out prior to COVID however the surveyors were not surveying on these regu lations. We are paying attention to our quality measures . Five-star ratings are heavily dependent upon the quality measures which are how you can show that you are tak ing care of an individual. Hollidaysburg , Southwest, and Delaware Valley hav e had their recent VA surveys . Southwest also had their annual Department of Health survey . They have all done a very good job. We get looked at f or hundred s of potential violations and for our fa cilities to have an average of 3 to 4 deficiencies out of hundreds is a tremendous accomplishment. Several directors of nursing are floating across the state in various areas . Maria Coles has been filling in while Andrew is carrying a role in Southwe st. We now have all our 6 commandants in place across the homes. We want to have a 3.8 PPD. Currently it is 2.7 which means there is 2.7 hours per patient , per day for a 100-bed facility would equal 270 hours of patient care. With t he current staffin g crisis, we would have a serious challenge to go to a 4. 1. Currently we are budgeted at a 3.8 . We understand our veteran population is a bit different from the private sector. W e tend to have more males , more altercations , more falls with injury, more uri nary type issues and we are thankful to be able to budget oursel ves at that high er staffing number. We are looking at the statuses of the council members , making sure we have all the proper paperwork in place . o Russell Canevari asked for clarification o f the 2.7 and Barbara stated that we must have 2.7 hours of care , per patient , per day. Russell then asked if we have the staff to accommodate the hours and Barbara stated that is the problem. It is a very serious problem that we are facing across the c ountry. Nursing and healthcare staff are leaving because they are tired and fatigued. COVID was extraordinarily devastating to our healthcare system. o Robert Cudworth asked if we are at a 3.8 right now. We are close but our census is also down. We are not sacrificing the care for a full cen sus. We have been keeping our census low on purpose so that we can maintain the patient care hours. That is what has caused the long wait lists in some areas. REPOR T OF THE ADMISSONS DIRECTOR Sarah Butler reported that our census is at 137. Since our last meeting we have had 19 new admissions but have also had 15 deaths . We are in the process of trying to increase the census. We do have 4 admissions scheduled to come in. We are also scheduled to attend 2 outreac h events to try and build the waiting list . Unlike some of the other homes, our wai ting list is not as long yet. 5 REPORT OF THE COMMANDANT Vito Ruggiero introduced himself as the \"new old guy \". He was commandant a few years past. He reported that we hosted a golf tourna ment on June 6th, and it was the highest amount ever raised . We will have the amount next meeting. Our roofing project is completed, and the courtyard has reopened. We will begin the replacement of the heating and air conditio ning units on September 6th. We will be starting with 1S. Letters will be sent out to the families to n otify them o f the project and changes. The COVID rate is currently at 17.46 which is high. We are following the policies . All those not up to date are required to test bi-weekly , wear safety glasses and N -95 masks. We are continuing to offer vaccine clinics to residents, staff and family. We ha ve 131 of 137 residents not fully vaccinated. Today we have 2 more scheduled which will bring us to 133. Our admissions have decided to raise our census goal to 75% capacity which will bring in 10 more residents . We are confident that with the allotted overtime we will be able to raise o ur compliment to 75% and still maintain an open unit incase we need to create a red area again for COVID. Our off-site trips have increased for our residents . We received our VA survey response regarding the 3 defici encies that the facility received. We are compliant other than a bond which is being handled by our legal department. Yesterday we had DOH here as a follow -up from a complaint to see if we are following up on our submitted plan of correction . They also h ad a new complaint. Happy to say we are compliant, and that the new co mplaint is unsubstantiated. Our Vets Home Week was a success. Travis and Maria were in the dunk tank for mon ey. Saturday is our motorcycle ride with H arley David son. Janice can gi ve you more information if you sto p at her office. On August 2nd, we celebrat ed Morris Kashuba who turned 103. All of our homes will be participating in a cooking contest. Our home 's entry will be tasted and voted on today. You are all welcome to stay for that. o Joe Sylvester stated that his organization would like to take the residents to a restaurant like they used to. Vito stated tha t we are beginning to go out again and that he should contact Pam or Jan. THE GOOD O F THE COUNCIL Robert Cudworth asked why do we have to h ave 2 witnesses when a patient needs to get a shot . Isn't it a matter of the custodia n or guardian? Barbara stated that we are just making sure that everyone is aware of the treatments and what is going into their body. Carol Sweeney for Karen Boback stated that the Veterans ' Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee went to Penn St ate on August 10th, they attended the informational meeting held at the Veter ans' and Service Member 's legal clinic. They met with Miche le Vol lmer, a clinical professor of law and associate dean for clinics and experiential learning as well as other individuals to discuss the mission of the clinic. The clinic provides, among other things, assis tance with VA related legal issues such as disability, pension, education benefits , advocacy for change in law and l egislation that will further benefit veterans and their families. 6 House Bill 1421 which is Act 54, provides money for the following: an increase in the amount of a stipen d from 150.00 to 250.00 for honor guard burial detai ls. It authorizes the PA N ational Guard to provide burial details when veterans' service organization members are not available or unable to provide the burial detail. An increase in the base pay for members of Pennsy lvania National Guard and Pennsylvania Guard ordered to special or active state duty to not less than 180.00 per day. House Bill 18 67 now Act 69, which encourages school districts to identify and assist students of transient military personnel. House Bill 2412 now Act 38, aut horizes the PANG to support state and loc al governments with cyber training or exercises while activ ated. o Russell Canevari asked for clarification of the honor guard stipend. Lisa Ka ye stated that military burials and honors are supposed to be free of charge and money is from donations. She st ated that she doesn 't believe it's accurate that people are getting paid 25 0.00 per funeral . If a family wants to give a donati on that is a whole different issue, but honors are supposed to be free. This h as been a battle that people are being charged and that people are being p aid and the families aren 't being given the option fo r free. Lisa also stated that this issue is being brought to the attention of the Sta te Veterans ' Commission . Travis ended with the real problem right now is the red tape around hiring. We are trying to be creative with our hiring and becoming a Com monwealth employee. What 's promising is that we are not seeing a huge exit of all our direct care staff leaving for all the crazy offers being posted all over the state. Our turnover numbers are nowhere near what they are in the private sector, the y are high regardless which is concerning. We need to keep pushing the boundaries of what we are told that we can and cannot do. We sare looking fo r support from our state reps and senators as well as the council and the organizations to move the nee dle. We are hoping with the new budget, we will have the ability to be creative and get people in our doors.

APPROVAL OF PREVIOUS MEETING MINUTES The minutes were approved from the prior meeting. MEDICAL DIRECTOR UPDATE Mrs. Seibert provided update on behalf of Dr. Eric Milie: Currently on our campus we are in full compliance with all of the regulatory survey agencies . That includes the D OH, DHS and VA . We are, from a covid standpoint, all green, which means that all of our residents are free of covid at the moment. We continue to monitor and test according to the testing protocols that are laid out via the CMS and DOH. Which for us means, with the Erie County transmission rate being as high as it is right now, this morning it was at 2 3%, we continue to test twice weekly for all residents and staff who are not up to date with their vaccination status. All the residents again are clear and free of covid at this moment. We do have 3 staff members who have tested positive for covid. 2 as recently as yesterday afternoon. Our testing l ocation continues to be outside, which is really advantageous. Our staff when they exhibit any symptoms are educated and have been doing a really good job adhering to this. They call in if they any symptoms , they come in and test at the outside testing location , so there is no resident crossover. They will continue to be off the schedule and will return once they're cleared by nursing administration. As far as resident impact, we continue to watch any of the activities to make sure there appropriate, given some of the covid mitigations that are at hand, but we encourage the outside activities. Visitation is without restricts . We are trying to be as back to normal as we can make it as evidence by the \" Sharing and Caring\" trip that was enjoyed by a lot of fol ks yesterday down in Pittsburgh. I was greeted by some residents that said they had a wonderful time yesterday and it was very much appreciated . ADMISSIONS AND MARKETING UPDATE Mrs. Seibert p rovided update on behalf of Pamela Jenkins : From an admissions standpoint we are seeing a lot of referrals coming in. we continue to receive them and field the calls. We are continuing to send out applications and to provide tours as needed. We have from a bed occ upancy level we have 6 veterans on the waiting list for the dementia unit, which currently has 15 residents. We have 3 non -vets on the waiting list for the d ementia unit. You might remember from the last meeting the ACU unit \"E\" and \"D\" are being renovated with all new flooring, so we have by design left some of those beds vacant as a matter of accommodating during the renovations of that unit . We are pretty confident as soon as the renovations happen, we can open up for full occupancy and we have established a waiting list to be able to fill th ose beds . On the nursing care unit, we have 65 out of the 75 beds occupied. We have 20 veterans that are on the active waiting list and 10 non -vets on the waiting list. Again, a condition of the renov ations, once the renovations are finished, we will be a ble to fill those beds off of the waitlist. On the PCU side we have 55 residents we're caring for right now . We have 4 that are on the waiting list and 2 that are non -vets on the waitlist. The renovations to the bathrooms, which are going really well, we are on phase 3 of the phase 5 construction project. So, again, some of the census is the result of the bed fill availability. Any questions? There were no questions. MARKETING UPDATE From a marketing end, we did participate this summer in some really fun o utreach opportunit ies. The \"8 Great Tuesday\" nights we participated in as well as the \"Tall Ships\" festival. What was interesting with the \"Tall Ships\" is that there were a lot of people from the Pittsburgh area . I think Ken mentioned, next year we will ha ve our Pittsburgh facility represented there as well. Ken and Emily did a real good job of providing info, not just on PSSH but also for the folks that came up from Pittsburgh. So that was a really successful event . We have been participating in some senio r citizen expos. The Curt Sonney senior expo . We will be participating in the Albion fair next week and the Mercer County Veteran Resource Fair we will be participating in . In the month of August, we were able to assist 5 veterans that were otherwise homeless, prior to coming to our Personal Care unit. So that was an active month and very much a support for our veteran homeless population. Again, the waitlist continues to grow which is always a good thing. Ken Vybiral added: It has been a real active summer especially since the last time we met. Life here at the Home has probably been the best its been since the onset of the pandemic . We were able to have a performance by the Erie Philharmonic which was exclusive to us. It was a really great celebration of patriotic music. It was really fantastic. We mentioned the \"Sharing and Caring\" trip, but just a lot of activity that was brought back this summer . A lot of the State Representatives have been offe ring their expos and fairs . So, we've been engaged and participating in all of those , getting out and talking to the community and making sure th ey're aware of our services . From an employment standpoint, admissions standpoint , volunteer recruitment standp oint we're all working very hard to build all those areas back up again. we're excited for where we are at right now and looking forward to a lot of great events coming this fall. Any questions? There were no questions. REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LONG -TERM CARE Mr. Travis Davis provided update: First, I want to say thank you all for your time and dedication to our Home up here in Erie. We certainly respect and appreciate all the time that you dedicate to our veterans here and our staff. The Governor's budget was signed in July, and it had a significant investment in Pennsylvania long -term care. Close to $500 million dollars . There hasn't been a significant investment in LTC in Pennsylvania in over a decade, so it was something that our in dustry really needed, and I think it was highlighted during the pandemic. Part of this $500 million dollar investment , there is about $190 million that's going to support retention bonuses , professional development and recruitment efforts for our staffing, and that's something I can you right now we desperately need. Its why our hands are pretty much tied to provide the things we can do for our staff . Because we are state employees, things like bonuses , incentives, appreciation gifts, those are all things t hat the private industry does routinely to boost the morale and attract staff and those are things that we can't do. So, I'm hoping that with this $190 million dollars that's being funneled into the state, I'm hoping that we are granted some flexibility with what we can do for our staff. Staffing still continues to be our biggest challenge today. It's the reason that our facilities are not full. We have extensive waiting lists. We have vets that are trying to get into our Homes, but we don't have the staff right now to do it. So right now, our census is around 980 at the 6 Homes. That's about a 68% occupancy rate. Again, we have a lot of closed wings, some due to construction like here in Erie , some is due to staffing . The DOH proposed an increase to the minimum staffing requirement. We right now surpass what the minimum state requirement is and we're going to continue to staff accordingly so we can meet our residents needs. However, our goal moving forward is going to be , to be above what the state minimum is. It's going to require additional positions for us to fill. So, we've gotten approval to add about 140 additional , mostly nursing positions to meet that goal . As you know, we have hundreds of vacancies right now . So, on top of that, it's going to be a big task to try and fill these positions. Five-star ratings. That's how we are rated through the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid . We have 2 of our 6 facilities bump up a star rating which is a great sign . Gino Merli and Southe astern Veteran Center are both now 4 overall stars . We recently wrapped up 2 annual Department of Health surveys at Holli daysburg and Southeastern Veteran Center. Both of those went very well. Southeastern Veteran Center ha d a deficiency free survey this year . Covid, we have 3 Homes currently in outbreak . All of our county transmission rates remain very high. What that does to us is it increases the amount of testing that is done. Every week were doing hundreds of tests on our staff and our residents. The PPE burnout and fatigue it puts on our staff members , we're really starting to see that. We've been seeing it over the years but never were in an outbreak, which again is 1 resident that could trigger the outbreak. Our staff are in their googles, they're i n their N95s and gowns, and it's really starting to wear on our employees. I will say between the 3 outbreaks we have right now, all of our residents remain stable . We have 15 Covid deaths year to date throughout the 6 Homes. None of those cases was Covid the primary cause of death. We are still required to record it as a Covid though . On the construction end president Biden signed a federal bill called \"Build America by America\". What that says is anyone who se receiving federal funds for constructio n they want all the materials purchased by American manufacturers . We have a 2-year waiver in effect for our current construction projects . For example, we have a replacement project going on in Hollidaysburg where we are constructing a 200 bed nursing fac ility to replace 2 outdated facilities. That's about an $80 million project. If the \"Build America by America\" was in effect today, that would raise our costs about 29% for that project. So, this is in the back of our heads that we really have to go back t o the drawing board and look at our 5 year and 10 year construction plan s so we can see what that impact is going to have on us. This is relatively new, were working with the VA closely on this to see how it may impact some of our larger project s down the road . As you can see there is a lot of construction going on in Erie, we're getting really close to the finish line. We're about 90% done with the nursing side . Its going to be a great addition for our residents up here in Erie. Also, at Southeastern we ha ve some flooring projects going on . 2 other positive notes I want to mention , we're seeing a decrease in grievances across all of our Homes. Those grievances are whether a family member or a resident has a complaint about something. Were seeing that those numbers are going down, which is a great sign for us. Also, we are seeing an increase in employee satisfaction . I told you today about staffing challenges, PPE burnout, with all of that burden on our staff, we're seeing the ir satisfaction go up . So, when I look at quality, I think those 2 measures tell us that we are moving in the right direction. Any questions? You mentioned President Biden \"Building America\" and its going to run the cost up almost 30%, is there some metrics that go with that ? Where did you get that number from? What we did when this originally came out, we didn't know that there would be a 2 year waiver , so we looked at our current constructi on projects right now and we estimated the things we were outsourcing out of the country for this project and what would it cost to buy in America if we did that. That's where we got that 29% increase. Luckily the VA said, no, we're going to put out a 2 ye ar waiver for any existing projects. So, we're okay on that project going forward but, we have major projects down the pipeline in Southwestern Veterans Home in Pittsburgh. We have a bout a $24 million project going on down there and renovations to that bu ilding. So, that is what the team is working on right now is estimating those costs. I have one question on staff. Is there any particular area where we're really hurting at this location? Nursing. RNs LPNs and nursing assistants. And that's across all 6 Homes. The one Home we have adequate staffing at is Hollidaysburg, but we are preparing to downsize that facility because of this new construction project. Right now, the Hollidaysburg campus is enormous, and it's spread out in multiple buildings . We're go ing to consolidate a lot of services under one roof and looking at staffing to see what are appropriate numbers going forward . Hollidaysburg is the one location right now that if we have a veteran that needs placement right away and he's lives up in the Erie area , we tend to go towards Hollidaysburg to get them that care right away and then they can transfer when a bed becomes available . First on your metrics there, there are not too many organizations anywhere that have those 2 causes of metrics going on at the same time. So that is a tremendous kudos. On the nursing, and only because all the kids I've coached , so many are now in colleges and studying to be nurses etc., before they get to that point they all look for nurse's aide positions while in school . I'm sure you guys could try to take advantage of that. Probably one of our biggest challenges with that are the schools. The re are no teachers in the nurse aide training courses anymore. Across the country there is a teacher shortage to train th e nurses aides. That's one of the problems. The other problem actually dates back probably more than a decade ago. The Department of Education pulled the nurse aide training from several different entities so that has been a major problem. Red cross use t o hold it and that's where we would get a lot of our individuals from. The other change that happened about a decade ago, for an RN in school , after he/she completed there initial first year, which involved their clinical rotation to be in a nursing home, that counted as their nurse aide training , it no longer counts. So even if you were an RN going through college you still would have to take the nurse aide training course that there is no teachers for. But I'm saying kids that already have that certification. So, what we're doing actually this summer , we're going to do a government internship program. That's where we are going to try to pull t hose individuals that maybe are in school and they don't want to work during the school year, so like a summer job . So those are the type of people we are going to try to pull in for summer type employment. As far as going to the different colleges , we're doing job fairs, those kinds of things. And that's tough because everyone is doing that, right? What we're trying to do also is work with our sister agencies . The Department of Human Services and we have the similar needs on the nursing end . So, we're talk ing about doing personal videos where we show how you kind of grow a nurse . How you can get into one of our Homes, whether it's by housekeeping, dietary or CAN, you can grow your career. We're pushing this movement with our Office of Administration in Harr isburg . We've talked about the colleges so much, lets talk about high school ers when they're trying to figure out what they want to be , how can they go to school and get things paid for. That's w here I think we need to start building that pipeline because I am concerned about the future of caregiv ers for this industry. REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF VETERANS' HOMES Mrs. Barbara Raymond provided update: Good morning, everyone. It's wonderful to see you all in person. Cheri is unable to join us today. Probably about 2 years ago I involved her in a project and its just finally wrapping up today . Thank you to Beth for pi nch-hittin g again. Cheri does send her regards that she wasn't able to join us today at this meeting. Speaking of \"Sharing and Caring\", this facility , Southwest facility and Hollidaysburg facility were all on the boat trip yesterday as well as today. I did hear that Cheri was our captain, she must have tak en over for me . I was captain for about 5 years. PSSH and our Hollidaysburg facility they won the dance contest. They had a really good time yesterday down in Pittsburgh. It's a long busy day for our Erie and Hollidaysburg folk, its quite the trip but ever ybody really enjoys it. Hopefully next year I can join them again . From a Covid perspective, we have 15 positive residents across our 6 Homes. We have our Gino Merli facility in Scranton in outbreak. Currently they have11 positive residents. Our Southeast facility has 1. That individual, though stable from a Covid perspective, has other comorbidities and that family is currently looking to go on hospice or comfort measures . Because that individual is currently positive with Covid, depending on when the indi vidual does indeed expire, we would then count that as a Covid death . So, depending on the timeframe of when this individual were to move on in their lives would determine whether or not we count it as a Covid death. Our Hollidaysburg facility has 3 indivi duals positive. Everybody other than that 1 individual is currently stable. We currently have 28 staff members positive with Covid across the 6 Homes. Our vaccine rates, we are well above 80% for our staff members. We are 100% compliant with the Federal ma ndate . Any of our individuals not fully vaccinated and or up to date either have a religious accommodation or an ADA accommodation so we are 100% compliant. We talked about our recent surveys. We had a very busy survey the last few weeks. Our Hollidaysburg was surveyed by the VA, Department of Health Life Safety, Department of Health Clinical and Department of Human Services all within just the last few weeks. They are doing quite well though, no major concerns out of any of our surveys . Travis mentioned we're really excited for our Southeast facility they ended up deficiency free out of their most recent annual survey . We are doing job fairs, they are coming up this coming fall late in September is when the first one starts and then we will hit them throughout the 6 Homes to again, try and fill those nursing positions which is definitely are greatest need. Which is where we put those additional positions due to our wanting to have higher hour per patient per day then the private sector does. The private sector, the government was initially looking at a 4.1 per hour per patient per day , which if you take a 100 bed building, that is 410 hours nursing care that is required . Currently it is 2.7 hours , again with that 100 bed building it would be about 270 hours. So, you can see in the current staffing crisis some facilities are struggling to maintain that 2.7 hours per patient per day , let alone increasing it to the 4.1. so, the Governor's Office did back that off a little . We don't have the finals on that yet, but the Governor's Office did back that off significantly. However, we want to keep our staffing as high as we possibly can, so we budgeted ourselves at 3.8 hours per patient per day. With those additional positions that we were budget ed, we did also move to some maintenance positions, some housekeeping positions across the 6 facilities, some activit ies positions to help support the overall operations of the 6 Homes. The other thing on our list from a fun perspective are cooking contests. So, we'r e doing our cooking contest across the 6 Homes. It's really fun the staff are enjoying it. We had some hiccups here and there on how to process everything and make sure everything was going smoothly and according to plan, but the kitchen staff were really excited about it . Its been neat to do that quality check on the food as well as boost a little morale . Any questions? When we were working with the budget this year, the staffing hours were a big point . From my standpoint, when I see 2.7 , and correct me if I'm wrong here, that's basically 1 person taking care of 3 people all day ? Not quite. We'll use that 100 bed example. If you take that 2.7 and times your 100 residents, so you have 270 hours in 24 hour s then divide that by 8. Is that 2.7 really low? So, the 2.7 , it all depends quite honestly on the a cuity of the resident. Our resident population, though they may not be sick from a clinical perspective, we don't have a lot of tracheostomies , we don't hav e a lot of wound care, we don't have a lot of tube feedings, those types of things that take nursing time in that manner. However, our population is primarily male , and I love all you men dearly, however, men don't listen. They tend to get up because they think they can do it and then with weak legs and that sort of thing, they fall. So, that is where some of our biggest challenges are. The gentlemen that we take care of tend to be a little more aggressive, they tend to have more mental health issues . So th at is where our time is spent, not necessarily on those skilled needs if you will. So, 2.7 hours truly depends on acuity however, it is low. Even in a private sector we didn't run a 2.7 . now with the staffing crisis, most places are running below a 2.7. What do you feel is the sweet spot? Honestly, outside of our folks , I would say a 3.2. Again, depends on the acuity. As an average I would say 3.2. What's the standard to protect staff and the residents from some of those difficult patients? Once we take t hem in , which is why we're very judicial as far as watching what's the history, what's the diagnosis, what's the medications, because once we have them, we can only discharge somebody for lack of payment or a situation where we can no longer care for them if they're a danger to themselves or others however the caveat is we have to have somewhere safe to place them . So, if they're a challenge for us are you going to take them in? So, it's rare? Yes, very rare. Depending upon the scenario, if someone is threa tening with a knife, bodily harm , things like that, we do have the option to transfer them to a hospital depending on the diagnosis though the hospital may or may not admit them and still the hospital is obviously not a discharge plan, so they still end up coming back. I understand the difficult patients, but I don't think the ones who can't pay get thrown out, correct? Correct. Our situation is uniquely different. We don't look at finances at all until they come in . A lot of people think that it's free, it's not free. In a very simplistic way, we take 80% of the individual's income and they keep 20%. There are very formulas invo lved in it, depending on if they have a community spouse, depending on if they have a community home , because the home in the Medicaid world as long as the individual goal is to discharge home then the home is never taken until the individual then passes on or there is no community spouse. We don't discharge anyone because they can't pay . That being said though, if they should be paying us, we go through the process, but it is very difficult. REPORT OF THE COMMANDANT Mrs. Elizabeth Seibert provided update: I just want to highlight some of the construction projects briefly. Some that you see from being on campus and some that are kind of behind the scenes. The first one that is kind of behind the scenes is the boiler house . The roof was changed out an d that is complete. We're just waiting to have Labor and Industry complete their final inspection. We did have a freezer and a cooler which was installed down in our storeroom which will be very advantageous for the dietary inventory flow. That is almost r eady to be up and running . We're just waiting for some final work to be done. The front of the PCU entrance, work is still being completed there. We thank you for using the ramp as an alternate way of egress in and out. We're just waiting on the new railings that were made to be installed and that should be by the next time you guys come it should be completed. They also in that area, fixed the porch roof . It was needing of some repair. The renovation project over on the nursing side is coming along very nicely. We'll be excited to tour you guys once it is complete. The therapy gym just has some final touch ups. The HVAC contactor just needs to do some things behind the scenes with some of the tubes and then it will be co mpleted. The NCU kitchen, that whole area, we are waiting on a service line and a beverage counter which is here and just needs to be installed . According to the walk around yesterday, the end of October is the date they are hopeful for . On your drive in you may have seen the new security building that is out by the front gate. There is a few more things that need to happen before that is completely turned over. One final inspection of. On PCU the bathrooms are all being renovated in this building. As you can imagine it is quite a fe at and it does entail going all the way down to the basement so whenever they work on one bathroom , it might be on the second floor, but it's involving the plumbing trunks all the way down in the basement . It is a 5 phase projec t that was initiated a while ago and we are on phase 3. The front of the NCU building, you'll notice they laid some additional sidewalk space for residents to be able to ambulate with their wheelchairs and some sitting areas that will be enjoyed by them o nce the full gates and everything with that project is completed. On the ACU, both units' \"D\" and \"E\", all the flooring on the units including the resident's rooms is being lifted and all new flooring will be laid down. It's a really nice project for the A lzheimer unit . As far as the compliance goes, I want to mention we are in our open window for our DHS survey on the Personal Care side . From a staffing angle I want to report off the actual numbers. We are authorized for 268 employees, we have 227 filled , which leaves us with 41 vacancies. We will continue to recruit and fill those positions. Lastly , I wanted to mention we do have in the works, after many years, a resident and staff photo . It's going to be taken in front of the facility. When you walk out, you'll see everyone gathered for that. Any questions? There were no questions. COMPLIANCE REPORT Mr. Josh Spigner provided update: The first issue is monthly exclusion checks. We've found that those are being done inconsistently throughout the BVH and so we are trying to link with OA downtown so that we can be on a contract with a vendor that will do this automatically for us, thus eliminating the risk of human error and also taking some of the workload off of the Homes themselves. The second issue for us is PBJ (Payroll Based Journaling). We are in the midst of having different vendors who are going to be able to help us stay in compliance with PBJ and also eliminate the risk of human error so none of our numbers are at risk to PBJ reporting issues. Any questions? There were no questions. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS Mr. R. DiGiacomo : Every time I come here, the residents are always pleasant , they always want to talk, and they don't know who I am , I'm just walking around and that is good evidence th at they're getting good care here. likewise, the employees, they might have an idea of who this stranger is walking around but they're also always cheerful and engaged and when I sit back and watch the interactions with the residents, they're always positi ve. My generation, Sunday is September 11th, we don't have that many residents here who are that generation yet but I think we will down the road , so one of the things you guys keep performing well and this will be here for my generation . When I need some where to go, I would have no problem living here at the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home. I know that I will be taken care of. Mr. Harry Stewart: It's really nice to see the residents getting out. We had them down for our picnic and they loved every minute of i t, the staff were great. Will we be able to do the Christmas tour this year? Mrs. Raymond: I'll talk with Cheri. I think so. I'm going to tentatively say yes , but I will talk to Cheri and make sure she is okay with it. I'll let her know what we've done in the past. Mr. Benacci: Good morning , I don't have a lot other than we all know that the PACT Act was passed here in August , so they added a lot of new presumptive' s for 9/11 all the way down to the Vietnam and Agent Oranges. The big one is the hypertension . I'm sure your house VSOs are aware, but I just wanted to make sure that all the residents know and if they need to go back and file a claim they should. If they g ot denied in the past for hypertension they should go back in, don't wait for the VA to contact them. Mrs. Raymond: We have 2 VSO's that support the east and the west side of the state as well as individual VSOs in all of the Homes and yes, they are on top of it. The Honorable Daniel Laughlin: The Veteran's breakfast that's coming up in a couple of weeks, I didn't get a chance to get the update from , my staff, so I brought Katie with me. Katie, can you give us a little update please? Katie: The Veterans Ap preciation Breakfast is September 23rd at the Zem Zem Shriners Club . It's a small er sit down breakfast . The guest speaker will be Joe. Each attendee will receive a n appreciation certificate from the Senate . The Honorable Daniel Laughlin: Thank you, Katie. We're looking forward to having some residents from here attend. I have to tell you, I've been on this for 6 years now . This is one of the things that I'm most proud of is being on this Advisory C ouncil. I d on't know how much of a positive impact that had but I certainly do my best and t ake messages back to the Senate . Mr. Gary Fry: We get these little emails that update us about Covid and the situation with the residents and employees and the construction g oing on and I like that because living out in Warren County I feel like I'm kept in the loop. They come quite frequently, and I like it. We've got a new meeting setup here. Is this better or worse ? Do we like it away from the wall? The audio is much better . We are still working on the acoustic situation, but you guys know we had challenges when we were downstairs in the chow hall. Well, it looks like it is pretty well accepted so we're moving in the right direction. I see this morning that the VA announced that the flu shots are ready . If you're in that area and want to go get your flu shots. Please spread work out for that . The building and grounds looks nice. I was impressed pulling in this morning. I see most of the construction is coming right along . I want to bring up one other thing. Last time we inducted two people into the hall of the fame . I was taken back by the crowd that was here. how nice it was and showcased in the chapel. I just thought it was very great . I heard a lot of people when I was wa lking around the room saying how nice they thought it was. I don't know who in particular put it together, but they should be commended, I'm sure it was a group effort. OLD BUSINESS No old business to discuss. NEW BUSINESS No new business to discuss.

There was a moment of silence , followed by the Pledge of Allegiance . Advisory Council Meeting July 14, 2022 Page 2 of 6 Review and Approval of April 14 , 2022 Meeting Minutes: A motion was made by John Getz and seconded by Mary Archey t o approve the minutes of the Advisory Council Meeting held on April 14 , 2022 . Motion carried, and minutes were approved as written . Report of the Medical Director: Lauren Stenson, SEVC Director of Nursing , reported on behalf of Medical Director Dr. Michele Shrikanthan. Currently the facility has no Covid positive resident s. There is one positive staff member who is in stable condition and remain s out of the facility . From skilled nursing , there are 153 residents who are vaccinated; 101 of them have also received the first booster ; 45 residents have r eceived the second booster. Three residents are unvaccinated. From Personal Care, there are 3 6 residents who are vaccinated with 35 having also received the booster. For staff, there are 37 employees who remain unvaccinated . Report of the Admissions and Marketing Coordinator: Admissions Coordinator Jill Alwine reported that as of the end of the 2nd quarter the facility has 192 residents , 156 in skilled nursing and 35 in personal care. There were 31 new admissions up from last quarter which was 14 admissions. Total adm issions to date are 45. There are currently 81 people on the waitlist . The approximate waiting list times for skilled nursing and personal care is 2-4 months and 9-12 months for memory care , due to it being our smallest area . There are 77 vacant beds . Barry Amole inquired about the 77 vacant beds. Jill responded that 3E and 3W remain empty as quarantine units . However, there is an upcoming flooring project that will req uire temporar ily placing residents on those units. Report of the Executive Director, Long Term Care - Travis Davis - DMVA: Speaking on behalf of DAG Maureen Weigl, Executive Director of Long -term Care Travis Davis passed along her thanks to everyone on the Advisory Council for their continued support and ongoing dedication to SEVC . Travis Davis provided an update on the state budget that was recently passed. Pennsylvania's long - term care industry will receive more than $500 million in increased funding , which has been needed for a very long time . The total funding increase for the long -term care industry amounts to more than $515 million for the 2022 -23 fis cal year, including its federal match. Funding will be included to support retention bonuses, professional development, and recruitment efforts for staffing. Staffing continues to be the biggest challenge. There will also be funding for childcare assi stance, which would be a huge benefit for current staff and recruitment efforts. Hopefully , we will be able to offer childcare on site or nearby at a discounted price. We are currently conducting surveys to assess the need. SEVC has the largest interest among all the homes. Pennsylvania will raise its Medicaid reimbursement rate by 17.5% for the state's nursing homes, translating to an increase of around $35 per resident per day. This is the first increase since 2014. In our state veteran homes about one third of the payer source comes from Medicaid. The community sector relies heavily on Medicaid , they are very dependent upon the Medicaid daily rates. Advisory Council Meeting July 14, 2022 Page 3 of 6 Last year the PA Department of Health proposed a staffing minimum increase . The changes would increase the minimum number of direct care hours for residents from 2.7 to 4.1 hours per day, which is closer aligned with Medicare recommendations. This would have resulted in an increase of 300 additional RN, LPN, CNA positions. They have come to a com promise , which is at the Governor's level for approval. Most likely it will be 2.87 % and 3.2 % going forward . This would be 140 new nursing positions. We are confident that those levels will be met. This is expected to take effect July 1, 2023. However, with the federal government nursing home reform act this could all change. If the federal government raises the federal minimum staffing requirements for facilities, then all states will be required to follow the rule. An announcement is expected next ye ar. The statewide recruitment campaign is ongoing. We are currently experienc ing some difficulties since the state has centralized the hiring process. There is a huge delay when posting open positions. Previously, it was taking approximately 60 -90 days to onboard new employees. Unfortunately, now it takes 2 months just to post an open position. This is a statewide issue, and they are working on fixing this issue in Harrisburg. However, thi s is really hurting our big push to hire staff. Other construction projects throughout the homes include : The e xpansion project in Erie to the dining and therapy areas is wrapping up. Hollidaysburg Veteran Home will be breaking ground on a new 200 bed skilled nursing facility next year to replace old infrastructure. Robert Richardson asked for an update regarding the hiring of Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners at SEVC. Barb stated the positions are authorized. The recruitment for these positions has been a challenge, due to salary, experience, candidates not interested in all call time, etc. John Getz asked for clarification regarding th e delay in hiring and posting jobs. Barb explained that all job postings and background checks are handled by the Talent Acquisition Agency at the Office of Administration . This process started April 24th and th ere is a tremendous backlog when posting open positions. When the facility gets a list of applicants , completes interviews and selects a candidate , Talent Acquisition will then conduct the background checks. Human Resources at headquarters is tracking this data . Last quarter , it took an averag e of 67 days to fill an open position. It is most likely much higher this quarter. It is not just affecting DMVA but all state agencies. Report of the Director of Veterans' Homes - Barbara Raymond - DMVA : Barb provided an update on the COVID status at all six homes: Currently, w e have one positive resident throughout our homes . We are routinely conducting testing throughout the homes, so this number will most like ly change. We have had 12 overall deaths since January 1st among all the homes; none had COVID listed as the primary cause of death. Currently, we have nine staff positive with C ovid throughout the six homes. Which is also a significantly low number and expected to increase . Recently 5 of the 6 homes experienced an outbreak over the spring season. It took about 2 -4 weeks to clear out of the outbreaks simply because of testing. A vaccine update was provided. The homes are 100% compliant with the federal mandate for vaccines. Everyone is vaccinated or has an ADA or religious accommodation. Advisory Council Meeting July 14, 2022 Page 4 of 6 We are preparing for phase three of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulations. Phase three was implemented in 2019 however it was not being u sed by surveyors yet. We are just preparing the homes on updated regulations. Currently the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid 5 -star rankings for all six homes are as follow s: Gino Merli, Hollidaysburg, Southeast and Southwest have three stars . These rating s are based on health inspections and the number of deficiencies. Delaware Valley and Soldier and Sailors have a 5-star rating. Reporting on the surveys at the homes , Southwestern Veterans' Home is currently having their annual DOH survey, as of now there are no major concerns. The survey team will exit tomorrow. Delaware Valley Veterans' Home and Hollidaysburg Veterans' Home recently had VA surveys. Preliminary results were minor concerns that the facilities are already correcting. Updat e on s taffing across the homes : We are soon to have a vacancy in the Director of Nursing role at our Erie home . Lauren Stenson is the new Director of Nursing at SEVC. A commandant has been selected for Gene Merli . Barb concluded her report and there were no questions from the Council . Report of the Commandant - Brian Gula - SEVC: Brian welcomed everyone and provided a staffin g update. Please welcome Lauren Stenson in her new role of Director of Nursing . We are very excited to announce that Lauren has been promoted to the permanent role of the Director of Nursing at SEVC. Lauren started her career path with SEVC as a RN Instructor, then moved into the ADON role, and was the acting Interim DON for the pas t 4 months. We recently hired a new Medical Director, Dr. Monika VanSant. She comes to us with 18 years of long -term care experience, and she has had her own practice since 2009. We are very excited to have her on board at SEVC. Survey update: SEVC is currently in our window for our Annual Department of Health Survey. We are expecting them within the next few weeks. We did have a DOH complaint survey last week to review 3 complaints received. The DOH review determined there were no deficient practi ces found and all policy and procedures were followed. The complaints were unsubstantiated. The Activities staff are doing a phenomenal job. We had a very successful Veterans Homes Week, with an abundance of great outdoor activities including a petting zoo, Rita's water ice and a carnival with games, refreshments and dunk tank . We had a n incredible 4th of July celebration. Major Benedict fro m the PA National Guard provided an elaborate firework display that residents, staff and families all enjoyed. SEVC Vo lunteer Department is also doing great things. A new program ou r Volunteer Coordinator has implemented is a s ummer high school voluntee r program . High school students volunteer and gain knowledge and experience on various career paths in long -term care. Several students have already completed the program and have achieved enough hours to receive the Presidential Youth Service Award . Regarding compliance at SEVC, the B ureau of Veterans Homes Compliance Team conducted a skilled nursing facility performance assessment, which is a mock survey. The team go through everything the Department of Health would review during a nursing home survey. It is another set of eyes to ensure Advisory Council Meeting July 14, 2022 Page 5 of 6 compliance. The team is scheduled to come back to conduct another assessment on the Personal Care Unit, since PC unit follows different regulations. Report of the Deputy Commandant - Mildred Butler -Coleman - SEVC: Mildred provided SEVC construction updates, noting there were major su pply chain issues for the past 12 months. This interruption caused many projects to be delayed. Budgeted projects from last year are now finally underway. Our nurse call bell system is being upgraded since we can no longer get parts to fix the older system if it would break. Both Coates Hall and CLC will get new call bell systems that will be computerized with state - of-the-art technology. This will allow us to run reports to check call bell response times and gives us the ability to do investigations into quality of service and quality of care for the residents. Symtec will be providing the computer software and Aid bell will be providing the electronic equ ipment. The HVAC System is being updated to separate the air and hot water systems. The two systems were integrated. The new system will separate the hot water from the heating/cooling system. Phase 1 included installing heating pumps. The project is wrapping up and the air conditioning system is keeping up with the summer temperatures. Our new flooring project is scheduled to start in August. All the carpet in the resident's rooms and the lobby in the CLC building are going to be replaced with vinyl flooring for infection control purposes. The carpet does not hold up well against cleaners and disinfectants and the vinyl flooring will be easier to clean and maintain. All the residents will have to be moved to Coates Hall one floor at a tim e while the work is being done. We anticipate the project to begin around August 22nd and room changes to begin on or around August 9th. The contractors will complete the work in phases therefore room changes will occur according to a schedule. Work should be completed in October. Families and regulatory agencies have been notified. This will be a big project and require all departments to work together to ensure that it runs smoothly but will be worth it. Robert Richardson inquired about resident saf ety regarding the flooring. Mildred explained the vinyl floors will be textured to minimize resident falls. Barb added that all the homes are moving away from carpet due to infection control issues a s well as cleanliness issues. The homes are not seein g an increase in falls. Residents tend to shuffle so the vinyl flooring is a better option. Brian added an update regarding the Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners (CRNP) positions at SEVC. SEVC is moving toward hiring our own physicians and CRNP's. Those services are currently contracted out through Suburban Geriatrics. Dr. VanSant our new Medical Director is a n SEVC employee . We are working to recruit CRNP's , however it has been a challenge, however , Suburban Geriatric s will continue support our facility until our medical team is established. Comments from the Council: Barry Amole reminded members to please have your organizations submit reappointment recommendation in a timely manner. A copy of the Advisory Council member listing with appointment status is included in you r packet. Advisory Council Meeting July 14, 2022 Page 6 of 6 Mary Archey asked for an update regarding the Adult Day Health Care and if they are looking into using the space for childcare services. Travis stated that construction is complete. DMVA is reassessing the need for adult day health care at all the homes. Meeting s are being conducted with the Federal VA along with the Departm ent of Aging County Directors , since they are a large re ferral source for adult day care services. We still have plans to move forward. However, the priority at SEVC is ensuring our staffing levels are sufficient for our current operations. The adult d ay health care program is still on the table, but we do not have a definitive timeline. Travis stated that the primary focus is still on adult day care, but while waiting on the legislation to get passed they are looking into what other ways the space ca n be used. One thing being considered , is using the space to provide childcare for staff. It is being reported that three major benefits that employees are looking for from their jobs are flexible scheduling, help with childcare, and help with transportati on. This could also help attract potential employees to the facility. We have the space at SEVC although slight modifications would have to be made to meet code for childcare services. John Getz commented on the Christmas Holiday and added that VFW Di strict 9 is here to take care of the veterans. He voiced his concern regarding providing gifts for the holidays. Mildred will follow up with the Volunteer Coordinator. Old Business : Nothing to Report. New Business: Nothing to Report.

Vice President - unanimous nominations and election of Mary Archey to serve as Vice President. Secretary - unanimous nominations and election of Ken Schweitzer to serve as Secretary.

In so doing, t he Commission was required by law to apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant with annual income of $75,000 or less has a need for the exemption. Section 8904 of 51 Pa.C.S. further provides that, beginning on January 1, 2009, the Commission will a djust the annual income level qualifying for the rebuttable presumption in an amount equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding two years. Adjustments were made to the annual income level that became effective on January 1, 2009, 201 1, 2013, 2015 , 2017 , 2019 , and 2021 . During the two-year period from November 1, 20 20, until October 31, 20 22, the Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers/Seasonally Adjusted) increased by a total of 13.4 percent . Accordingly, beginning January 1, 20 23, the Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant for the Disabled Veterans ' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program with an annual income of $ 108,046 or less may have a need for the exemption. Applicants whose annual income exceed s $108,046 may attempt to rebut the presumption that they do not need the exemption by submitting expense documentation that they believe demonstrates their need. In applying the $ 108,046 presumptive income level, the Office of Veterans Affairs will use the following approach when determining the effective date of the exemption: Applications pending on December 31, 20 22, which are determined to demonstrate need based on eligibility criteria applicable on or before that date, shall be effective based on the date of application in accordance as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25 (relating to effective date of exemption). Applications pending on December 31, 20 22, which did not demonstrate need when applying the prior annual rebuttable presumption income level , but which are eligible under the revised income level applicable on January 1, 20 23, shall be effective as of January 1, 20 23, unless the presumption is rebutted. Applications filed with county boards for the assessment and revision of taxes , or similar board s for the assessment of taxes, on or after January 1, 20 23, shall be effective based on the date of application as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25. Applicants who were denied certificates of need prior to January 1, 20 23, but who believe t hey qualify after that date, may reapply with the effective date based on the date of the new application as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25. MARK J. SCHINDLER Major General, PAA RNG The Adjutant General PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY AND VETERANS AFFAIRS [ 43 PA. CODE CH . 5 ] Bureau for Veterans' Affairs The Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (Department ) and the State Veterans' Commission (Commission) , under the general authority in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 701 (relating to overall powers of department ) and the specific authority in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1704 (7), 7701 (b), 7702(b) , and 8904(1) propose to amend Chapter 5 (relating to Bureau for Veterans' Affairs ) to read as set forth in Annex A. Purpose of this Proposed Rulemaking This proposed rulemaking is to update the procedures for application, adjudication, appeal, and administration of veterans ' benefit programs administered by the Department and Commission . Explanation Chapter 5 is proposed to be amended to provide clear and consistent procedures for the application, adjudication, appeal, and administration of all veterans' benefit programs administered by the Department and Commission . The proposed amendments are necessary for several reasons. Chapter 5 was last amended in 199 1. Amendments to the rules in Chapter 5 are required because of amendments to certain underlying authorities and organizational changes within the Depar tment since 1991 . The proposed amendments update, as necessary, and clarify definitions and procedu res, as well as promote cross -programmatic consistency in application , adjudication , appeal , and administration procedures . Act 12 of 1996 redesignated th e Department of Military Affairs as the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and prompted several organizational changes within the Department . The Bureau for Veterans' Affairs was reorganized as the Office of Veterans Affairs with two subordinate b ureaus : the Bureau of Veterans Homes and the Bureau of Veterans Programs, Initiatives, Reintegration, and Outreach. A change to the title of Part 1 is therefore proposed to reflect the current name of the Department, \"Department of Military and Veterans Affairs,\" and Chapter 5 is proposed to be amended from \"Bureau for Veterans' Affairs\" to \"State Veterans' Programs\" to better reflect the conte nt of the chapter . Subchapter A . Veterans' Emergency Assistance Program Amendments are required in Subchapter A, Veterans' Emergency Assistance Program, because this program no longer exists in the same name and form. Act 109 of 2016 amended 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85 by changing the title from \"Veterans' Emergency Assistance \" to \"Veterans' Temporary Assistance. \" The title of Subchapter A is therefore proposed to be changed from \"Veterans' Emergency Assistance Program \" to \"Veterans' Temporary Assistance Program.\" Act 109 of 2016 also substantially amend ed the program's definitions , eligibility requirements, and provisions on assistance. The statutory amendments were addressed in a document entitled Program Guidelines f or Veterans Temporary Assistance, published at 46 Pa.B. 109 on January 2, 2016, however the outdated rules at Subchapter A were left in place. These amendments propose to bring Subchapter A into conformity with 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85. On promulgation of the ame nded rules, the Department will discontinue use of the document titled Program Guidelines for Veterans Temporary Assistance. Section 5.1 . Proposed amendments to \u00a7 5.1 , Definitions, are intended to address legislative changes since the original promulgation and to cure minor inconsistencies in restated statutory definitions by proposing conforming language that directs back to relevant definitions in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8501. A proposed chan ge to the definition of \"Armed Forces of the United States\" creates clarity by specifically including other individuals, agencies, and organizations beyond the military services whose service has been deemed \"active military service\" with respect to federa l law and regulations administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Changes to the definitions of \"Bureau\" and \"Department\" are proposed to reflect the organizational changes made in 1996. The current definitions of \"military or naval s ervice of the United States\" and \"women's organization officially -connected with the military or naval forces\" are proposed to be removed and replaced by a single definition of \"Armed Forces of the United States\" as discussed above. The definition of \" sudden or unexpected loss of income or other source of support\" is proposed to be replaced with a definition of \"need for temporary assistance\" which conforms to the definition provided at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8501, and a definition of \"surviving dependents\" is propos ed to be added, also conforming to the definition at \u00a7 8501. Lastly, five definitions, \"peacetime hostile fire,\" \"surviving children of an eligible veteran,\" of eligible veteran,\" \"terrorist attack,\" and \"war or armed conflict,\" are p roposed to be removed because they are no longer relevant as a result of amendments made to the statutory definitions and eligibility requirements by Act 109 of 2016 . Section 5.2 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Amounts of emergency assistance\" to \"Application procedures\" to create a more logical flow in the regulatory structure. Application procedures in the current regulation are found at \u00a7 5.4. The proposed application procedure s do not differ substantively from procedures in the current \u00a7 5.4. Proposed subsection (a) eliminates reference to a specific form, a standard practice in rulemaking, and updates the sources of application forms and assistance. Subsection (b) addresses co mpletion and execution of form, including a provision allowing the spouse, legal guardian, or person exercising general power of attorney to sign the application if the veteran is unable due to a medical condition. Subsection (c) adds clarity by proposing a comprehensive list of required supporting documentation aligned with the statutory eligibility requirements. Proposed subsection (d) highlights an Authorization for Release of Information on the application form and the use and limits on use of informati on gathered under the authorization, and proposed subsection (e) points applicants to mail and fax information on the application form for proper submission . Lastly, proposed subsection (f) provid es a simple procedure for withdrawal of application that doe s not currently exist. Section 5.3 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Domicile\" to \" Adjudication procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication. Domicile, or the residency requirement, meanwhile, is sufficiently addressed in the proposed subsection on supporting documentation at \u00a7 5.2 (c), above . Adjudication procedures in the current subchapter are briefly discussed at \u00a7 5.5 (relating to r eview of applications ). The proposed amendments offer more detailed adjudication procedures . Proposed subsection (a) describes the general determination of need. Proposed subsection (b) announc es maximum amount s and limits on assistance, all consistent with the Program Guidelines on Veterans Temporary Assistance established in 2016 . And, proposed subsection (c) addresses notification of determination, including important new provisions for corre spondence with and payment to homeless veterans. Section 5.4 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Application procedures \" to \" Appeal procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal. The application procedures meanwhile are shifted to proposed \u00a7 5.2, as discussed above. The proposed appeal procedures are substantially the same as the current appeal procedures which conform to 1 Pa. Code Part II (relating to general rules of administrative practice and procedure ). The only significant proposed change to the appeal procedures is an extension of the timeline for requesting reconsideration from ten (10) days to 30 days. This change is consistent with requests for reconsideration across programs and is intended to allow applicants more time to gather supplemental information relevant to the request. Section 5.5 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Review of applications \" to \"Administration of temporary assistance \" to complete a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal and finally to administration of the program. Proposed subsection (a) outlines the organization and responsibilities of a F und Committee, previously established in the Program Guidelines for Veterans Temporary Assistance , to assist with the administration of temporary assistance. The organization and responsibilities of the Fund Committee do not differ from those published in the Program Guidelines and in use at the Department since 2016. Subsection (b) notices the Adjutant General's a uthority to adjust adjudication guidelines and maximum amounts of assistance according to the amount of funds available for temporary assistance in the Veterans Trust Fund at any given time . And, s ubsection (c) proposes the addition of critical language noticing and reinforcing the Department's focus on safeguarding the personal information of veteran applicants with which it is entrusted. Secti ons 5.6-5.7. These sections are proposed to be removed and reserved. Section 5.6 (relating to renewal of payment ) addresse s a recurring payment function in the previous Veterans' Emergency Assistance Program which no longer exists in Veterans' Temporary Assistance. Section 5.7 (relating to reconsideration and appeals ) is shifted and addressed in proposed \u00a7 5.4, as discussed above . Subchapter B . Educational Gratuity Program Amendments are required in Subchapter B, Educational Gratuity Program, to provide essential information in the application and adjudication procedures not provided in the current rule, to address organi zational changes within the Department, and to create consistency in the regulatory structure across programs. Section 5.11 . Prop osed a mendments to \u00a7 5.11, regarding d efinitions, are intended to cure minor inconsistencies with restated statutory definitions by proposing conforming language that directs back to relevant definitions in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8701. The definitions of \"Bureau\" and \"Department\" are proposed to be changed to reflect the organizational changes made in 1996. The lengthy definition of \"eligible disabled or deceased veteran\" is proposed to conform simply to the definition at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a78701, and the definition of \"gratuity\" is proposed to now refer to the definition of eligible disabled or deceased veteran. A prop osed change to the definition of \"military or naval service of the United States\" adds the Space Force and National Guard, and creates clarity by specifically including other individuals, agencies, and organizations beyond the military services whose servi ce has been deemed \"active military service\" with respect to federal law and regulations administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. T he definition of \"war or armed conflict\" currently attempts to describe the United States Department of Veterans Affairs' definition of \"periods of war\" at 38 CFR \u00a7 3.2. As this definition has changed since the original promulgation of Subchapter B in 1991 (including addition of the Persian Gulf War period and a recent amendment to the Vietnam Era period ), conforming language is proposed here as well , directing back to the federal regulation . Lastly, minor changes to the defin itions of \"peacetime hostile fire\" and \"terrorist attack\" are proposed to better describe their relation to the defined periods of war or armed conflict . Section 5.12 . This section is proposed to be amended from \"Purpose\" to \"Application procedures\" to creat e a more logical flow in the regulatory structure and consistency across programs . Application procedures in the current regulation are found at \u00a7 5.14, Procedure. The proposed application procedures do not differ substantively from procedures in the curre nt \u00a7 5.14. The proposed procedures do however update the sources of application forms and assistance at subsection (a). Proposed subsection (b) addresses completion and execution of the form. Proposed subsection (c) adds clarity by proposing a comprehensive list of required supporting documentation aligned with the statutory eligibility requirements. Proposed subsection (d) adds language highlighting the authorization for release of information (VA Form 3288) and the use and limits on use of information gathered under the authorization . Proposed subsection (e) points applicants to mail and fax information on the application form for proper submission. Proposed subsection (f), regarding dual application, address es students attending two or more educational institutions . Proposed subsection (g), regarding t ransfer application, address es students transferring between educational institutions (currently at \u00a7 5.19) . Proposed subsection (h), regarding n o subsequent application, describ es the Bureau's responsibility to coordinate subsequent evaluation and payment directly with the educational institutions . And, proposed subsection (i) provides a simple procedure that do es not currently exist for withdrawing application. Section 5. 13. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Certification of service \" to \"Adjudication procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication. Current adjudication procedures are split between \u00a7 5.15, Review and approva l, and \u00a7 5.17, Determining financial need, and are insufficient in detail. Proposed subsection (a), regarding d etermination of eligibility , describes approved educational institutions and proposes rules on full -time attendance at an approved educational in stitution which are necessary for objective adjudication but are not addressed in the current rule. Proposed subsection (b), regarding determination of financial need , does not substantively differ from the procedures in current \u00a7 5.17, but it creates reasonable annual expense allowances for students residing in off - campus housing , or an alternative allowing students to submit certain off -campus expenses, where educational institutions currently report such expenses as zero. The a llowances are expressly to the benefit of the applicant. Also, in the determination of need, the Bureau has long interpreted award of federal Dependents' Educational Assistance (38 USC Ch. 35) as a precondition to eligibility for the Educational Gratuity. The proposed rule clarifies that award of Chapter 35 benefits is to be included as part of the funds available to defray the cost of attendance but is not a precondition to eligibility. Lastly, where current determinations of financial need rest solely on information provided by the educational institution, the proposed rule makes specific allowance for applicants to rebut that information by submitting additional relevant information in a request for reconsideration. Proposed subsection (c) addresses notif ication of determination and includes a 30 -day timeframe for notification following the receipt of a fully developed application. Section 5.14 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Procedures \" to \" Appeal procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal. The application procedures meanwhile are shifted to proposed \u00a7 5. 12, as discussed above. The proposed appeal procedures are substantially the same as the current appeal procedures which conform to 1 Pa. Code Part II (relating to general rules of administrative practice and procedure). The only significant proposed change to the appeal procedures , at subsection (c), is the use of a hearing officer provided by the Commonwealth in place of the appointment of a Commission member to act as presiding officer . This proposal creates consistency with appeal procedures in all other Chapter 5 programs . Section 5. 15. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Review and approval \" to \"Administrat ion of educational gratuity \" to complete the logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal and finally to administration of the program. Subsection (a) , regarding payment, addresses the payment procedures currently outline d in \u00a7 5.18 and adds a provision for the equal division of a gratuity payment between two educational institutions when a student submits dual applications as discussed in proposed \u00a7 5.13(c). Subsection ( b) proposes the addition of a critical section noticing and reinforcing the Department's focus on safeguarding the personal information of veteran applicants with which it is entrusted. Sections 5.16-5.20. These sections are proposed to be removed and reserved. Section 5. 16 (relating to elig ibility criteria) is a restatement of the statutory eligibility criteria which is superfluous and unnecessary to the proposed rule . Section 5. 17 (relating to determining financial need) is proposed to be folded into \u00a7 5.13, Adjudication procedures, as disc ussed above. Section 5.18 (relating to payment) is addressed in proposed \u00a7 5.15, Administration of educational gratuity, as discussed above. Section 5.19 (relating to transfer) is addressed in proposed \u00a7 5.12, Application procedures, as discussed above. An d, \u00a7 5.20 (relating to reconsideration and appeal s) is shifted and addressed in proposed \u00a7 5.4, as discussed above. Subchapter C . Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program Amendments are required in Subchapter C, Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program, to address amendments to the Act since promulgation of the current rule, to provide essential information in the application, adjudication, appeal, and admini stration procedures not provided in the current rule, to address organizational changes within the Department, and to create consistency in the regulatory structure across programs. Section 5.22 . There are significant proposed amendments to \u00a7 5.22, Defi nitions, intended to refine and clarify critical programmatic definitions to mitigate the possibility of arbitrary decision -making while potentially broadening access to the exemption, a goal endorsed by legislators on the House and Senate Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committees, the State Veterans' Commission, and the Department. Where no definition of \"Armed Forces of the United States\" exists in the current rule, a definition is proposed to provide consistency between programs and to cr eate clarity by specifically including other individuals, agencies, and organizations beyond the military services whose service has been deemed \"active military service\" with respect to federal law and regulations administered by the United States Departm ent of Veterans Affairs. Whereas the definition of \"blind\" is clear in the Act, it is also incomplete in the sense that adjudication of the disability relies on ratings provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs which are grounded in 3 8 CFR Ch. 1, Pt. 4 (relating to schedule for rating disabilities). The definition in the Act addresses visual acuity, however the federal schedule for rating disabilities evaluates visual disabilities based on impairments to visual acuity , visual field, and muscle function . (See, 38 CFR \u00a7 4.75.) It is not always apparent to adjudicators what type of impairment actually underlies the disability rating. For this reason, the proposed definition of \"blindness\" is reasonably expanded to account for other impairm ents. This more complete definition is necessary to objectively adjudicate an application for exemption based on blindness. Importantly, the proposed definition is also consistent with the definition of \"blind veteran\" used in the Blind Veterans' Pension P rogram at 43 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.31. The current definitions of \"cost of living allowance\" and \"dependents' allowance\" are proposed to be combined into a single \"cost -of-living allowance.\" While the allowances are currently defined, the basis and amounts of th e allowances were never promulgated or published. The proposed definition provides a rational basis for the allowance in the federal government's Maximum Thrifty Food Plan and the Consumer Expenditure Survey, it is scalable to the number of qualified depen dents, and will be adjusted for inflation every two years. The current definition of \"income\" is proposed to be changed from \"income from whatever source derived...\" to \"gross reportable annual income... ,\" followed by a comprehensive list of specific report able sources of income. The proposed definition cures a challenge posed to many applicants by patently exempting distributions from individual retirement accounts which are transferred or rolled over into other eligible accounts within 60 days of the date of distribution as well as qualified disaster distributions which are repaid within the year . Most significantly, the Commission agreed on the exclusion of veterans' benefits from the assessment of income in a unanimous vote on October 8, 2021. Income from federal and state veterans' benefit programs, as well as Combat Related Special Compensation from the military services , which is also non- reportable, are therefore also patently excluded in the proposed definition. \"Loss of two or more limbs,\" another disability creating statutory eligibility in the Act, is not defined in the Act and has never been defined in statute or regulation. As with the definition of blindness, adjudicators must rely on disability ratings reported by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. In the federal schedule for rating disabilities at 38 CFR Ch. 1, Pt. 4 , a rating that equates to \"loss of two or more limbs\" can result from either the physical loss of limbs or the loss of function in limbs. Because of the rating str ucture , adjudicators often have no way to determine whether a disability rating is awarded because of physical loss (i.e., amputation ) or loss of function (i.e., paralysis or neuralgia). Therefore, the proposed definition accounts for variations of impairment in the federal rating schedule and, importantly again, aligns with the definition of \"amputee and paralyzed veteran\" in the Amputee and Paralyzed Vete rans' Pension Program at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7702(c). This proposed definition is necessary to objectively adjudicate applications for the exemption based on loss of two or more limbs. The proposed definition of \"monthly household expenses\" provides clarity by including a comprehensive list of the acceptable expenses for necessities of life associated with the principal dwelling. A comprehensive list is necessary to eliminate ambiguity and allow for an objective assessment of financial need for the exemption. The definition of \"monthly income\" is proposed to be clarified by changing it to \"monthly household income\" and replacing the ambiguous language \"Income received by the claimant and other persons...\" with \"Income received by the applicant and qualifying de pendents...\" with a separate proposed definition of \"qualifying dependent.\" \"Paraplegia,\" another disability creating statutory eligibility, is defined in the Act. However, again, adjudicators rely on disability ratings reported by the United States Depar tment of Veterans Affairs, and the federal schedule for rating disabilities at 38 CFR Ch. 1, Pt. 4 offers no specific rating for paraplegia. The bilateral paralysis of the upper or lower extremities of the body (as defined in the Act) is rated as a complet e loss of use in the federal schedule. The complete loss of use of both lower or both upper limbs will result in a permanent and total disability rating, which will therefore create eligibility under that broader construct, but it is critical to create ali gnment between the definition in the Act and the federal schedule for rating disabilities to eliminate potential confusion and dispute. A definition of \"presumptive income level\" is proposed to better describe the function of the statutory presumption i n the determination of need. A definition of \"principal dwelling\" is proposed to clarify the term as used in the Act with respect to eligibility. Importantly, the proposed definition incorporates standing legal guidance from the Department that there ar e no restrictions on the size of the property with respect to the exemption. A definition of \"qualifying dependent\" is proposed to define the applicant's dependents whose income and expense information is relevant to the determination need. The definiti on also allows for the proper tallying of dependents in the cost -of-living expense allowance. Section 5.23 . This section is proposed to be amended from \"Eligibility criteria\" to \"Application procedures\" to create a more logical flow in the regulatory st ructure and consistency across programs. Application procedures in the current regulation are generally found at \u00a7 5.24, Processing applications. Since promulgation of the current rule in 1991, multiple processes have been combined into a single multi -purpose form to replace separate application forms for eligibility, financial need, surviving spouses, and the five -year review of need, all addressed in current \u00a7 5.24. Proposed subsection (a) eliminates reference to a specific form (a standard practice in ru lemaking), but it is important to note that only one application form now exists for the program, and we are proposing changes to that application to better reflect the amended rules as well. The balance of the proposed application procedures does not diff er substantially from procedures in the current \u00a7 5.24. Proposed subsection (a) updates the sources of application forms and assistance, and subsection (b) addresses completion and execution of the form. Proposed s ubsection (c) adds clarity by offering a comprehensive list of required supporting documentation aligned with eligibility requirements in the Act. Proposed subsection (d) highlights an Authorization for Release of Information on the application form and the use and limits on use of information gat hered under the authorization, and proposed subsection (e) requires that applications be submitted to the county office of property assessment through the county office of veterans affairs so the application can be stamped to show the date of receipt. This is largely consistent with the current rule at \u00a7 5.24(b) but the submission process, as practiced in virtually all counties, includes a check on the application by the county office of veterans affairs before delivery to the office of property assessment. The proposed rule simply reinforces that existing step in the process. There is also no longer a requirement to notarize the application form as required at \u00a7 5.24(c); verification of eligibility by an accredited veterans services officer at the county of fice of veterans affairs replaced the notarization step in the current application form. Lastly, the proposed amendments add a subsection (f) providing a simple procedure for withdrawal of application that does not currently exist. Section 5. 24. This se ction is proposed to be amended from \" Processing applications \" to \"Adjudication procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication. Rules for the processing of applications, again, are proposed to be addressed a t \u00a7 5.23. Adjudication procedures in the current subchapter are briefly discussed in \u00a7 5.5 (relating to review of applications). Proposed amendments at subsection (a), Determination of eligibility, are intended to provide clarity for applicants and guidanc e for county boards for the assessment and revision of taxes, or similar boards, on the adjudication of eligibility, as is their duty consistent with 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8903 (relating to duty of board). This guidance does not exist in the current rule. This prop osed subsection also explains the burden of proof and weighting of evidence for each eligibility requirement in the Act. Proposed subsection (b), Determination of financial need, similarly explains the Commission's duty to determine need at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 89 04. With respect to the determination of need, \u00a7 8904 was amended by Act 161 of 2006 to create a simplified avenue for determining need. This amendment created an annual income level at or below which an applicant shall be presumed to have need, eliminatin g the requirement for a full income - expense assessment. (See, 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8904(1).) When an applicant fails the presumptive need test, the determination can be rebutted by a full income -expense assessment. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) explains the process fo r determining presumed need and relies heavily on the proposed definitions of \"income\" and \"presumptive income level\" already discussed in \u00a7 5.22. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) restates, in the context of the presumption, the full determination of need, relyin g heavily again on the proposed definitions of \"income,\" \"monthly household income,\" discussed in \u00a7 5.22. Proposed subsection (c) provides standards for the certi fication of need required at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a78904(4) (relating to duty of commission). Finally, proposed subsection (d) makes provision for the boards and the Commission to reasonably delegate adjudication and administrative duties to offices with appropriate staff, resources, and expertise: the county offices of property assessment and veterans affairs in the case of the board, and the Bureau of Veterans Programs, Initiatives, Reintegration, and Outreach in the case of the Commission. Both the boards and the C ommission retain their statutory duties to approve eligibility, certify need, and, in the case of the board, grant and administer the tax exemption. Section 5.25 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Effective date of exemption \" to \"Appeal procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal. Discussion of the effective date of exemption meanwhile is shifted to proposed \u00a7 5.26 (relating to administration of the tax exemption). The only si gnificant proposed change to the appeal procedures is the addition at subsection (a) of language directing appeals of determinations on eligibility to the county board for the assessment and revision of taxes, or similar board, as is their duty consistent with 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8903 (relating to duty of board). The proposed appeal procedures at subsection (b) for determinations of financial need made by the Commission are substantially the same as the current procedures at \u00a7 5.27 which conform to 1 Pa. Code Part II (relating to general rules of administrative practice and procedure). Section 5.26 . This section is proposed to be amended from \" Periodic review \" to \"Administration of the tax exemption \" to complete the logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal and finally to administration of the program. Discussion of the periodic review of need is made subordinate to this proposed section, as discussed below. Proposed subsection (a) addresses the effective date of exempti on, largely maintaining the same requirements as found in current \u00a7 5.27 (relating to effective date of exemption). The only significant proposed change is in the amount of time applicants are given to gather relevant documentation after submission of the application. Whereas the current rule allows for a period \"not to exceed 120 days except under extraordinary circumstances,\" the proposed rule shortens it to a period \"not to exceed 60 days except under extraordinary circumstances.\" Short of extraordinary circumstances, it is the experience of the Commission that 60 days is a reasonable amount of time to respond to requests for information. The longer 120 -day timeframe also often carries applications into the next taxing period, creating administrative chal lenges at the county offices of property assessment. Proposed subsection (b) addresses periodic review of need. The current rule on periodic review of need is outdated because of a statutory amendment created by Act 161 of 2006. Section 5.26 of the curr ent rule relates a two -year periodic review found in the former statutory requirement. Act 161 of 2006 amended that requirement by extending the periodic review to once every five years. The proposed rules at subsection (b) reinforce the Bureau's responsib ility for tracking due dates for the periodic review and properly noticing those with exemptions of the need for review. It further directs that the application, adjudication, and appeal procedures remain the same as with a new application and refers to th ose relevant sections in the proposed rule. Subsection (c) proposes a new rule relating to notification of changes, addressing notification procedures for the death of a veteran or surviving spouse in receipt of the tax exemption. Subsection (d) prop oses a new rule, necessary considering the presumption created by Act 161 of 2006 and codified at 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8904(1), regarding adjustments to the presumptive income level based on changes in the Consumer Price Index and their publication in the Pennsylv ania Bulletin every two years. Subsection (e) proposes a new rule on adjustments to the cost -of-living expense allowance defined at proposed \u00a7 5.22. To provide a rational basis for adjustments to the allowance, the proposed rule relies on changes in the Maximum Thrifty Food Plan table and in the mean annual cost of gasoline, other fuels, and motor oil for the Northeast Region in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The Bureau shall adjust the allowance based on changes in these indices and publish them along side adjustments to the presumptive income level in the Pennsylvania Bulletin . Subsection (f) proposes the addition of a critical section noticing and reinforcing the Department's focus on safeguarding the personal information of veteran applicants with which it is entrusted. Section 5.27 . This section regarding reconsideration and appeal is proposed to be removed and reserved. Information on reconsideration and appeal is proposed to be discussed at \u00a7 5.25, above. Subchapter D. Blind Veterans' Pens ion Amendments are required in Subchapter D, Blind Veterans' Pension, to provide essential information in the application , adjudication , and administration procedures not provided in the current rule, to address organizational changes within the Department, and to create consistency in the regulatory structure across programs. The title of the subchapter is proposed to be changed to \"Blind Veterans' Pension Program\" to promote consistency between subchapters in Chapter 5. Section 5. 31. Proposed amendments to \u00a7 5.31, Definitions, cure minor inconsistencies with restated statutory definitions by proposing conforming language that directs back to relevant definitions in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7701. Conforming language is, for example, proposed to replace the current definition of \"blind veteran ,\" and a separate definition of blindness is proposed to better address the way that term is used throughout the subchapter. The re are no changes to the federal disability rating requirements in the proposed definition of \"blindness.\" Changes to the definitions of \"Bureau\" and \"Department\" are proposed to reflect organizational changes. Lastly, the definition of \" military or naval forces of the United States\" adds the Space Force and National Guard, and creates clarity by specifically including other individuals, agencies, and organizations beyond the military services whose service has been deemed \"active military service\" with respect to federal law and regulations administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 5. 32. The title of this section remains \"Application procedures .\" The proposed application procedures do not differ substantively from current procedures. Proposed changes in subsection (a) update the sources of application forms and assistance . One change is proposed in subsection (b) allowing for application by a spou se, legal guardian, or person exercising general power of attorney on behalf of a veteran unable to apply due to medical condition. Proposed changes at subsection (c) add clarity to the short list of required supporting documentation , which is properly aligned with eligibility requirements in the Act . Language highlighting the Authorization for Release of Information on the application form and the use and limits on use of information gathered under the authorization is proposed at subsection (d), while inf ormation on submission of applications in the current subsection (d) is moved to a newly propose d subsection (e), which refer s applicants to the mailing address and fax number provided on the application . Lastly, a proposed subsection (f) provid es a simple procedure that does not currently exist for withdrawing application s. Section 5. 33. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Review of applications \" to \"Adjudication procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication. The proposed amendments do not substantially change the current adjudication or notification of determination procedures, however the langua ge is changed to provide conformity across programs. The most significant proposed change at subsection (b) holds the Bureau to a 30-day adjudication timeframe after receipt of a fully developed application. Section 5. 34. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Appeal \" to \"Appeal procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal. The proposed appeal procedures are substantially the same as the current appeal procedures which conform to 1 Pa. Co de Part II (relating to general rules of administrative practice and procedure). Minor changes to the language are proposed to promote consistency with appeals language in the other subchapters . Section 5. 35. This section is proposed to be amended from \"Reserved \" to \"Administration of pension \" to complete the logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal and finally to administration of the program. Proposed s ubsection (a) addresses the effective date of pension currently at \u00a7 5.36 and clarifies that the pensi on shall not be backdated to the date of award of disability compensation by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Proposed subsection (b) discusses rate and form of payment, including information on electronic funds transfer payments, a stipul ation that the pension may not be made payable to anyone other than an eligible blind veteran, and important new provisions for correspondence with and payment to homeless veterans. Proposed subsection s (c) and (d) provide rules for the notification of cha nges ( i.e., changes of address and contact information) and notification of death of the pensioner, including the potential need for supporting documentation. Proposed subsection (e) provides procedure on reimbursement of debts, typically accrued when the Department is not timely notified of the death of a pensioner. This is a standard process in the Department which is not accounted for in the current rule. Lastly, s ubsection ( f) proposes the addition of a critical section noticing and reinforcing the Depa rtment's focus on safeguarding the personal information of veteran applicants with which it is entrusted. Sections 5. 36. This section is proposed to be removed and reserved. Current s ection 5. 36 (relating to effective date of pension ) is proposed to be included in \u00a7 5.35, Administration of pension , as discussed above. Subchapter E. Paralyzed Veterans' Pension Amendments are required in Subchapter E, Paralyzed Veterans' Pension, to address amendments to the Act since promulgation of the current rule, to provide essential information in the application, adjudication, and administration procedures not provided in the current rule, to address organizational changes within the Department, and to create consistency in the regulatory st ructure across programs. The title of the subchapter is proposed to be changed to \"Amputee and Paralyzed Veterans' Pension Program\" in conformance with amendments passed in Act 180 of 2014 and to promote consistency between subchapters in Chapter 5. Section 5. 41. Proposed amendments to \u00a7 5. 41, Definitions, cure minor inconsistencies with restated statutory definitions by proposing conforming language that directs back to relevant definitions in 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7702. Conforming language is used, for example, in the proposed definition of \" amputee and paralyzed veteran.\" This definition in turn is proposed to replace the definition of \"paralyzed veteran\" which is outdated because of amendments a t \u00a7 7702 created by Act 180 of 2014. Changes to the definitions of \"Bureau\" and \"Department\" are proposed to reflect organizational changes. Act 180 of 2014 changed the eligibility criteria to more closely align with relevant disabilities in the federal schedule for rating disabilities at 38 USC Ch. 1 Pt. 4. The current definition of \"loss of use\" is thus outdated and proposed to be changed to \"loss or permanent and severe or complete paralysis of two or more limbs\" as that term is currently defined in the Act . Lastly, the definition of \" military or naval forces of the United States\" adds the Space Force and National Guard, and creates clarity by specifically including other individuals, agencies, and organizations beyond the military services whose service has been deemed \"active military service\" wit h respect to federal law and regulations administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Current definitions of \"peacetime combat -related action,\" \"terrorist attack,\" and \"war or armed conflict service dates\" are proposed to be removed because requirements in the Act for service during war or armed conflict, including peacetime combat -related actions and terrorist attacks, were removed by Act 109 of 2001. The current definition of \"women's organization officially -connected with the militar y or naval forces\" is proposed to be removed and included in the definition of \"military or naval forces of the United States,\" discussed above. Section 5. 42. This section is proposed to be changed from \"Eligibility\" to \"Application procedures.\" The current language regarding eligibility gives outdated reference to the monthly amount of the pension which is proposed to be removed and addressed more generally in proposed \u00a7 5.45 (relating to administration of pension ). The proposed application procedures do not differ substantively from current procedures at \u00a75.43 . Proposed changes in subsection (a) update the sources of application forms and assistance. One change is proposed in subsection (b) allowing for application by a spouse, legal guardian, or person exercising general power of attorney on behalf of a veteran unable to apply due to medical condition. Proposed changes at subsection (c) add clarity to the short list of required supporting documentation, which is properl y aligned with eligibility requirements in the Act . Language highlighting the Authorization for Release of Information on the application form and the use and limits on use of information gathered under the authorization is proposed at subsection (d) . Information on submission of applications in the is propose d at subsection (e), and a proposed subsection (f) provides a simple procedure that does not currently exist for withdrawing applications. Section 5. 43. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Application \" to \"Adjudication procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication. The proposed amendments do not substantively change the current adjudication or notification of determination procedures, h owever the language is changed to provide conformity across programs. The most significant proposed change at subsection (b) holds the Bureau to a 30 -day adjudication timeframe after receipt of a fully developed application. Section 5. 44. This section i s proposed to be amended from \" Criteria and procedure for determination of peacetime combat -related actions \" to \"Appeal procedures\" to continue a logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal. Because Act 109 of 2001 remov ed the eligibility requirements based on wartime service, peacetime combat -related action, or terrorist attacks, the current section is outdated and is proposed to be removed in its entirety. The proposed appeal procedures are substantially the same as the appeal procedures at current \u00a7 5.46 which conform to 1 Pa. Code Part II (relating to general rules of administrative practice and procedure). Minor changes to the language are proposed to promote consistency with appeals language in the other subchapters . Section 5. 45. This section is proposed to be amended from \" Review of applications \" to \"Administration of pension\" to complete the logical flow in regulatory structure from application to adjudication to appeal and finally to administration of the program. Information in the current \u00a7 5.45 on review of applications is rolled into the pr oposed \u00a7 5.43, regarding adjudication procedures, as discussed above. Proposed subsection (a) addresses the effective date of pension currently at \u00a7 5. 47 and clarifies that the pension will not be backdated to the date of award of disability compensation b y the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Proposed subsection (b) discusses rate and form of payment, including information on electronic funds transfer payments, a stipulation that the pension may not be made payable to anyone other than an elig ible blind veteran, and important new provisions for correspondence with and payment to homeless veterans. Proposed subsections (c) and (d) provide rules for the notification of changes (i.e., changes of address and contact information) and notification of death of the pensioner, including the potential need for supporting documentation. Proposed subsection (e) provides procedure on reimbursement of debts, typically accrued when the Department is not timely notified of the death of a pensioner. This is a standard process in the Department which is not accounted for in the current rule. Lastly, subsection (f) proposes the addition of a critical section noticing and reinforcing the Department's focus on safeguarding the personal information of veteran applican ts with which it is entrusted. Sections 5. 46-5.47. These two section s are proposed to be removed and reserved. Current section 5. 46 (relating to appeals ) is proposed to be addressed at \u00a7 5.44, appeal procedures, as discussed above. And, current \u00a7 5.47 (relating to effective date of pension) is proposed to be included in \u00a7 5.45 , administration of pension, as discussed above. Fiscal Impact Commonwealth . The Department does not expect that this proposed rulemaking will have a fiscal impact on the Department or other Commonwealth agencies. All procedures will be handled by existing Department staff. Political subdivisions . Proposed amendments to Subchapter C, Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program, will potentially create modest increases in the number of real estate tax exemptions and thereby have a fiscal impact on counties, municipalities, and school districts in this Commonwealth. It is impossible to precisely estimate the potential impacts because eligibility for the tax exemption ultimately relies on a combination of multiple variables and the number of applicants who may meet all of the variables is unknowable. While, for example, the Department and Commission may know the number of veterans with 100 percent disability, it is unknown how many of that number own real property or have financial need. For this reason, we can only offer the most aggressive estimate, a ceiling, on the potential fiscal imp act by county. It is believed that the real impact in all counties will be much lower than estimates the Department and Commission are able to provide. At present, while there are 21,885 permanent or totally disabled veterans in the Commonwealth, 16, 418 of them, approximately 75 percent, are receiving the real estate tax exemption. Proposed definitions of \"blind\" and \"loss of two or more limbs,\" additional disabilities made eligible in the constitution and Act, will expand eligibility to certain veterans wi th disabilities rated between 70 -90 percent. There are 35,023 veterans in the Commonwealth with disabilities rated between 70 -90 percent. The Department and Commission have used this number as a ceiling in our estimates of potential fiscal impact. However, this number is a gross exaggeration for the purpose of estimating impact because only a small percentage of those 70 -90 percent disabled veterans will have ratings that meet the precise proposed definitions of \"blind\" or \"loss of two or more limbs.\" Becau se the Department and Commission have proposed to align these definitions with those used in the Blind Veterans' Pension and Amputee and Paralyzed Veterans' Pension programs, the more likely increase will be closer to the number of disabled veterans receiv ing one of those two pensions, currently 2,262 veterans. And many of those pensioners are already receiving the real estate tax exemption as permanent or totally disabled veterans. The Department and Commission are prepared to share and discuss specific, b y-county fiscal impact projections with political subdivisions and the public on request. No proposed amendments to the other subchapters will have a fiscal impact on political subdivisions. Private sector . This proposed rulemaking will not have a fisca l impact on the private sector . General public . This proposed rulemaking will not have a fiscal impact on the general public. Paperwork Requirements Veterans and eligible dependents s eeking state veterans' benefits under Chapter 5 will be required to file application s and supporting documentation with the Department . Additionally, county boards for the assessment and revision of taxes, or similar boards, will be required to administer an eligibility application process for the Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program, as required by 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8903 (relating to duty of board) . The proposed rule makes allowance for delegations of this duty to county offices of property assessment and veterans affairs to leverage the staff, resources, and experience in those offices. Effective Date This proposed rulemaking will become effective upon final -form publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.

(a) [ The veteran or the unmarried surviving spouse shall request the following two forms from the County Director of Veterans' Affairs or the Bureau for Veterans' Affairs, Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania 17003 -5002: ] Determination of eligibility . The Board shall determine eligibility for the tax exemption in accordance with 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8903 (relating to du ty of board), by comparing information from the application form and supporting documentation to eligibility requirements described in the Act and this subchapter. If the Board approves an applicant's eligibility, the application form shall be signed, ackn owledging approval, and forwarded to the Bureau with appropriate supporting documentation for the determination of financial need. If the Board finds that an applicant is ineligible for the tax exemption, the reasons for the determination shall be clearly marked on the application form, signed, and a copy provided to the applicant. No determination of need will be conducted. [ (i) MA-VA 41 (Information Needed by County Tax Assessment Office for Disabled Veterans Property Tax Exemption). (ii) MA-VA 4 0, Veteran only; or MA -VA 40ss, Surviving Spouse only, (Application for Determination of Need for Exemption from Certain Real Property Taxes). ] (1) In accordance with \u00a7 8902(a) of the Act, the applicant must be a resident of the Commonwealth and must occupy as a principal dwelling the property for which the exemption is requested. An applicant's current Pennsylvania driver's license , learner's permit, or identification card showing the address of the dwelling for which tax exempti on is requested shall suffice as proof of residence and principal dwelling barring indications to the contrary. Applicants without a current Pennsylvania driver's license , learner's permit, or identification card, or applicants whose residence or principal dwelling are otherwise in question, must prove residence and principal dwelling to the satisfaction of the Board. (2) The DD Form 214, or equivalent, is best evidence of the veteran's character of discharge and dates of service in the armed forces of t he United States. A benefit summary letter issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs attesting to the veteran's character of discharge and dates of service is also acceptable evidence. (i) Qualifying character of discharge shall be d etermined in accordance with 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 104 (relating to character of discharge). The character of discharge requirement for the tax exemption coincides with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs' character of discharge requirement for disabi lity compensation at 38 CFR \u00a7 3.12 (relating to character of discharge). Thus, qualifying character of discharge for the tax exemption will have already been positively adjudicated for a veteran who has been awarded disability compensation. (ii) Ser vice in a war or armed conflict shall be determined in accordance with 38 CFR \u00a7 3.2 (relating to periods of war). Award of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, a service specific expeditionary medal, or a combat era specific expeditionary medal , as recor ded on the DD Form 214, DD Form 215 (Correction to DD Form 214), or equivalent, is acceptable proof of service in an armed conflict outside codified periods of war. (iii) While there is no specific requirement for active -duty service in the Act, acti ve-duty service is a requirement for the underlying federal disability compensation ratings. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs adjudicates active -duty service in accordance with 38 CFR \u00a7 3.12a (relating to minimum active -duty service requir ement). Therefore, if a veteran is in receipt of disability compensation, the veteran's qualifying active -duty service has already been positively adjudicated. To qualify for a tax exemption, the veteran shall have served at least one day of that qualifyin g period of active -duty service during a period of war. (3) To qualify for the exemption, the veteran must have been rated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, prior to death, for service -connected blindness, loss of two or more limbs, paraplegia, schedular 100 percent permanent disability, or total disability based on individual unemployability, all in accordance with 38 CFR Ch. 1 , Pt. 4 (relating to schedule for rating disabilities). The United States Department of Veterans Affa irs rating code sheet, if available, is best evidence of the veteran's qualifying disability compensation ratings. The most current disability compensation rating decision or benefit summary statement are also acceptable evidence if they clearly address th e disability ratings creating eligibility . Where these documents conflict, the rating code sheet shall govern. (i) Blind ness and loss of two or more limbs may result in a schedular rating of less than 100 percent and still qualify an applicant for t he tax exemption. The definition of \"blindness\" at \u00a7 5.22 coincides with the definition of \"blind veteran\" in the Blind Veterans' Pension program at 43 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.3 1, and the definition of \"loss of two or more limbs\" at \u00a7 5.22 coincides with the defin ition of \"loss or permanent and severe or complete paralysis of two or more limbs\" in the Amputee and Paralyzed Veterans' Pension program at 43 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.4 1. For this reason, eligibility for the tax exemption based on blindness or loss of two or more l imbs may rely on, but shall not depend on, the prior approval of a veteran's application for Blind Veterans' Pension or Amputee and Paralyzed Veterans' Pension. (ii) Paraplegia, as defined at \u00a7 5.22, may be rated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs under various diagnostic codes, but the resulting complete loss of use of both lower or both upper extremities will result in a 100 percent permanent or total disability rating and will thus be qualifying under either construct. (4) In a ccordance with \u00a7 8902(a)(3) of the Act, the officially recorded deed must show property ownership in one of three manners: sole ownership by the veteran, joint ownership by the veteran and spouse, or as an estate by the entireties (between the veteran and spouse). This statutory requirement patently preempts all other manner of property ownership, including ownership by trust and joint ownership by the veteran and anyone other than a spouse. (5) A copy of the official marriage certificate and the vetera n's death certificate, together with attestation on the application form that the spouse remains unmarried, shall suffice as proof of eligibility for surviving spouses. Assertions of common law marriage must be accompanied by notarized statements from two close relatives of the veteran attesting to the fact that the surviving spouse and veteran held themselves out to the community as husband and wife, and resided together continuously beginning on or before January 1, 2005, through the date of the veteran's death. (b) [ MA-VA Form 41 shall be completed and forwarded in three copies to the County Tax Assessment Office for their records. The tax office will retain one copy for their files and return the second and third copies to the veteran showing the date of receipt ] Determination of financial need . The Commission shall determine need for the tax exemption in accordance with 51 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8904 (relating to duty of commission) . (1) Presumed need for the tax exemption is demonstrated when an applican t's annual income is determined to be at or below the current presumptive income level as defined in \u00a7 5.22. (2) When an applicant's annual income is above the presumptive income level, the Commission shall conduct a full determination of need by comp aring the applicant's monthly household expenses, including a cost -of-living expense allowance, to the monthly household income, all as defined in \u00a7 5.22. All monthly household income and monthly household expenses submitted shall be of the same year. Need for the tax exemption is established in this manner when the monthly household expenses exceed the monthly household income. (c) [ The MA -VA Form 40 or MA -VA Form 40ss shall be completed and notarized. Form MA-VA 40, Veteran: The veteran shall attach a copy of Report of Separation. Form MA - VA 40ss Spouse: The applicant shall attach copies of a Veteran's Report of Separation, Veteran's Death Certificate and Marriage Certificate. A receipted copy of MA -VA Form 41 shall be attached to applications listed i n this subsection and mail them to the State Veterans' Commission, Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania 17003 -5002 ] Certification of need . The Commission shall notify applicants of its determination in writing within 90 days of the receipt of a fully developed application. An application is fully developed when all information and supporting documentation needed for adjudication have been submitted or gathered . (1) If financial need is determined, the written notice shall provide certificates of need, as well as important programmatic information, including an explanation of the periodic review of need discussed at \u00a7 5.26(b). It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure certificates of need are presented to the proper county, municipal, and school district taxing authorities. (2) If financial need is not determined, the written notice shall clearly state the reasons and inform the applicant of the reconsideration and appeal procedures specified in \u00a7 5.25(b) . (3) The Commission shall separately certify its determination of an applicant's financial need to the Board in both cases. (d) [ The Commission will determine whether the applicant has financial need for real property tax relief.

In so doing, the Commission was required by l aw to apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant with annual income of $75,000 or less has a need for the exemption. Section 8904 of 51 Pa.C.S. further provides that, beginning on January 1, 2009, the Commission will adjust the annual income level qualifying for the rebuttable presumption in an amount equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding two years. Adjustments were made to the annual income level that became effective on January 1, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021. During the two- year period from November 1, 2020, until October 31, 2022, the Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers/Seasonally Adjusted) increased by a total of 13.4%. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2023, the Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant for the Disabled Veterans' Real Estate Tax Exemption Program with an annual income of $108,046 or less may have a need for the exemption. Applicants whose annual income exceed $108,046 may attempt to rebut the presumption that they do not need the exemption from real estate tax on their principal dwelling by submitting expenditure documentation that they believe demonstrates their need. In applying the $108,046 presumptive income level, the Office of Veterans Affairs will use t he following approach when determining the effective date of the exemption: Applications pending on December 31, 2022, which are determined to demonstrate need based on eligibility criteria applicable on or before that date, shall be effective based on the date of application in accordance as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25 (relating to effective date of exemption). Applications pending on December 31, 2022, which did not demonstrate need when applying the prior annual rebuttable presumption income level, but which are eligible under the revised income level applicable on January 1, 2023, shall be effective as of January 1, 2023, unless the presumption is rebutted. Applications filed with county boards for assessment and revision of taxes or similar boards on or after January 1, 2023, shall be effective based on the date of application as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25. Applicants who were denied certificates of need prior to January 1, 2023, but who believe they qualify after that date, may reapply with the effective date of any exception being based on the date of the new application as provided by 43 Pa.Code \u00a7 5.25 unless the presumption is rebutted.
