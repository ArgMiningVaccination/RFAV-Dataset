At the Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor we know that a complete education doesn't mean sacrificing one subject for another. Instead, each discipline enriches the other. By integrating the arts throughout our curriculum and each day, our students achieve a richer, more complete view of the world. Our students aren't tracked into a narrow range of classes based on their early aptitude. All our students, from grade school through high school, sing, read music and play instruments, as well as study the sciences, world languages, literature and history. In addition to taking art classes that educate the eye as well as the hand, art is incorporated throughout the curriculum, deepening academic lessons. Connections are discovered between subjects, and students find a deeper understanding of the world around them. The result? Our students understand that they are not limited to one category or one discipline; that they all are artists and engineers, scientists and poets, musicians and mathematicians.

The festival, now called the Movement Electronic Music Festival, was created to celebrate De troit's r ole as the birthplace of electronic (or \"techno\") music. People lose themselves in transcendental dance floor moments, listening to samples from church gospel, 70s disco, and completely original mixes. Some who make the annual trek claim that dance music is their church and the place where they can most touch and taste the holy. In recent years, the festival producers have been increasing the numbers of female DJs and artists on the lineup. There are dozens of parties around the city that happen concurrently with the festival, including an annual event that showcases some of the best female talent in the industry. Maggie Derthick is the founder of Girls Gone Vinyl, an annual Detroit dance party that was the first networking event for women in electronic music from around the world. The party has been taking place for 11 years, and thousands of women (and men) have attended GGV events both here in Detroit and across the globe. A few weeks after 2017's Movement, Maggie and I chatted about the history of Girls Gone Vinyl, how things have changed from then to now, and what's in store for the organization. Sara Vos: Maggie, Girls Gone Vinyl is the biggest all-female lineup dance party in Detroit each Memorial Day Weekend, and now you've taken it all over the U.S. and Europe. Can you fill us in on the history and as well as your motivations for getting started? Maggie Derthick: In 2006, I started an electronic music promotion company in Detroit and I was working on producing events. With the advent of social media, which was Myspace back then, I was able to meet women from all over the world based on their tastes in music \u2014 women who were into the same things as me. It was very cool, because we could have an immediate conversation and connection, due to social media.It was early spring, and the Detroit Electronic Music Festival was coming up. All these women were reaching out, asking where they could play and get booked, and they were having a hard time doing it. Because of that, and because I wanted all of these very cool girls to meet, I thought, \"Why don't we just throw a party with all these awesome women who can all play, and all meet, at the party?\" I chose the name Girls Gone Vinyl because the \"Girls Gone Wild\" [adult vacation video] brand was in the news at that time. As a marketer, I knew \"Girls Gone...\" would have some legs to it, because people were hearing such negative things [about \"Girls Gone Wild\"], so my goal was to take that messaging about women \u2014 that women are objects and to be exploited \u2014 and turn it upside down. The party itself was about girls and women who wanted to get into the music business. I wanted to push boundaries with the title of the party. The message I'm trying to get across to young girls and women in the music business is: \"Be who you are.\" It's super frustrating to watch anyone shrink or change themselves to achieve a goal that they want, or to be able to put their art out into the world. How can you truly be an artist if you have to temper yourself? SV: So you called the first party Girls Gone Vinyl back in May 2006. Were people into the title or concept? Where did it go from there? MD: I didn't know where it was going to go, or what it was going to be, but I wanted it to be a place that women from around the world could meet each other and create networks amongst themselves, because it was very hard to get into that boys network. The more you meet people like you \u2014 like attracts like \u2014 the broader your reach can be. So that was always the major goal, to have the event at the festival, and then via the social media connections and meeting each other in person, to grow the network of how many industry women knew each other. I knew so many women who, like myself in Detroit, had been one girl amidst a bunch of guys in electronic music enclaves in New York, San Francisco, Italy, Berlin... so I was trying to connect those girls with each other from around the world, and then give them a platform to play in the Mecca of electronic music, Detroit. I wanted to create a platform for them to play and put their art out in the very place that had inspired them to become artists in the first place. I continued to do the event every year, and grow the amount of women who were meeting and inspiring each other, and they were moving up in their careers.Coffee with Maggie Derthick of Girls Gone Vinyl Detroit's Annual All-Women Party in the Mecca of Techno Music By Sara Vos All these women were reaching out, asking where they could play and get booked [at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival], and they were having a hard time doing it... I thought, \"Why don't we just throw a party with all these awesome women who can all play, and all meet, at the party?\"[When] I chose the name Girls Gone Vinyl...my goal was to take that [Girls Gone Wild] messaging about women \u2014 that women are objects and to be exploited \u2014 and turn it upside down.We all come at it from different angles, and I don't know all the answers, but I definitely think there are two major factors: First, women and men are socialized very differently in Western culture, so women are not taught to go into electronics, as boys are. Second, I also think there are major differences in the ways women and men market and promote themselves. I definitely think that feminine strengths and needs are different than masculine strengths and needs. SV: It sounds like it has been quite the adventure and journey. Thanks so much for taking the time to share with me. What else should readers know? MD: People can follow Girls Gone Vinyl on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. We have many changes underway and people can keep track of what we're up to. Also, we'll throw our annual party next May as part of the Movement Electronic Music Festival. We've been covered by Billboard, Forbes, Red Bull Radio... So I'm ready to capitalize on the broad appeal I have built and push out the discussion even further. I just want it to be a normal thing where all women are on a lineup and not have to call it a \"Girls' Party.\" SV: That's really powerful.MD: Yeah. And it's starting, little by little. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 7GirlsGoneVinySV: How did it shift and evolve?MD: A big reason this became important to me is because I have a daughter. I realized that, as a young girl, when you're only seeing men's names, men on posters, men at events, how does a young girl look up and say, \"I can do this, too\"? Music festival lineups were five percent women at the time. How do young girls even know that they have a possible chance to do it? How do they even know the stories and paths that other women have taken to get into the business? While I was asking these kinds of questions, I happened to meet a woman locally, Jenny Lafemme, who has a film production company. Jenny is a DJ as well. We were talking one night, and we thought, \"Why don't we take this party on the road and film the stories of these women around the world?\" We wanted other women, young and old, to see and hear the stories that led other women here. So that's how the documentary side of it came about, in 2010. We raised $15,000 on [crowd-funding website] Kickstarter and went to five different countries, interviewing over 100 women and five men who are in this business. We filmed over two years, all the while doing GGV events throughout... Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Ibiza, Detroit, Miami, Chicago... We were doing GGV parties all around Europe and North America. Then we still kept the annual Detroit party during the electronic music festival here. Where we are now is that we have hundreds of hours of great footage. We are trying to figure out if we do docu-episodes instead of a full documentary film. Each of the interviews is so amazing that telling each woman's full story seems to be the most exciting. So we're looking at showing cool, edited interviews of each of the women and having a few years of legs for this project. Many different ages and nationalities are included; some are moms, some are booking agents, some are record label owners and not DJs or producers. So there are other ways to get into the business that are showcased in the interviews, even if you're not an artist. We have GGV mixes online and we'll be starting to put new mixes back up on our website this year. The cool thing is that even now, since 2010, there is way more discussion about women in the industry and how to make things more equal. There are more female-centric groups, like Female Pressure, and there's a club in Germany that does a whole month of all-female artists. Smart Bar in Chicago does a month of all-female DJs in February. The conversation has changed, but the music festival bookings have not. It's still 5-10 percent women in lineups. SV: Why do you think the numbers are that low? MD: I still do think it's about the way the booking system works. There are definitely still way more men than women who do create and produce electronic music, but the booking and lineup numbers aren't correctly reflecting how many talented women are in this business.The message I'm trying to get across to young girls and women in the music business is: \"Be who you are.\" How can you truly be an artist if you have to temper yourself? I knew so many women who, like myself in Detroit, had been one girl amidst a bunch of guys in electronic music enclaves in New York, San Francisco, Italy, Berlin... so I was trying to connect those girls with each other from around the world.A big reason this became important to me is because I have a daughter.

Without a permanent address, potential employers arereluctant to hire you. But you can't get a permanent address without ajob. You find a job, and it seems like a pretty good one at first, paying alittle above minimum wage. But the shifts are uneven and the workingconditions are unsafe, and you start getting sick. But with a job, youcan get a housing subsidy, so you need the money. So you keep going towork. Until one day you just can't. Your hours get cut. Then you get fired.And you have to start all over again. As frequently as the law allows, you sell plasma, for around $30 eachtime. You even take iron pills to make sure you're not too anemic \u2014 andbarred from donating. Because that cash makes the difference betweeneating and going hungry. These scenarios are true. They're from $2.00 a Day, Living on Almost Nothing in America (Mariner Books; Reprint edition September 13, 2016) by Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer. The book was named one of the 100 Notable Books of 2015 by theNew York Times Book Review and won the Hillman Prize for Book Journalism, amongother awards. Shaefer is an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. He is also the director of Poverty Solutions, a U-M initiative launched in 2016 that focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of poverty and works with both community groups and students. Shaefer can recite those poverty scenarios by heart. Since the book was published, his life hasn't been the same. \"It was both the hardest thing I've ever done in my work life and the most rewarding,\" says Shaefer, who traveled across the country with Edin to speak with families living in extreme poverty to write the book. \"It was hard to hear these stories, but making connections across those barriers was incredibly important to me,\" he says. \"Meeting those really interesting and loving people enriched my life. We're still in touch with some; we've lost touch with others ... but the ones we showed the book to generally appreciated the opportunity to tell their stories. We told them we would tell them in an honest way. We weren't going to cover anything up, but we would also be respectful and compassionate, and they appreciated that.\" Shaefer, husband to Susie, father to young Bridget and Michael, is soft-spoken and obviously passionate about his cause. He had a slight taste of that life before he began studying it. Born and raised on the outskirts of Ann Arbor, his family was fairly low-income, he says. \"We never had to go to the welfare office; we could go to Grandma and Grandpa,\" he recalls. \"We were never like the people in the book.\" But he remembers when he was in junior high, his father changed careers and for a few years, money was exceptionally tight. His upbringing affected his view of the world, he says. \"From a very early age, I grew up understanding poverty and disadvantage in the U.S. and wanting to do something about it.\"Lending a helping handThat dedication became more focused as he grew older. During his undergraduate years at Oberlin College, he served as a relief caseworker, helping low-income residents negotiate with landlords, and working with the city so water and utilities weren't shut off. He became more involved in advocacy, in helping solve larger issues. While studying at the University of Chicago, where he received his advanced degrees, he became interested in the more structural issues: welfare and social policies. He began teaching as well as studying the incomes of the poor through the Survey of Income and Program Participation, administered through the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2011, he met Edin, a long-time researcher of welfare trends, while they were both teaching at Harvard University. Edin had been doing field work, updating research she'd done a decade prior by interviewing low-income families. She was struck by the fact that so many of them were living on virtually no income, and the lack of cash permeated nearly every aspect of their life. She shared her findings with Shaefer, who found them startling. After all, how could a person live in today's society with essentially no money? He began sifting through available sources of nationally representative data. \"When I met Kathryn and she began telling me about these families that were so deeply, deeply poor and lacked access to cash \u2014 that 's what propelled us forward on this project,\" Shaefer recalls. \"It started as a five-page policy brief, then a magazine article, and then a book.\" Together, their extensive research uncovered surprising statistics: As of 2011, 1.5 million households with roughly 3 million children were surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2.00 per person per day in any given month. Think of it this way: that's about one out of every 25 families with children in America. Poverty is often closer than we think \u2014 it could be affecting coworkers, friends, neighbors. Also, the authors claim, that number has been on the rise since landmark welfare reform legislation was passed in 1996. According to their calculations, as of 2011, the number of families in $2.00-a-day poverty had more than doubled in just a decade and a half. Luke Shaefer, Ann Arbor Co-Author of $2.00 a Day, Shares Insights into the Story Behind his Blockbuster Book By Diane MajeskePhotos by Tobi Hollander $2.00 a Day, Living on Almost Nothing in America, by Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer was named one of the 100 Notable Books of 2015 by the New York Times Book Review and won the Hillman Prize for Book Journalism, among other awards.Shaefer is an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work and the Gerald R.

While families headed by single mothers were most at risk of falling into the demographic, more than a third of the households in $2.00-a-day poverty were headed by a married couple. And nearly half of the $2.00-a-day poor were white. Meeting the disadvantaged The two set up field sites and traveled throughout the country from 2012 to 2014 finding the faces behind the numbers \u2014 in Chicago, Cleveland, the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee, and the Mississippi Delta, historically one of the poorest places in the U.S. Eight of the 18 families they followed are featured in their book and profiled in detail. Shaefer didn't know what he'd find on the journey. He realized afterward, though, he'd held a few preconceived notions. \"I didn't expect to find so many people who really want to work, and who had such a history of work,\" he admits. \"I thought they would be more detached from society ... then I heard story after story, of, you know, 'I was working and then this happened, and this happened...' Working in the office, like I do, with large-scale data, you don't realize the barriers that families face that are part of the system.\"Many of the profiles in the book are unforgettable, like young Tabitha Hicks, who matter-of-factly explained what it was like to sleep with eight siblings in one bed, when there had been no food in the house for days. The researchers asked her what it felt like to be that hungry. \"Well, actually it feels like you want to be dead,\" she told them. \"Because it's peaceful being dead.\" Shaefer's research changed him, he says; even the simplest of moments became profound. He recalled one afternoon in Chicago, when he and his then three-year-old daughter met up with several of the women being profiled and their families. All the children began playing together. The odd juxtaposition hit him \u2014 how the children were so alike, yet their lives were so different. \"That was a time I'll never forget,\" he says. \"They were playing in a park, just kids, but with such very different life trajectories. You know that ... but when you see kids just playing with each other, it makes you wonder why. It was incredibly intense for me. From a research standpoint, you learn things from field work that you just can't learn in your office.\" Since its publication, the book has made quite an impact; both authors have testified in front of House and Senate committees and policy makers continue to debate and discuss solutions. Shaefer candidly admits that not all responses have been favorable.\"We've been incredibly gratified by the reception of the book,\" he says. \"But we did receive criticism from some conservative think tanks that say our data is too flawed to tell us anything. And if that's true, we'd have to throw out our case studies and say that OK, we probably found about half a dozen families in the worst shape in the country.\" He stands by their findings and doesn't mind the critiques. \"We only really started receiving criticism when it was clear the book was making an impact,\" he says. Forging solutions As Shaefer has spoken about the book \u2014 in the community, around the country, to media \u2014 he's found others who are concerned about the growing rift between haves and have-nots in the U.S., particularly as the political climate is changing. It's a difficult situation, he says. The book offers a multi-pronged solution that centers on developing more and better jobs, creating housing opportunities, and designing a social assistance program that could provide a temporary cash cushion in times of crisis. \"I hope our book does something to bring people together,\" Shaefer says. \"Society is segregated by geography and by income. It's hard to make policy decisions when we're so separated like that. I hope people realize that these people are not just numbers. They're not just problems. They're people. They want to do well by their kids. In general, they want to work.

As of 2011, 1.5 million households with roughly 3 million children were surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2.00 per person per day in any given month. That's about one out of every 25 families with children in America.\"I didn't expect to find so many people who really want to work, and who had such a history of work... then I heard story after story, of, you know, 'I was working and then this happened, and this happened.'\" Many of the profiles in the book are unforgettable, like young Tabitha Hicks, who matter-of-factly explained what it was like to sleep with eight siblings in one bed, when there had been no food in the house for days.This is what it's like to be incredibly, desperately poor in America today: You live in a crowded homeless shelter with nothing but spoiled milk in the fridge. Without a permanent address, potentialemployers are reluctant to hire you. But you can't get apermanent address without a job. You find a job, and it seems like a pretty good one at first,paying a little above minimum wage. But the shifts are unevenand the working conditions are unsafe, and you start getting sick.But with a job, you can get a housing subsidy, so you need themoney. So you keep going to work. Until one day you just can't.Your hours get cut. Then you get fired. And you have to start allover again. As frequently as the law allows, you sell plasma, for around $30each time. You even take iron pills to make sure you're not tooanemic \u2014 and barred from donating. Because that cash makesthe difference between eating and going hungry.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 11 \"I have people ask what they can do. There's lots of ways they can help. If they volunteer at a soup kitchen or a kids' program, I tell them, 'Try to make a connection \u2014 don't just be a face behind a desk or behind a table. Get out there, talk to people. Share a little bit, learn a little bit. We'll all be the better for it.'\" Because in the end, it isn't just about money or jobs, Shaefer says. It's far more than that. And that's what the book concludes: \"The ultimate litmus test we endorse for any reform is whether it will serve to integrate the poor \u2014 particularly the $2-a-day-poor \u2014 into society. It is not enough to provide material relief to those experiencing extreme deprivation. We need to craft solutions that can knit these hard-pressed citizens back into the fabric of their communities and their nation.\" ### He recalled one afternoon in Chicago, when he and his then three-year-old daughter met up with several of the women being profiled and their families. All the children began playing together. The odd juxtaposition hit him \u2014 how the children were so alike, yet their lives were so different.

At the root of the word, it simply means \"to be concerned with oneself\" and can also mean to be \"self-interested, self-loving, or self-serving\"\u2014 what is so very wrong with that? Why is caring for oneself and caring for others often implied to be mutually exclusive? We have all heard the analogy of putting on your own mask first before attempting to assist the person next to you in an emergency situation. Another wonderful example of this exists in the human body: for each heartbeat, the heart first pumps blood to itself before sending it out to the rest of the body. In today's society, where busyness and lack of sleep are worn like badges of honor, prioritizing self-care can be portrayed as pass\u00e9 and lead to feelings of guilt, but in this fast-paced world it becomes even more vital to slow down and check in with your mental and physical well-being. In line with this thinking, there is an old Zen proverb that states, \"You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day - unless you're too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.\" Without actively engaging in self-care activities, we are at risk of remaining in a state of chronic stress, which can lead to the development of adrenal fatigue. Your adrenal glands are two thumb-sized organs that sit on top of your kidneys and ar e an integral part of the endocrine system. The adrenals play a vital role in stress response. When faced with an actual or perceived threat, they release adrenaline (i.e. epinephrine) to help you leap into action\u2014referred to as \"fight-or-flight\" mode. Next, they release corticosteroids which function to slow down what are, in that moment of crisis, seen as less vital processes, such as digestion and immune function. They are responsible for cortisol production, and play a role in balancing sex hormones as well as aldosterone (which is important for blood pressure control). From an evolutionary perspective, these adaptations were intended to be a transient response to a dangerous situation, but in this day and age, many of us\u2014in some estimates, up to 80 percent of the population\u2014are in this state chronically, which can have serious short- and long-term implications for our health and well-being. Research has shown that individuals who take time for self-care practices are more creative, successful, and happier. So how do we begin to start moving away from maladaptive behavior and place self-care practices at the top of our priority list instead of leaving them as an after-thought? The journey begins by checking in with your physical and mental health, as well as social relationships and your professional life. Just like any other healthy habit, it can be easiest to integrate them into our routines if we build on other solid habits we have already established. For example, before my 11:00 p.m. bedtime, I will take 15 minutes for stretching and deep-breathing exercises and gratitude journaling. During my lunch break at work I will often take a 15-minute walk outdoors to enjoy the sunshine. What counts as a self-care activity or practice? This is highly personal and individualized. It is really anything that relaxes, restores, and rejuvenates you, and contributes to your overall health and well-being in a positive way. Take some time to examine your schedule as well as your personal needs to begin to determine how to integrate regular acts of self-care into your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly routines. Self-care activities can range in length from a few minutes of deep-breathing to a two-week vacation in Colorado!Daily practices might include: Gratitude journaling Dancing in your living room to your favorite Prince album Meditation (try phone apps such as Headspace, Calm, Meditation Studio, orInsight Timer) Setting your intentions for the day first-thing in the morning Getting a full 7-8 hours of sleep Eating your meals without the distraction of electronic devices Taking a relaxing walk with your pet or coworkers Monthly or weekly practices could include: Grabbing tea or brunch with a good friend Having a picnic at a local park Taking a day-trip to a new city Scheduling a nice massage, pedicure, acupuncture, or facial (to save money,take turns pampering a friend!) Curling up at home and reading a book or your favorite magazines Going out to see live music at a local venue Scheduling 1-2 days per week for meal planning and preparation Going out of town for the weekend (for a cost-effective option, try anAirbnb!) Working with a counselor, nutritionist, or health-coach Making a vision board to help display some of your goals and aspirations To help identify which areas you may need to spend some time developing, take a few minutes to consider the following. Do you: Eat a whole-foods diet rich in colorful fruits and veggies? Spend time in nature? Feel nourished, healthy, and strong? Feel gratitude on a daily basis? Express yourself creatively? Find a sense of meaning and enjoyment in your work? Have the ability to comfortably say no? Get enough social time with people who make you happy? Don't wait until things are in a state of turbulence before realizing you need to reach for the oxygen mask. In order to be fully present, and to effectively engage with and care for the important people in our lives, we must fill our own cups first\u2014you can't pour from an empty cup.

Namaste, Katie... When you take off your backpack, take a moment to do a few shoulder rolls. Inhale, let the shoulders float toward the ears, and on the exhale, draw the shoulder blades together and drop them down the back.The third eye references the Ajna Chakra, or the sixth chakra. When purified energy moves up through the five chakras and reaches the third eye, we are able to witness ourselves and our actions from a removed perspective. If you practice regularly (a few times per month or more), I would invest in a rubber mat. Rubber mats generally cost more than $50, but, in my opinion, they are worth every penny. Photography by Hilary Nichols Namaste, Katie \u2014 I walk ALL over campus with a lot of text books in my backpack, and my shoulders ache every day. Though I have been going to a gentle yoga class, I am struggling to find any postures that I can do when I get to class, or at home, to relieve that tightness on the front of my shoulders. Any pointers? Jesse, Ann ArborDear Jesse,Oh, I remember those days well! In fact, I am living them again with my computer bag. Anything that adds weight on the shoulders can cause tension in the muscles. One common reaction to carrying weight on a consistent basis is to round the shoulders as we lean forward to balance the weight. We hollow out the front of the chest, which shortens the pectoralis muscles and can lead to the tightening of the jaw and neck as a way to attempt to balance the body. When you take off your backpack, take a moment to do a few shoulder rolls. It is important to identify the area of need. Though we often make assumptions that this type of pain or discomfort is stemming from the chest, try to be mindful and aware of where the pain may be truly coming from. Inhale, let the shoulders float toward the ears, and on the exhale, draw the shoulder blades together and drop them down the back. In several yoga poses, we interlace the fingers behind the back while the shoulder blades are grounded. Weaving the fingers together, with the palms facing up (if this is available to you), draws the chest open. Breathe into that space. If you'd like more of a stretch, you can allow the hands to float away from the back. If you are feeling more room to explore, you may couple this with a forward fold, gaining additional openings for the front side of the chest. As mentioned, if bringing the hands together is challenging, try stacking the arms behind the back, with the shoulders moving toward each other. Some days this is enough. Enjoy these moments and allow for length through the shoulders. Namaste, Katie \u2014 Lately, though I recognize this is not a new concept, I have been hearing about the \"third eye\" \u2014 in movies, music, even comic books. I had a friend tell me this is a yoga term which is discussed in her class on a regular basis. Can you elaborate? Dave, SalineDear Dave,I certainly can, and I love, love, love when ancient yogic teachings make their way into our general way of life! It certainly gives people a sense of familiarity when they are in a class that may feel uncomfortable, and suddenly they hear a word or phrase that is recognizable, as you said, from TV, or a book. Anything that allows us to access yogic teachings works for me. The third eye references the Ajna Chakra, or the sixth chakra. These energy centers in the body are all thought to have different properties, and the third eye is thought to be the witnessing self. When purified energy moves up through the five chakras and reaches the third eye, we are able to witness ourselves and our actions from a removed perspective. In many tellings, our actions are merely the playing of a movie, from which we can remove our minds at any time, back to their rightful place of peace. The numerous references to the third eye in pop culture you've noticed are touching upon this spiritual connection beyond the physical body to something greater than ourselves. Namaste, Katie \u2014 I am new to yoga. I have been to a few different classes and tried different types, and think I have found a style that I like. My question is, what do I need? There is so much out there, there are so many clothes, props, and things with the OM symbol on them. I mean, do I need mala beads? Do I need a salt lamp? Do I need socks with grippers on them? Help, please! Holly, Ann ArborDear Holly,You raise a great question. Yes, yoga comes with a wide variety of props and accessories. Some of these I would call essential, and others, I would call optional. One great place to start would be to ask a teacher at your place of practice. Different styles of yoga do rely on some different props, so your teacher would be a good resource. He or she may also inform you about what your studio has available and what would be the most important to purchase for your home practice. Personally, I think a yoga mat is essential. If you practice regularly (a few times per month or more), I would invest in a rubber mat. To find one, you will need to visit a specialty store. Rubber mats generally cost more than $50, but, in my opinion, they are worth every penny. Rubber mats are no-slip, and you can sweat on them, so there is no need for a towel or additional mat cover. They are also long-lasting. I've had mine for seven years, and I practice three times per week on average. Plastic mats, which are available just about everywhere these days, are great in a pinch, and are cost effective. However, they are a bit more challenging to work with. Blocks, straps, blankets, and bolsters are the most commonly used props in more traditional classes. Bolsters are the most expensive item in that grouping, though if you have a steady home practice, you may enjoy having one. Generally, a few stacked blankets can be used in its place, or a couch pillow. For a strap, you can use an old neck tie as a quick substitution. Last word \u2014 for clothes, wear what feels comfortable to you. Find pants that have a stretch so you can move freely. What they look like and have on them is really up to you. As I have said before, and will say again, this is your practice. If you like mala beads to meditate, or because of the way they look, get them, but, at this stage of your journey, they are likely not necessary to further your practice. In the next issue of CW Journal , I'll explain a great meditation chanting breath technique where you only need your hands. Stay tuned!

They try to diminish that respect to what they consider an appropriate level, but the locals will have none of it. Then the couple discovers that, since the locals make and repair every single item they depend upon, the same has been assumed of them \u2014 their radio, watches, phones, kitchen tools. When the couple tries to explain that these items were made by others, and that they had no idea how to repair or recreate them, the locals were unable to comprehend such a world. How many of your own needs can you meet? What needs do you trade for, working your job to make money to trade for items or services? How many of those needs could you meet yourself if you didn't work or worked less? Would you have the skill, the knowledge, the wherewithal to learn how to do what needs to be done for yourself and your family? And if, like most of us, you don't, where could you go to learn those skills? I promised in the previous column to talk about \"deep\" green living, more than just \"green shopping.\" This requires an intimacy with all of the ways our lives touch the world we live in and transforming that relationship. Knowing how to meet our needs ourselves \u2014 if not from our own knowledge, then through others we know \u2014 is part of that transformation. My last column talked about permaculture and introduced the food forest, a landscape structure. Permaculture (think \"permanent\" + \"agriculture\") theory posits eight different types of capital in human civilization. \"Capital\" often conjures images of piles of money, putting a stake down in a financial venture, but I mean a broader definition here. Webster's defines capital as \"wealth, in whatever form, used or capable of being used to produce more wealth.\" Wealth itself is defined as \"abundance,\" \"valuable products,\" and \"well-being.\" The food forest, then, is a compact repository of biological living capital. It produces abundance, contributes to the well-being of the plants, soil, water systems, humans, and animals involved, and is capable of producing more wealth. Craft and experience are another form of capital. Experiential capital combines knowledge (intellectual capital) with people: think community projects or hands-on learning. Learning as you create, gaining skills while working with others, meeting your individual needs while in community all build experiential capital. Encouraging this form of capital is the Michigan Folk School. Small classes on a variety of self-sufficiency topics are the Folk School's curriculum. While skills and projects are the focus of each class, the broader emphasis is on creating a community of artisans. The Michigan Folk School draws inspiration from two models: Driftless Folk School in Wisconsin, which concentrates on agricultural arts and homesteading, and North House Folk School in northern Minnesota, which focuses on cultural crafts of their region. Jason Gold, co-founder of the Michigan Folk School, points out that southeast Michigan has \"a wealthy craft history, and we wanted to bring those cultural crafts to light.\" Jason began the School as an LLC with his wife Julia in 2012. Both educators, suburban born and bred with a strong interest in self-sufficiency, the Golds found themselves in 2011 with a flock of six-year-old chickens that were no longer laying eggs as before. They knew it was time to turn their flock into stock. Neither had ever killed an animal. Jason describes himself as a \"Jewish Buddhist\" and no amount of YouTube videos or books could convince him this was a task to attempt alone. So Jason, Julia, and some friends in the same situation hired a teacher. \"The experience was spiritual,\" recalls Jason. The slaughter was easy, fast, and nothing like the anxiety that he had felt in the days before. Jason left that lesson with the knowledge to process chickens humanely and competently, but beyond that, the community created that day was something he wanted to build upon. Although it hadn't been their intention, the Folk School was born that day. The School strives, in Jason's words, \"to use the knowledge of yesterday and the technology of tomorrow to make a better today.\" After the initial chicken-processing experience, the Golds reached out to other teachers, offering small classes of no more than twelve people in introductory courses on constructing earth ovens, knife sharpening, broom making, blacksmithing, lacto-fermentation, soap making, and how to process roadkill. Today, many courses are offered through Washtenaw Community College's Community Enrichment Program. Eighteen percent of participants come from out-of-state to take Folk School classes, while forty-five percent are county residents. In 2016, the Folk School became a 501(c)3 nonprofit with a Board to Directors because, says Jason, \"We never wanted to own it; we want to leave something for the community.\" Both Golds have full-time employment outside the Folk School, as well as practicing their own crafts: woodworking for Jason, pottery for Julia. Built mostly by word of mouth, the School's long-term goals are to have a permanent campus and the ability to offer longer courses in intermediate and advanced work for interested students. Those goals may soon be realized through the School's new partnership with the Washtenaw Parks and Recreation Department, which owns Staebler Farm County Park, a historic farmstead consisting of 98 acres of agricultural land, buildings, and wetlands. Programs currently in development at the farm will \"follow what the original owner was doing,\" according to Jason, with the property eventually becoming an agricultural resource center. Details are tied to the County's timeline, but Jason has initial plans for a wood shop and a blacksmith shop, to offer school groups \"an encompassing experience of what people were doing 100 years ago.\" This expansion will be a big step for the Folk School and an opportunity for community creation in action: \"We are really looking for help community building and creating the campus,\" said Jason. The School welcomes both skilled and unskilled volunteers to help with tasks ranging from answering phones and greeting guests to painting, building, and repairing. Not only craft and skill are developed in the School's courses. Jason related a story from a recent knife-sharpening course held at Dixboro Church. Because of a website error, they had eighteen students and so Jason was assisting. \"People are bringing knives to sharpen, so you have to be careful,\" he said. \"There was a table with two women in their 70s and 80s wearing blue 'Hillary/Resist' T-shirts, and across from them were a man and his son wearing red 'Make America Great Again' T-shirts. I thought, 'Uh oh, they all have knives, how will this go?' Two hours later, they were the best of friends and traded contact information. [The class] created a bridge, a way to connect with one another above and beyond the politics of the day. To see each other for who we are, Americans.

Her Healing Light Jewelry Collection is also carried by a psychic shop in Livonia. \"I wanted to make a difference in people's lives by giving them a natural healing option, to help heal the negative effects of illnesses, and help attract one's deepest desires for their highest good,\" shared Kinzer about her jewelry. \"I discovered that crystals, minerals, and gemstones have healing and attracting abilities from my first time visiting a metaphysical and spiritual shop... I learned that [by] placing healing stones within or around your aura, you can benefit from their amazing natural abilities.\" Two of her favorite stones are citrine, \"for its positive energy, enhancing [her] creativity and motivation,\" and black tourmaline, \"for protection against negative energy.\" \"I wear both of these amazing stones every day,\" she said. Some of Kinzer's designs include the Migraine Relief bracelet with lapis lazuli, rose quartz, and amethyst; the Focus and Study bracelet of tiger's eye and fluorite; a line of Chakra Symbol pendants; and more. Naturally Healthy Skin with Mary Hess Mary Hess, the founder of Hess Nest Naturals, LLC, grew up in Monroe, Michigan, and she has had an affinity for nature from a young age. \"I was raised by the lake, and to this day find a great calmness being near a large body of water.\" Her love for nature largely inspired her line of natural health and beauty products, Hess Nest Naturals, which produces natural lotions, scrubs, deodorants, liquid and bar soaps, lip balms, and vapor rubs. Hess is also a Registered Nurse, so she knows a thing or two about healing. When I asked her what set her on this journey of creating natural healing products, she answered, \"As a Registered Nurse, hand-washing is of the utmost importance. We all know that proper hand-washing helps stop the spread of disease. Sadly, that is not all that it does. Repeated hand-washing and hand sanitizing leaves hands cracked and bleeding.\" Hess discovered that using store-bought lotions \"would only sting and further inflame [her] hands.\" In investigating the causes of the irritation and looking into a \"multitude of ingredients,\" Hess was \"alarm[ed] to know that all of these chemicals are being absorbed into our bodies\" and \"it was at that point that I realized that I needed to make my own lotion. After a few years of trial and tribulation, I finally came up with our perfect lotion recipe.... That is when we decided to launch this business. Hess Nest Naturals, here we go!\" Essential oils are used to scent all of Hess Nest Natural's products. \"There are so many possible scent combinations,\" said Hess. \"I tend to be drawn to the essential oils that evoke a sense of calm and happy, those that uplift your mood.... I feel like a chemist in my own kitchen.\" Her favorite scent of lotion is Jasmine Patchouli, \"although, I love them all!\" Currently, all of the products are made in Hess' kitchen and are distributed online through their website and Etsy shop and at craft shows. Said Hess, \"I dream of having a storefront one day. I just have not yet had the opportunity.\" The business is a family operation and all of the online photographs are taken by Hess' daughter, an \"aspiring photographer.\" Hess has been married to the love of her life since 1994 and they have three children, the \"joys of their lives.\" \"My family is so helpful and supportive,\" said Hess. \"I could not do everything that I do without them.\" Hess' promise on her website to her customers is \"you will never purchase a Hess Nest Natural product that contains parabens, aluminum, phthalates or sulfates.\" \"Our mission at Hess Nest Naturals is not only to create the world's most luxurious Through her online shop, The Charmed Crystal, Melanie Kinzer sells handcrafted, Reiki- infused jewelry.

I study an illness and its side effects to the human body. I research the crystals and gemstones [that] best fit the definition of treating the illness and the parts of the body the illness effects, then I pick the best healing stone combination for the bracelet design to ease the negative effects of the illness.\" And Kinzer's favorite thing about her work? \"Designing jewelry with a purpose. Helping people improve their emotions, easing pain and overall health....

A New Way to Shop with Kristin Baker If you've been paying any attention to women's fashion \u2014 and Facebook \u2014 in the last few years, you've probably heard of fashion designer and clothier LuLaRoe. They are known for their bright colors, bold patterns, and comfortable clothes that fit all shapes and sizes. Based on the multi-level marketing (MLM) business model, LuLaRoe clothing is only available through independent retailers like Kristin Baker, a resident of Ann Arbor's West Side. \"I love this company,\" Baker gushed to me. \"We are all independent retailers that help each other out. We bless each other and customers on a daily basis. It's beautiful.\" Baker is a believer in LuLaRoe's compelling mission statement: \"Where through fashion we create freedom, serve others and strengthen families. A place where lives are being blessed and dreams achieved through love, confidence, purpose, and growth.\" LuLaRoe's MLM model allows stay-at-moms like Baker, who has three children between the ages of five and eleven, to double as stay-at-home independent business-owners. Retailers hold what are called Pop Ups either online or in people's homes or places of work. Baker explained, \"I pack up all my inventory and travel! I also host parties for people in my home if they don't have a space that works for them (I have a shop in my house).\" For people who live too far to meet up in person, Baker holds online events. \"Recently I had one for someone in Las Vegas.\" She went on, \"I do use Facebook for parties and sales. I [use Facebook Live] in my group a few days a week with different sales. Sometimes my husband hosts sales in my group, which is always fun to watch!\" The online Pop Ups work more or less like any other online shopping, except that rather than a limitless supply of a style in various sizes, there is usually only one item per design and size, and you are competing with everyone invited to the Pop Up. I bought one of my all-time favorite skirts this way, a black maxi with white polka dots that never fails to receive compliments every time I wear it. In the future, Baker hopes to expand her business by growing her inventory (LuLaRoe retailers purchase their inventories wholesale) \"and carry more styles.\" \"I would like to be able to make a significant contribution to my family income,\" Baker added, \"and have fun doing it!\" For more information and to shop LuLaRoe, go to lularoe.com and find a retailer in your area.Kristin Baker is an independent retailer for the fashion brand LuLaRoe, which is known for its bright colors, bold patterns, and comfortable clothes that fit all shapes and sizes.

DEXTER, MI LANDSCAPE LOVE YOURBy Lynda Gronlund-NaeemThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 20 This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/ Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. From August 15 right up until September 28, Akshara, Ann Arbor's nonprofit organization supporting India-themed and inspired arts, is holding a major multi-arts festival called the Rasa Festival. (See article on page 23 for more info)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 21 Continued on page 22New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Ann Arbor's Deep Spring Center for Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry, with Guiding Teacher Barbara Brodsky, has re-shaped their focus with a revised mission statement. The new statement makes clear that the Center is \"grounded in many spiritual traditions, and that co-creation with the Divine is a core aspect of [their] work.\" Brodsky explained that many people have associated the organization with Buddhism, but that it is not a Buddhist center. The concepts she teaches, with the guidance and help of the channeled entity Aaron and other entities, are understandable to everyone, she said. \"We don't have to be Buddhists to understand this. Anyone can understand this.\" The new mission statement is as follows: OUR DEEP SPRING CENTER VISION To awaken to higher consciousness. We rest in the knowing that this is already so. EXPANDED VISION We support living with increasing wisdom, compassion, and an open heart.We co-create this awakened world with all loving sentient beings.We draw on practices of multiple traditions to lead us there. MISSION STATEMENT We honor this vision with our c ommitment t o personal spiritual practice; guided by classes, r etreats, workshops, shared teachings; and support ed by lo ving community. The Center has new offerings this fall. One is a monthly program called Remembering Wholeness. Brodsky said that she channels an entity called The Mother \u2014 an expression of aspects of the Divine Mother \u2014 who then shares energy through her with the people who attend. \"She looks at you with unconditional love,\" Brodsky said, \"such that unworthiness, wrongness, and shame fall away,\" allowing one to experience one's own \"innate wholeness.\" Another new offering is the Dharma Journal, a monthly series of talks given by Aaron (channeled by Brodsky), offered freely as videos on the Center's website. Brodsky is also working on a new book by Aaron with the working title Living in the Light. He has written several books with Brodsky in the past, including Human, and Cosmic Healing , which includes the story of how Brodsky came to begin channeling Aaron in 1989 after the sudden loss of her hearing. The Deep Spring Center's website is www.deepspring.org. Barbara Brodsky can be reached by email at brodsky.barbara@gmail.com. Most of Deep Spring's events are held at the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth on Airport Boulevard in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth has a new senior minister, Lauren Tatarsky. Tatarsky has replaced David Bell, who served as senior minister since he founded the Center in 1997. Bell retired in June, but still teaches a class weekly and serves as a guest speaker. Tatarsky has a master's degree in spiritual guidance from Sofia University in California (formerly the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology) and a bachelor's degree in peace and conflict resolution from American University. She is only 30 years old and comes from a diverse spiritual background. She was brought up in a Reform Jewish family, and she has received training in yoga, meditation, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Ayurveda. She has also spent time living in an ashram. She describes herself as a \"spiritual eclectic,\" embracing what speaks to her from many spiritual traditions. In addition to her minister post, she maintains a private practice in spiritual guidance. Tatarsky said that she views herself as more of a facilitator than what many people would think of as a traditional minister. The Center is popular with seekers who consider themselves \"spiritual but not religious,\" she said. In her words, \"they don't want to be preached at,\" and many of them want to have opportunities to share the wisdom they've found on their own spiritual paths. In the Sunday Celebration, some community members contribute as musicians, meditation leaders, and readers. After the talk or lesson given by the minister, there is an open mic period, when people can share what they are working on or thinking about spiritually. The Interfaith Center is \"a community of people on a spiritual journey,\" where \"everyone gets to learn from each other,\" Tatarsky said. One of the Center's guiding principles is to affirm \"the truth in all faith traditions and religious paths.\" Services draw from many traditions and teachings. Tatarsky also has a background in social issues, including poverty, race, environmental justice, and healthy food access.

Local musician Laurel Emrys has formed a band called Fusionix, which plays what she calls \"world peace jazz fusion.\" She directs and plays flute, bansuri, and treble viol, and sings. Annabel Lemke plays violin and sings; Chris Foster plays cello, mandolin, bouzouki, and sings; and Matt Keating plays percussion and sings. Emrys started learning music at the age of 3 and has been involved in music for 65 years. She acts as director of the band and as a mentor for the three younger band members. She said she has envisioned and worked toward getting this band together for a long time. In addition to teaching and performing music, Emrys practices a form of sound healing she calls \"Being in Harmony,\" which combines her knowledge of brainwave optimization, her experience tuning, and her intuition as a Qigong practitioner and \"highly sensitive person.\" She uses this healing modality to help people with physical, mental, and emotional issues, including chronic pain. She plays concerts designed for this purpose and offers individual attunement sessions. Fusionix also incorporates this concept into their music. Emrys said she is happy that she can now do it on a regular basis with a band of gifted musicians, sharing it with audiences as performance art. Fusionix is a form of the word \"fusionic,\" a term Emrys coined to mean \"the quality of being in a state of fusion, which is typified by harmonious brainwave states.\" The band's music incorporates world sounds, which will be familiar to audiences, as well as original elements and improvisation, which will be new to listeners. They also play in many musical keys, where most musicians stick to just a few, she said. She believes that playing in what she calls \"Full Frequency Harmonics\" \u2014 utilizing many keys, including ones not frequently used in Western music \u2014 allows greater healing. \"Our music is designed to help the listener bridge the gap between the worlds and within themselves, so that we can all move forward in this time of great intensity into new paradigms of wholeness, of living love,\" she said. Fusionix's performance schedule is available online at www.laurelemrys.com. Laurel Emrys can be reached by phone at (734) 276-4765 or by email at laurelemrys@yahoo.com. MOVE Fitness and Wellness in Ann Arbor has launched a 450-hour Pilates instructor training program. Made up of three modules, which cover mat work, the Pilates Reformer apparatus, and other equipment used in Pilates training, the course is designed to prepare instructors for the Pilates Method Alliance Exam (PMA) \u2014 the accredited, industry-standard certification for professionals. Students can choose to complete just one or two modules and can teach general Pilates classes before completing all three. Elaine Economou, MOVE's cofounder and CEO, said that she created the program to give local instructors a way to receive high-quality in-person training in the Ann Arbor area, and to \"build professional opportunities for trainers.\" She explained that there is a demand for qualified Pilates trainers in the area, including at the MOVE studio. Some of her team members bring over 20 years' teaching experience and knowledge to the program. Economou herself is an experienced Pilates instructor with a degree in movement sciences, and extensive training in kinesiology, anatomy, and other movement systems. She said that MOVE's program is unique in its warmth and sense of community, just like the Ann Arbor area itself. Economou said the program, launched at the end of April, currently has about 10 students. The goal is for them to sit for the PMA exam in January. At least one has already been hired by a local gym to teach Pilates classes. (Elaine Economou wrote an article called \"Conscious Fitness and a Path to Family Wellness\" for our September thru December 2012 issue (Issue #52), available on our crazywisdomjournal.com website's digital archive of past issues.)

Kim Cardeccia, a licensed professional counselor and experienced horsewoman, runs Hidden Promise, an equestrian facility outside Fenton offering \"equine-facilitated mindful refuge.\" Cardeccia said she noticed many years ago that her horse riding students were somehow more comfortable, and disclosed more information, than some of her counseling clients. From there, she began allowing the horses to assist in her counseling work, with \"profound results,\" she said. Lora Girata, Hidden Promise's outreach coordinator, said, \"Horses, with an uncanny ability to perceive subtle energy, offer a distinctive ability to support and heal the whole human.\" Cardeccia began offering retreats for adults in 2008. This summer, she offered her first 3-day retreat \u2014 an \"adult day camp\" style program called Confidence Camp. \"Horses respond well to a leader who is compassionate and empathetic,\" she said. \"This is the same skillset needed to lead your own life in the direction of your choosing.\" Participants include both horse owners and complete beginners to horsemanship. Cardeccia said that she and the horses have helped people make progress in healing from trauma, health issues, and confidence issues. The camps are limited to four participants to ensure everyone's safety and to allow participants to receive personal attention from Cardeccia and the 17 horses on the property. The horses each participate in their own way, some just by being ridden, and others by interacting more closely. Participants are matched with a particular horse for the entire retreat. Said Girata, \"The caring and nurturing relationships that develop between coach, horse, and participants as the days go by are meaningful and potentially transformative.\" Retreat dates and registration are available online at Hidden Promise's website, www.confidencethroughconnection.com. Kim Cardeccia can be reached by phone at (517) 898-5094 or by email at kim@hiddenpromisecampus.com. Katie Kidle, M.S.W., is joining Firefly Art Therapy in downtown Ann Arbor . Kidle received her degree from the University of Michigan and has been treating clients at the Women's Center in Ann Arbor. Sibel Ozer, Firefly's founder and experienced art therapist, has served as her mentor for the last two years, and Kidle will now be working, with Ozer's guidance, at Firefly. Kidle believes that before each person can begin to learn and grow in the therapeutic process, he or she needs to feel seen, heard, and understood. There are many modalities today that can assist in this process depending on the individual's needs and interests, art therapy being one. People interested in trying art therapy do not need any prior experience or special talent. Kidle was trained and practices therapy using the RICH Relationship Model: Respect, Information, Connection, Hope. It is an empowerment approach which, she explained, is especially suited to clients who have experienced trauma or loss. She tailors her approach to each client combining holistic and structured treatments. She has training in cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure response and prevention therapy, and motivational interviewing. She uses these in combination with mindfulness, self-compassion, and attachment theory techniques. She is especially passionate and versed in treating clients of all ages who are living with obsessive compulsive disorder. Firefly Art Therapy is located at 321-B South Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 and its website is www.sibelozer.com. Kidle can be reached at (734) 219-9085 or at katie.fireflyarttherapy@gmail.com. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 23 Continued on page 25Upcoming Events From August 15 right up until September 28, Akshara, Ann Arbor's nonprofit organization supporting India-themed and inspired arts, is holding a major multi-arts festival called the Rasa Festival. Visual arts, film, music, dance, culinary arts, and literature will all be represented in events and performances held in locations around Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti including the Michigan Theater, the Kerrytown Concert House, Riverside Arts Center, the Downtown Public Library, White Lotus Farms, Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, Caf\u00e9 Verde at the People's Food Co-op, Literati Bookstore, and the Faber Piano Institute. The festival is sponsored by small grants from the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs. Many of the events offer free admission. Organizer Sreyashi Dey said the intention is for the festival to become an annual event. \"We feel that such cross-cultural exchanges are essential, especially in the present time, and strengthen our community in a significant way,\" she said. Dey has produced festivals and arts events in the past, but this will be the largest and most all-encompassing. \"People don't always realize the breadth and depth of richness and diversity and interconnectedness of art forms from India,\" she said. Her goal is to represent that and introduce people to these beautiful, vibrant, and interesting art forms. Dey herself is a professional performer, teacher, and choreographer of the Odissi style of Indian classical dance and will perform with her dance company at the festival's dance events. She has performed internationally with her company and won several awards. ( The Crazy Wisdom Journal published \"An Interview with Sreyashi Dey \u2014 Dancing with Tradition: Recreating Ancient Indian Spiritual Dances for Modern Audiences\" in our January thru April 2012 issue (Issue #50), available on our crazywisdomjournal.com website's archive of past issues.) Christina Burch, Akshara's art director, is organizing the visual arts events for the festival. She is a painter inspired and influenced by \"the Tantric view of energy and embodiment.\" Her work is on display throughout the U.S., and some of her paintings will be on display at festival shows. She is an example of an artist who is not from India, but who is highly inspired by Indian culture and art. Dr. Swaroop Bhojani, former University of Michigan research scientist and chef and founder of Ann Arbor's Hut K Chaats restaurant, will offer a farm-to-table strolling dinner at White Lotus Farms, which will include produce grown there. Other contributors to the festival will be local, national, and international Indo-American artists. For a calendar of events and more information on the artists and shows, the Rasa Festival website is at www.akshara-arts.org/rasa-festival. Sreyashi Dey can be reached by email at sreyashi2@gmail.com or by phone at (734) 223-5616. The University of Michigan Depression Center's Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Program will host Marya Hornbacher, author of Madness: A Bipolar Life and other books detailing her experiences with mental illness, for the 11 th-annual Prechter Lecture. The event will take place on November 8 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the A. Alfred Taubman Biomedical Science Research Building. This annual lecture is free and open to the public. Crazy Wisdom Bookstore will have Hornbacher's book for sale at the lecture, and she will be available for autographs. The event will begin with a talk from Hornbacher, followed by a panel discussion with Hornbacher and University scientists researching bipolar disorder. It will be facilitated by the program's scientific director, Dr. Melvin McInnis. Audience members will have the opportunity to ask questions both of Hornbacher and the scientists. The communications manager, Kat Bergman, explained that when the program began offering these annual lectures for the public, they were headlined by research scientists, and sometimes the information was more technical than most audience members could understand. Last year, for the 10 th lecture, the audience connected well with author Mimi Baird, who wrote He Wanted the Moon: The Madness and Medical Genius of Dr. Perry Baird, and His Daughter's Quest to Know Him. Her book documented her father's struggle with bipolar disorder, and his eventual death in 1959 after a lobotomy, which was intended to help with his condition. Bergman said she hopes that with this year's lecture, by featuring a writer who has struggled with bipolar disorder herself, the program can continue to decrease the stigma around the disease and around mental health in general and help more people to increase their understanding. The Prechter Research Program, explained Bergman, has over 1200 people with bipolar disorder enrolled in a lifelong study consisting of regular online questionnaires and phone calls. This research is incredibly valuable in helping LIVING PRE:SE:NCE: Rev Alison Hine & Rev Joe Summers E:.piscopal Church ot Incarnation \"Presence is the point ot intersection between the world ot the senses and the world ot spirit\" Using Kabir Helminski's book \"Living Presence\" as our study guide we will explore the world of Mindfulness and the Essential Self through a Christian and Sufi perspective.

Many participants, she said, find being in the study helpful as it nudges them to reflect on their own condition and reminds them of habits that can help them to manage their health, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. The program is always adding people to the study; the more data it has, the more the scientists can learn. More information is online at http://www.prechterfund.org/lecture/. The lecture will also be livestreamed from the website and archived for later viewing. Kat Bergman can be reached for questions at kbergman@med.umich.edu. For those interested in attending a small discussion group about this book, and about bipolar disease, Crazy Wisdom Bookstore will hold a Book Discussion Group on Friday, October 20 th at 7:30 pm in its Community Room. It will be hosted by store owner, Bill Zirinsky, and is free and open to anyone, whether they've read the book or not. Ann Arbor's Westside Art Hop is a bi-annual event in its sixth year. Previously, it was held in May and December, but this year the December event has been moved to Saturday, October 14, in hopes of more comfortable weather for walking between the homes, yards, and garages that house the art displays. Organizer Sophie Grillet said the show is juried to maintain quality. Artists pay a low fee to support the Art Hop, and any sales proceeds are theirs to keep. The May show hosted just over 40 artists, said Grillet. Each event gets a little bigger \u2014 the first had just 12. She said the event attracts a few hundred visitors, from inside and outside theneighborhood. Some artists live in the neighborhood, others set up in spaces offeredby neighbors who want to support the event. It's a one-day event, she explained, \"Sono one has to spend too long sweating over it. It's very straightforward.\" Painters,fiber artists, photographers, potters, and others have displayed their pieces. As theevent has grown bigger, Grillet said, it will be moving under the nonprofit wing ofthe Ann Arbor Art Center. They are always looking for more neighbors who wantto donate their space or otherwise get involved, and are accepting new artists whowant to participate. More information is available online at www.westsidearthop.com. Sophie Grillet can be reached at westsidearthop@gmail.com. New Classes Kimberly Cresswell and Carrie Gibbs Fraser formed Float Ohm SUP in late summer 2016. SUP stands for stand-up paddle boarding. Most people have seen the large, surfboard-like contraptions floating on the Huron River in recent years. The boards used by Float Ohm are a bit different. Designed specifically for yoga and fitness applications, they are wider and more stable than most boards, said Cresswell, making them easier for paddle boarding novices to use. Cresswell and Gibbs Fraser were both experienced Ann Arbor-based yoga teachers prior to being introduced to SUP yoga. They completed SUP yoga certification in the early summer of 2016 with California-based teacher Amelia Travis, founder of Stoked Yogi. Cresswell explained that adding the SUP aspect into yoga is \"a great way to spend time outdoors, and improve core strength, endurance, and flexibility.\" Float Ohm offers a variety of ways to try SUP out. Complete beginners may be interested in the Intro to SUP classes to learn the basics of getting on and off the board and maintaining balance. Floatfit is a high intensity interval training fitness class on the board for a yoga-free fitness experience. SUP yoga classes are offered throughout the summer as well. Private classes and lessons are available by arrangement (Creswell said they recently hosted a bachelorette party). In February of 2018 they will travel to Puerto Rico for four nights of SUP and beach yoga and other adventures like kayaking in a bioluminescent bay. Cresswell said, \"It looks really difficult but don't be intimidated!\" She emphasized that she and Gibbs Fraser are focused on everyone having a great time, regardless of their level of experience. More information on classes and retreats is available at www.floatohmsup.com. They can be reached by phone at (734) 430-0787 or by email at floatohmsup@gmail.com. The Jewel Heart Tibetan Buddhist center in Ann Arbor will host a three-day compassion training course by Geshe Lobsang Tenzin Negi from November 3 through 5 . The course is part of the Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT) program designed by Negi and offered at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. This will be the first time this course is offered in Michigan. Students may take it as a standalone course or as an introduction to the program offered at Emory. Continuing education credits may be available for nurses, social workers, mental health professionals, and others. Emory can provide documentation of the work for those who may want to petition their organizations for credit. CBCT teaches people, through progressive exercises and meditations, to cultivate compassion and understand how one's thoughts and actions support compassion or not. CBCT aims to increase one's desire to help others and to make compassion a more ingrained habit. The training may be of interest to educators, medical and mental health professionals, and anyone seeking to become more compassionate in their professional and personal lives. Negi, a Ph.D. and former monk, is the cofounder and director of the Emory- Tibet Partnership, created in 1998 to bring together Western and Tibetan Buddhist thought and science on well-being. Registration for the course is available online at www.jewelheart.org. Questions can be directed to Kathy Laritz at kathyjewelheart@gmail.com or (734) 994-3387. Jewel Heart is located at 1129 Oak Valley Drive, Ann Arbor, MI48108. Starting September 30, the Self Realization Meditation Healing Centre (SRMHC) in Bath, Michigan, will host international teacher H\u00e0nanda Whittingham for the Progressive Counselling and Coaching course, now offered on weekends. This course is usually offered for three full weeks in a row followed by an assessment week, which works well for students at the SRMHC headquarters in England, where people have more vacation time available than Americans typically do. The Michigan Centre's resident teacher, Joanne Peeters, said that one student had contacted the Centre and expressed her deep desire to complete the course, but was only able to do it on weekends due to her work schedule. Thankfully, Whittingham was available and agreed to come to Michigan for the extended time needed. She will also care for the Centre while Peeters travels to the Founding Centre to continue her training with SRMHC founder and guru, Mata Yogananda Mahasaya Dharma. The course is a two-year, six-module program. Modules one through three are offered in the first year. Modules four through six are offered in the second year and will be offered on weekends as well. The first module is also available as a standalone course and may be taken by anyone wishing to explore the program and consider whether it is right for them. It covers listening and communication skills, said Peeters, \"how to get our own egos out of the way to listen clearly and respond clearly.\" The subsequent models teach how to \"hold a space of unconditional love; keep ourselves out of the way; use our intuition; and help the person in front of us to progress spiritually, and come to their soul's purpose.\" The content will be useful to people in mental health and medical jobs, but also to anyone who wants to learn to communicate better, use their intuition, and help others more effectively. Participants will have many opportunities to role play and practice the skills being taught. The course will be limited to a maximum of 10 students, to keep it intimate and allow Whittingham to give personal attention to everyone. Home-cooked vegetarian meals are included in the tuition and onsite accommodation is available for those who would like to stay on site for the weekends. The SRMHC is a 501c3 nonprofit organization and offers tuition assistance to students who are interested in the course but unable to afford it. The Centre is also always in need of volunteers. The Self Realization Meditation Healing Centre is located at 7187 Drumheller Road, Bath, MI 48808. Its website is www.selfrealizationcentremichigan.org. Joanne Peeters can be reached by phone at (517) 641-6201 or by email at info@selfrealizationcentremichigan.org. Continued from page 25The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 26 New Practitioners and Businesses In November of 2016, Denise Carbonell moved with her husband from Okemos to Gregory, Michigan, in the Dexter/Chelsea area, bringing her practice Joyful Spirits with her. Carbonell is a licensed professional counselor, Reiki master, and endorsed life coach. She became a certified hypnotherapist in June. She has retired after working for 30 years as a high school counselor and is now focused on helping people through her various healing modalities to improve their lives. She knows that the mind, body, and spirit are interconnected so that healing in one area impacts the others positively as well. This is why she has trained in various healing formats, giving her flexibility in what she can use to assist different individuals. She said, \"I strongly believe we hold the answers within us and my role is to help bring the answers out.\" Reiki often entails using a very light touch by the practitioner, which can help balance the client's energies and be deeply relaxing, sometimes \"bringing issues to the surface to explore and heal,\" Carbonell explained. Life coaching, she said, can help people through change brought about by life circumstances or by one's own goals. The coach serves as a \"partner and co-creator,\" helping the client shift his or her awareness and perception. Hypnosis, she said, can help the client access memories and examine limiting beliefs in the subconscious mind, allowing them to adopt new beliefs that better serve the individual. She received her certification as a hypnotist from the Institute of Transformational Hypnotherapy this past summer, and is honing her skills with friends and family before beginning to offer this service professionally in the fall. The modalities Carbonell uses with clients depend on their own goals, preferences, and needs. She said that her wish is to help people toward \"awareness, change, growth, and ultimately a more joyful spirit.\" Denise Carbonell can be reached at (517) 775-2731 or at carboden@aol.com. Her website is www.joyfulspirits06.abmp.com. Purna Yoga Ann Arbor, located off of Geddes Road in Superior Township, will open in mid-September. Owner and certified yoga instructor Raisha Janet Love began teaching yoga in 2007 and enrolled in the College of Purna Yoga in Washington (state), where she has completed the 200 and 500-hour certifications. She is currently enrolled in the extensive 2000-hour certification. Love explained that \"Purna\" means \"complete\" in Sanskrit. It is a newer style created by yoga master Aadil Palkhivala (a student of B.K.S. Iyengar) and meditation and Kundalini master Savitri, creator of Heartfull Meditation. She said that Purna Yoga is alignment-based and safety-focused, but also provides \"an invaluable set of tools for transformation,\" both on and off the mat. \"Yoga is not about the shape of your body, it's about the shape of your life,\" said Love. The system includes learning asana (postures), pranayama (controlled breathing) and Heartfull Meditation, as well as nutrition and yogic philosophy adapted to modern life. It is based on ancient teachings while acknowledging current science and lifestyles. Purna Yoga Ann Arbor will offer classes for beginners and intermediate students, and eventually, Love said, she would like to offer a teacher training program. Morning and evening classes will be available. The studio is a former artist's studio in a home \"on a three-acre wooded lot surrounded by nature.\" Love has been renovating the space, and one of its features is \"the great yoga wall\" \u2014 a tool consisting of straps hooked into grommets in the wall for inversions \u2014 developed by her teacher Palkhivala to help lengthen the spine and ease back pain and shoulder and neck tension. Love said it is great for those who would like the benefit of handstand type postures but are not able to perform them. Purna Yoga Ann Arbor's class schedule will be available online at www. purnayogaannarbor.com. Raisha Janet Love can be reached at (989) 284-1042 or at askraisha@yahoo.com. Evenstar's Chalice, relics,\" local art, \"sacred swag,\" and more, opened its doors on July 7. This was a \"soft opening,\" in anticipation of a grand opening September 22 through 24. In the meantime, the store will continue to unfold and take shape while introducing itself to the community. Partners Jeanne Adwani, Mara Evenstar, and Mara's husband, Russ Jones, came together on the project after realizing the next steps in their goals were compatible. Adwani has been collecting antiques for over 30 years and is a tarot reader, but she has made her living as a hair stylist. The building she had been operating out of was sold in January and she was looking both to relocate her salon and open an antique shop with an eye toward \"integrating [her] passions, spirituality, etc.\" She had decided to \"just make it work,\" when she met with friend Evenstar at Cultivate Coffee & Taphouse in downtown Ypsilanti to catch up. Evenstar and Jones had been working toward manifesting a \"center for transformative arts\" as an outgrowth of their organization New Myth Works, which they started five years ago with a vision to \"provide a dynamic sanctuary for our conscious evolution.\" A retail store was always a part of this vision as a support for the center, but in talking to Adwani, Evenstar realized it would be a good place to begin. Evenstar's Chalice came together with a unifying idea of \"being an offering to the Divine Feminine.\" This is evident in the store's sign \u2014 a goddess holding a chalice \u2014 and in its six altars subtly mixed in its merchandise displays. The altars are for earth, air, fire, water, the Goddess and a \"community altar,\" which briefly held an Elvis theme for Ypsilanti's nearby Elvis fest. The altars will change and rotate but will always be present in the store's makeup, Adwani explained. Adwani's hair salon is in the rear of the store space, which is just uphill from Riverside Park, where Evenstar's organization Sophia Unfolds recently hosted a full moon gathering. World of Rocks is a neighbor, and Adwani hopes that the vacant space next door will soon be filled by another complementary business. There is a seating area for guests to mingle, and the space will hold classes and gatherings. \"We love being in Ypsi,\" she said, \"and being a part of the unfolding, greening and renewal of the community.\" The store will sell art from local artists, antiques, altars and altar adornments, goddess images, and more. The eclectic mix, explained Adwani, all fits within the altar concept. \"We all have them,\" she said, \"a shell from the beach, a picture of the kids, all the things we display in our homes.\" She envisions people being inspired by the store to use their personal \"altars\" in a more conscious, intentional way. The vintage and antique items also serve the purpose of honoring the \"Great Mother\" Earth by reusing and upcycling instead of discarding. (Jeanne Adwani was featured in our Cover Story on \"The Hair Healers of Ann Arbor\" in our May thru August 2011 issue (Issue #48), which is available on our crazywisdom.com website's digital archive of past issues.)

There was something missing, there was more to be birthed in me, and I didn't really feel comfortable in a gym environment. I never liked that the focus was all about the body because that just didn't resonate with me. I knew there was more to it.\" She enjoyed exercise because the rush of endorphins made her feel good, but simple focus on the body and musculature left her less than fulfilled. \"There was a depth of motivation and intrinsic transformation that was missing with this approach, so I began a journey to find that depth in my own life.\" She left her job in Vermont, purchased a plane ticket, and headed for New Zealand. Samson had always felt called to go to New Zealand and Australia. \"I didn't want to just jump into another job after leaving Vermont, I wanted to experience a little bit of the world before I did that.\" Samson traveled across New Zealand with her pack on her back and her thumb in the air for three months. \"I had some profoundly beautiful experiences there. It's incredibly humbling to depend on the kindness of others to get you from place to place, and it opens you up to witness the breadth and depth of love that is possible in another human being, and in yourself.\" From there, she backpacked across Australia, and experienced incredible compassion from human beings that she'd never experienced in the United States. \"I'd just never opened myself to the universe to show me the compassion we all have inside us The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 32 This is one of a series of articles we've been doing on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses. As the economy in Michigan has struggled and then revived over many years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. What follows are personal profiles of two businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary Stokley Photos by Susan Ayer Namaste: the divine light within me bows to the divine light within you. Ann Arborite Carla Samson is grateful to her parents, who allowed her to experiment with different things as a child, believing they contributed to her finding her place in the world today. She feels they are an integral part of what she accomplishes through the classes and training she offers at Align Divine Yoga. Samson tried ballet, tap dance, drums, soccer, and basketball throughout her elementary, middle, and high school years. \"I went to Pioneer High School and that was great,\" Samson explained, \"but I didn't feel very much passion for school. And living in Ann Arbor brings with it a certain assumption that one will attend college, and so my dad asked me what I was passionate about, what would I want to go to college for? I love to run and exercise, I told him, and he said, well, maybe there's a major you can find that has to do with exercise.\" Samson attended Western Michigan University, majored in Exercise Physiology with a minor in Holistic Healthcare, and then she was on her way.Namaste Moments with Carla Samson of Align Divine Yoga \u2014 Align Divine Yoga 201 E. Liberty St. #16, Ann Arbor, MI 48104734-276-7242; www.aligndivineyoga.com Carla Samson\"Yoga means to yoke or be united with the Divine, the higher power,\" Samson explained. \"And I felt that way the entire time I was there. For the first time I can remember, I felt truly and completely connected with a higher power and a higher purpose.\" \"There was a depth of motivation and intrinsic transformation that was missing with this approach, so I began a journey to find that depth in my own life.\"in the way I was able to do while traveling.\" Samson always had a plan for her next move until she spent this time in New Zealand and Australia. \"I just allowed life to flow through me and allowed myself to flow with life for the first time.\" And it was there where she began learning about the practice of yoga. Her visa was nearly expired and she asked some friends she'd made if they would recommend any other place she should travel before she had to return to the United States. They told her she needed to travel to India, and two weeks later she was there. Landing in Delhi was a ridiculous experience, according to Samson, because it was so bustling and hectic that she immediately needed to get away from the city. She purchased a bus ticket to the Himalayas and spent the next 24 hours crammed into a seat at the back of the bus between two Indian families. After landing in Kasol, Samson spent the next three months backpacking through the Himalayas. \"I only met one other American the entire time I was there and spoke English on a few occasions, so it was like a silent trek across the Himalayas.\" Samson practiced Asana Yoga, which focuses on postures, only once while she was there because she already felt wholly connected to the higher power. \"Yoga means to yoke or be united with the Divine, the higher power,\" Samson explained. \"And I felt that way the entire time I was there. For the first time I can remember, I felt truly and completely connected with a higher power and a higher purpose.\" During yoga practice, practitioners recite Namaste (see above) to their instructors and fellow practitioners. \"In India, this is how you greet everyone. You are consistently honoring the light of the divine in others. It is such a deep worship and prayer for life that is so different from anything I'd ever understood before, and I am so grateful I was able to experience it.\" Upon returning to the United States, Samson went back to personal training and became the head personal trainer for Fitness Together, a private club in Ann Arbor. Samson began meditating and brought meditation into her training, but still felt a longing for something more. After six or seven months, she quit that job, packed all her belongings, and moved to California. She spent the next nine months tenting around California, allowing the flow of life to take her from one place to the next, and surrendering to the experiences that came her way. She spent time in a Zen Buddhist temple where she learned the value of \"being\" in the moment, to nurture the experience each moment provides, rather than trying to return to her past or travel to her future.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 33 Feature continued on page 34 She returned to Ann Arbor once again and met Scott, now her fianc\u00e9. After living here for about two years, they decided they wanted to go travel again, and went to Columbia, South America for three months, and on to Panama, Costa Rica, and Guatemala each for a month. They spent their time studying and diving into the South American Medicine traditions, working with Shamans and other teachers of mystery, learning deep breathing and meditation techniques, and yoga practices emanating from indigenous traditions. After this, Samson and Scott went back to California, then lived in Alaska, and traveled and studied in Peru, until she received a very clear vision that she was to return to Ann Arbor and open a yoga studio. \"I've been given so much,\" Samson said, \"that now it is my responsibility to give back.\" Samson completed her 200 hour (Center for Yoga Ann Arbor) and 300 hour yoga (Saul David Raye) teacher certifications. \"And now I've been able to open this beautiful studio and to share with anybody who wants to come what I've had the opportunity to learn.\" Samson returned to Ann Arbor in April 2016, opened Align Divine Yoga Studio in December 2016, and began training others how to experience life flowing through them, taking them where they're supposed to go, and sharing the traditions she learned through her travels. Align Divine Yoga offers instruction in classes which use breath and movement combined with shamanic and yogic techniques, posture yoga, meditation through sound with quartz crystal bowls, and Hatha Yoga techniques combined with Tantric tools to light the soul's inherent flame. In October, Align Divine Yoga is offering a 200 hour Tantric Yoga teacher and immersion training instructed by Samson and Natasha Schaffer. If you're interested in this training, or in beginning a yoga or meditation practice, please contact Samson, and she will be happy to provide you with the information necessary to help you make an informed decision for the next step in your spiritual awakening. ### Her visa was nearly expired and she asked some friends she'd made if they would recommend any other place she should travel before she had to return to the United States.

He started his roots in the music industry as a tour manager and sound engineer in Chicago, moved on to a boxing/fitness gym in Portland, Oregon, and then spent some time in New York City before moving back to Michigan in 2009. He lived in Detroit for a year before moving with his wife, Danielle (also from Flint), to Ypsilanti. He promptly saw a business opportunity. Mark took a job as a dishwasher at Caf\u00e9 Luac (the same location as present day Ollie Food & Spirits) and washed dishes for about two weeks before asking the owner if he'd be willing to sell the business. His mother gave him a small business loan, and Mark went from dishwasher to business owner in the span of two weeks. \"My entire family is made up of entrepreneurs, so this is nothing new to us,\" Mark said. Around this same time, Mark also purchased (and still owns) Two Jerks Records, located just down the road from Ollie also on Cross Street in Ypsilanti. Because the established Caf\u00e9 Ollie closed for a couple of months in January of this year, many people may be under the assumption that Ollie Food & Spirits is under new management. But the truth is that the caf\u00e9 underwent a rebranding and renovation and re-opened its doors as two businesses, Ollie Food & Spirits and Cream & Crumb (located next door to Ollie). Danielle and Mark have been the owners and managers since the caf\u00e9 opened in 2010, and continue to manage the two establishments, and, with the help of some additional managerial staff, do their utmost to provide the best possible customer experience for each patron who walks through the doors. Ollie Food & Spirits: A Depot Town Favorite \u2014 Ollie Food & Spirits 42 East Cross Street, Ypsilanti, MI 48198734-482-8050; www.ollieypsi.com Danielle and Mark TeachoutMark took a job as a dishwasher at Caf\u00e9 Luac (the same location as present day Ollie Food & Spirits) and washed dishes for about two weeks before asking the owner if he'd be willing to sell the business.Danielle and Mark have been the owners and managers since the caf\u00e9 opened in 2010, and continue to manage the two establishments, and, with the help of some additional managerial staff, do their utmost to provide the best possible customer experience for each patron who walks through the doors. Smaller portion sizes at an appropriate price helps make this possible. Ollie prices their entr\u00e9es moderately with the expectation of higher volume at a lower price point, as opposed to many fine dining venues that place less expectation on volume and more on the higher price point. \"We want to pack the place out rather than having eight people come in who pay an exorbitant price.\" Ollie will still participate in Ypsilanti's First Friday events, and the works of local artists will be displayed and rotated with more frequency. \"We used to do a lot of live music, which we don't really do anymore because we want to focus on being a bar and restaurant and less on being a music venue,\" said Mark. It's that idea of keeping the concept narrow enough that customers can readily recognize who they are and what they do. A year and a half ago, Danielle and Mark were going to sell the business outright, due in part to knowing they'd taken Caf\u00e9 Ollie as far as they could, and also due to health concerns that Mark was facing. \"I have really bad degenerative, rheumatoid arthritis. I got to a point where I couldn't move and ended up in the emergency room on several occasions,\" he said. Thanks to a new doctor and new medication, and the space next to Ollie opening up, all the circumstances fell into place and they decided not to sell. \"It was as if we'd planned it out, but we hadn't.\" As the owners, Danielle and Mark are only a part of the equation. The rest is made up of the people who work with them. \"We have an amazing and knowledgeable staff of people, people who are passionate about what they do. It's not just a job for these people. Nobody here is just passing through on their way to somewhere else and need a job. The real heart and soul of Ollie Food & Spirits and Cream & Crumb is the passion that our people bring to what we do.\" So, where did the name Ollie come from? Mark's parents were going to name him Burgess Oliver, and his nickname was going to be Ollie. \"My father was in Australia in the 1960s and got into a bar fight when he was jumped by his opponent's friends. An old man jumped off the bar to his rescue and saved his life. His dad thanked him, but the man told him no thanks were necessary, just name your first born son after me. That man's name was Burgess Oliver. My mother refused to name me Burgess Oliver, so I pay homage to him with the name of the restaurant and a cocktail called the Burgess Oliver.\" ###Caf\u00e9 Ollie, a Depot Town favorite, was a fairly broad business concept that offered coffee, ice cream, beer, wine, and lunch. \"We knew that in order to take the business to the next level, we had to separate the businesses and have the caf\u00e9 side in a different location which wasn't available,\" Mark explained. Then the Russian Ballet Studio moved and left open the space right next door. \"So, we moved all of that [coffee and ice cream] next door and rebranded Caf\u00e9 Ollie as a full-service restaurant and bar.\" Business w as good for Caf\u00e9 Ollie, but its definition became somewhat confusing to the customers, and the owners had to address that particular issue. With the launch of Cream & Crumb, they subtracted food from the menu, and rather than sourcing their own sweets, they utilize Zingerman's and a few other local bakers to provide their breads and pastries. Mark and Danielle felt that they'd reached the pinnacle for Caf\u00e9 Ollie, so the separation of businesses was necessary. \"Sometimes when refining, subtracting components can be more beneficial than adding, and that's what we did with Cream & Crumb and Ollie Food & Spirits; we've curated a small menu that's very specific to lunch and dinner menus and brunch on the weekends.\" And now, when people walk into either business, they have a very clear idea of what each is and what they provide. \"There's really only so much any coffee or ice cream shop can do without expanding into twelve such shops. We wanted to refine the businesses without having to expand.\" So far, sales have skyrocketed since the relaunch. Mark finds it interesting that even though they've been in business for six-and-a-half years and this feels old hat to them, the reality is that for many people who walk by, it is a brand-new business. \"We're only a few months into this rebranding and we don't yet know the full potential. I think we're going to be doing really high business. The response from the community has been great.\" They're trying to be ahead of the curve by projecting and speculating, not about what Ypsilanti and Depot Town are, but what they're going to be, and what Ollie Food & Spirits will become along with it. \"People who've been our customers for a long time are happy with what we've done, and new customers are thrilled with what they see when they come in, so I honestly can't see any downside to anything we've done,\" Mark said. Ollie offers a seasonal menu with foods that are locally sourced and based on a Midwestern cuisine. \"We don't like to refer to it as fine dining, although the quality of the food is fine dining without all the pretense and price,\" Mark shared. They try to have prices that are appropriate and affordable for anyone who comes in to eat.

By Jenna Wunder Page 44On a bitter cold and rainy day in late April, my husband and I were inspired to do our annual trek to HillTop Greenhouse and Farms to plot this year's garden and bask in the warmth and stunning visuals contained within the expansive space. The day before I was in the process of contemplating another horticultural local for the farm beat column for the Crazy Wisdom Journal while in the midst of personal challenges that greatly hindered my ability to tackle basic tasks. I simply could not come up with a story line. I knew I had to let go and trust that the perfect story would reveal itself if only I pay attention and step aside. Quite honestly I was going to postpone the piece for a later date. Then the family that inspires HillTop moved me. I firmly believe there are no real coincidences. Sometimes life carries me to a certain intersection in time, where if I pay attention to the subtle nudges guiding my path, I am better able to accept there are hands of something greater than myself guiding the way. As we were leaving, it became completely clear their story was meant to be shared with reverence and gratitude. HillTop Greenhouse and Farms is located between Parker and Jackson Road, ten minutes from Ann Arbor, and we have been patrons for the 11 years since they opened. The proprietors, Denise and Ken Prielipp, and their staff have a way of being that is uplifting. Getting a hug from Denise is a bonus! The space is nurturing and visually stunning; overflowing with colorful vibrant hanging baskets, an expansive array of annuals, perennials, and my personal favorite, vegetable and herb seedlings. They have one of the most extensive varieties for edibles starters I have ever encountered, including heirloom and rare varieties alongside the most popular choices for our region. Denise and Ken procure non-G.M.O. and seeds sourced by initiative companies, when available. They hand seed90 percent of their plants, with the exception of tropicals, and other proprietaryannuals and perennials (all clearly labeled). The green house is 52,000 square feetand very peaceful. After spending an hour with them while my husband and I contemplated our summer garden, they shared with us their new winter venture of raising fresh vegetables and herbs to sell at their stall at the Royal Oak Farmers' Market. I was honored to capture a portion of the following interview amidst Denise and others working, laughing, and sharing in the conversation. They moved through the greenhouse gently carrying by hand the jalape\u00f1o seedlings to their new home in the veggie garden area. I sat at a table in the center of the greenhouse with an incredibly wise and grounded woman Denise calls \"Ma B\" (Frances Baldus). We placed tiny jalape\u00f1o seedlings into trays in a \"quilting bee fashion.\" Denise and Ma B's bond touched me in a profound way. I realized in that moment that the heart of this operation is not just the business of farming-horticulture, sustainability, or raising beautiful flowers and edible plants for all to eat and enjoy. HillTop is a precious family heirloom sewn tenderly together with weathered hands, commitment, resilience, hard work, and a supportive community of \"friends.\" This is the legacy they will leave for their three children and future generations. *** Angela Madaras: What is the nature of your relationship with \"Ma B\"? Denise Prielipp: Ma B, I met her through her son, Ken. He was a sales rep for the greenhouse \u2014 seeds. I was looking for a reference for a seamstress to make a christening gown [out of my wedding gown] for our daughter, Lindsey. Ken introduced us. I physically met her at JoAnn Fabrics while dropping off my wedding gown. It pained Ma terribly to cut up a wedding gown. To this day, I have my wedding gown, but an heirloom piece for my children also, all sewn together with love from a woman I admire and a story they also know and can share as time passes. As our family grew with David, my dear friend made David's entire christening suit. So a beautiful gown and a suit for our family to treasure for all time. Ma B is a dear, dear friend. She's one I hold closest to my heart. She is a mentor, teacher, and woman through whom I've learned how to become a better person, wife, life lessons, and motherhood. We share an enormous amount of time together laughing, and sometimes in silence, just being in the greenhouse and all the beauty surrounding us. Knowing that each day is a gift to have such a special woman in my life. [Denise gets teary just talking about Ma B and it is contagious as I found myself welling up with tenderness.] Angela Madaras: Tell me about your beautiful \"Three Little Farmers\". Denise Prielipp: David, age 9, raises chickens. He received his first six chickens for his fourth birthday, of which six ended up being roosters. We then replaced [them] with egg laying hens. That was the birth of his fledgling business, David's Eggs. We found another home for the roosters and bought other eggs that are the best sellers at the market. Courtney, age 13, plans on selling her meat goats, Sweetheart and Leia, at the Washtenaw County 4-H fair in July. She's planning on saving her dollars for college from the sale of the goats. Lindsey, age 10, is collaborating with David in growing and selling sunflowers.

I want to be able to run and play without worrying. Climbing trees and making forts in our barn, things my friends don't get to do.\" -Lindsey Prielipp Angela Madaras: You used to have a nine to five job, working for G.M.A.C. Finance 13 years ago, that you left after you met your third-generation-farmer husband, Ken. Would your children prefer you work \"a normal\" nine to five job, as you did then? Denise Prielipp: That's right. I met Ken at the Royal Oak Farmers' Market, I was working a second job after I got off work at G.M.A.C. in the evenings selling for a farmer and Ken was at the stall next door. We got married and purchased 42 acres to start the greenhouse together. That was the end of nine to five. And my kids love that this is our life. AM: Are you inspired by your grandfather, also a farmer?DP: Absolutely. I saw his hard work and his dedication my whole life, from when I was a young child until the day that he passed on. He worked on a hobby farm and sold vegetables at his roadside farm stand until he was no longer able to do that. It was in Bruce Township. AM: How do you think about what you do?DP: We actually talk about that daily. \"We feed families,\" David says on a repeated basis. Courtney, in particular, is passionate about saving farmland. She told us that, \"People want to move to the country next to the farmer, but they're taking space to grow food for them and others when they buy farm land. It's a big circle. Land equals food. No land, no food.\" So says a 13-year-old wise beyond her years. Lindsey \u2014 she's my girl who wants to run in a field. She says, \"Mom, I could never live where there are close neighbors. I want to be able to run and play without worrying. Climbing trees and making forts in our barn, things my friends don't get to do.\" AM: What inspired you to become voluntarily MAEAP certified? [Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (www.maeap.org) is a recognition by the State of Michigan as a sustainable farm working in service for environmental protection. HillTop is the first greenhouse in Michigan to receive certification.] DP: We have one land. Ken and I care about the land that we farm and live from. The land provides our family our way of life. Land is a gift; never take the land for granted. Recycling plastic, down to the plant tag, is just what needs to be done. MAEAP Certification was just a simple way to publicly acknowledge our family's efforts to the community that we care about. It's for our family, as well, our children, and our community, and to our state. MAEAP is a voluntary program. It took us three years, and thousands of dollars \u2014 of our own \u2014 to finally put all the pieces together to become certified. Well worth the time and dollars to rest at night knowing that we are valued by the State of Michigan as an environmentally friendly farm. \"MAEAP Certification was just a simple way to publicly acknowledge our family's efforts to the community that we care about.\" -Denise Prielipp Continued from page 39A Family Firmly Planted: HillTop Greenhouse and Farms Continued on page 43The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 42 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 43 AM: Do you have any hints or ideas for first time gardeners? DP: Don't overload yourself. Start small. Grow what you will eat. Plant colors that you enjoy looking at if you're planting flowers. Most importantly, know yourself. If your lifestyle doesn't fit into a watering schedule, be honest. Success is key. From the newest and littlest gardener to the most elaborate of gardens, it's always a learning experience. It takes time to grow a garden, and it takes time to grow in learning what best suits a gardener. AM: To which organizations do you donate?DP: There's a whole list, but most importantly we give back to the communities that shop with us. We're in Chelsea with the Boy Scouts for a fundraiser in the spring, Dexter Schools for a mum sale, plants for science projects, Oakland County Habitat for Humanity, and The Ann Arbor Garden Walk. We've also contributed to Food Gatherers' Auction and Ele's Place. AM: Did you receive any grants or assistance financially?DP: No grants here. Sacrifice, sweat, sacrifice, tears, struggles, support, and love from friends and family and days we were carried through by a higher power to make this dream live. Most importantly, what I personally want to share is gratefulness. During the downturn in the economy those who only had a few extra dollars in disposable income came in and supported us. Just one basket or one flat. Sharing that they couldn't afford to plant as they used to, but they still wanted something in their yard, and they made a conscious effort to make our business their destination of choice. We are not located on a main road. Our \"friends who shop with us,\" as Ken and I call our customers, are intentional each year to remember us. We don't spend dollars advertising. So every new face, every friend over the years is made via another friend. AM: What do you enjoy doing on your off hours? DP: Watching my children run together. Their smiles, hearing their giggles. Looking at my husband's hands with the toil of the day's work out in the fields, feeling his calluses as I hold his hands. The flicker of a campfire when all of us can sit and share. Most evenings in the Prielipp household, while sharing dinner, we ask the children the following questions: what was the worst part of the day, then the best part, and something to be thankful for. In that order. Always ending on thankfulness. *** Denise, Ken, and their children bring people together; sowing seeds of gratefulness for those who are drawn to support them, and of course, the greenhouse and picturesque farmland that sustain their livelihood. Their gratitude and joy are palpable and extremely contagious. I, too, share the belief that being thankful for every moment on terra firma is the key to authentic joy and that deep reverence for the fertile land which sustains each and every one of us is a grander family heirloom.

Drink a glass of water, wait five minutes, and see if you still have the craving. Try adding fresh fruit and/or herbs to give it extra flavor. SEVEN WAYS To Kick The Sugar Habit by Rachel Lozon Your co-workers brought in cake for your birthday, you promised the kids ice cream after dinner, and your neighbor pops over with homemade cinnamon rolls. Sugar is everywhere. It's a celebration, an indulgence, it's simply love. The av erage American consumes nearly 90 grams of sugar per day. Most of all it's doing more harm than good. Studies have shown that sugar contributes to heart disease and can lead to liver disease, hypertension, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease. Eliminating your added sugar intake as much as possible is one of the most powerful things you can do for your health. Sugar is addictiv e. It stimulates the brain pathways the same way as a drug would. The cravings that are induced by sugar are comparable to those induced by cocaine and nicotine. Addicts crave what they are addicted to, so you should expect sugar cravings as you begin to eliminate it from your diet. Stopping the sugar will lead to withdrawal symptoms. Feeling tired, irritable, anxious, and having headaches is typical. You can manage to make it through a few days of feeling unpleasant, especially if you are aware of the positive changes you're making for your health. Ther e are Seven solutions to kicking the sugar habit. Let's begin, shall we? Check your bevvies! \u2014 Sounds crazy, but sometimes sweet cravings are a sign of dehydration. Drink a glass of water, wait five minutes, and see if you still have the craving. Keep a water pitcher filled in your fridge andrefill your glass throughout the day. Try adding fresh fruit and/or herbs to give it extra flavor. Cucumbers and mint are my favorite! Also, too much caffeine mimics a blood sugar crash \u2014you're high for a bit, but then you come crashing down and crave... SUGAR, of course. Satis fy your sweet tooth with sweet veggies, fruit, and spices \u2014 Your t ongue has sweet taste buds that demand to be satisfied, so don't hold out on them. Add naturally sweet foods and spices to your diet like squash, yams,carrots, beets, berries, figs, apples, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom. Studies have shown that the polyphenols in cinnamon help to reduce sugar cravings by controlling blood glucose levels. How neat is that? Sleep \u2014 F or many of us, this is easier said than done. But, if you're constantly tired, your body is going to look for energy, usually in the form of sugar or caffeine. Power down an hour earlier than usual and notice how yourcravings disappear. Some extra Z's come with added bonuses, too. Sleep helps improve your immune system and lowers stress levels. Too much stress sometimes will boost sugar cravings. So rest up! Check your pr otein \u2014 This is a fun, c ool fact \u2014 watch how much protein and what kind of protein you're eating, especially animal protein. Eating too little animal protein can lead to massive sugar cravings. Eating too much animal protein can lead to massive sweet cravings. Finding just the right sweet spot for protein intake will keep you feeling satisfied and therefore less likely to crave sweets. Choose protein-rich foods, such as organic meat, eggs, fish, dairy, beans, nuts, and seeds. Sniff out low -fat and fat-free foods \u2014 When food manuf acturers remove the fat from foods, what do they replace it with? Yes, sugar! Yogurt is agreat example. The healthy fats are a far better choice over fat-free. Many low-fat and fat-free foods promoted as healthy options contain more sugar than their \"full-fat\" equivalents. In some cases, more than five times as much. I encourage you to read labels before making a purchase. Healthy fats are a far better choice over low-fat and fat-free. Try an avocado or a handful of nuts. Mov e your Body! \u2014 Mo vement is another kind of food for your body. It releases stress, it's good for your heart, it makes you feel great and look great. When you don't get enough, the body starts to look for other ways toblow off steam, like bingeing on Snickers bars. When you find yourself doing this, go for a brisk walk, head to the gym, or turn on some music and move yourself. We crave sugar when we are lacking energy. Regular exercise can increase energy levels naturally and distract you from your cravings. Crea te new post-meal rituals \u2014 If y ou're a \"dessert after your meal\" person, one of the things you might love about that is the ritual of it. What are other possibilities for post-meal rituals? Go f or a walk. This gentle activity is a simple way to aid digestion, helps to regulate blood sugar, and will boost metabolism. Perhaps, this would be a great time to journal about your day. Meditate. Enjoy a cup of herbal tea. The truth is, sugar is e verywhere, and it certainly sneaks up on us no matter what. Try following these seven ways to kick sugar, and I promise you'll start to see a difference in how you feel. You'll have more energy and even notice your pants getting loose. And you'll begin to have a lower tolerance for sugar. The sweets you once loved will become too sweet. The natural sweetness such as fruit and nuts will become more enjoyable and satisfying. Dark chocolate will take the place of that Snickers bar. There are so many delicious and healthy options when it comes to replacing those sweet treats. The best part about that is, you can indulge without guilt and not suffer any consequences. Rachel Lozon is a certified holistic health coach.

Nadia Todoroff: Who are the owners of Get Down Farm? Anita Singh: I am one of the owners and founders, and my name is Anita Singh. I have a farming partner named Elizabeth \"Bee\" Ayer. NT: How did you two meet? AS: We worked together when we both lived in Brooklyn; we worked at an urban farm there. Bee is from Michigan, and we're farming on some of her family's land, on two and a half acres in Dexter. We raised 600 pasture chickens last season in our first year. NT: How did the two of you get into farming? AS: Bee is a veggie farmer, and she's been farming since high school, for around 15 years now. I'm an educator, a high school science teacher, and I started getting more interested in working with young people outside which brought me to working on a high school youth farm in New York. I really appreciated the difference that being outdoors could make for young people who especially aren't successful in the classroom. I've always really loved animals, and I've done vegetable farming, which I like, but I don't think that's my true passion. I really enjoy raising animals, and I'm kind of obsessed with chickens - I think they're really fun to raise, and it's something that you can start up fairly easily. It costs a lot to start a farm, from the equipment to the land, but if you are just starting small, raising chickens, you don't need too much capital or infrastructure to get started. So that was the appeal for me. I've raised my backyard flocks and city flocks of laying hens for about 6 years now, so it's kind of a natural progression to wanting to start something on my own and start my own farm. NT: Do you just raise and sell chickens on Get Down Farm?AS: This year we are going to be growing some organically raised local flowers, but right now we just sell [chicken] meat. We raise Red Rangers, which is different from your average meat chicken that you would purchase at the supermarket. The kind you'd purchase at the supermarket are the commercial breed of Cornish Cross, and they're bred to grow as rapidly as possible, going from hatching to slaughter in 6 weeks. Red Rangers take an average of 12 weeks to mature, and they act more like birds, so they're running around on the grass and eating bugs. Your average commercial Cornish Cross is just bred to eat and sit around, and that's pretty much it. In our day jobs we are involved with growing vegetables; Bee is the farm manager at Growing Hope in Ypsilanti, and I work for Keep Growing Detroit. NT: What are the benefits of eating the kinds of chicken you raise?AS: Primarily our chickens are raised on pasture, so that means that they're eating bugs and grass and they're getting those omega 3s. You can even see it in their skin, which is a little bit more yellow, and they have that deeper, richer flavor from their diet. They're also supplemented with a non-GMO feed from our local Dexter Mill, whereas your average and even your organic chicken is raised in a giant warehouse, pretty cooped up in a small cage. Even if it's a free-range that just means that there are thousands of birds in one warehouse fluttering around, so it's not a super healthy environment for a chicken. [Get Down Farm] is kind of bringing it back to originally how we used to raise and consume our meat. NT: How many chickens do you have on the farm now, how often is turnover, and when do you slaughter them? AS: We raise them in batches of 100, so every few weeks we're getting a new batch of 100 birds, and then they complete their life cycle in anywhere from 10-12 weeks. I order them from a specialty Freedom Ranger hatchery. These breeds were actually developed by the French Label Rouge program, which is kind of a humane animal welfare program also concerned with taste and flavor, so these chickens are a hybrid and were developed from that. NT: Who does the slaughtering?AS: We take them to a processor that is USDA certified.NT: How does it feel raising animals that you know are for slaughter?AS: I think that people are free to decide if they're going to consume meat or not. I think that if people were actually more connected to the animals and the food that they eat, we'd actually consume less meat. I think if people had more awareness about the effort that it takes and the process that goes into raising an animal and fully taking it to slaughter, it would be less about eating meat almost everyday or for every meal because that really teaches you respect for the process and respect for the animal. In terms of slaughtering them, it is done in a humane way. It's never easy to kill an animal, but I think it can be done with care and respect, and that's something that we practice on our farm. NT: How can people purchase chicken from Get Down Farm?AS: We have a C.S.A. that we call \"The Chicken Club.\" Folks can get a chicken either every week or every other week for 10 weeks during the summer. Full shares pick up every week and half shares pick up every other week. We also sell down at the Farmer's Hand and directly to restaurants - we've sold to Spencer and Jolly Pumpkin in the past. Our C.S.A. sign ups are now open, and our website is getdown.farm. I can be reached at anita@getdown.farm , and one of our C.S.A. drop-off locations is at Ann Arbor co- housing. Anita Singh I'm an educator, a high school science teacher, and I started getting more interested in working with young people outside which brought me to working on a high school youth farm in New York. I really appreciated the difference that being outdoors could make for young people who especially aren't successful in the classroom. Q. A.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 46 Meat Broth or Bone Broth \u2014 What's the Difference, Which is Best for You, and Why? Meat broth is a soup made with raw meat, skin, joints, and bones, and cooked for short periods, anywhere from two to six hours. Bone broth, on the other hand, is made primarily with bones (surprise) and joints but very little meat or skin. Typically bone broth is cooked for much longer periods than meat broth, from 12 to 72 hours.Homemade meat broth cooked for short cooking times is THE way to heal and seal any holes in our gut lining. It's essential to the healing quality of the broth that all meat and bones are sourced from the highest quality animals. Beef must be 100 percent grass-fed and finished. Chickens need to be organically fed and, ideally, pastured. Whenever I cook meat and bones from any animal, I always offer a prayer of gratitude to thank them for helping me to nourish my body. By Jenna Wunder, MPH, RD My relationship with homemade chicken soup runs deep. Not only has it been my favorite food my entire life, but it is also the first meal I learned to cook for myself. My mom is famous for her chicken soup. I learned from the best. Like many families around the world, we have a traditional chicken soup recipe, passed down through the generations from my grandmother, to my mom, to me, and on it will go. Ours is a Jewish version, with onions, parsnips, carrots, dill, and parsley. Without dill or parsnip \u2014 you've messed with the Jewish chicken soup gods. Once I added garlic. My mom was horrified. I had challenged tradition and lost. As a clinical nutritionist and seasoned cook, I have become a chicken soup expert, teaching my patients every day how to make it the \"right\" way. The key elements involve what is added to the pot and how long it cooks. Meat broth \u2014 whether chicken, beef, lamb, turkey, or something else \u2014 is a soup made with raw meat, skin, joints, and bones, and cooked for short periods, anywhere from two to six hours. Bone broth, on the other hand, is made primarily with bones (surprise) and joints but very little meat or skin. Typically bone broth is cooked for much longer periods than meat broth, from 12 to 72 hours. I'm very specific in how I teach patients to make meat broth. I recommend starting with a whole raw chicken or marrow bones plus meaty beef bones, since we get added benefits from the meat, cartilage, and skin. I recommend using a specific amount of water based on the quantity of meat and bones. The goal is a medicinal broth \u2014 a healing nectar. The benefits of broth are vast. Broth provides valuable minerals in a form your body can easily absorb and use, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, silicon, sul - fur, chondroitin, glucosamine, and a variety of trace minerals. Broth aids digestion by producing and stimulating digestive enzymes. Broth also fights inflammation and infections. If your broth gels when it cools, you also get benefits to your hair, nails, and skin. As a certified GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) practitioner, I learned directly from Dr. Natasha Campbell McBride that homemade meat broth cooked for short cooking times is THE way to heal and seal any holes in our gut lining. Over time, fac - tors such as prolonged stress, exposure to toxins including pesticides and radiation, poor eating choices, and repeated antibiotic and prescription drug use can cause our intestinal lining to develop leaks that allow undigested food, especially protein molecules, to enter our bloodstream. These foreign compounds wreak havoc on our digestive system, immune system, and brain, causing digestive symptoms, auto - immune symptoms, and/or behavioral symptoms in both children and adults. Bone broth has the advantage of being higher in mineral content, but true gut heal - ing happens only with meat broth. I always recommend starting with meat broth. It's essential to the healing quality of the broth that all meat and bones are sourced from the highest quality animals. Beef must be 100 percent grass-fed and finished. Organic beef unfortunately is not suitable because the cows have still been fed corn. Cows cannot digest corn. A corn-fed cow is therefore a sick cow and its fat is inflammatory. Fat from a grass-fed cow, however, is higher in anti-inflammatory fats and is healing to the gut and the brain. Chickens need to be organically fed and, ideally, pastured. Chickens can digest grain, allowing the organic certification to be acceptable, but it's also important that the chicken had access to roam around out - side and eat insects and bugs as nature intended for a healthy chicken. Whenever I cook meat and bones from any animal, I always offer a prayer of gratitude to thank them for helping me to nourish my body.About five years ago, I diag - nosed myself with a severe MSG sensitivity. One night while experiencing head - ache, heart racing, anxiety, and insomnia, I Googled \"alternative names for MSG.\" I knew, for me, that MSG induced migraines so I carefully monitored my diet, but I didn't think I had eaten any MSG that day. I found a page called \"Hidden sources of MSG\" ( www.truthinlabel - ing.org/hiddensources.html ) where I learned that 40 ingredients other than MSG contain the same chemical, processed free glutamic acid, that causes MSG reac - tions! I spent years learning about these ingredients and eliminating them from my diet. I became passionate about teaching my patients about these hidden ingredients and how to avoid them (please see my previous Crazy Wisdom Journal article, archived at www.scribd.com/ document/294847342/Jenna-Wunder-Q-A-PDF). One of the many benefits of broth is the amino acid content. Glutamine is a con - ditionally essential amino acid, meaning our body usually makes it on its own. In a healthy, strong body, glutamine is tightly regulated and helps to maintain brain, immune, and gut function. When your body is weakened and therefore more sensi - tive, even small amounts of glutamine can cause the body to react adversely, causing MSG-like reactions including, headaches, nausea, anxiety, panic, tics, and even seizures. It's for this reason that I recommend short cooking times for broth: the amino acid content, including glutamine, triples as the broth cooks longer. When chicken broth is simmered on the stovetop for only two hours, or four hours on high in a slow cooker, the levels of glutamine are kept to a manageable level (beef broth should be simmered for four hours on the stovetop or six in a slow cooker). This way, you still get the added benefits of the fat, the softened cartilage, and the easily absorbable nutrients that are necessary to heal the gut. Many health care practitioners sing the praises of homemade broth and recommend that their patients buy bones and cook them for 12 to 72 hours \u2014 despite the fact that the long cooking time increases the glutamine content of the broth. Although many people can tolerate long-cooked bone broth, individuals with significant leaky gut symptoms (bloating, fluctuations between diarrhea and constipation, gassy, burpy) or behavioral disruptions (mental fog, inability to focus, anxiety, depression, The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 47 The benefits of broth are vast. Broth provides valuable minerals in a form your body can easily absorb and use. Broth aids digestion by producing and stimulating digestive enzymes. Broth also fights inflammation and infections. If your broth gels when it cools, you also get benefits to your hair, nails, and skin. panic) have an increased tendency to be sensitive to glutamine. Too often, I have seen patients come to me who are making their own bone broth, cooked for long cooking times, and their symptoms have been exacerbated \u2014 migraines, dizziness, nausea, stomach upset, anxiety, difficulty sleeping. Once we shorten the cooking time and add meat, skin, and cartilage to their broth, symptoms improve and real healing can begin.

Ingredients: 4+ lbs raw, whole, pastured, organic chicken 4 large carrots (or 6-8 small) peeled, cut in half or thirds 1 large parsnip (or 2 small) peeled, cut in half or thirds 4 stalks celery with leaves, cut in half 1 large onion, quartered 1/2 bunch curly parsley 1/2 bunch dill (not optional) 1 tsp sugar (my mom insists, although I don't add sugar) 1 Tbsp Celtic or Himalayan sea salt \u00bc tsp ground pepper* Noodles or rice, cooked (optional) Clean chicken and place it in a large stock pot. 1. Add cold water to pot, covering the chicken completely with water. Once the chicken is covered, stop adding water. That's the correct ratio of chicken to water. 2. Bring water and chicken to a boil on high. Once boiling, turn down to a simmer. Soup must be at a low simmer, bubbling but not boiling. Add the remaining ingredients. Cover and let simmer for two hours. 3. You can serve immediately or let cool and strain liquid through a fine mesh sieve to get a clean broth. Separate cooked chicken meat from bones and set aside. Take out carrots and parsnips and set aside with chicken. Do not remove fat \u2014 the fat is essential to the healing quality of the broth. 4. Reheat broth. Do not boil. Add portions of chicken, carrots, and parsnips to individual bowls and ladle hot broth on top. If using, add cooked noodles or rice to each bowl. Season with more salt and ground pepper as desired. *I use about 18 whole peppercorns but Rosie says old ladies use ground pepper, not fancy peppercorns.

See in-store display for other sweet and gluten-free items on special.Vedge Cafe The Ann Arbor foodscape is constantly changing. Downtown lost a great vegetarian and vegan dining option when Back2Roots Bistro (see article in CWJ issue 62) closed last fall. But overlapping that loss was the opening of the new Vedge Cafe, located just two blocks down, near the corner of Main and Ann streets. Vedge Cafe offers a wide and delicious array of fresh vegetarian, vegan, and gluten- free soups, salads, and sandwiches prepared from scratch. The flavors are rich and the dishes are colorful. (I also appreciate the 1990s and early 2000s alternative rock nostalgia soundtrack that plays in the dining room.) You may dine in, carry out, or have your lunch delivered. From their website, Vedge Cafe's mission: Millions are switching to plant-based diets, fully or partially eliminating animal pr oducts from their meals. We are delighted to serve our vegan patrons; however, our real mission is to help those working toward a plant-based diet. As such, you will find some ovo (egg) and lacto (dairy) products on our menu. And they promise \"to serve wholesome, delicious food, while doing [their] best to preserve our most precious asset, earth.\" In this pursuit, Vedge Cafe definitely has a few tricks up its sleeves. The taco salad is not only packed with flavor, but over top is sprinkled \"shredded Cheez,\" so this hearty lunch option is not only gluten-free, but vegan. Whoever says a vegan taco salad can't taste good has never been to Vedge Cafe. It tastes awesome! The lentils and black beans both provide protein so this salad is also plenty filling. For a richer flavor, I suggest the Caramelized Onion and Mushroom Panini. Be sure to grab a fork as this one can also get a little messy! (Deliciously, deliciously messy.) The Southwest Couscous Salad is listed on the sides menu, but it would also make a nice light lunch because of the generous portion size. As for beverages, you have your choice of Power Smoothies, coffee (regular and decaf), hot tea, LaCroix (lemon or lime), San Pellegrino (blood orange or lemon), or bottled water. (There is also an ice water dispenser and clean glasses in the dining room if you're not taking your meal to go.) The staff at Vedge Cafe is friendly and attentive. In four visits, I only once managed to bus my own table, and then only because I narrowly beat the guy to the trash station. (He almost intercepted me; I'm just speedy, I guess. He made a good effort.) As you might have guessed, this is one of my new favorite lunch spots downtown. When the weather is nice, it makes for a pleasant walk and dining experience, so I return to work satiated in body and spirit. What a service! Located at 205 N. Main Street in Ann Arbor, Vedge Cafe is open Tuesday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Order online at vedgecafea2.com or call (734) 929-4485.

Miss Kim is also a tipping free establishment. Gratuity and taxes are included in the prices of the food. Miss Kim You've probably heard there's a new Zingerman's venture in Ann Arbor's Kerrytown called Miss Kim, serving up (according to their website) Korean \"food and drink rooted in tradition and adapted to where we are now.\" \"[O]ur dishes are made from scratch from local ingredients whenever possible, and we work with local farmers to build a menu that changes seasonally.\" This isn't all that makes Miss Kim a unique addition to the Ann Arbor foodscape. Miss Kim is also a tipping free establishment. Gratuity and taxes are included in the prices of the food. The lunch menu is composed of original Banh Mi Sandwiches, Asian Hot Dogs, Rice and Salad Bowls, Gua Bao Buns, and a small assortment of sides and add-ons. Pair with an iced Vietnamese Coffee (Zingerman's cold brew and house-made milk jam) for an afternoon pick-me-up. Dinner is a separate experience with a different menu divided into three plate sizes, small, medium, and large, and the dishes are served family style (meaning everyone at the table takes food from communal platters and places it on their own individual plates). When I went with my husband, we ordered two small plates, Buddhist Chips (lotus root, sweet potato, and kombu seaweed) and Miso Butter Asparagus, and one large plate of Korean Fried Chicken with sweet soy glaze. The fried chicken is also available in chili glaze and lemon pepper, which I think I need to try next time. The asparagus was divine, and I could have eaten two plates all by myself! As for the Buddha Chips, they were made fresh and served warm. The lotus root was chewy while the sweet potato seaweed chips were crisp. Served alongside dinner was a selection of kimchi, and a bowl of rice. Unlike I've usually had at other Korean restaurants, though, this was not plain white rice, but a much more richly flavored Soy Butter Rice. If you aren't used to buttered rice, this could be an acquired flavor for you. It is a perfect example of how Miss Kim puts its own spin on traditional foods. For dessert, I couldn't resist the matcha (green tea) gelato. It was served with sliced strawberries, another interesting flavor combination. (The sweet cream gelato was paired with fresh raspberries.) With so many dinner plate combinations, Miss Kim is sure to delight on repeat visits. Located at 415 North 5th Avenue in Ann Arbor, Miss Kim is open Tuesday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. for dinner, Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. for dinner, and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. for dinner. Find them online at misskimannarbor.com.For dessert, I couldn't resist the matcha (green tea) gelato. The Tteokbokki, Spicy Rice Batons is the perfect plate for when your craving something different.

Mindfulness helps us focus our awareness and recognize what is going on in the present moment, while non-judgmentally accepting our feelings, thoughts, and sensations. Practicing mindfulness is a way to generate calming energy, reduce stress, and take our mind away from daily challenges. Mindfulness improves our ability to learn and communicate. It also improves our quality of life by bringing joy, peace, understanding, compassion, and physical and emotional well-being. To be effective, it is important to practice mindfulness daily in unison with nature, particularly with animals who eloquently model this mind-body connection. Close, mutually- beneficial relationships with other species promote trust, reduce fear, increase empathy, and foster mindfulness \u2014 all elements necessary for effective relationships and our well-being. Mindfulness is enhanced when combined with equine assisted therapy. Within the animal kingdom, horses are the closest to humans psychologically. This means that horses can connect with us on a very deep emotional level, and they are very intuitive. The relationship between humans and horses is synergistic. Horses are unconditional and non-judgmental. They have a way of breaking down any barriers and defenses people might have, reducing stress and allowing opportunities to temporarily forget about daily challenges and worries. Horses are attuned to their surroundings and do not have the social filters to sift through to make decisions. Horses are excellent teachers of effective mindfulness strategies. They live entirely in the present because, historically, they have needed to be fully aware of their surroundings for survival. They are also very effective communicators and connect with their herd via breathing and movements in a peaceful and genuine manner. To communicate and interact with a horse effectively, we have to be mindful and develop an awareness that matches theirs. Horses respond in the present moment and accurately reflect back to us \u2014 i.e., if we are anxious, they will be anxious as well, whereas if we are calm, we will have a soothing effect on them. So, in order for them to effectively engage with us, we need to be calm, harmonious, and present. Through mindfulness augmented by equine assisted therapy, we have the opportunity to learn and grow. Horses exemplify equanimity, a state of mental calmness, composure, and evenness of temper. Equanimity is an essential leadership skill in stressful situations for both horses and humans. By interacting with horses we can learn effective herd dynamics by being open, observant, and objective. Horses are consummate teachers of the ability to recognize our emotions and those of others so that we can identify and calm the emotions we are experiencing, rather than being reactive and overwhelmed. The horses provide immediate feedback that require us to stay in the moment and shift our behavior to respond appropriately. They teach us to foster equanimity by centering ourselves first and then communicate with clarity, intention, and compassion so that we are effective in our daily lives. Augmenting mindfulness with equine assisted therapy allows us to partner with horses and learn from them to be present and aware of our inner world and how it is projected and perceived by our external environment. By becoming in tune with our animal nature and innate drive for survival, we respond with wise choices rather than reacting to situations. We no longer feel pressure from others to do things their way or at the mercy of our old habits. When we achieve self-mastery by learning from horses, we can now better regulate our emotional states, engage with authenticity, communicate effectively, and be empathetic, even during stressful situations. Thus combining mindfulness with equine assisted therapy results in increased awareness and understanding, and thus we can be more effective in our lives and relationships. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 50 At the Michigan Abilities Center (MAC), we combine mindfulness with equine assisted therapy using either groundwork, mounted work, or a combination. Sessions are open to those of all ages and abilities, with the age range being 2 to 93 years old. Those with special needs also benefit from mindfulness during their sessions. While groundwork sessions are very effective, augmenting mindfulness sessions with riding heightens the experience due to the unique tri-planar rhythmic motion of the horse in unison with the rider. Equine assisted activities and therapies are often more effective than traditional therapies because the horse's rhythmic movement is very close to human motion. Horses are also very intuitive and bond closely with humans. Best of all, the horses make therapy fun and engaging! It is a very rewarding and empowering experience. Improvements from equine assisted activities and therapies include: activities of daily living, attention, balance, cognition, coordination, empowerment, endurance, life skills, motor control, posture, respiration, self-esteem, self-regulation, sleep, speech, strength, tone, transitions, trust, and physical and emotional well-being. The Michigan Abilities Center is located at Heritage Hill Haven, a 60-acre farm environment that provides a natural setting for mindfulness sessions. Being outdoors is known to improve your mood and allows you to be more relaxed and focused. Being at the farm and seeing the horses brings a feeling of peace and is an optimal environment for mindfulness. Discover how combining \"horsepower\" and farm life with mindfulness, therapy, and learning makes horse sense! Kathleen A. Hinderer, P .T., M.P .T., M.S., Ph.D., is a physical therapist and Executive Director of the Michigan Abilities Center at Heritage Hill Haven. The types of equine assisted activities and therapies offered at MAC in combination with mindfulness include hippotherapy, equine assisted learning and mental health, therapeutic riding, recreational riding, experiential learning, life skills, and soft skills training.

Holistic Law The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 52 Martha Travers \u2014 Conversations with the Elements The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 53 Conversations with the Elements ~ An Interview with Martha Travers on Bringing Nature-Based Shamanistic Practices to the U of M Martha Travers is a beloved teacher at the University of Michigan who shares the wisdom of contemplative nature-based practices with her students. Her courses are influenced by her own shamanic practices, and provide a space for students of all walks of life to listen to their inner voices. For me, Martha's classes were a deep breath in the chaos, my fulcrum point, my outlet to investigate what was going on internally, and a place where I could and was encouraged to simply \"be.\" Her new book, The WayCard Oracle: A Guide to the Inner Journey, is available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. I sat down with Martha on her patio outside her little house on a hill, overlooking grassy gardens and surrounded by woods in Manchester. Her sweet dog, Violet, accompanied us and ran circles around the yard. Nadia Todoroff: What do you do around Ann Arbor? Martha Travers: I do not live in Ann Arbor, but I have been teaching here at the University of Michigan on and off for many years. I did my graduate work at the University of Michigan, a Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, in the late 1970s and taught writing while a graduate student. I taught at Michigan State University for a couple years after graduating in the mid-1980s, but chose to stay home with my children after my second child was born in 1987. I returned to U-M in the early 1990s and again taught writing for a couple years before beginning to homeschool my children around 1994. Since my own undergraduate days in the mid-1970s, I had been a student of meditation and other forms of contemplative practice, including shamanism. In a very interesting and unexpected way, in 2005, I was invited to return to U-M by Ed Sarath, Founder and, at that time, Chair of the Jazz Department in the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance, to teach a contemplative studies course in his newly-created Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies. (See our interview with Ed Sarath in Issue 55.) Since that time, I have been teaching as a Lecturer in the Jazz Department's contemplative studies area. I teach various forms of contemplative practice and am especially interested in what I call \"nature-based contemplative practice.\" I also teach workshops and retreats in various places in Michigan, including most recently at the small farm where I live near Manchester. I call it \"Blessed Bee Farm,\" and I am excited to share it with others as a place for retreat and restoration. Nadia Todoroff: If you were to give yourself a \"title\" for what you do, what would that be? Martha Travers: I usually use the word \"guide\" when I refer to my retreats or workshops and to my teaching at the University. My role is to act as a guide for people's unfolding, for the unfolding of their inner path. If I were to name myself, I would call myself a \"mystic.\" That is not because I thought it sounded like something I wanted to do or be; it's because of experiences that I've had during many years of living in the country. In those experiences, I experienced the sense of union with nature \u2014 the nature that we are. The really important recognition is that we are nature, and so if we allow ourselves to be really quiet and simple in nature we then feel that connection. And to me that is mystical \u2014 that sense of oneness with everything. Nadia Todoroff: Do you have any childhood experiences that introduced you to the nature-based path? Martha Travers: Not so much as a child. I think that children are already connected, that the experience of the child is an experience of mystical oneness. It's as we grow older and through conventional education that we begin to lose that primary connection that we are born with. But as I became older and experienced more distance and separation from myself, then for me a primary experience was as a mother, giving birth, and also gardening. Those two experiences for me were very profound teachers of my essential oneness.During the years that I was a mother, I lived in a relatively rural and remote setting compared to living in a city. My second child was born at home in 1987. Through that experience, I began to learn about medicinal plants. Then I began growing medicinal plants. As soon as you start actually growing the plants, then that teaching relationship begins to develop even more than previously. So I would say that giving birth at home, encountering medicinal plants, and growing medicinal plants were initiatory experiences. Todoroff: What is nature-based practice and why is it important?Travers: Nature-based practice, the way I guide it, is to help us reconnect with the nature of which we are a part, through opening a conversation between ourselves and the elements. I am speaking of the earth, the water, the fire, and the air. I learned some of these practices from Indigenous Kichwa teachers in the Andes mountains. There I learned very specific ways of renewing our connection with the elements. It's important to emphasize that this connection is already there. It's not like it's something we are creating. But that connection has been impeded for various reasons in individuals. And so the experience of having a conversation with nature, speaking with the water, speaking with the air, speaking with the fire, speaking with the earth, is the center of the nature-based contemplative practice. This also includes, as we move deeper into working with the elements, very simple practices like lying down on the ground, the whole body on the earth. The encounter with water \u2014 meaning the drinking of water, the greeting of the water, the feeling of the passage of the water through the body, and the expression of gratitude to the water \u2014 these are also examples of practice. The foods that we eat, the way that we relate to our foods, the way the foods are grown, the way that we prepare the foods, and the way we take in these foods are all part of our relationship with the earth element. And so, this is also part of nature-based contemplative practice \u2014 to cultivate an actual communication with the food, an opening of the energy channel between the individual and the food that they're eating. My experience is that nature is a great teacher, and that the more time we spend quietly in nature without an agenda the more connected we feel with our own inner path, and also with the cosmos of which we are a part. Todor off: What are steps we can take in cultivating a relationship with the elements? Travers: The first part is greeting, saying hello. That act of greeting is an acknowledgement of the presence of an energy. The air, the water, the earth, and the fire are presences that permeate our lives to such a degree that we are less aware of them in a way, because they are so prevalent. So this first step in the practice of saying \"hello,\" of greeting, is an act of recognition. It's a way of saying, \"I see you, I honor you, I respect you.\" And then, after that, we move into the receptive phase \u2014 that phase of being still and quiet with the water that we're drinking or with the food that we're eating or with the ground that we are sitting or lying down on. That stage of deep silence and openness is our opportunity to feel what we are receiving from the elements. And then it's very important to express gratitude when we feel complete, when we feel that we're ready to move on. That expression of gratitude is a central part of the practice. Todoroff: How have these practices shaped your life?Travers: I hope that I am more able to be in rapport with nature in a way that is doing less harm. And also that I have more ability to listen to my intuition and follow intuitive guidance because of this rapport with nature. Todoroff: How do you feel intuition and nature are connected?Travers: So if we go to this basic principle that we are nature, part of our way is to instinctively know how to be with nature \u2014 to go with nature rather than work against nature. But because of years of industrialization and separation from daily encounters with growing our own food, or building a fire to keep ourselves warm, By Nadia TodoroffPhotography by Susan Ayer For me, Martha's classes were a deep breath in the chaos, my fulcrum point... I teach various forms of contemplative practice and am especially interested in what I call \"nature-based contemplative practice.\"The really important recognition is that we are nature, and so if we allow ourselves to be really quiet and simple in nature we then feel that connection. And to me that is mystical \u2014 that sense of oneness with everything. Continued on page 54The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 54 or finding water \u2014 because we've been separated from those daily encounters, we are also separated from that more instinctual side of ourselves that knows how to be in relationship with nature. So that's why it's so important to reconnect, and then that brings up that intuitive knowing that we all have. I'm sure many people have experienced taking an afternoon, going to a park, sitting in the backyard, going for a walk, and in that moment or in that time period receiving intuitive insights about their lives that they would not have received if they had not taken that time to be quiet in nature. Todoroff: Earlier you mentioned learning nature-based practices in the Andes mountains. What brought you there? Travers: I was invited to go to Ecuador by one of the elders who had come up to the University of Michigan, along with a group of shamanic teachers from the Amazon and the Andes mountains. They were speaking at a conference at the University of Michigan School of Medicine. The conference included a session on alternative philosophies of health and healing. That first event was in the fall of 1999. Then the f ollowing spring of 2000, there was a workshop here in this area. One of the teachers from the Andes, Alberto Taxo, guided at that workshop. He invited anyone who felt called to come to the Andes to spend some time with his family, to feel the teachings that were coming from the mountains, from the condor, from the wind, from the fire, from the song and from the dance and from the way that the people move there. Todoroff: What did you learn there? Travers: I traveled to the Andes many times between 2000 and 2009. On the first trip, I was only there for 10 days, but during that 10 days, I experienced a huge shift in my sense of self. When I got on the plane to go back to the States after that first trip, this awareness came just as the plane was lifting up for take-off out of Quito. I felt that I had just passed through as much change as would happen in seven, seven-year cycles. It's not easy for me to isolate an individual experience, as much as to say that the experience was one that I felt my physical being cleansed, my emotional being cleansed, and my spiritual self receiving support. That first journey was a very stabilizing experience. Todoroff: Did that experience influence your practices back in the States?Travers: I don't think it changed an external practice because I already was, even before I traveled to the Andes, doing these practices in my own way, these practices of communion with nature. It did activate in me a desire to share these teachings beyond my small circle of family. So it's not so much that it changed the way that I practiced, as that it encouraged me, invited me, and motivated me to reach out to offer to share these practices with people who might want t o have these experiences. Todor off: What led you to teach contemplative studies and nature-based practice at the University of Michigan? Travers: I actually first met Ed Sarath in Ecuador. He also went on that first trip to learn from the elders in the Andes in the year 2000. It was about five years later that he invited me to return to the University of Michigan to teach contemplative practices in the Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies. I was not in any Martha Travers \u2014 Conversations with the Elements Continued from page 53 I was invited to go to Ecuador by one of the elders who had come up to the University of Michigan [Alberto Taxo], along with a group of shamanic teachers from the Amazon and the Andes mountains.On the first trip [to the Andes], I was only there for 10 days, but during that 10 days, I experienced a huge shift in my sense of self...

The connection between my early years teaching writing at the University and these years teaching contemplative practices is my interest in inner development. Back when I was teaching writing, I discovered that what students most needed was to access their voice. I realized that in order to write well, students needed to care about what they were writing, and that in order to care about what they were writing, they needed to have it really coming from a deep sense of themselves. So in the experience of working with young people with writing, I discovered that I was most interested in helping people access that deep self. When I decided to home-school, I left the University. During that time, between 1994 and 2004, I continued to do this work of helping people access their deep self through offering small workshops and retreats. I think of the deep self as our inner voice or inner dream. One of my teachers, Cheryl Stereff, who did a lot of shamanic guiding in Ann Arbor during the 1980s and 90's, referred to this as \"the dream of paradise.\" My work is to help us access this place in ourselves, to help us envision a beautiful, harmonious existence, and to help us discover how we can express our own gift in life. What are we really trying to give? What are we seeking? Not for ourselves, but to give to others. That's the energy. It's the way the energy moves from us, outward. In order to give it outward, we need first to access it. So my work is to help people access it. And that's what everything I do ultimately is about. It's about accessing that inner dream, and then creating the path, opening the path. Todoroff: What classes do you teach now at the University of Michigan? Travers: I teach a course called \"The Contemplative Practices Seminar,\" which is an introduction to sitting meditation, walking meditation, contemplative reading, and reflective writing. I also teach a course that is thematically based. The theme differs in different terms. Currently, the theme is \"Finding Your Way,\" and we are using my new book in that class. The book is called The WayCard Oracle: A Guide to the Inner Journey (Schiffer Books, 2016; available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore). The book includes a deck of oracle cards and a guide book. In the class, the students are using the WayCards to help them recognize the, shall we say, inner archetypal energies that are propelling their lives. In addition to using the WayCards, students learn sitting meditation and nature-based contemplation in this class. In the winter semester I teach a course that is about the nature of consciousness, and because it's such a big field, I narrow it to how we experience consciousness coming to us from nature. In order to do that we explore shamanism and Indigenous perspectives on the nature of consciousness. So those are the three courses. I'm not the only person who teaches courses like this. Professor Ed Sarath teaches different courses in the contemplative field. He is a leading scholar in the field of consciousness studies, and so he is a really important resource for students who want to learn more about the academic, scholarly field of consciousness studies. The program that Ed designed, the Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies, is groundbreaking. Todoroff: What do you hope your students will gain from taking your classes? Travers: I hope my students will be able to access their intuitive side, and will recognize that the intellect and reasoning are essential aspects of the human being, and that with those essential aspects of the intellect and reason, the intuition is the part that has been often, in the dominant culture, ignored or suppressed. This side of ourselves is often also described as \"the feminine,\" not meaning gender specifically, meaning an energy we all have no matter which gender we identify with, and that intuitive, receptive \u2014 sometimes called \"yin\" \u2014 side of ourselves needs to be given space. So I hope that my students will be in balance more when they leave my classes, that they will be using their capacity to reason and their intellect and that they will also be able to access and trust their intuition. Todoroff: Who have been your greatest teachers on your path?Travers: When I began to experience the shamanic side of my life, Crow was a very important energy. And the woods that I lived in, which I heard receive a name, \"Duirhaven.\" \"Duir\" is the Celtic word for \"oak,\" so it means \"Haven of the Oaks.\" And then prior to that \u2014 and really most importantly \u2014 my children. Giving birth and being close to the spiritual cleanliness and openness of an infant was a great, great teacher to me. So in the experience of working with young people with writing, I discovered that I was most interested in helping people access that deep self.And so the experience of having a conversation with nature, speaking with the water, speaking with the air, speaking with the fire, speaking with the earth, is the center of the nature-based contemplative practice.

It's already how we are, it's already who we are. And so our practices are helping us uncover this self that already is present. So for someone beginning it's easy to be caught up in ego and in wanting and in trying to produce results. So the most important thing is to remember that all we have to do is lie down on the ground. All we have to do is sit quietly in meditation. All we have to do is express gratitude to the water when we drink it. Express gratitude to the food when we eat it. Express gratitude to the sunlight and to the rain. Express gratitude to our family. To the animals who inhabit the world with us. Be careful to not do harm. One other thing. I think one of the most important characteristics for this path is sincerity. If a person is sincere in their desire to learn, everything will come in its own way and its own time. Todor off: Are there any books you'd like to recommend for those wishing to pursue nature-based practices? Travers: There's a wonderful, recent book by Robin Wall Kimmerer called Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants (Milkweed Editions, 2015) that is an expert distillation of Indigenous wisdom (she is Potawatomi) and the scientific understandings of a biologist. Kimmerer tells beautiful stories that give the reader the experience of communion \u2014 this very conversation with nature that I was speaking about. She helps the reader experience that communication, that way of conversing with the earth, the water, the fire, and the air. I would also suggest an older book written by Doug Boyd. The title is Rolling Thunder (Delta, 1976). This is a description of Boyd's encounter with a Cherokee/Shoshone medicine man in the United States in the early 1970s. The other book that I would recommend is Joan Halifax, The Fruitful Darkness: A Journey Through Buddhist Practice and Tribal Wisdom (Grove Press, 2004), an absolutely brilliant and compelling book \u2014 a beautiful description of her path and the union in her path of Buddhism and shamanism. Todoroff: Will you be teaching any workshops around the area for those not able to take your classes at U-M? Travers: Yes, and anyone who would like to know about my retreats can go to my website, which is natureandhealing.org. The website describes the retreats. I offer some in Southeast Michigan, and I also teach in Northwest Michigan at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park, and at the Fetzer Institute's GilChrist Retreat Center in Southwest Michigan. I also do phone consultations, readings of the WayCards, or guidance on the nature-based path. Last year I began an apprenticeship program for people who want to study with me over a longer period of time. This is something a person can do at a distance. They do not need to live in Michigan to apprentice to me. For more info contact Martha at mwtravers@natureandhealing.org, or visit her website natureandhealing.org.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 56 The way it happened with Crow is that I would have visitations when I was in my yard. Maybe I was gardening or lying down in the tall, wild grasses. And you know how crows are \u2014 they are a very communicative bird. There would be these patterns. They would show up, calling and swirling into the yard, and there would always be three of them. The first time I really noticed this crow pattern actually was not in my yard. It was when I was teaching, and I was on my way to work in the early morning. Three crows were sitting on what appeared to be an extremely light blade of grass that could not have possibly supported those three crows up above the ground like that. It was a windy day and the trees and things around them were moving, but there was no movement. The crows and what they were sitting on, a weed perhaps, were perfectly still. So moments like that call one's attention. That would be what we may call an annunciation \u2014 a moment when nature says, \"Ah, pause, see. There's more here than might first appear.\" I'm not too into interpreting. My path is not so much to say, \"Oh those crows were telling me to do thus and so.\" My feeling is that moments like that are nature's way of saying \"pause, open, listen.\" It's not about grabbing for information or an interpretation. It's just about pausing and opening and listening. And so then what happens, gradually over time, there's an energetic change. My personal experience of it would be to say that this change is physical. It is happening at a cellular level. So the body begins to wake up to its nature, and that means that this instinctual and intuitive aspect of ourselves also starts to wake up as the body is waking up. So it's not so much that these teachers are coming with specific information for me. That's not been my experience. My experience is that they encourage me to connect. And that with that feeling of connection gradually over time I receive, through my own energy field, insights and awarenesses that guide me on my path. Todoroff: What are you continuously learning through your practices? Travers: Well, I hope I'm learning humility. I hope that I'm learning to let go of needing to be in a certain place, in a certain way, at a certain time. I hope that I'm learning to take care of the life support systems on the planet in a more conscious way than maybe I had been doing previously. Todoroff: Do you have any advice for people starting on the nature-based path?Travers: First of all I would say trust yourself. Don't give your power away to teachers or to externals. And know that everything you need is already with you. This is one of the most important teachings of contemplative practice. That we are already there. Our practice is helping us remove the veils that separate us from our true nature. So there can be a great ease in practice. It does not have to be this intense strain, [On Crow:] My experience is that they encourage me to connect. And that with that feeling of connection gradually over time I receive, through my own energy field, insights and awarenesses that guide me on my path. It's about accessing that inner dream, and then creating the path, opening the path.Martha Travers \u2014 Conversations with the Elements Continued from page 55 If a person is sincere in their desire to learn, everything will come in its own way and its own time.Martha Travers Book Suggestions \u2014Robin Wall Kimmerer, Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants (Milkweed Editions, 2015) An expert distillation of Indigenous wisdom (she is Potawatomi) and the scientific understandings of a biologist.

On this beautiful morning, with the grasses just coming through the dark soil and the buds forming on the trees, Detroit and its wide blue sky surprised me with how welcoming it felt. Driving on Gratiot headed toward Mt. Elliott Street, I was in the heart of downtown Detroit, just a mile or so away from Ford Field. It seems only small businesses are here, a Mr. Fish and a crowded shop selling second hand furniture, likely for a charity. In this place on this map, blocks of the grid are disappearing. Fallow fields sit waiting in their place. I pulled up to a bright brick church anchored strong amidst open green plots and dilapidated, boarded-up structures. There is a man sitting on a milkcrate. He is sentinel of this corner. A security guard standing on the grass looks me over, then softens. School children are lining up on the grass about to be escorted on a tour. I see a gardener planting bright pink annuals around the church's signage. This is a beautiful place, part of a bigger compound that houses Brother Jerry Smith and the Capuchin Soup Kitchen. I am here to learn more about how one charitable organization is lifting up Detroit. This Meldrum location, where breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served Monday through Friday, and people can get a hot shower and a change of clothes, is part of a much larger Capuchin charitable organization and effort throughout Detroit. For over 125 years, the Capuchin friars, staff, and volunteers have been placing their faith in action here. For children, people who are hungry, who are housing insecure, and those who need re-entry support, recovery services, and job training, this is a place of refuge, making the Capuchin Ministries of Detroit one of the city's most respected charities. As I turn the corner to get to the soup kitchen, I am struck by a giant modern hoop house. It has an \"Earthworks Urban Farm\" sign on the fence. Standing in the sunlight across from this structure were people milling about looking like they were expected somewhere \u2014 guests of the Capuchins. In the parking lot, I pulled into a spot next to a farm stand that says \"produce processing.\" Behind it is another giant hoop house with plants growing on the periphery. There is a shed behind the farm stand with a cardboard sign announcing \"Bike repair Wednesdays, noon to 3\" and another announcing \"in case of snow, rain, or heavy hail, bike repairs will be in the hoop house.\" The front of the soup kitchen is an unassuming grey door. There is a man happily working at sweeping the parking lot. He is quietly greeting people arriving for the 11 a.m. start to lunch service. He is wearing a black t-shirt and a white apron. He sweeps into a small handheld dustpan, bent down against a backdrop of large metal structures framing squares of sky, stacked like interlocking cubes two stories high. I make a mental note to ask Brother Jerry about this industrial sculpture that hovers above the parking lot. As I enter the dining room, there is great anticipation in the air as people greet each other and take a seat at the tables, catching up until the lunch line will be formed. A lively woman at a small round table is registering voters. People are smiling at each other, greeting one another, and tipping a nod to me in welcome. I am waiting for Brother Jerry, not sure if I need to be where I am. I smile as I realize the Capuchin friars here wear brown robes. Later, in the office halls, I will see a sign on someone's door with the image of a friar with his arms spread out: Keep calm and wear brown. Standing there waiting for Brother Jerry Smith, I begin to get a feel for this place. It is deeply urban, yet the presence of the Capuchin mission \u2014 humble, welcoming, warm \u2014 is higher than this. The people here are Detroiters, and while they come from every walk of life, many are middle aged and elderly people of color, and there are perhaps more men in the room than women. I notice a few younger people, and though I know they serve many families, it is a school day and children are not present. As people chat, I can feel mutual respect in their exchanges, and that being here is very important to the movements of their day. People are looking each other in the eyes and speaking with open faces. Mostly laughter rises above the conversation. Lunch is almost ready. The mission of the Capuchin Soup Kitchen is displayed on the wall. It is very uplifting and gives me a sense of calm. Inspired by the life and spirit of St. Francis of Assisi, we: tend to people's basic needs, especially the need for food, strive to stimulate minds and nourish spirits, and work to understand and address root causes of social injustice in our community.In all we do, we seek to build alliances with others who share a commitment to thisvision. The kitchen first opened in 1929, in response to the Great Depression when people would knock on the monastery door asking for food. Over time, as the line grew to 2,000 people waiting for their single meal of the day, the friars knew they needed to do more. They worked with community members to collect food from farms, make soup, bake bread, and serve meals in the hall next to the monastery. Today the operation has matured into a stalwart fixture in the community it serves. A friar in a brown robe helps me find Brother Jerry. Brother Jerry had been away coordinating with the head of the soup kitchen staff. He brings me to them. With a white chef's coat on, the woman running the kitchen is very full of purpose and happy. I quickly shake her hand and she beams. Brother Jerry also greets me with a big smile. He is, in a word, jolly. Brother Jerry, by the way, is not to be confused with Capuchin Soup Kitchen's new director as of spring 2017, Brother Jerry Johnson, who took over when Smith was Transformation Is Here ~ Capuchin Ministries of Detroit By Maureen McMahonPhotography by Joni Strickfaden I am here to learn more about how one charitable organization is lifting up Detroit.

We meet a volunteer who is distributing shower kits, towels, and fresh clothes for guests who have signed up for a hot shower. These facilities are just off the dining room, with two showers providing an average of 25 hot showers a day. Brother Jerry mentions they are about to upgrade the steam vents to commercial grade, giving me a small insight into the level of facilities management that they work in every day \u2014 meeting basic needs at high volume. There is a simple and effective system for people to select a freshly washed outfit after their shower. They are encouraged to leave their old clothes so that they can be washed and recycled into this system of donations. I smile to think of how this is grace, how it feels like starting a new day. There is a much bigger clothing distribution operation at another Capuchin Ministries site. They distribute 1,500 articles of clothing and 11 appliances or pieces of furniture each weekday. Brother Jerry toured me around the administrative offices, pointing out that two weeks ago they gathered everything into one room to lay fresh carpet. This building is not old and there are clearly continual upgrades refining it. It feels very intentional.

Represented are four men and four women who exemplified a particular beatitude during the last 60 years. Founded in 1883, St. Bonaventure Monastery is the residence of many of the Detroit Capuchin friars and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Its presence is an anchor for the neighborhood of lower Eastside of Detroit. Its lit steeple provides a pathway to those seeking peace in the adjacent Monastery Chapel and Solanus Casey Center. In what will be a very big day for Detroit, the beatification Mass making Father Solanus Casey a Catholic saint will be said on November 18 at Ford Field, which can accommodate as many as 60,000. Venerable Casey will be the second American-born male to be beatified.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 61 I meet an administrator who explains she is in charge of arranging HR services, including pension and healthcare, for 80 employees. There are three volunteer coordinators who lead their hundreds of volunteers. Many of the guests also volunteer, giving back by wiping down tables, serving on the food line, putting shower kits together, or helping to keep the parking lot tidy. I ask Brother Jerry if there are a lot of friars. He said there are three, as well as a priest and a Dominican nun. The rest are lay. I think of how this is a much bigger operation than I was aware of. That this is about meeting needs at the point of asking for them. He shows me the office door of Brother Joe, a friar who is a leader in their work with substance abuse support and counseling. This includes Jefferson House, an extended residential treatment program for substance abuse recovery, housing men for nine months. He explained his job includes running four support groups a week and doing ministry to those in need of these services. The meetings held in the dining room at Meldrum in the evenings are full, with people sharing their love with each other and sharing their stories. Standing there in the hallway, Brother Jerry holds his heart and bows, saying \"it is deep and profound.\" I can feel his pride in this work, and more so, his pride in the people who join him to do it. Deep and profound are words he will use two or three more times in our morning together. When he described how their services \"really run the gamut\" of what people who show up need, he added, \"It's holistic.\" A legal services clinic, a dental office for their guests, appointments for medical services, job placement, and job training. As I think of the expansiveness of their services, I am inspired by how wide the reach. There is a much bigger clothing distribution operation at another Capuchin Ministries site. They distribute 1,500 articles of clothing and 11 appliances or pieces of furniture each weekday. Later, at home, I read Brother Joe's words in their Breaking Bread newsletter summing up his experience of his Jefferson House work. He named it \"hopelessness transformed.\" He recently handed his leadership over to Amy Kinner, and in his goodbye note described his witness to that process as his greatest satisfaction. He recalled a man who was deeply addicted to heroin and was often in and out of the hospital. That man is now sober, married with a child, and running a small business. \"He is a stunning example of the triumph of the human spirit, of the power of recovery, of life over death.\" Beyond counseling and support groups, Brother Jerry mentions On The Rise, their re- entry job training and housing program for those who have recently been in prison or completed substance abuse treatment. At On the Rise Bakery Caf\u00e9, located at 8900 Gratiot, so far over 70 men have apprenticed with other bakers, transforming themselves into bakers of breads, pastries, and pies \u2014 and eventually mentors prepared to help the next baker coming into the program. They learn customer service in the deli and sell at local churches. They interact with customers who come into their storefront to buy baked goods or have lunch, and also with the Capuchin volunteers. One baker spoke in Breaking Bread of what re-entry can do, explaining that the volunteers set an example: \"When we are in our addictive state, we get out of touch with society. The volunteers give us context.\" Brother Jerry encouraged me to read about their Rosa Parks Art Studio & Children's Library, a site 2.5 miles east where the Capuchins focus on connecting with children to strengthen community. Their mission includes exploring with children alternatives to violence. Gathered in a lending library of over 5,000 books, 6 to 15 year-olds and adult volunteers connect through tutoring and art therapy sessions. Kids can relax and have fun doing seasonal activities like Christmas cookie baking and decorating Easter eggs. Teen boys' and girls' groups and a junior counselor program focus on developing youth leadership. They run a summer peace camp with art, drama, music, dance, peacemaking classes, and field trips. Other summer priorities include a leadership camp, an academic camp, and a garden program that meets four times a week throughout what they call \"the Peace Garden season.\" Rosa Parks site Director Nancyann Turner, O.P ., wrote that working with children to tend the flowers, vegetables, and \"tire gardens\" is \"an incredible source of learning for our children. The garden builds community among our families and contributes to the well being and beauty of our struggling Detroit.\" Continued from page 59Capuchin Ministries of Detroit \"Brother Jerry encouraged me to read about their Rosa Parks Art Studio & Children's Library, a site 2.5 miles east where the Capuchins focus on connecting with children to strengthen community.

He named it \"hopelessness transformed.\" Brother Jerry is eager to take me to see the Earthworks Urban Farm sites, the two green hoop houses outside...

Shop and consider having the dinner be a fundraiser to support Earthworks. Three Questions for Patrick Crouch, Earthworks Farm Manager What's the happies t thing about working at Earthworks for you, Patrick? I get to spend my days working with plants and soils and meeting people from all sorts of walks of life without ever having to leave the garden. What feels like the common purpose shared by the volunteers at Earthworks?I don't think there is a common purpose. People come to be at Earthworks for all kinds of reasons: a desire to give back to the community; developing their gardening skills; meeting new people; feeling a sense of community; obtaining locally grown organic vegetables. How do you feel Earthworks is uplifting Detroit? I'm not a fan of this question \u2014 as it assumes Detroit being at a detriment and that it is in need of lifting. It fails to consider the systemic issues that have caused Detroit's disinvestment. However, I'll do my best to answer the question. I think that Earthworks is one of many projects in Detroit that has been inspired by the ideas of Grace and Jimmy Boggs, to think of what community members can do to transform not just their surroundings but themselves as well. Earthworks serves as a community space where we can grow our relationship with the Earth, each other, and ourselves. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 63 Back at the soup kitchen, throughout our visit, guests greet Brother Jerry as a friend, as their uncle, as someone they are eager to joke with. They all want to talk about how far back they go with him. One man said, \"I'm fifteen years an employee, but we go back longer than that \u2014 if you know what I mean.\" He and Brother Jerry laugh. This is Brother Jerry's family. Brother Jerry is eager to take me to see the Earthworks Urban Farm sites, the two green hoop houses outside. We exit into the parking lot, again in the shadow of that huge metal structure. I asked, Is this a burnt out building? An intentional structure? An afterthought? A leftover pile from scrappers? He explained it is not the Capuchins' but a neighbor's who has stored frames for hanging car parts as a car is stripped. This neighbor has stacked them into an odd sculpture for storage. \"We're kind of used to it.\" In steep contrast to this, we enter the warm energy of the hoop houses at the other ends of this parking lot. We stoop under the plastic of one and into its steamy air, thick with the aroma of fertile soil and green growth. Growing in neat rows are organic leafy greens, producing 12 months a year. The Ford Motor Company donated this structure and much of the soup kitchen's bounty comes from here. Brother Jerry shows me three impressive cisterns that collect rainwater to water the plants. He tells me the water and heating system is very sophisticated and solar powered. They won an Erb grant to pay for it. The light is bright in here on a cool spring day. There are strings hanging in rows where soon tomato plants will climb. Brother Jerry smiled, making a circle with his hand to describe the tomatoes that will peek out from beautiful green vines rising high to the roof of the hoop house later in the summer. As we crouched under and over suspended twine and hoses, he shared with me that physical movements can be challenging because his foot is affected by MS. He made it seem very matter-of-fact, happy to maneuver around the farm with me, and gave me a larger sense of appreciation for what his work has been. In the other hoop house an impressive plant starter operation is underway. Earthworks interns have a soil composite recipe up on a white board that they follow as they scoop, consolidate, and plant. Many of the interns were once guests of the Capuchin Soup Kitchen. This work is here to connect them to the land, to teach them about nutrition, but also to give them practical training in running an enterprise. They can work with plants and in an aviary producing honey. Here they learn in a formalized sequence, covering topics like ag business, soil and compost, seed procurement, and farmers' markets and sales. One woman shared with me how it has changed how she thinks about food, how she has planted an edible garden at home, and taken up baking her own bread. Baking bread was common in her grandmother's home; a part of her heritage she'd left behind until coming here. With a laugh, she said, \"C'mon, I can bake my own bread! It can't be that hard!\" She was so happy to be her own bread baker. Brother Jerry circled us back to the lunchroom so we could get in line for some spaghetti. He led me to a table shared with five other guests. Conversation turned to one of the guests, a television producer from Europe who had been filming the day before in East Detroit. Guests of the soup kitchen had been her guides, showing her the squat houses they were staying at and helping her to understand how to tell a story about their lives. She said Europe still sees Detroit as the Motor City, and that it's important to show the world what is really going on here, in one of the biggest cities in the wealthiest nation. I was reminded of my intention to understand uplift. I turned to Brother Jerry and tried to engage him in a conversation about what the city feels like to him. I asked, What does the vibration of this place feel like to you? Wondering if I was asking the right question \u2014 a concern I was met with when I asked the same question to the Earthworks Farm Manager \u2014 he carefully answered: \"I'm not interested in the vibration of Detroit. I'm interested in how the guests of the soup kitchen see themselves.\" He said the Capuchins have been here since 1929, and though it's nice to think otherwise, the neighborhood hasn't gotten better. We discussed the question, Can one place change the whole? He explained that the soup kitchen is shifting its operational model from direct services, or what he called \"giving He explained that the soup kitchen is shifting its operational model from direct services, or what he called \"giving them free food,\" to a more interwoven, invested model like the Earthworks intern program, where 12 interns from the community of people who use their services learn about urban farming, sustainability, and agriculture. Continued on page 64Continued from page 61Capuchin Ministries of Detroit them free food,\" to a more interwoven, invested model like the Earthworks intern program, where 12 interns from the community of people who use their services learn about urban farming, sustainability, and agriculture. Beyond its mission of \"building a just, beautiful food system,\" Earthworks is where Detroiters restore connection to their environment and community. I felt him explain Capuchin Soup Kitchen is where you go when you need a hand up. After our meal, Brother Jerry continued to be very generous with his time. He escorted me back to the parking lot where farm meets city, where purpose finds the people who need it, and I felt this was a strong place of anchoring \u2014 a calm bay surrounded by once fallow fields that now, through vision, fellowship, and volunteerism, feed the community. I left in gratitude with one encounter from my time at the soup kitchen that has stayed with me to this day. Moments before we went to lunch, an elderly woman walking beyond the parking lot's chain link fence called out to Brother Jerry. We paused. He wrapped his hands around the links, leaning in to say hi. She asked after him. He knew her name and thought to ask about the store where she worked. There was so much happiness between them, as well as an undercurrent of empathy around times that are tough. He said he'd felt better. She said they weren't going to get the grocery bill paid. \"I don't know how we'll do it, Brother Jerry,\" she said smiling. Then she swooped her hand up into the sky and proclaimed: \"No matter what happens, I just throw it up to heaven!\" To get involved with the Capuchin Soup Kitchen, donate online, and learn more about their programs, visit www.cskdetroit.org.

Anything can be.\" Shel SilversteinA floppy-eared protagonist who would be called Bunny Rabbit in the straight-talking world morphed into Runny Babbit in the inimitable imagination of Shel Silverstein, and first appeared in Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook. This collection of spoonerisms, illustrated with the poet's trademark black-and-white drawings, was published by HarperCollins Children's Books in March 2005, five years after Silverstein's death. The amiable rabbit will make a second appearance on September 19, when the publisher issues a companion volume, Runny Babbit Returns. Silverstein, who was also a gifted cartoonist, playwright, performer, songwriter, and recording artist, has charmed generations of young readers with his children's poetry collections, which have sold more than 39 million copies in the U.S. alone and have been translated into 46 languages. His tongue-twisting, letter-swapping wordplay in Runny Babbit obviously tickled kids' funny bones: the book has sold more than 770,000 copies. Never-before-published \"Runny Babbit Returns\" On shelves September 19th1930 - 1999C r a z y W i s do m K i d sIt's Not Your Fault, Koko Bear By Vicki LanskyThis is a sweetly illustrated book that follows a younger bear through the everyday realities of parents living apart. Koko Bear can help children learn what divorce means, deal with changes in their everyday lives, talk about their feelings, recognize that their feelings are natural, be assured that their parents still love them and will take care of them, and understand that divorce is not their fault. There are passages at the bottom of each page with tips for parents. The story is very gentle and involves two amicable parents. Even so, it was difficult for my child to listen to.$9.99 Dinosaurs Divorce By Laurie Brown and Marc BrownA comprehensive, sensitive guide for changing families, this book helps readers understand what divorce means, why it happens, and how best to cope with everyone's feelings. Written in somewhat graphic novel style, the characters are engaging. I liked this book because it tackles more of the scenarios typical of a difficult divorce, which might be helpful to children in these types of unknown and unnerving situations. This is a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.$8.99 Divorce Is Not the End of the World: Zoe and Evan's Coping Guide for Kids By Zoe and Evan SternAt ages 15 and 13, Zoe and Evan wrote an honest, positive, and practical guide for kids that covers topics like feeling guilty, mad, sad or scared; adjusting to different rules and parenting styles; dealing with birthdays, holidays, and other special occasions; and getting used to stepparents and blended families. In this new edition, they look back upon the advice they gave with a fresh perspective ten years later. This book is written for the younger teenaged child and has an easy, relatable, and conversational approach. This was not a book that was useful for my son, but it was helpful for me as a parent to hear potential scenarios and reactions, and what aspects might need greater care.$9.95 Angel cd: Guided Meditations for Children By Michelle Robertson-JonesIn this beautiful cd with gentle meditations, children will be guided to connect to their very own guardian angels and protective spirits. This type of calming and supportive meditation is useful for any type of trauma or sadness, and can be reassuring during the painful and confusing time of divorce. Intended for the younger child, there are four different guided meditations, with soothing music by Llewellyn. Especially appropriate before bedtime.$15.95 Transcending Divorce: Ten Essential Touchstones for Finding Hope and Healing Your HeartBy Alan WolfeltThis is a clear and compassionate book about the painful journey through the \"wilderness\" of divorce. He describes ten touchstones that are essential physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual actions to help you accept your experience of divorce, and find your way to hope and healing. This book was useful in helping to integrate the divorce into my life, and move forward with more strength and wholeness.$14.95 You Can Heal Your Heart: Finding Peace After a Breakup, Divorce or Death By Louise Hay and David KesslerThis is the most helpful book about divorce I read because it involves reframing how you view your pain and your difficult experience. Louise Hay most commonly uses affirmations and mirror work to help change your thinking, which then helps change your life. I was stuck for a long time in grief, unable to shift my perspective about what had happened. Using the suggested affirmations repeatedly truly did create movement in me and comfort, and allowed me to feel lighter and more hopeful. And when posted within the house or car, my kids were able to read them and benefit, too. I highly recommend this title. $14.99The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 66 By Waldorf parent Sarah Newland You may also purchase the reviewed books at shopcrazywisdom.com by either visiting the website or scanning the QR code to the left. https://shopcrazywisdom.indielite.org/kids-reviewsThe Crazy Wisdom Kids Section Book & Media Reviews - Great Kids Books & CDs available at Crazy Wisdom in our Children's Section Having gone through a divorce in the past year, I searched for books with a more spiritual approach to help me navigate my heart-wrenching journey.

Or really connected with your kids learning a new activity together? How often does your tween or teen get excited to turn off the video game and go somewhere and be active? Ann Arbor Skate Park Photo by Joseph McKinney of Real Neptune MediaPhoto by Joseph McKinney of Real Neptune MediaPhoto by Tobi Hollander PhotographyPhoto by Tobi Hollander PhotographyToday, a nonprofit called Friends of the Ann Arbor Skatepark acts as a liaison between the City of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County Parks Commission and the Michigan DNR Trust Fund Grant to maintain the facility and organize events. After four years in operation (and eight years in the making) the A2 Skatepark is realizing its vision of a thriving community resource and tourist destination that attracts skaters from Ann Arbor and all around Michigan and surrounding states. Skateboard Culture Has Come a Long Way Ska teboarding has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in the 1960s in California. Some people may still think of skaters as part of a counterculture, derelict kids building ramps in the alleys, jumping backyard fences. Today, skateboarding has gone mainstream, a truly global sport, which will debut as an official event in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Ann Arbor' s Skatepark is truly a place for everyone. As quoted in MLive on opening day June 21, 2014, Staples said, \"We wanted to make sure anybody could skate, whenever they wanted, for free.\" About a year ago, an all girls skate program was initiated to encourage girls and their moms to try the sport. Currently in its second season, All Girls Skate attracts approximately 20-40 girls every 2 nd and 4th Sunday at 9 a.m. from spring until fall. Volunteers offer free instruction and equipment is free to borrow (until it runs out.) Ann Arbor' s Skatepark is a place where peers teach peers\u2014and once a skater masters a new trick, he can pay it forward by helping another learn it too. The skaters challenge each other everyday but the real competition is with the individual skater pushing his or her edge. As a general attitude, skaters love to see other skaters succeed at new challenges regardless of the level they are at. It is definitely that kind of place where encouragement prevails. A special note t o parents who visit the park: you are asked to leave it to the kids to figure things out for themselves. The skatepark website advises against sideline coaching or interference as this kind of well meaning involvement takes away from the unstructured creativity of the sport. When a kid nails a new trick the y have been practicing for days or weeks, everyone can celebrate. It takes patience to learn and a willingness to persist and push through fear to make progress. This teaches kids the meaning of a \"commitment\" and to make choices for themselves. My son challenges himself by asking, \"What incremental step can I take today to get closer to mastering this kick flip trick?\" He might spend two or four days working on something that might look trivial but is significant to him. Then he pays it forward and can teach a younger kid how to do it. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 68 When was the last time you pushed your edge in public? Or really connected with your kids learning a new activity together? How often does your tween or teen get excited to turn off the video game and go somewhere and be active? Have you ever wished your son or daughter felt a sense of belonging in a community of peers outside of home or school? At the Ann Arbor Sk atepark, positive peer-to-peer community building happens every day. Youth and adults alike are rediscovering the motivation to play, experiment, and connect with each other creating a culture of inclusivity and support at a time when we are often divided. My 14-y ear-old son opened my eyes to this community back when he was 12 and all he had was an old Razor scooter. He w ould ask me to drive him to the skatepark after he finished his homework and I'd sit on the bleachers reading a book. One day he decided to try skateboarding and borrowed a friend's board. Soon he was hooked and making friends and learning basic tricks. Now he bikes to the park on his own, he skates the bowls, and is paying it forward teaching younger kids the tricks he knows. He also enjoys a sense of belonging \u2014 that reassuring familiar feeling when he shows up at the park after being away for a while, a couple of the regulars go out of their way to \"high five\" him and stop by to ask where/how he has been. This sense of \"you matter\" and a feeling of \"belonging\" are crucial to adolescents. A Schoolteacher's Vision Galvanizes a Community Loca ted at the Northwest corner of Veteran's Park across from Aldi and Plum Market, the Ann Arbor Skatepark offers 30,000 square feet of world class technical skate park terrain suitable for all levels of skateboarders, scooters, and even roller-skaters. Credit g oes to Trevor Staples, an Ann Arbor Public School teacher, for planting a seed back in 2005 and ultimately seeing to it that the park would become a reality for the Ann Arbor community. Over the next 8 years, his persistence and grassroots approach attracted enough community supporters and sponsors to ultimately raise the $1.2 million required to construct the park, which was completed in the summer of 2014. By Kendra TheriotAnn Arbor Skate Park - A Welcoming Place Located at the Northwest corner of Veteran's Park across from Aldi and Plum Market, the Ann Arbor Skatepark offers 30,000 square feet of world class technical skate park terrain suitable for all levels of skateboarders, scooters, and even roller-skaters.

Photo by Joseph McKinneyPhoto by Joseph McKinneyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 69 Fitness and concentration are keys to performing skateboard tricks. Amazingly there ar e few serious injuries despite the perceived high risks of being airborne over concrete, jumping over metal rails and ramps. Many skaters wear some form of padding (knees and wrists) and helmets. There are signs posted around the park recommending this practice especially if you are new. Occasionally collisions happen when the park is busy and kids are not paying attention. At peak times this is more likely to happen, so if you are new, you might try coming earlier in the day before it gets too crowded. Come See for Yourself The Ann Arbor Ska tepark is on the map. Last fall, it was standing room only when UMS kicked off their 2016-17 season with a live Skateboarding and Jazz event at the Ann Arbor Skatepark celebrating the art of improvisation in music and in skating. Every spring, the Friends of the Ann Arbor Skatepark hosts the Dave Tuck Memorial event, a cancer benefit that attracts huge crowds of skaters and non-skaters alike. Josh Meisler, the current President of the Friends of the Ann Arbor Skate Park, spoke of plans to use the park as a venue to showcase local bands. The ev eryday action is reason to consider an outing at the skatepark with a friend or with your family. Just come and have a picnic one day\u2014there are plenty of eateries nearby and shade is plentiful on a hot day. Weekends are a good time to catch some of the local pros in the area but there is always someone there during the daylight hours\u2014you won't be disappointed. While it's common t o see youth cruising the park landscape on scooters and skateboards, it is also fun to watch the older set cruising the bowls (deep pools). Sit close enough to listen to the kids exchange encouraging words, challenging each other to become better skaters and citizens at the same time. Witness f or yourself the respect and cooperation that happens here in this unsupervised environment. Notice the absence of graffiti, the relative cleanliness, and the occasional police car in the parking lot. Come wintertime, you may see someone clearing snow after a big winter storm. The cement is specially formulated to dry quickly making skateboarding a year round activity. Arguably Ann Arbor 's most famous pro skater is Andy MacDonald, commonly known as \"Andy Mac.\" Now an X Games legend, Andy spent several years skating in Ann Arbor as a kid, and still comes back to town for special events at the Ann Arbor Skatepark. On a more regular basis spectators are apt to catch glimpses of awesome skaters like Mark Davenport, who hails from nearby Ohio, or street skaters who can do complex kick flips in the air and jump or \"olly\" over flights of stairs with ease. Getting Started While the park is free, the har dware and safety equipment require a modest investment. To this end, Friends of the Ann Arbor Skatepark operates a scholarship fund to make skateboarding safe and affordable to anyone who wants to skate. This fund also includes an inventory of donated equipment (skateboards, parts, helmets and bus passes). In formation on how to apply is available on the a2skatepark.org website. This park sees a lot of use and local ar ea businesses are benefitting. Launch Board Shop recently moved from South U to Packard and Platt and has everything you need to get started\u2014skate friendly shoes, clothing, decks, hardware, and safety equipment as well as stickers to make your helmet look cool! According to Patrick Eagle, a Launch employee, all the staff are experienced skateboarders who will gladly offer guidance and assemble a complete skateboard deck purchased at the store for no extra charge. As for learning basic trick s, the best lessons are the informal ones you get by coming to the park, watching people doing a trick you want to learn and asking people at the park to critique you. Practice and patience are key. Building on Success - Next Steps for the Park The park has many off erings but some skaters wish it had a half pipe. Others wish it had lights so you can skate past sundown. According to Meisler, the Friends of the Skatepark is now raising money for lights which will make the park accessible to even more people. Once funding is secured and ligh ts are in place, Meisler's next dream is to build a small \"pro / service shop\" on the perimeter of the park where skaters can purchase tools, gear, repair parts, as well as snacks and water. Proceeds from this shop would go towards funding the annual park maintenance and repair fund. For Meisler , the Ann Arbor Skatepark offers the perfect complement to his career as a social worker in the juvenile justice system where he works during the day. To know that he is supporting a place where teens interact in a supportive way, and are staying active and out of trouble, motivates him to volunteer his time. And he is especially proud that his six- and eight-year-old girls are out skating on Sundays as part of the All Girls Skate program. What c an we all learn from the skatepark? Start with a vision for what is possible, add years of persistence and community engagement, and put in place a set of self-governing social norms around pushing your edge, supporting your friends, and being active, and you have a recipe for success. For more inf ormation on how you can get involved with the park, contact Josh Meisler via the website a2skatepark.org.

Photo by Joseph McKinneyPhoto by Tobi Hollander PhotographyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 70 We love our children dearly. They bring us more joy than we could have imagined. But even when family life is going well, it can also feel inexplicably hard. Just consider the language that describes some of our more difficult parenting moments. We say our blood boils. We say we lose our minds, blow up, fall apart, or tear our hair out. We say or do things we promised ourselves we would never say or do. We may have trouble enjoying our children, and it may seem to us that something is wrong with us or with our children. There are many reasons why parenting can be hard. The stress of illness, a strained relationship with a partner, worries about money, long hours of work, and not enough time for ourselves or our children can drain our enthusiasm and patience. Many parents also face isolation, even if they are in a relationship, because parenting so often occurs away from other adults. Add to this the potential burdens of racism, homophobia, and other forms of unfair treatment and parenting can be much more stressful than it should be. These stresses impact us as parents and can shape our reactions to our children. There is also a different, additional, and usually invisible cause of stressful parenting moments. Sometimes, our reactions are shaped more by unresolved experiences and feelings than by our present challenges. We may notice a pattern to our reactions that we've tried to change, but without success. We want to teach not to hit, but we smack (or must fight the urge to smack) the child who just hit their sibling. We want to be patient and understanding but we belittle our child for melting down over getting the wrong cup/plate/cut of sandwich, etc. We want to model problem-solving for our children, yet we more often end up yelling instead. Sometimes we hate something our children do with an intensity that cannot take into account where they are developmentally, or their innocent intentions. We feel out of control. The work of neuroscientists in recent years has helped to explain why we have these over-the-top moments, and also gives us new insight into the experiences and memories of our babies and very young children. It has to do with how we remember. Many of us have heard that babies and young children don't remember experiences the first few years. However, research has shown that children do remember their experiences\u2014but differently at different ages, as our brains mature. Babies are born with a functional, although still maturing, ability to remember. These early memories, called implicit memories, are our only form of memory until sometime around our first birthday. There are two functionally distinct types of memory, though most of us only learned about one of them. From age two to five years, we are developing explicit memory, the \"autobiographical\" memories that let us actively recall our experiences. We usually mean explicit memories when we talk about \"remembering.\" Before this development, we are said to have \"childhood amnesia,\" and our inability to consciously recall events has been confused with an idea that we were unaffected by events from before our own \"recorded history\" begins. We can't deliberately recall our implicit memories the way we can our explicit, or autobiographical memories, but nevertheless implicit memories are stored in our nervous system. We won't remember them as stories, but our sensory perceptions of events, the emotions we feel, and the bodily sensations we have all get recorded. We continue to store implicit memories later in life, too, even after we are capable of creating explicit memories. Events with strong emotional meaning, particularly fearful or upsetting ones, are most likely to be stored as implicit memories later in life. One example which many of us may be familiar with is people's reactions to being in hospitals after a difficult experience there. One woman told me about her experience of returning to a hospital with a gift for the nurses who had cared for her mother before she died unexpectedly. \"I felt fine returning to the hospital, and I looked forward to seeing the nurses who had been so wonderful. But the closer I got to the floor we had been on, the dizzier and more upset I got. I had to ask my brother to do all of the talking because I was overwhelmed by feelings.\" We are often in crisis mode at the hospital, and don't get a chance to fully process, or \"metabolize\" the experience. In this case, some of it gets stored as implicit memory. Returning to the hospital can bring up these sensations. Here's one key to understanding implicit memories: when we remember implicit memories, it doesn't feel as if we are recalling something. We simply feel emotions\u2014 often accompanied by physical sensations, and it seems as though we are reacting to the present moment. This happens for our children but it also happens to us as adults. When a situation reminds us of the implicit memory, we can be flooded with the sensations from a previous experience. Despite our inability to consciously recall those earliest experiences from babyhood, they stay with us, and have a profound effect on our development and the way we see the world. Implicit memories shape our children in incredibly important ways and, having been children ourselves, our own implicit memories affect us as parents, too. Understanding the implicit memories we make and store starting at birth (or before) can help us to make sense of some of the reactions we have as parents, as well as give us new insight into our children's behavior and help us build better relationships with them. Understanding Implicit Memory in Children You don't need to panic if you've been thinking that your children forget all their early experiences. It's good news that they don't, because otherwise all the love, attention and affection you've been giving them would also be forgotten. This newer information about children's memories validates the importance of your care for your children. As Dr. Dan Siegel writes \"Our connections with our children impact them and their development at the deepest, most fundamental and formative levels.\" How do our children feel our connection with them? Your eye contact with them, your warm and reassuring tone of voice, your gentle physical closeness and your responsiveness to their needs, even if you don't figure things out correctly the first time. These ways of communicating are of tremendous importance from birth onward. Those experiences that we give our children of feeling seen, understood and cared about are shaping their brains, personalities, and social abilities more profoundly than we ever could have guessed. From our implicit memories, our minds form generalizations, or mental models of the world. Kirke Olson, Ph.D, describes the impact of our implicit memories and mental models in The Invisible Classroom : It would be difficult to overestimate the influence of these always active but invisible memories. Implicit memories also create mental models which are summations of repeated experiences that become expectations for future experiences. These mental models act as filters that bias our current perception in the direction of the already established model. In other words the mental model creates an expectation of what will occur next and can screen out, allow in or color information based on that expectation.By Catherine FischerConscious Parenting Babies Will Remember ~ How Understanding Implicit Memory Can Make Us Happier and Better Parents Just consider the language that describes some of our more difficult parenting moments. We say our blood boils. We say we lose our minds, blow up, fall apart, or tear our hair out. We say or do things we promised ourselves we would never say or do. We want to model problem-solving for our children, yet we more often end up yelling instead. Sometimes we hate something our children do with an intensity that cannot take into account where they are developmentally, or their innocent intentions. We feel out of control. With an understanding of implicit memories, we can know that our child is flooded with the old fear and can't tell the difference between now and that first frightening experience. We can help our child to face and feel the fear without trying to get them to bypass it. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 71 So, not only do implicit memories stay with us on an unconscious level, they shape our perceptions. The impact of our early memories on our perceptions is so strong that we shape our views of reality and our behavior to make them fit our mental models. We are all born with the capacity to recover from painful experiences, even ones that get stored away unconsciously, and your children have probably been doing this already. Those hearty cries they've had over falling, or feeling scared when you leave the room, or when an animal frightens them help children to release the emotional charge of the moment. When they have your caring attention during difficult emotional moments, their brains form different connections and can organize the information that came in differently than if they feel alone with their fears and don't have a chance to release them. If something frightening or discouraging happens to our children and they don't release, or \"metabolize\" the feelings of the incident, those feelings resurface later when they are somehow reminded of it. As parents, we can't always know what these implicit memories are about, but sometimes we can make an educated guess. For example, a baby who has spent time in the hospital early on, and perhaps felt frustrated or frightened by being alone in an incubator, may later hate being put on her back for a diaper change. A baby who had a difficult birth, perhaps getting stuck in the birth canal, might have that sensory and emotional experience triggered when clothes are put over her head. For older children, it can be easier to see. After being frightened by a large barking dog, a child may feel scared of any dog, no matter what size and whether the new dog is barking. Without an understanding of implicit memories, we don't understand why we can't reason with our child that \"this is a nice doggie, he's not going to hurt you.\" With an understanding of implicit memories, we can know that our child is flooded with the old fear and can't tell the difference between now and that first frightening experience. We can help our child to face and feel the fear without trying to get them to bypass it. When we are with a child in the grip of strong emotions, if we can offer them our calm and confident support while allowing them to feel the feelings, they can drain the emotional charge of the earlier experience. This will help them to gain confidence and deepen their connection with us. How Implicit Memories Affect Our Parenting As parents, our children's behavior can take us back to our own childhood, and we may not even be aware of it. Sometimes this is positive\u2014the scent of certain foods we prepare with our family or playing a particular game can evoke a warm feeling of well-being if it reminds us of pleasant implicit memories. (Of course, we can also just be enjoying the present moment. But sometimes it goes beyond that.) Even simply being around a child who is the same age as we were at a particularly happy time of life can evoke lots of happy implicit memories. I suspect that this is why many of us have a favorite age of children to be around. However, we can also be flooded with the feelings and bodily sensations related to a frightening or otherwise upsetting implicit childhood memory. This is tricky, because when our implicit memory is triggered, there is no sensation of remembering, it appears to be about our children. Siblings hurting one another can trigger our experiences of being picked on and a fight or flight response. Children not cooperating may remind us of how we were treated when we tried our parents' patience. Crying babies can trigger our own implicit memories of being helpless. I once talked with a new mom at a mother's group who bravely told me that she was having a really hard time when her baby cried. When I told her that sometimes our feelings about our children tell us something about our life when we were their age, she immediately made a connection: \"Maybe the adults around me didn't like it when I cried,\" she said. It is possible by having that realization, making the implicit explicit, she would re-write that implicit memory and meet her crying baby's needs without such a flood of negative feelings. Even later in life, after we are old enough to create explicit memories, an unresolved emotional experience still gets stored as an implicit memory. One mother described having an implicit memory surface with her son, and having the experience of recognizing an implicit memory before it got her to mistreat her child: When my son was about eight years old, he spanked me on the butt, out of the blue. It didn't hurt at all (except for my pride.) Maybe someone had done that to him, or he was just playing, or he did it for some other reason. I wasn't able to think about why he would suddenly start this behavior. I was immediately annoyed and said sternly not to hit me on the butt. He stopped at that moment, but the next day, he did it again. I gave him the same rigid, tense response. After several days of this, he did it one last time, and I suddenly became filled with rage. I felt it surge up in me as I turned to face him. I was really going to let him have it! My face and energy must have been terrifying and he clearly knew what was coming, because as I opened my mouth to yell at him, I saw his face. His eyes were wide and he looked both surprised and scared. Somehow the look on his face stopped me. Despite my rage, I could see that it shouldn't be directed at him. He looked too innocent and small to handle these intense feelings that I wanted to vent at him. As I teetered there on the edge of losing it with him, I suddenly knew that the rage was left over from another experience in my life. I had a flash to an old boyfriend who had a habit of patting or grabbing my butt whenever he felt like it. I told him I didn't like it and asked him to stop, but he believed that my body was \"his\" and he should be able to do that. I wasn't able to stand up for myself. Instead, I avoided walking past him or up the stairs in front of him. Eventually I left the relationship but I never resolved that issue. The intermittent butt pats I was getting from my son were similar enough to that old, upsetting experience that all of my bottled-up rage washed over me. I think it had been stored as an implicit memory because living in the situation with that boyfriend, I hadn't even let myself feel it.\" Sometimes, just bringing the implicit memory to light by talking about it can help shift the difficult feelings we are having in the present moment. How to Heal Painful Implicit Memories We don't always know what our implicit memories are, though. Anyhow, even becoming aware of an implicit memory isn't always enough to release its power over our reactions. Often, we need to do more in order to resolve negative feelings from implicit memories. In his book, Parenting from the Inside Out , Dr. Dan Siegel provides \"inside-out exercises\" to help parents with these challenges. Siegel's other suggestions for working through the emotional charge of those old memories include: Body awareness Self-reflection Having a trusted other bear witness Writing in a journal. The book List en, by Patty Wipfler and Tosha Schore, also describes tools that parents can use to undo the effects of negative implicit memories for both ourselves and our children. A primary tool for parents is using \"Listening Partnerships\" in which parents take turns listening to one another with acceptance and warmth but without any interruptions or advice. Using any of the above methods can help, and are useful whether or not we can consciously identify our implicit memories. Parenting is hard sometimes. Understanding implicit memories can help to make it less confusing, though. Knowing that these \"always active but invisible memories\" are there explains some of our over-the-top reactions as parents. We can use a number of techniques to help ourselves loosen the control of the emotions in our implicit memories. Freed up to respond more patiently and flexibly to our children, we can be more thoughtful and responsive and probably have a lot more fun, too. We can also be more understanding of our children's big emotions, doing them the great service of being the \"trusted other\" who bears witness to their feelings and allows them to move ahead in life less burdened by painful implicit memories. Finally, we gain the satisfaction of understanding the vital importance of our connection with our children and how we show that we see them and care. Hopefully, someday, no parent will be misguided by the myth that what happens to their young children doesn't matter because \"they won't remember it anyway\" and instead parents will be encouraged with accurate information that helps them to give their children the care, attention and responsiveness that they need.

It is a contemporary spiritual teaching drawing on both modern psychology and traditional wisdom teachings.The Diamond Approach: A Path of Embodied Understanding Imagine a spiritual path which embraces the truth of our interconnectedness with the ground of being, whether it is called God, Tao, the Buddha realm, or the logos. Then imagine a spiritual path that looks at your day-by-day events, mental thought objects, reactions, and expansions to see how they relate to the depth. Then imagine an organized method of looking at these daily events, thoughts, and reactions that allows you to see the truth of these events. Then you would be imagining a path like the Diamond Approach, developed by A. H. Almaas over 40 years ago. The Diamond Approach is a path of wisdom, an approach to the investigation of Reality, and a method of working on oneself that leads to increased understanding, spiritual maturity, and liberation. It is a contemporary spiritual teaching drawing on both modern psychology and traditional wisdom teachings. This work is intended for those living in the world, supporting self-realization without needing to leave one's life activities. It welcomes us as we are and guides us toward taking the next steps in actualizing our potential for more aliveness, intimacy, clarity, depth, and engagement with our lives. Accurate and deep teachings are not hard to find in today's world. A careful search of the Internet could yield talks and writings in all the traditions which are deep and true. But even with that knowledge available, most people either can't hear or assimilate the teachings in a useful way. They listen to a good teacher with a good teaching, but it doesn't penetrate their lives. Something more is needed \u2014 embodied understanding and application. Psychology agrees with the wisdom traditions in a very important and basic way \u2014 we do not have our ego self when we are born. So how is it constructed? Object relations psychologists and depth psychologists have a very detailed understanding of the stages of development of our separate self. It is a truism that one of the most persistent barriers to experiencing one's self in the complete openness of our true nature in total freedom is our constructed self. In the Diamond Approach, we have studied this knowledge, and we use it to inform our own inquiries into the truth of our nature. The Diamond Approach uses meditation and a unique kind of inquiry to develop greater understanding. It is usually done in group format. With a partner and a sincere desire for the truth, a person will look at an issue both historically and in the moment. We spend as much time exploring the barriers as we do exploring the expanded states of stillness, peace, and pure awareness, for example. All of it is included and, especially at the beginning, the barriers are often most prominent. Someone might come to practice because she sees patterns of behavior that are not fulfilling and undermine her in her job or relationships. You could say to this person You need to stop identifying with this small deficient place. It is not really you anyway. If a person could do this, then she wouldn't need to have a practice. But typically, she can't and we can't. These patterns of behavior have many supports from our historical upbringing. So, this person will have been in an early holding environment that did not support her true nature completely; we all were. There may have been a way that her basic worth was not valued or seen. Maybe she was only valued as she performed some function in the world. Perhaps her father told her this either in words or actions. And she tried hard to please, sometimes being successful. But it left her with a basic feeling that she was not valued unless someone was praising her result. It left a feeling of dependency on the outside world for her value and a sense of deficiency underneath. Our inquiry practice focuses our attention on different places where we are disconnected. When we genuinely experience our anger, for example, and also metabolize the psychodynamically \"stuck\" places (often trauma in our history), our strength naturally arises, and it has a firmness combined with sensitivity and appropriateness.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 79 Many times our parents don't recognize our true nature, or sometimes are even challenged by it. A father might be upset by the unabandoned joy expressed by a small child. Because of our love for our parents, we start to give up on parts of ourselves. It starts to shape us in a certain way.This example is not an isolated instance. It is almost universal. So, instead of saying Stop identifying with that little deficient girl , we say: Let's look at that, how did it get formed, what is it made up of? How did it make you feel when you were with your father? Is there anger, sadness, something else? What is it related to? How was that for you? Bringing presence to these undigested places allows us to bring our current wisdom to them. As they get digested, the truth of our being starts so show through. In this case, we see the truth of our own value. It is ours, without qualification. We see how we do not have to earn our value and that even in difficult circumstances we are not disconnected from it. And it is not dependent on outside circumstances. For this practice to have meaning, it must be felt in an embodied way and understood. The above example is regarding value, one of our essential qualities. Our map includes many places where the personality \"covers\" up our essence: anger over strength and aliveness, willfulness over true will, hatred over peace and power, to name just a few. As these are brought to awareness, more is learned \u2014 connections to self and one's history \u2014 often seeing the long-held contractions of the ego, and experiencing them in the moment. As these contractions are seen through and understood, they tend to thin out or fall away. Our ego is always attempting to shore itself up with various defenses and identifications. Some are \"positive\" (like \u2014 I am a smart person) and many are \"negative\" (like \u2014 I am not worthy, as in the above example, or, I am not strong enough). The map of the Diamond Approach shows the usual patterns that we are defended or identified. Many people come to spiritual work because something in their lives is not working. Maybe they have difficult relationships which repeat. Maybe they have problems with jobs and co-workers, or feel a lack of fulfillment in some way. So, as you look at the big questions such as What is the base cause of suffering? Who are we at our depth? What is our relationship to the ground of being in the universe?, the issues of our daily lives tend to be mixed with those issues \u2014 maybe our lack of confidence in our lives, perhaps relationship issues, maybe ways that we experience difficult emotions over and over. Our practice deals with the big questions but also the more mundane life issues which are intertwined. Without looking at our anger, for example, we are not going to be able to fully feel our love. Without looking at our hatred, we can't experience our peace.Our practice is to start from where the student is in the moment, and, with careful inquiry, let the truth eventually unfold. The doorway to the universal is begun with the personal. Many times our parents don't recognize our true nature, or sometimes are even challenged by it. A father might be upset by the unabandoned joy expressed by a small child. Because of our love for our parents, we start to give up on parts of ourselves. It starts to shape us in a certain way. A small boy has an artistic, quiet introspective nature but is in a family that honors athletic achievement. He is torn between his own natural inclinations and the love of his family. So he leans in the direction of being more gregarious and active, which may not be his nature. As in that example, we learn how to suppress parts of ourselves. It may help us to get along with society, but it's really also about becoming something that we are not. There is something false created that takes the place of the true. We begin to create an identity, a way to be different than we would naturally. There is a gap between our nature and our expressed identity. In order to become that identity, we had to begin to disconnect from ourselves. And then we start to cut off awareness of these parts of ourselves. We become so well-molded that not only do we not feel them, but we forget them and take ourselves to be the created identity. That is the challenge of the personality, or ego structure, or the false identity. We inhabit it so fully, we forget our depth. We forget who we are. So one purpose of this path is to learn about this false identity, remember the true and connect more to the truth of our nature. It addresses this extraordinary dilemma \u2014 disconnection. Our inquiry practice focuses our attention on different places where we are disconnected. When we genuinely experience our anger, for example, and also metabolize the psychodynamically \"stuck\" places (often trauma in our history), our strength naturally arises, and it has a firmness combined with sensitivity and appropriateness. Practicing with a group over many years allows one to see many of the corners of our false self, which brings our history and our unconscious supports to light. As these are metabolized, the true qualities of our nature, love, intelligence, peace, compassion, and many other undefiled qualities of our spiritual nature show through more and more. As we are more guided by our essence, we are more able to connect with the beauty and mystery of life. The Diamond Approach takes us from wherever we are to what is underneath that and, eventually, to what is more fundamental. We are peeling back that onion to find the potential of the beings that we are, and that potential is unlimited. It's not the same for everyone; it's unique and personal. We are unique expressions of that reality, and it is a precious gift to find out more about it. Lou Weir is an ordained Diamond Approach teacher. He is also a founding teacher of Insight Meditation Ann Arbor. He believes that being present with all our impulses (both good and bad) with loving support, allows us to understand and find our way home to our deepest nature.

Metaphysics, Emotional Intelligence, and Belief Systems with G. Arthur Weidman Second and Fourth Fridays, beginning Sept. 29, 7:30p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Meta-physics assumes that consciousness is the basis of all creation, and wellness is the natural state of being that need not be pursued, but is simply allowed by the focusing on that which is desired. Emotion is the measure of our separation between our personal self and our greater self, not a reaction to outside stimuli. Higher states of consciousness are therefore associated with emotional experience and the relaxing into of who we really are. $1. Con-tact G. Arthur at (269) 501-6223; gweldman97@gmail.com.

It was Nixon's famous 1972 visit to China, and the related press in Readers Digest and The New York Times, that brought acupuncture into the popular consciousness. But by doing so, this traditional medicine was also brought into direct conflict with the cultural and political clout of the biomedical paradigm.We in Michigan are in the unique position of being the only state where the practice of acupuncture continues to be illegal except under the delegation and supervision of a physician. From Nixon to Michigan: A Brief History of the Legalization of Acupuncture in the U.S. Which state do you think was the first to legalize the practice of acupuncture? You are probably thinking California, right? Or maybe New York? Did any of you guess Nevada? If you got this question right, then perhaps you happened to have been living in Carson City, Nevada in the spring of 1973 and saw the line of patients with canes and wheelchairs waiting outside a hotel across the street from the state legislature. Perhaps one of the patients told you that they were waiting hopefully for a free acupuncture treatment made legal for a three-week period by a special \"emergency bill\" passed by the state senate. This unlikely scene was the result of a concerted effort by a prominent Las Vegas businessman, Arthur Steinburg, to bring Dr. LOK Yee Kung, then the president of the Hong Kong College of Acupuncture, to Nevada to demonstrate the miraculous efficacy of what was, at that time, an illegal activity. This effort resulted in the collection of over 17,000 signatures, the treatment of dozens of legislators, and several sensational \"miracle cures.\" And it was successful. On April 20, 1973, the governor of Nevada signed the first state law to license the practice of acupuncture, and a new chapter in the history of acupuncture in the United States began. The practice of East Asian medicine in the U.S. is hardly new \u2014 herbal clinics in particular have existed since the 1800s \u2014 but the twin firewalls of language and culture caused it to remain hidden from the English-speaking public within the country's Asian communities. It was Nixon's famous 1972 visit to China, and the related press in Readers Digest and The New York Times, that brought acupuncture into the popular consciousness. But by doing so, this traditional medicine was also brought into direct conflict with the cultural and political clout of the biomedical paradigm. The American Medical Association lost no time in promoting legislation to restrict the practice of acupuncture to physicians or medical researchers. Although this effort backfired in Nevada, where popular support of acupuncture overwhelmed the efforts of the Nevada State Medical Association, it was more successful in states like Michigan, where in 1974, then Attorney General Frank J. Kelley determined that \"Acupuncture, as a total system of diagnosis and treatment of a patient, clearly falls within the statutory definition of the practice of medicine...\" and could therefore only be practiced by a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician.As the earliest state to license the practice of acupuncture, Nevada was under pressure to set a high bar for entry to the profession, and they created the highest and most stringent educational requirements of any state in the country - a license to practice medicine in China, Japan, or Korea, and 20 years clinical experience, rather than the entry-level masters degree used today. In the years after Nevada's groundbreaking law passed, many other states followed suit, with California legalizing acupuncture in 1975 and New York shortly after in 1976. In the intervening years, all but four states have licensed the independent practice of acupuncture. As one of those four states, in Michigan we are in the unique position of being the only state where the practice of acupuncture continues to be illegal except under the delegation and supervision of a physician. This, of course, is a direct continuation of the 1974 A.G. opinion that acupuncture is the practice of medicine. A few years back I had the opportunity to ask Mr. Kelley, through his biographer Jack Lessenberry, what his intent was with this influential opinion, and he wrote back that he saw acupuncture as \"an advancement in science,\" and that this opinion was intended to protect and support the practice of acupuncture in the state. If you put his determination in the context of the conversation about acupuncture in the 1970s, one can see how farsighted this opinion was. Take the range of training that existed at the time. Although acupuncturists from China were trained as physicians, in the U.S. a 1973 A.M.A. conference presentation stated: \"Another area of concern throughout the country are the so-called 'quickie courses' in acupuncture, many of which must fall into the category of outright quackery. For example, some courses [...] are of the weekend, three-day variety, after which participants are granted some kind of a certificate that, based on those three days, states they now are 'qualified acupuncture practitioners.'\" And in the popular media one saw both fascination with and harsh criticism of this mysterious art. As the New York Times reported in 1972, \"The American Society of Anesthesiology, while calling acupuncture 'a potentially valuable technique,' The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 93 During these decades since the determination that acupuncture is the practice of medicine, a professional class of trained acupuncturists has emerged. As the profession grows, in time acupuncture treatments will be available in settings ranging from traditional private practices to hospital-based integrative medicine departments, and from low-cost community clinics to inpatient addiction treatment centers.has warned that 'severe mental trauma' could result if acupuncture was applied indiscriminately to patients not properly evaluated psychologically and that quacks could misuse the treatment and divert patients from obtaining effective, established medical cures.\" Given the variety of opinions that existed in the US in the early 1970s, ranging all over the spectrum from wholehearted approval of acupuncture to scorn and denial, Mr. Kelley's balanced conclusion in Opinion No. 4832 is fascinating to me. For him to have taken the time and effort to look past even the contemporary popular opinion of acupuncture as a straightforward remedy for pain, a simple technique to be used by any professional, and conclude that \"...the separation of the practice of acupuncture with its concern for the maintenance of an equilibrium of energy forces, and the selected use of some of the techniques to produce an anesthetic effect, is premature\" was quite forward looking and has had a lasting influence across the decades. During these decades since the determination that acupuncture is the practice of medicine, a professional class of trained acupuncturists has emerged. The current minimum requirements for national certification in acupuncture are completion of an accredited program consisting of 3 years/1905 hours of education, including 660 hours of supervised clinical training and 450 hours of biomedical clinical sciences, as well as passage of national certification exams. These are individuals trained to practice acupuncture \"...as a total system of diagnosis and treatment of a patient,\" and carry on the living tradition of what the WHO has described as one of the humanity's most valuable intangible cultural heritages. The new chapter in the history of acupuncture that opened in Nevada in 1973 has still not closed here in Michigan, as the state acupuncture and oriental medicine association, M.A.A.O.M., which successfully fought for title protection in 2006, is now leading an effort to make Michigan the 47 th state to license the independent practice of acupuncture. Why is this struggle still important in Michigan? Although it has been many years since an acupuncturist was arrested for \"practicing medicine without a license,\" recent times have brought new challenges to the profession. Just as there was a boom in popularity following President Nixon's visit to China, more recent affirmations of acupuncture's efficacy by the medical research community has led to an interest on the part of other healthcare professions in adding acupuncture to their scope. The same sort of \"quickie courses\" in acupuncture techniques (now called \"dry needling,\" or \"intramuscular stimulation\") that proliferated for a few years in the 1970s are showing up in Michigan today, advertising that students can \"offer this to your patients the very next day\" after taking a 3-day course. In Michigan, physical therapists, physician assistants, nurses, and other professions are operating in a legal grey area where there are no specified minimum training standards required before sticking acupuncture needles into one's patients. It is truly a case of \"let the buyer beware.\" Licensure of acupuncture would bring Michigan up to the level of the 46 states that have already done so, while allowing time for the development of clear standards for how much additional training is necessary for each of these professions to practice safely. Currently in Michigan there are a little over 200 acupuncturists (with the highest number practicing in Washtenaw county) who are nationally certified and could practice legally in other states. Michigan's imperfect regulation of the profession has led to slower growth than we've seen in other Great Lakes states - Illinois has 850 licensed acupuncturists, for example - despite the fact that Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that it is one of the fastest growing healthcare professions in the country. What has this multi-decade movement to regulate and legalize acupuncture meant for the public and for practitioners? The intent is certainly to make it safer to seek out an acupuncturist, as weekend courses for laypeople have given way to master's degrees at accredited colleges. But has this meant that fewer people could study and practice the medicine, creating the spike in health costs that we see in the conventional healthcare models? We are fortunate to have many activists that have worked to prevent such a bottleneck from developing, ranging from the Working Class Acupuncture movement, which created low-cost community acupuncture clinics all over the country, to the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, which has taught the 5-point auricular protocol for substance abuse to more people in Michigan than any other state in the country. As the profession grows, in time acupuncture treatments will be available in settings ranging from traditional private practices to hospital-based integrative-medicine departments, and from low-cost community clinics to inpatient addiction-treatment centers. No government regulation of a healthcare profession comes without costs. But from the earliest lurches and miss-steps towards licensing in Nevada, with their requirement of foreign doctorate-level education to the present-day entry-level master's degree and national certification, a standard for the profession has emerged that promises safety and efficacy, while not closing the door so far as to prevent the development of a variety of delivery models and kinds of training. Henry Buchtel completed his acupuncture and herbal medicine studies at the Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in southern China, where he lived for more than a decade. In 2011 he moved back to his home state of Michigan to continue his clinical practice at The Lotus Center of Ann Arbor and at Michigan Oriental Medicine in Grand Blanc. He is in his second term as president of the Michigan Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. He can be contacted at henry.buchtel@gmail.com.

I believed that sleeping and resting were luxuries, not necessities. I got chronic fatigue syndrome and developed type 2 diabetes by the end of my residency. Finally I was forced to listen to my body and respect the way it worked.In six months I completely reversed my diabetes and chronic fatigue syndrome \u2014 personal proof of the efficacy and power of integrative medicine!Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine to Improve Patients' Health Being healthy takes place on many levels: our bodies, minds, and souls. For each of us, the ideal mix is a little different, and what is needed to thrive is unique to each individual. I work with patients to uncover the underlying reasons a person's body is not working well, and to develop the best plan to achieve optimal health. I truly believe that everyone can become empowered to transform their health. I am a family physician who practices integrative medicine, functional medicine, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine. I love what I do and it gives me great satisfaction when I hear gratitude from patients who have transformed their health with my assistance. I have always been drawn to natural approaches to medicine. In part, this is because I come from a family that has been practicing acupuncture and Chinese medicine for eight generations. At a very young age I began to learn basic concepts of Eastern medicine with its emphasis on the whole-body approach. My journey to become a physician began at the age of 15 when I left everything behind in my birthplace of Harbin, China to start a new life in the U.S. It was difficult at first, but I learned English quickly and worked part-time at a local restaurant after school. I attended Community High School in Ann Arbor where the environment encourages self-initiated learning opportunities. I began to take mathematics and science classes at the University of Michigan when I was in eleventh grade. These early experiences helped me learn the value of responsibility, hard work, and self-reliance. I was awarded a full five-year merit scholarship to the University of Michigan, where I graduated with a double major: mathematics and cellular and molecular biology. I loved growing up in Ann Arbor, with its small college town feel and big city opportunities. Multiculturalism is a given here; not only do we have world-class Western medical programs and facilities, we also have many alternative and holistic health practitioners. Early in my training I had many opportunities to shadow and work with some of the gifted doctors and healers in town. After graduation, I studied at one of the most prestigious acupuncture and Chinese medicine schools in the country, the Oriental Medical School at Dongguk University in Los Angeles. My experience with using acupuncture to successfully treat infertility led me to publish a research article on the subject. My solid background in Eastern medicine, along with my observations of the scientific rigidity of Western medicine, led me to wish to integrate these separate methodologies for better patient care. To achieve this, I attended medical school at American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine, in the Netherlands Antilles, and graduated at the top of my class. I was a hard-working student and my health started to show some problems due to lack of sleep, stress, and the competitive environment. I became a stress eater and was making poor snack choices such as potato chips and cookies. I was never obese, but I gained more than 50 pounds in four years of medical school. I noticed my body was changing and I was getting flabby, but I remained focused on my goals. I went on to complete my residency in family medicine at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan. I tailored my medical school and residency curriculum to gain more experience in providing integrative and holistic care. I attended numerous integrative holistic medicine conferences and spent months shadowing and learning from national and local holistic providers. With a desire to help patients achieve optimal health, I moved back to Ann Arbor and completed an integrative medicine fellowship at the University of Michigan, a program that awards just one fellowship each year and is recognized as a top program internationally. During my fellowship I was awarded the Provider of the Month Award twice by clinic patients and staff. I was happy to return and serve my home community, but years of pushing myself too hard had taken a toll on my body. During medical school and residency, I became addicted to sugar and caffeine. I believed that sleeping and resting were luxuries, not necessities. In fact, even The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 99 The principle of health is very simple: take out the bad stuff and put in the good stuff.I often share with my patients that one of the easiest ways to feel happier is to direct your attention to the good things in your life. Similarly, shining a positive light on the bad or neutral things changes how you feel about them. though I knew all about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and nutrition, I continued to push my limits. I worked long hours, some days without sleep. I got through the night shifts by eating half a dozen chocolate donuts and drinking two cups of espresso. I learned how to keep myself awake despite my exhaustion. I constantly craved sugar and carbs, but I didn't realize that they had actually altered my brain chemistry, hormones, and metabolism. I gained a lot of weight and felt exhausted. And then, I got chronic fatigue syndrome and developed type 2 diabetes by the end of my residency. Finally I was forced to listen to my body and respect the way it worked. By all measures I was a successful family physician, but my personal illness gave me a firsthand appreciation for the power of integrative medicine. I was trained to help my patients get their health back, but now it was my turn to do the right thing. I realized I needed a detox. I eliminated sugar, caffeine, and junk food, tested myself for food sensitivities, and eliminated the allergens that drive inflammation in the body. I also learned to slow down and practice meditation. Through meditation I improved my mood and my immune system. I often share with my patients that one of the easiest ways to feel happier is to direct your attention to the good things in your life. Similarly, shining a positive light on the bad or neutral things changes how you feel about them. These days I spend 30 minutes in the morning after I wake up practicing gratitude meditation. As I progressed on my recovery journey, I came home to visit my mother, Dr. Shan Kong, who is a well-known, licensed acupuncturist in Ann Arbor, and received acupuncture treatments once a week. After evaluating my underlying chemical imbalance, I started to take supplements and herbs. In six months I completely reversed my diabetes and chronic fatigue syndrome \u2014 personal proof of the efficacy and power of integrative medicine! Unfortunately, many people subject themselves to the same bad lifestyle choices that I did. We use sugar, caffeine, alcohol, or worse to manage our energy and moods. We don't pay attention to what we eat, how much we sleep and exercise, and how much time we make for connecting with family and friends. I believe the human body has an innate ability to heal itself, but sometimes it needs professional help. In my medical practice, I look into the underlying reasons a person's body is not working well and treat the root causes. In fact, the principle of health is very simple: take out the bad stuff and put in the good stuff. I evaluate factors that are negatively influencing the patient such as food and chemical sensitivities, allergies, microbes, toxins, nutritional deficiencies, mind/body imbalance, and so on. Once these factors are identified, then we can help the body to heal based on the individual's specific needs.

The further you get into it, the more it begins to make sense. \" \u2014 Harold KushnerTeachers, Lecturers, Workshop Leaders, and The Centers The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2017 Page 103 By Marta Dabis \"When you want to escape from your difficulty, or when you try to improve your practice, you create another problem for yourself. But if you just exist there, then you have a chance to appreciate your surroundings, and you can accept yourself completely, without changing anything.\" \u2014 Shunryu Suzuki RoshiJissoJi Zen Ann Arbor \u2014 A Zen Meditation Group in the Tradition of Shunryu Suzuki \"So, in our practice, we rely on something great, and sit in that great space. The pain you have in your legs or some other difficulty is happening in that great space. As long as you do not lose the feeling that you are in the realm of Buddha nature, you can sit even though you have some difficulty.\" These lines in the book Not Always So by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi were my first exposure to Zen. I was recovering from an icy highway car accident and went to the bookstore to find another book by Suzuki Roshi's called Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind . It was not there \u2014 instead I was drawn to this random page in Not Always So almost immediately. I had plenty of difficulties, pain, spasms, and a new phobia. The recent trauma redrew the maps of what I was and wasn't able to do. \" When you want to escape from your difficulty, or when you try to improve your practice, you create another problem for yourself. But if you just exist there, then you have a chance to appreciate your surroundings, and you can accept yourself completely, without changing anything.\" Tears started rolling down my face; it turns out it wasn't my old reality I needed back, but rather a softer mind that could accept me in my new reality. My inner world responded to Suzuki Roshi's words. He was speaking personally to me, to the broken, lost, and hopeful me. \" To exist in big mind is an act of faith, which is different from the usual faith of believing in a particular idea or being. It is to believe that something is supporting us and supporting all our activities including thinking mind and emotional f eelings. All these things are supported by something big that has no form or color. It is impossible to know what it is, but something exists there, something that is neither material or spiritual. Something like that always exists, and we exist in that space.\" I knew I had arrived home \u2014 at first in my heart, and a few months later, in City Center (Beginner's Mind Temple) of the San Francisco Zen Center. Suzuki Roshi's student, the editor of Not Always So , Edward Brown, became my first teacher. On the day of my arrival to Tassajara Zen Mountain Center (one of the three practice communities that comprise the San Francisco Zen Center) he gave the meditation instructions. This was in 2007. I already had a daily meditation practice (not Zen) for years; I wasn't looking for a teacher and wasn't looking for a tradition, but I was open to having a spiritual friend.Brown owned his brokenness so openly that I knew he could understand my tears well. He shared his cape with me, as a chaplain. Eventually I learned to be that chaplain myself. At the end of my residential Zen training, I formally enrolled and completed my clinical pastoral education and started working as a hospital chaplain. I was lay ordained by Brown and priest ordained by the head of the Udumbara National Sangha Diane Martin Roshi, who also trained under Suzuki Roshi and received dharma transmission from Katagiri Roshi. On the free meditation app Insight Timer, I received a request to start the lineage in Southeast Michigan. So JissoJi Zen Ann Arbor was born.
