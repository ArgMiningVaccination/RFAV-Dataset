He was sentenced to life in prison. Franklin appealed. 'US District Judge Lowell Jensen, appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, reversed the conviction this year, concluding that \"the risk of an unreliable outcome in this trial is unacceptable,\"' the Los Angeles Times reported in December 1995. Prosecutors had the option to retry Franklin but they did not.

She testified: 'I was sitting on the sofa in my family room and my daughter was playing on the floor with some of her little playmates. And my daughter said something to me, which caused me to look down at her and I matched her gaze and at that moment she really closely resembled Susan and I remembered seeing Susan sitting there and seeing my father with the rock above his head.'

Maclean, who was at the trial and wrote a book about it called Once Upon A Time, said on the series: 'It was the first murder case involving a repressed memory. I was fascinated to see how that would work in the trial. If it stood all alone would it be sufficient for a conviction.' He contrasted Eileen, who was 'such a dramatic witness' with George, who was 'sitting there the whole time like a stone figure... So it starts to right away turn into a good versus evil thing.

If you were going to make up a story that's a pretty good one to make up, isn't it.' He said in the series that Eileen was motivated by revenge and financial gain. Before the trial, she was negotiating book and movie deals, according to Maclean, the author. 'Our view was it was pretty explosive,' Horngrad, above, said. 'Eileen had a financial interest in the outcome of the case. Because, of course, if he was acquitted, her story would be worthless. Her story is only worth something if he gets convicted.

There was also a 1992 TV movie called Fatal Memories in which Shelley Long, seen above in the film, played Eileen. Georgie Jeffries, the executive producer of Fatal Memories, said in Buried that her first impression of Eileen was of a 'very serious young woman... She was on a mission. She was doing her very best to control the narrative.

Guendelman said there was a 'gold mine' of amazing archival footage of Eileen and the trial. He also noted that there was a lot of research about repressed memories in the 1990s.

They are pictured in character above (Damon right)https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/14/11/49163445-10091695-They_had_once_been_good_friends_but_on_a_cold_winter_s_day_in_De-a-2_1634208963464.jpgThe two men were engaging in what was the last judicial duel sanctioned by the French monarch, who at that time was King Charles VI. The reason for their fight? Carrouges had accused Le Gris of raping his wife, Marguerite, while she was alone at his mother's chateau. When he went to the king for justice, the monarch ordered the duel to resolve the dispute after an ordinary court trial failed to reach a conclusion.
