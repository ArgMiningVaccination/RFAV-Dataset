We exist in the realm of energy, whether we acknowledge it or not. Becoming acquainted with our subtle energy system and accepting its effect on our body, mind and spirit help us us understand and use tools to manage our actions, thoughts and attitudes. Our energy fields shift and transform as our conscious awareness develops. The more we connect with the absolute oneness of life, the stronger our subtle energy becomes. Having a strong and viable energy field assists with physical health and emotional well being. We can transform ourselves through awareness and by understanding how our life force responds to positive intention and clearing. The realm of the spirit opens us to the all-pervading consciousness of truth, love and wisdom. It gives our lives purpose and teaches us to honor our own inner guidance for living. These are the principles we work within our 22 week trans-formative class. It is an amazing journey to embark upon! In our world, energy is rarely acknowledged, we know there is electricity and wind even though we cannot always see them. We all know the strength of something hitting us in the gut, an awareness that something is wrong, this class will teach you how to understand and work with that information in a practical and helpful way. In an Energy Healing Session Dr. Paradise will work with your desires and your guides to assist you. We can address any issue or concern, lingering emotional struggles, and help to untangle the layers of energy that contribute to that. - 1 Hour Healing Session $200 - 30 Minute Healing Session $125 4 year Energetic Awareness Training Program [Nita Bryant](https://www.nitabryant.com/)online, with some in person weekend workshops at the Coast and in Portland, and ongoing classes with Dr Paradise are available at the Coast.
