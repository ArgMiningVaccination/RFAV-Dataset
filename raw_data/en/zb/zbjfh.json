The credentials, training, jobs, and available specialties are the same for both. Allopathic and osteopathic physicians use a biological approach to healing. Physicians diagnose, treat, and work to prevent human illness and injury. They perform examinations, analyze medical histories, order and interpret diagnostic tests and develop treatment plans. Allopathic and osteopathic physicians are very similar in their approach to working with patients and the differences between them are more historical than current practice. The osteopathic approach is patient-oriented and uses a holistic approach to care. Osteopathic medicine also incorporates a treatment modality, Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM), which is a form of musculo-skeletal manipulation that is used both for diagnosis and treatment. MDs and DOs practice in all the same specialties. The residency system has now been combined. "}
