With dozens of COVID-19 vaccines now in clinical trials, it is important to understand the accelerated timelines for development, the different types of vaccines available, and the facts related to vaccine safety and efficacy. Additionally, as vaccines are approved, we will track data on vaccination efforts. Explore how U.S. states delivered their supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to their residents at vastly different speeds that led to vastly different results. INTERACTIVE An interactive tool from our vaccine experts that explores how a vaccine is developed and the differences between a typical timeline and an accelerated timeline. UNDERSTANDING COVID-19 VIEW-hub is a publicly available interactive tool that displays up-to-date information on vaccine characteristics, and vaccine introduction and use globally. Vaccines include COVID-19 as well as many childhood vaccines in routine immunization programs. Understanding COVID-19 COMIT, the COVID-19 Maternal Immunization Tracker, provides a global picture of national public health policies that influence access to COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant and lactating people. Vaccines Q & A The Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center provides free, online training to equip people with knowledge to debunk false claims about vaccinations. Vaccines Q & A Emergency use authorization for Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine for U.S. children is unlikely to lead to widespread vaccinations among the nation's 28 million 5-to-11-year-olds. Vaccines Q & A Nearly 60% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. All of Africa: just 6%. Yet the United States is expanding boosters and authorizing vaccines for children age 5 to 11 years old - and hoarding and wasting additional doses. This series of brief reports will shed light on COVID-19 vaccine development, allocation and deployment in the United States and globally. Topics will include ensuring the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, principles for vaccine allocation, strategies for deployment and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, vaccine confidence and demand, and the economics of Covid-19 vaccines. REPORT | March 1, 2021 By Carleigh Krubiner, Chizoba Wonodi, Elana Jaffe, Ruth Faden COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University. Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington hosted a high-level symposium, \"The Scientific Integrity of COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials: From Clinical Trials to Public Allocation,\" that explored complex issues, brought together leading voices in the field, and put forward a concise plan for protecting the scientific integrity of these ongoing efforts. webcasts | October 6, 2020 webcasts | October 6, 2020 Filter By news | June 30, 2022 American children ages 6 months through 4 years recently became eligible to receive coronavirus vaccinations, after federal regulators and health officials cleared vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for very young children. news | June 27, 2022 U.S. health authorities are facing a critical decision: whether to offer new COVID-19 booster shots this fall that are modified to better match recent changes of the shape-shifting coronavirus. news | June 16, 2022 When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meets at the end of June to discuss whether the vaccine should be modified before the likely rollout of more booster shots in the fall, it will have to make decisions without knowing how the virus will continue to change. news | May 23, 2022 Three doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine offer strong protection for children younger than 5, the company announced Monday, another step toward shots for the littlest kids possibly beginning in early summer. news | May 9, 2022 Since the Omicron wave crested in January, multiple studies and datasets have demonstrated that the mRNA vaccines are not nearly as effective against this variant as they were against earlier variants or the original virus. news | April 18, 2022 According to the CDC, Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred for individuals who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. news | April 1, 2022 Adults 50 and older can now roll up their sleeves for a second COVID-19 booster, as can younger individuals with certain immune-compromising conditions. news | March 31, 2022 More than 16 million Americans rolled up their sleeves last year to get Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine because it promised to be a \"one and done\" shot, but newer information and booster authorizations suggest they should consider a third dose. news | March 29, 2022 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agreed with the FDA and has updated its vaccine recommendations to include a second booster. news | March 29, 2022 On Tuesday, the FDA announced that it has expanded the emergency use authorization for the two vaccines to allow adults 50 and older to get a second booster as early as fourth months after their first booster dose. experts | March 29, 2022 The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday authorized an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for Americans 50 and older and for certain younger people with severely weakened immune systems. news | March 18, 2022 The coronavirus vaccines most widely used in the United States remained highly effective at preventing the worst outcomes from infections even in the face of the highly transmissible Omicron variant in January, a report released Friday by federal disease trackers shows.
