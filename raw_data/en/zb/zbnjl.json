Consider a skin-care analogy: If daily conditioner is akin to your lightweight [body lotions](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-body-lotions-for-every-skin-type.html), hair masks are more of a body butter, explains Ash Fritzler, master stylist at [the Bird House](https://birdhousenyc.com/) salon. And stylist Danielle Priano, whose clients include Hailey Bieber and Jennifer Lopez, believes \"hair masks are key to healthy hair, no matter the texture.\" Although, according to Shirley Hagel, an advanced creative stylist at [Parlor Hair Salon](http://www.parlorhairsalon.com/), hair type isn't always the most important guiding factor in this context. \"For me, choosing a mask isn't so much about whether hair is thick or [thin](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-shampoo-for-thinning-hair.html),\" she says. Rather, her most important consideration is what the hair needs \u2014 whether that be hydration, damage repair, or nutrient replenishment. To find the best masks for all kinds of hair types (at all kinds of price points), I talked to 17 experts, including salon owners and stylists, and then tested out a few of their favorite recommendations myself. And before we dive into the specific brands that our experts turn to for those varying needs, here is some general advice that emerged from the group: Aim to use a mask about one to two times a week (in place of your usual conditioner), leave it on for about 10 to 15 minutes, and rinse with cold water to enhance shine. What we're looking for Ingredients The most important thing about hair masks is the active ingredients they are formulated with. Make sure you're giving your hair what it needs most, whether that's oils for hydration, bond rebuilders for damage repair, or vitamins and antioxidants for health. Sulfate-free Like shampoo and conditioners, some hair masks are formulated with sulfates and others are not. While many hair types can tolerate sulfates, those with sensitive skin or who have hair that is damaged or color-treated should try to steer clear and opt for a sulfate-free option instead. Size I'm also keeping an eye on the total ounces of hair mask you're getting per dollar. Best overall hair mask Ingredients: Olaplex, bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 3.3 oz. We first heard about the benefits of Olaplex products when we talked to hairstylists about the best [shampoos for color-treated hair](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-shampoos-dandruff-volumizing-thinning-dry.html). The line's \"repairing treatment\" (effectively a mask) has the same bond-building benefits. \"If my clients have a color service with me, I'm sending them home with Olaplex No. 3,\" Fritzler says. But it's not only for the color-treated among us: Regardless of hair texture, Fritzler says she's seen the transformation this formula can bring to her clients with just one use a week. I used Olaplex once a week for close to a year and was always super- impressed by how soft and shiny my hair looked after the treatment. Long term, it kept my fine hair healthy and strong, especially after I highlighted it. [Maria Elizabeth](https://www.instagram.com/maria.elizabeth.art/?hl=en), founder of Salon deZEN, also appreciates how well it works on a variety of hair types, calling it a versatile product she recommends to anyone with hair that feels compromised (and \"even pollution exposure can compromise hair integrity,\" Fritzler adds). It also works on \"natural textures that tend to feel coarse or dry, and even perfectly healthy hair that is seeing a seasonal change in hair health,\" says [ Jessica O'Keeffe](https://www.instagram.com/jessicaleestyling/), a stylist at [Hawthorne Studio](http://hawthorne-studio.com/). Developed by chemists, Olaplex uses a patented bond-building technology that is said to help rebuild the [ damaged parts](http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/03/best-hair-mask-for-dry-hair-kenra-revive-treatment.html) inside each strand. And while that might sound intense, O'Keeffe notes that it doesn't have an excessive amount of protein in it, so it's not aggressive on the hair. Hairstylist Dhiran Mistry recommends the mask as a general powerhouse: \"It will help reform shattered hair bonds,\" as he puts it. Olaplex No. 3 is a favorite of hairstylist [ Michelle Cleveland](https://www.instagram.com/michelleclevelandhair/) as well, but she emphasized following the directions to get the best results. Best less expensive hair mask Ingredients: Moringa Seed Oil | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 6.3 oz. \"This is our tried-and-true mask that works with nearly every hair texture, from straight to wavy to curly,\" says Stephanie Louis, founder of [Stylebox Salon](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203822/https://www.styleboxsalon.co/) in Prospect Heights. \"It's super-light and not sticky.\" Louis says that [Verb's Ghost line](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203822/https://www.verbproducts.com/collections/ghost) is great for healthy-feeling hair (she's previously [recommended the Ghost shampoo](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203822/http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-shampoos-dandruff-volumizing-thinning-dry.html)) and will also help restore a healthy look for those who have dry hair from chemical processing or coloring. Like all of Ghost's products, the mask is paraben- and [sulfate-free](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203822/http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html), meaning it won't dull color-treated hair; it also contains glycerin, which has a softening effect. Moringa seed oil, known for its nourishing compounds, works to add back moisture. Those with curlier hair textures may not see immediate improvement after using the mask because the formula is so light \u2014 but give it two to three months of regular use, advises Louis. Best starter hair mask Ingredients: Snow mushroom extract, murumuru butter, and pequi oil | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 5 oz. R+Co's Television Perfect Hair Masque is \"a really good starter mask,\" according to Fritzler, because it can be used for all hair types (even those with [finer hair](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422203822/http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-shampoos-fine-hair.html)). The formula includes hydrating snow mushroom extract, emollient murumuru butter, and pequi oil \u2014 all of which lock in moisture \u2014 in addition to ingredients that will give your hair softness and shine. The mask has a nice scent, too, with notes of cardamom, tangerine, and lavender. Best hair mask for dry hair Ingredients: Prickly pear seed oil | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 8.4 oz. New look, same mask. Dianna Cohen, founder of hair-care line [Crown Affair](https://www.crownaffair.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7LCk9Zip5wIVFKSzCh1LggaiEAAYASAAEgK3KPD_BwE), says that her \"favorite hair mask of all time\" is this one from Christophe Robin. She calls it \"the most universal hydrating mask\" and says that you would just use a dime-size amount if you have finer hair and more if you have thicker or [curlier hair](http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/11/best-hair-products-curly-hair-2017-shampoo-conditioner-oil.html). Cohen says she uses it about twice a week, and though the price is still steep, ingredients like the Prickly Pear seed oil, which is rich in vitamin E, make it worth the cost. Vitamin E restores the protein and keratin of your hair, which in turn makes it shinier and silkier without clogging your scalp or causing buildup, explains Cohen (she notes that masks can often cause buildup if you use them too close to your scalp). She leaves the mask on for about 15 minutes and then rinses it out with cold water. If you want to truly luxuriate with your hair mask, Cohen told us the ingredients in the Christophe Robin mask take well to heat \u2014 apply it under a shower cap, and then put a [hot towel](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-holiday-gift-towel-warmer-brookstone-review.html) on top. Best (less expensive) hair mask for dry hair Ingredients: Shea butter, Moroccan clay | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 12 oz. This is not only the least expensive mask for dry hair on this list but also the cheapest on the list overall. (And no, it's not a sample size either.) Myleik Teele, who has tested thousands of products as the founder of [CURLBOX](https://curlbox.com/), a subscription service for curly hair products, says it \"can go toe-to-toe\" with any other high-priced mask when it comes to performance because of how moisturizing it is. While Teele loves it for curly hair, it's a good option for anyone with extremely dry hair. It has shea butter in it to moisturize, while the Moroccan clay helps to clean the hair. It's also heat activated, so if you have access to a hooded dryer at home, now would be the time to use it \u2014 but if you don't, the shower-cap-plus-hot-towel method will work too. Best hair mask for aging hair Ingredients: Orchid flower extract, hydrolyzed quinoa protein | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 6.7 oz. If you want to help stop the effects of aging, Elizabeth suggests using a hair mask one to three times a week. Young Again has specific ingredients she says work to restore and replenish the hair to more youthful-looking locks. It's packed with vitamins and antioxidants from natural ingredients like orchid flower extract, which is rich in nourishing proteins that help to strengthen the hair \"while also providing intense hydration, elasticity, and silkiness, she says. It also has hydrolyzed quinoa protein, which Elizabeth says will leave the hair feeling rejuvenated. You won't have to wait long for these results either \u2014 she says you'll notice a difference after just one use. Best hair mask for fine hair Ingredients: Glycerin, deep-sea water | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 6 oz. Those with [fine hair](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-shampoos-fine-hair.html) may not need to use a mask at all if they get enough nourishment from their conditioner. (If that's you, Fritzler advises talking to your hairstylist about the results you're hoping to achieve before using a mask.) That said, we did hear about this Shu Uemura mask created specifically to give fine hair some lift, recommended by Mistry. The mask's ingredient list includes deep-sea water, which is rich in nutrients and minerals that help keep hair hydrated and weightless. The formula is also meant to rebalance natural hair oils \u2014 another step toward keeping fine hair from falling flat on an oily scalp. [Mark DeBolt](https://www.instagram.com/markcolorist/), co-owner of [Mark Ryan Salon](https://www.markryansalon.com/), seconds Mistry's recommendation, calling it the \"absolute best\" mask for finer hair types because it offers \"lightweight and long-lasting volume,\" he says. Best (less expensive) hair mask for fine hair Ingredients: Coconut and macadamia oils | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 13 oz. Strategist writer Rachael Griffths, who describes her hair as fine and color treated, had noticed her hair was feeling drier and frizzier than normal. When her hairdresser confirmed it \u2014 calling her hair \"exceedingly dry\" \u2014 Griffiths said she ran to her local drugstore to find a hair mask to use immediately. This Garnier Ultimate Blends Hair Food mask caught her eye. \"A couple of times a week, I put a generous glob of the mask in my wet hair and leave it to nourish overnight. When I go to blow-dry it, my hair (even my dry ends that bear the last evidence of my lockdown dalliance with peroxide) feels smooth and silky and looks great, even on the third and (sometimes) fourth day between washes.\" The product can also be used as an in-shower or leave-in conditioner. Best hair mask for color-treated hair Ingredients: K18Peptide | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 1.7 oz. K18 was originally a salon-only treatment but was launched in 2021 for at-home use and quickly became a new favorite among beauty writers and editors. \"Basically, K18 works by delivering a patented amino-acid chain to the inner structure of your hair, replacing missing amino acids and regenerating the bond to repair your hair,\" [explains Strategist beauty columnist Rio Viera-Newton](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-products-to-heal-bleached-hair-2021.html), who says that after using it every other week, she noticed \"a big difference in the texture, softness, and general health\" of her bleached hair. Both myself and Strategist writer Tembe Denton-Hurst also swear by it. I particularly like how much simpler it is to apply versus traditional hair masks. After shampooing your hair (and skipping your conditioner), you apply a few pumps depending on your length and thickness and work it through your hair. Then you just wait four minutes for the product to soak in and style as usual. Best color-depositing hair mask Ingredients: Almond and buriti oil | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 8 oz. If you'd like your hair mask to also give your color a boost, Rio recommends this color-depositing mask from Christophe Robin, which she promises will \"give your hair a color boost that's as close to [salon color](https://nymag.com/strategist/2018/07/the-16-best-products-for-double-processed-hair-2018.html) as you can humanly get from home.\" When Rio's hair was bleach blonde, she used the Baby Blonde mask, but the brand also has shades like chestnut, cool brown, golden blonde, and copper. \"Magical color-fixing properties aside, it's one of the most wonderfully hydrating hair masks I've ever used,\" she says. Best hair mask for heat-damaged hair Ingredients: Sweet almond oil, oat kernel extract, apricot kernel oil, and linseed extract | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 8 oz. One product that will help bring some life back to heat-treated hair is this mask from It's a 10, which Louis says is ideal for those who often use heat tools on their hair. The mask's restorative properties come from ingredients like antioxidant-packed oat-kernel extract, apricot kernel oil, which adds moisturizing vitamins A and E to the mix, and linseed extract, which calms the scalp and gives hair a softer, silkier feeling. Louis says you should notice your hair looking less dull almost immediately and that over time, as the mask repairs your hair, you'll notice more volume as well. Best hair mask for curly hair Ingredients: Australian kakadu plum and starflower oil | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 12 oz. Since its launch two years ago, Bread has instantly become a favorite of \"lazy naturals,\" people with curly hair who want a simplified, low-maintenance approach to hair care, says Strategist beauty writer [Tembe Denton-Hurst](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-black-owned-hair-care-products-routine.html). The hair mask \u2014 also a favorite of our friends over at [the Cut](https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/reviews-2020-sephoras-newest-curly-haircare-line-bread.html) \u2014 is chock-full of Australian kakadu plum and starflower oil, both of which add shine and moisture to curls. Best hair mask for fine, curly hair [Hours in Minutes Silkening Mask](https://hourshaircare.com/products/in-minutes) Ingredients: Avocado and coconut oils | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 6 oz. \"Faster than you can say 'Rumpelstiltskin,' this heavenly-scented [hair mask](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-hair-masks.html) spins strawlike [Cheryl Kramer Kaye](https://nymag.com/author/cheryl-kramer-kaye/). \"It's infused with avocado oil, which has fatty acids to moisturize and strengthen hair, and coconut oil, which has a low molecular weight to give you superlight conditioning and breakage prevention. I reach for it nearly every time I'm in the shower, and it hasn't weighed my fairly fine curls down yet.\" Best hair mask for coarse hair Ingredients: Euterpe oleracea fruit extract, Myrciaria dubia fruit | Size: 8 oz. Mirjam Bayoumi, whose [namesake Upper East Side salon](http://www.mirjambayoumi.com/) is known for its hair-coloring services, says that her own thick and wavy hair has damaged ends. To combat some of the damage, she uses Brazilian Blowout's mask, which she recommends to anyone with coarse hair because it has a moisturizing formula that helps with detangling. The mask contains the brand's signature \"Brazilian Super-Nutrient Complex,\" which includes Euterpe Oleracea fruit its antioxidant properties. And its berry-derived Myrciaria dubia fruit extract is packed with vitamin C. Together, the ingredients condition the hair cuticle and cut down on frizz without weighing down the [curl or waviness](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-hair-ties.html) of hair. As far as the application goes, just as Cohen suggested with the Christophe Robin mask, Bayoumi says the Brazilian Blowout does well with heat. Best hair mask for wavy hair Ingredients: Macadamia oil, wild mango butter, keratin, | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 5.92 oz. Priano says anyone with thick, coarse, curly, dry, or damaged hair should look for a mask with oils like macadamia, jojoba, coconut, Moroccan, or argan. This mask, which she loves for her wavy- to curly-haired clients, contains macadamia and jojoba oils, as well as protective keratin and hydrating Japanese bamboo to deliver plenty of moisture without weighing the hair down. The macadamia nut oil in the mask smooths while the sunflower seed extract adds shine, Priano tells us. And while you may be tempted to keep a mask on overnight, Priano advises against it, since leaving a keratin-infused mask on for too long can lead to breakage as well as dry or brittle hair. Instead, she recommends getting the most out of your mask by [combing it](https://psxdanielle.com/collections/combs/products/styling-comb) through while in the shower, which helps the product penetrate deeper into the hair shaft and seal the cuticle. Best hair mask for breakage-prone hair Ingredients: Fiaschetto tomato extract | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 8.45 This Davines mask's moisturizing quality comes from Fiaschetto tomato extract, which is packed with antioxidants and [vitamin C.](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-vitamin-c-serums.html) Fritzler uses it for all kinds of issues \u2014 chemical processing, sun damage \u2014 but especially recommends it for those who are dealing with brittle and breakage-prone hair due to medical conditions. Fritzler has gotten rave reviews from clients undergoing cancer treatment or autoimmune disease after recommending this mask. She notes that if you are having breakage because of a medical issue, the mask won't return your hair completely to its original state, but it does restore nutrients back into the hair, which in turn makes it feel healthier and look shinier. Best moisturizing hair mask Ingredients: Rose-hip and argan oils, algae, and biotin | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 8 oz. If your hair needs some serious moisture, try this deep-conditioning mask that [Rio](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-moisturizing-hair-masks.html) relied on when her hair was bleach blonde. \"This mask has a great consistency \u2014 not too thick or rich, not too light,\" she says. Plus, it's formulated with rose-hip and argan oils, as well as biotin, \"all of which replenish, rejuvenate, and [deeply condition](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/briogeo-dont-despair-repair-mask-review.html) your hair,\" she explains. \"It will leave your hair looking beautiful and bouncy and feeling extremely [ silky and conditioned ](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/the-best-products-to-combat-frizzy-summer-hair.html)for days,\" she says. Rio recommends using it approximately every other wash and leaving it on for at least 20 minutes for best results. Best softening hair mask Ingredients: Elastin, castor seed oil, olive oil, and glycerin | Sulfate-free: Yes | Size: 5.07 oz. Because my hair is so fine, finding a mask that's deeply nourishing but not greasy or heavy is always a challenge, but I think after years of searching, I've finally found one that works. Philip Kingsley Elasticizer is formulated with a combination of elastin, castor seed and olive oils, and glycerin. While I'm typically skeptical of products that promise immediate results, I can't deny that I was shocked by how incredibly soft, shiny, and detangled my hair was after just one treatment. And unlike with other brands, my hair didn't feel heavy or greasy at all afterward. The brand recommends leaving it on for ten to 20 minutes or overnight, depending on when you wash your hair. Once a week, I apply the mask before an evening shower, pop on a shower cap, and leave it to soak in for 20 minutes before shampooing and conditioning my hair as usual. My hair has never been healthier.
