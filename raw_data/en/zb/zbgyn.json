But first, what is meditation? It is defined as the regular process of training your mind to focus and redirect your thoughts.

The very best way is to call and speak with the receptionist of your clinic of interest and ask them if they have experience in or specialize in your primary condition you are seeking care for. While most acupuncturists have trained extensively for 3-5 years in graduate level study acupuncture programs, and receive a Master's degree or a Doctorate (also known as a Acupuncture Physician), it's still best to work with an acupuncturist or clinic that has experienced success in treating your condition. Some questions you can ask when you phone a prospective acupuncture clinic: Has the acupuncturist treated my type of condition before? What is the success rate of treating my condition at this clinic? How many years of experience does the acupuncturist have? Do you offer any additional therapies beyond acupuncture to help address my condition? What can I expect during my first visit? (Is it just a consultation, or will I receive treatment that day?) Most of our patients are referred by word of mouth, from former patients who have also experienced success. Our acupuncturist Dr. Laura Parks does specialize in chronic, complex conditions and has been practicing for over 13 years. She received her acupuncture doctorate from Five Branches University, and acupuncture masters from Maryland University of Integrative Health (formerly Tai Sophia). Dr. Parks has been treating Fertility patients for over 13 years and specializing in neuropathy for over 4 years, with over a 85% success rate. [ At Peace Instead of In Pieces ](https://cloud9acuclinic.com/at-peace-instead-of-in-pieces/) Lately we've had a huge surge in New Patients. Most of these patients are completely new to acupuncture, some are not. Some saw another acupuncturist years ago for a few visits perhaps. One of my takeaways as one of the 6 acupuncturists here at Cloud 9 from the past few weeks is a reminder of just how powerful it can be to have a practitioner provide deep listening. What do I mean by \"Deep Listening?\" Many of our patients recently have said their peace and then looked at me with a soft smile and said, \"wow, I feel like I'm talking to my therapist, but I'm more relaxed. I feel so much better.\" Usually followed by, \"Does anyone else ever tell you that?\" The answer is Yes. Many times. The reason patients have this healing experience so often is because we set a supportive environment where patients can bring any of their concerns or life difficulties to the table to be tended to. As an acupuncturist, I was also given years of training as a Wellness Coach, giving mindset shifting tools to carefully craft and curate for each individual patient at hand. That's not to take away from a psychologist or therapist. We refer out to therapists all the time and we respect the amazing work they do. At the same time, we acknowledge that acupuncture brings healing to what the Ancient Chinese described as \"Body/Mind/Spirit\" and we tend our patients knowing that what ails the mind will show up in the body, and what ails the body will weigh heavily on the mind. We are here to tend you by looking at you holistically (and as a whole). I look forward to seeing you on the table soon, so we can continue to help you Find Peace, and Bring Your (maybe not so broken?) Pieces back together.

You may hear your practitioner speaking about your CF or Constitutional Factor, and you are probably asking yourself what that means? In Five Element Acupuncture Theory there are five elements or seasons that we use to help diagnosis and understand our patients. We have each of these elements within us, but we prefer one to two of them over the others. Those elements that we unknowingly prefer or align with are what we would call a person's Constitutional Factor or CF. Within each CF there are the meridians, colors, odors, sounds, emotions, personality traits, seasons, etc. that go along with it. One of these elements is a Fire Constitutional Factor. The season for Fire is Summer which is coming to an end as we head into Late Summer. This element is very loving and playful. It likes to build connections with others and find partnership. Fire CF's will have some red or lack of red on their skin around their eyes, and will have a scorched smell odor to them. They connect to the heart, pericardium, small intestine and triple burner meridians. Kelly sees patients on Tuesdays & Thursdays 12p -8pm, Saturdays 10am-3pm in Timonium, and Wednesdays 12:30pm-7:30pm in White Marsh. Read "}
