Individuals vio-lating those standards are subject to disciplinary action; suchbreaches could lead to expulsion of the student from IndianaUniversity or to rescission of a degree already granted. ACADEMIC RENEWAL POLICY General Considerations The academic renewal policy encourages capable, mature, undergraduate students to return to IU South Bend after theywere academically unsuccessful during an earlier attempt athigher education within the Indiana University system. Thispolicy pertains only to undergraduate students who do not havea bachelor's degree. Meant to apply campuswide to all IUSouth Bend academic units, the academic renewal optiondescribed here exists only on the IU South Bend campus andnot on any other campus of Indiana University. Students whowish to apply for renewal must contact their respective acad-emic units at the time of application for readmission. If renewalis granted, all grades earned prior to the renewal are no longerused in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average,which is reset to zero. Academic Renewal Policy The academic renewal option described here is subject to the following considerations:1. The IU South Bend academic renewal policy applies to any former Indiana University student who; a. has not yet completed a bachelor's degree, andb. has not attended any campus of Indiana University for a minimum of the last three years (36 months). 2. Academic renewal applies to all Indiana University course work taken prior to readmission to IU South Bend. A stu-dent seeking academic renewal may not exempt certaincourses from the application of the renewal policy.Furthermore, this policy is inapplicable to any gradesissued owing to academic dishonesty. As a precondition ofany student receiving academic renewal, the registrar'soffice formally evaluates the student's record to identifyany grades resulting from academic dishonesty. 3. Academic renewal may be invoked only once over the course of a student's academic career at IU South Bend. 4. Because academic renewal is aimed at academically unsuc- cessful students, the grade point average (GPA) for theperiod for which renewal is sought must be lower than 2.0. 5. The policy is applied after a probationary period in which the student earns at least 12 credit hours with a minimumgrade of C+ (2.3 grade point average) in all coursesattempted. 6. Academic renewal does not occur automatically: A stu- dent must apply for academic renewal, and the petitionmust be approved by the student's academic unit. If thepetition is approved, all grades earned prior to the renewalare no longer used in the calculation of the program GPA.The GPA earned after academic renewal takes effect issubject to each academic unit's rules regarding academicprobation and dismissal. 7. Although the grades in the courses to which academic renewal is applied are not considered in calculating theGPA, the courses themselves may still be used to satisfycredit hour and degree requirements if the original gradesearned are C (2.0) or higher. 8. After approval of the request for academic renewal, a stu- dent must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours(including the 12 credit hour probationary period) on theIU South Bend campus to meet the graduation residencyrequirement and must complete a minimum of 60 credithours to merit graduation with academic distinction. 9. Invocation of the academic renewal option does not pre- clude a student's using other available, course-specificgrade replacement options, subject to each academic unit'srules and procedures and the conditions set out in the IUSouth Bend Grade Replacement Policy. 10.Academic renewal is available only for courses taken at Indiana University. Each academic unit retains the right toconsider records of performance from other universities indetermining admission to the academic unit, the grantingof honors and academic distinction, and other matters. ACADEMIC STANDING The university has established levels of competency,according to grade point average and semesters completed,which determine whether an undergraduate student is in goodstanding, on probation, or ineligible to continue studies.Good Standing: Those students who consistently maintain a minimum of 2.0 on their cumulative and semester recordsare considered to be in good standing. Probation: Students are on probation for the duration of the next regular semester or summer session following theone in which they failed to attain a 2.0 GPA. They are alsoACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND POLICIESon probation whenever their cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0. Additionally, several academicprograms of the university have specific grade require-ments that affect probationary status. (Consult appro-priate sections of this Bulletin.) Dismissal: Students may be dismissed from the university if they: \u0081 make less than a 1.0 (D) average for a semester, or \u0081 are on probabion two consecutive semesters and have a cumulative grade point average less than 2.0 (C). *See chart below ADDITION OF COURSES /LATEREGISTRATION Undergraduate students are permitted to register late or add courses only during the first two weeks of the semester (firstweek in summer sessions).

EMERGENCY CLOSING The primary person responsible for making the decision toclose or cancel classes at IU South Bend is the chancellor. Inthe chancellors absence, the vice chancellor for academicaffairs will make the decision. IU South Bend has aligned itself with the South Bend Community School Corporation (SBCSC), and in most caseswill cancel all classes at all campuses when the SBCSC can-cels classes due to weather conditions. IU South Bend off-campus centers are also aligned with their respective school districts and in most cases will cancelclasses in those locations when the local school district can-cels classes. This includes the Elkhart, Concord, andPlymouth school districts. When the main IU South Bendcampus is closed, classes at all sites will be cancelled. The campus is notified of any closing or emergency situation through the IU South Bend IU Notify system which includestelephone calls, e-mails, and text messaging. Information isalso delivered by the administration through telephone trees,switchboard messages, the campus electronic bulletin board,the IU South Bend Web site, and local news media. ENROLLMENT RESTRICTION No undergraduate student, except those who declare busi-ness as their major, is allowed to take more than 23 percentof his/her course work credit hours in business courses underany circumstances. The undergraduate business program hasthe responsibility of monitoring the implementation of thisrequirement. Any minor in business is subject to approval bythe undergraduate business program office. FINAL EXAMINATION SCHEDULING POLICY Students are to be notified by the instructor of any deviationfrom the published final examination schedule no later thansix weeks prior to the beginning of the final examinationperiod. In the event a student is scheduled to take more thantwo final examinations on the same day, the student mayexercise the following options: \u0081 Take final examinations as scheduled.\u0081 Consult with the instructor or academic program giving the final examination to determine if any make-up exam-ination(s) is or can be scheduled. If no make-up exami-nation is available, then the student must notify theinstructor or academic program of the course scheduledfor the third (and additional) final examination of the day.That instructor or that academic program is then oblig-ated to adjust the student's final examination schedule,provided the student has notified that instructor or acad-emic program 30 calendar days or more prior to the dateon which the final examination scheduling conflict exists. GRADE GRIEV ANCES If a student disputes his/her final course grade, the studentmust discuss the matter with the faculty member assigningthe grade no later than the end of the next regular semester. If the faculty member disagrees with the student's case for changing the grade, the student may appeal to the chair-person of the department that offered the course. If the chair-person of the department disagrees, the student may appealto the dean or program director of the area that offered thecourse. If the faculty member, chairperson, dean or programdirector all disagree with the student's request, the studentmay then appeal to the Academic Affairs Committee of theIU South Bend Academic Senate. That committee thenmakes its recommendation to the vice chancellor for acad-emic affairs, who makes a final resolution. In those instances where either the faculty member, chair- person, or dean or program director supports the student'sappeal, the student and the person supporting the appeal mustsubmit a written appeal to the Academic Affairs Committee ofthe academic senate. That committee reviews the appeal andmakes a recommendation to the vice chancellor for academicaffairs, who makes a final resolution. GRADE REPLACEMENT POLICY The IU South Bend Grade Replacement Policy modifies thecurrent Indiana University Faculty Council FX policy bybroadening the replacement option to courses in which a stu-dent receives any grade except a W, I, or NC. The purpose ofthis expansion is to allow an IU South Bend student who hasdone poorly in a course, even if he or she has not failed thecourse, to repeat the course and remove the weight of the ear-lier grade from the student's cumulative grade point average.This modified grade replacement policy applies only to GENERAL INFORMATION 29 courses taken on the IU South Bend campus. Courses taken on other Indiana University campuses can still be replaced, butonly under the old system. That is, only if the original gradesin those courses were F's. This grade replacement policy fol-lows the Indiana University system's general rule that a stu-dent can replace (i.e., FX) a maximum of three courses or amaximum of 10 credit hours (whichever comes first). Any FXcourses prior to the fall of 2004 are included in this 10 credithour maximum. A student can repeat a course for which gradereplacement is sought only once. A student who wishes to apply for grade replacement must obtain the approval of his or her academic unit. Some IUSouth Bend academic units may not honor the grade replace-ment policy when they consider, for example, admission to theacademic unit, the granting of honors and academic distinc-tion, and other matters. Therefore, each student is advised tocheck beforehand with his or her academic unit regarding therules and restrictions that may apply. Furthermore, every stu-dent should recognize that other higher education institutionsmay not honor this grade replacement policy. Some particu-larly competitive undergraduate programs and most graduate-level programs in medicine, law, and other fields may use theoriginal grades for the purposes of determining the grade pointaverage required for admission. The grade replacement option is subject to the following con- siderations:1. The IU South Bend grade replacement policy applies to undergraduate courses taken by students who do not havea bachelor's degree. In no case may a grade be replaced fora course taken prior to the awarding of a bachelor's degree. 2. This policy merely excludes certain grades from the calcu- lation of the cumulative grade point average (GPA). Allgrades remain a part of a student's academic record; a nota-tion on the transcript indicates if a grade is not included inthe GPA calculation. In determining admission, themeeting of degree requirements, the granting of honors andacademic distinction, and other matters, each academicunit may use a GPA calculation that does not honor gradereplacement. The GPA earned after grade replacement issubject to each academic unit's rules regarding academicprobation and dismissal. In short, each academic unitretains the right to consider, for internal purposes, a stu-dent's complete academic record. 3. Under this policy, a student can replace the grades in any course taken at IU South Bend, except courses in which thestudent received the grades of W, I, or NC. However,courses taken at any other Indiana University campus canbe replaced only if a student received the grade of F. 4. A student may exercise the grade replacement policy for a maximum of three courses or 10 credit hours (whichevercomes first). The 10 credit hour limit includes any coursespreviously replaced under the FX policy prior to 2004 andany previously FX'd courses that were approved for acad-emic renewal. A student may exercise the grade replace-ment policy only once for any single course. 5. Grade replacement under this policy ordinarily is available for undergraduate courses with fixed credit hours and fixedtopics. The course in which the student reenrolls must bethe same course for which grade replacement is sought.Grades in courses that have different titles or variabletopics may be replaced only if the content in both coursesis the same. In such cases, a student may petition to replacea grade in one course with the grade earned in anothercourse, provided the two courses are equivalent. To deter-mine equivalence, a comparison of course descriptionsalone is not adequate. In making this determination, thefaculty offering the course shall apply the same criteria asused in evaluating courses for transfer purposes. 6. Once invoked, a student may not subsequently request reversal of the grade replacement granted to a particularcourse. 7. Subject to the restrictions set out in earlier paragraphs, a student who received academic renewals may still usegrade replacement for work taken subsequent to thegranting of academic renewal. 8. Grade replacement does not happen automatically. It is the responsibility of the student who wishes to repeat a coursein order to replace the grade to consult with his or her aca-demic unit regarding its policies. 9. Enforcement of the grade replacement policy is the respon- sibility of the academic unit that certifies a student's ful-fillment of degree requirements. Problems relating to thepolicy are referred to the academic unit's dean or equiva-lent. 10.IU South Bend joins all other campuses in honoring the principle that the grade policies on the degree-grantingcampus are applicable to each student. Hence, if an IUSouth Bend student transfers to another Indiana Universitycampus, IU South Bend honors requests from that campus,on behalf of the student, to replace a grade earned at IUSouth Bend. Were the student to return to IU South Bendfor graduation, however, the student must check with theiracademic unit for their policies regarding grade replace-ment. GRADING CODE The official grade code of the university is as follows: A(highest passing grade), B, C, D (lowest passing grade), F(Fail), I (Incomplete), P (Pass), S (Satisfactory), and W(Withdrawn). I, P, S, and W are not calculated in a student'sGPA, but the grade of F is calculated as 0 points. Quality points are assigned for purposes of determining the cumulative grade point average as follows: GRADING CODE SCALE A+ = 4.0 C+ = 2.3 A = 4.0 C = 2.0 A-= 3.7 C-= 1.7 B+ = 3.3 D+ = 1.3B = 3.0 D = 1.0B -= 2.7 D-= 0.7 F = 030 GENERAL INFORMATION GRADE POINT AVERAGE A minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 (C) is required for undergraduates. Transfer studentsadmitted from other institutions with deficiencies in creditpoints are expected to overcome those deficiencies with IUSouth Bend grades. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS It is expected that a substantial part of the course work doneby students who intend to graduate from IU South Bend,especially in their major field, be completed on the IU SouthBend campus. Candidates ordinarily are not recommendedto receive the bachelor's degree from IU South Bend unlessthey earn 30 hours of credit at this campus. Specific acad-emic program requirements for graduation should also benoted in the respective sections of this Bulletin. Degrees are conferred in December, May, and August.Commencement is conducted in May. Students who intendto complete their degree work within a given year must con-tact their academic program early in that year. All credithours of candidates for degrees, except for the work of thecurrent semester, must be on record at least six weeks priorto the conferring of degrees. GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION Graduates whose minimum grade point averages (GPAs) are3.9 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU SouthBend are graduated with highest distinction; those whoseminimum GPAs are 3.8 and who complete at least 60 credithours at IU South Bend are graduated with high distinction;and those whose minimum GPAs are 3.65 and who completeat least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated withdistinction. These honors are noted on diplomas and in com-mencement programs. Students who earn them are eligible towear the cream and crimson fourrag\u00e9re at commencement. Some programs limit the number of students awarded dis- tinction to the top 10 percent of the graduating class. Othersmay use different criteria for awarding distinction. INCOMPLETE GRADES A grade of I (Incomplete) may be given when a substantialamount of the course work (75 percent) is satisfactorily com-pleted by the end of the semester. The grade of I is givenonly when the completed portion of the student's work is ofpassing quality. The grade of I is awarded only under cir-cumstances of hardship, when it is unjust to hold a student tothe time limits ordinarily fixed for completion of coursework. A student must remove the I within a calendar year from the date of its recording or, if required by the instructor, in ashorter time period. The academic program head may autho-rize adjustments of this period in exceptional circumstances.If the student fails to remove the I within the time allowed,the grade is changed to F. Students may not register for creditin a course in which they have a grade of I.These regulations do not apply to courses in which comple-tion of the course work is not usually required at the end ofthe semester. Incomplete work in those courses is denoted byR (deferred grade). INDEPENDENT /CORRESPONDENCE STUDY The Indiana University School of Continuing Studies offersinterested individuals the option of taking university courses,both credit and noncredit, at home through the IndianaUniversity independent study division. Credit earned in cor-respondence courses is not counted toward any graduatedegree. It is possible, however, that such work may be usedby the student to make up entrance deficiencies. For moreinformation, call continuing education at (877) 462-4872,extension 4261; or off-campus programs at (800) 321-7834. PASS/FAILOPTION During the undergraduate program, a student in goodstanding (not on probation) may enroll in up to a maximumof eight elective courses to be taken with a grade of P (Pass)or F (Fail). The Pass/Fail option may not be taken when oth-erwise restricted by academic program regulations. The Pass/Fail option is open for a maximum of two courses per year, including summer sessions; for this option, the yearis defined as August 15 to August 14. A course selected forPass/Fail must be an elective; it may not be used to satisfyacademic program requirements. Part-time students mayselect two Pass/Fail courses per 30 credit hours. A student must file a Pass/Fail option request by the end of the third week of class. This is done by consulting the stu-dent's academic program and completing an option form.Once the option request has been processed, it is final andcannot be reversed. At the end of the course, the letter gradegiven by the instructor is converted by the records office intoa final grade of either P (A, B, C, or D) or F. A grade of Pcannot be changed subsequently to a grade of A, B, C, or D.A grade of P is not counted in computing grade averages; thegrade of F is included. READMISSION In special cases, a student who was dismissed may petition afaculty committee, through the head of the appropriate acad-emic program, for readmission. Because petitions must besubmitted sufficiently in advance of the semester or sessionto which readmission is sought, students must consult withthe appropriate academic program head as early as possible. RELEASE OF INFORMATION IN STUDENT RECORDS An implicit and justifiable assumption of trust is placed inthe university as custodian of personal data submitted by astudent entering the university or generated during enroll-ment. This mutual relationship of trust between the univer-sity and the individual student requires that such data be heldin confidence. The university responds to requests for confi-dential data (that is, information not normally available tothe general public) in compliance with the amended FamilyEducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.RELIGIOUS OBSERV ANCES Indiana University respects the right of all students to observe their religious holidays and makes reasonableaccommodation, upon request, for such observances. Pleaserefer to the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct for details. A copy is available on the Internet at dsa.indiana.edu/Code . SATISFACTORY /FAILCOURSES A number of IU South Bend courses are offered with an S/F(Satisfactory/Fail) option. For a given semester, the course isgraded either S/F or with regular letter grades (A, B, C, D,F). All students in the course must be graded under one or theother options. A grade of S cannot subsequently be changedto a regular letter grade, nor can a regular letter grade bechanged to an S. S/F graded courses are not counted as partof a student's Pass/Fail option. S/F graded courses are notedin the Schedule of Classes. SECOND DEGREE Normally the holder of a bachelor's degree who wishes topursue further education is encouraged to become qualifiedfor admission to graduate study. In certain cases, however, astudent is admitted to candidacy for a second bachelor'sdegree. When such admission is granted, candidates nor-mally must earn at least 30 additional credit hours in resi-dence and meet the requirements of the academic program inwhich they are candidates. SEMESTER LOAD A typical full-time undergraduate academic load is 12 to 18credit hours with an average of approximately 15 credithours for the fall or spring semesters. Full-time enrollment ineither the fall, spring, or summer semesters is a minimum of12 credit hours. An undergraduate student expecting to carry more than 18 credit hours should have a cumulative B (3.0) average orhave earned a B (3.0) average in the last full semester.SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER Students or applicants are advised that the requested disclo-sure of their Social Security number to designated offices isvoluntary except in regard to the financial aid application.Students have the right to refuse disclosure of this number orrequest its removal from records without penalty. The stu-dent's Social Security number is not disclosed to individualsor agencies outside Indiana University except in accordancewith the Indiana University policy of release of student infor-mation. STUDENT RECORD ACCESS Indiana University's annual notification of student rights: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educa-tional records. These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the university receivesa request for access. Students should submit to the regis-trar, dean, head of the academic department, or otherappropriate official, written requests that identify therecord(s) they wish to inspect.

RACLIN SCHOOL OF THE ARTS MUSIC MARTIN PROFESSOR OF PIANO :Toradze PROFESSOR :Barton ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR :Kolt ASSISTANT PROFESSOR :J. Mu\u00f1iz :Demaree, Esselstrom AREACOORDINATOR :Barton GENERAL INFORMATION ADMISSION In addition to the general admission requirements for IU South Bend, prospective music students must take the fol-lowing steps: \u0081 Students must audition on their major instrument. A later change of major instrument requires an additional audi-tion. For information about audition dates and repertoire,contact the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts office. \u0081 All entering first-time students must complete an assess- ment process to determine their placement in music theoryand music history classes. There is no charge for thisexamination which is administered during new student ori-entation. Once the above steps are complete, the student may be cer-tified as a music major. However, up to the time when 45credit hours are successfully complete, the student maytransfer to another academic program, either at the student'srequest or on the recommendation of the music faculty. TRANSFER STUDENTS Transfer students must audition in a major performing areafor admission to a particular curriculum. Applicants withcumulative grade point averages below the requirement maypetition for admission on probationary status on the basis ofmusical talent demonstrated by an audition before music fac-ulty members. Transfer students who have completed college course work in a music program must take placement examinations inmusic theory, aural skills, music history, and keyboard profi-ciency. These examinations usually are given during theweek before the first day of classes each semester. All credit hours in music and world languages from an insti- tution other than Indiana University are subject to placementand evaluation in the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Artsand must be validated upon entrance by examination or audi-tion. Transfer students, especially those transferring for their junior or senior years, must be aware of the possibility thatnot all credit hours in the above areas are accepted orcounted toward degree requirements in the Ernestine M.Raclin School of the Arts. These students may have to spenda longer time to complete their bachelor's degrees. Transfer students may take a music examination to demon- strate their comprehension when they have passed an equiv-alent course at another institution. (See Credit byExamination within Academic Regulations and Policies ofthe university in this Bulletin for more information.) CREDIT FOR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Students seeking credit for equivalent professional experi-ence are evaluated as follows: \u0081 In academic courses, on the recommendation of the director of instruction, the student may gain Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts credit by examination. \u0081 In applied music, advanced placement in a medium is achieved only through parallel music performance andliterature examinations which evaluate the compositelevel of experience. To acquire music course credit by examination, the test must be conducted by the music faculty at IU South Bend. ENSEMBLE REQUIREMENT All undergraduate music students in the Ernestine M. RaclinSchool of the Arts must enroll in a major ensemble and earn apassing grade each semester of registration regardless ofadmission status. Attendance at public performances of themajor ensemble is required. Ensemble credit hours earned by music majors do not apply toward the 120 credit hour minimum required for a degree. To preserve necessary performance balances, no with- drawals from music ensembles are permitted after the secondweek of the semester. Appeals must be directed to the musicfaculty. Students should note that absence from a public per-formance, for any reason other than emergency illness, isregarded with the utmost seriousness, and is grounds forfailure in ensemble. MUSIC 45 Commencement activities and similar ceremonies may require performances by university ensembles after semesterclasses are over. The music faculty issues grades in suchcases pending satisfactory participation by all performersand reserve the right to revise those grades after originalissuance where necessary. CHECKLIST Students who do not return equipment, music, instruments,keys, locks, etc., to the music office or other designated areaby the designated date are placed on a checklist. A student onthe checklist may neither register in the following semesternor receive honorable dismissal to enter another institution.If the item cannot be returned, the student is charged for itsreplacement value, plus necessary fines to cover the clericaloperation. Keys that are lost or not returned require a com-plete lock change, and this cost is charged to the student. APPLIED MUSIC PROCEDURES The assignment of students to teachers for applied musiclessons is the responsibility of the music area coordinator,and is made on the basis of student request and availabilityof the preferred teacher. At the time of enrollment, studentsmay indicate their first, second, and third choice of teachers.(It is recommended that major- and concentration-level stu-dents contact their preferred teacher(s) before enrollment.) No one may withdraw from an applied music course once the formal assignment list is posted, except by appeal to themusic faculty. Because a major portion of a facultymember's time is allocated by the enrollment process to asingle student, assignment in these courses must be final. A jury is the assessment method in applied music equivalent to the final examination. Juries are held at the end of eachsemester for students taking applied music in the enrolledinstrument. An applied music fee is assessed, in addition to regular credit hour fees, to all students enrolled in applied music. Consultthe current Schedule of Classes for fee information. PERFORMER 'SCERTIFICATE The IU South Bend Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Artsfaculty established the Performer's Certificate to honor thosestudents who exhibit exceptional abilities in music perfor-mance. While all applied music students are eligible, the cer-tificate is rarely awarded to those below senior standing. Noregular schedule of awards is established nor shall any stu-dent receive the certificate twice. A student is nominated for the Performer's Certificate by the student's applied music instructor. If the nomination isagreed to by two-thirds of the full-time music faculty, allfull-time music faculty members are thereby obligated toattend the public recital itself, following which a final ballotis taken from a minimum of six full-time faculty members.The certificate is awarded unless two or more negative bal-lots are cast by those present and voting.COMPOSER 'SCERTIFICATE The faculty also established the Composer's Certificate tohonor those composition majors who exhibit exceptionalabilities in composition while at IU South Bend.Composition majors are normally considered for this awardin conjunction with their senior recital in composition. The criteria for this award are not only the quality of the stu- dent's compositions, but also the degree of professionalismexhibited in the preparation of the compositions for public per-formance. No regular schedule of awards is established. A stu-dent who is awarded the Composer's Certificate shall notthereby be prevented from also receiving the Performer'sCertificate, and vice versa. The procedures by which a studentis nominated for and elected are identical to those establishedfor the Performer's Certificate. BACHELOR 'SDEGREES IN MUSIC KEYBOARD PROFICIENCY All students majoring in music must pass a keyboard profi-ciency examination before graduation. The proficiency exam-ination tests the student's ability to use the piano as a toolwithin the framework of professional activities; thus, therequirements vary in emphasis according to the area of majorstudy. The examination is taken with the consent of theinstructor with whom the secondary student is studying.Entering students prepared to take the examination may do so. The examination is offered at the end of each fall and spring semester. Examining committees consist of at least onemember of the piano faculty plus a representative from eitherthe theory or music history faculties, or both. A student mayattempt all or part of the examination in a given semester;any requirements attempted in which the student is deemedto be deficient are subject to reexamination the followingsemester. Students, except those majoring in a keyboard instrument, are required to enroll in piano class until they pass the pianoproficiency or complete the piano class sequence (MUS-P101, MUS-P 102, MUS-P 103, MUS-P 104 Piano Class I-IV). Students who reach the fourth semester of piano class,MUS-P 104 Piano Class IV , without having attempted theexamination are required to do so during that fourthsemester. Students are entitled to enroll in one semester of studio instruction in piano MUS-P 200 Piano upon completion ofthe piano class sequence (or earlier, with faculty permis-sion). Enrollees in MUS-P 200 Piano take the piano profi-ciency examination at the end of the semester. N OTE: A LL STUDENTS MAJORING IN A KEYBOARD INSTRU - MENT MUST TAKE THE PIANO PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION NO LATER THAN THE END OF THEIR FIRST SEMESTER OFSTUDY .46 ERNESTINE M. RACLIN SCHOOL OF THE ARTS Students who intend to attempt the examination in a given semester enroll that semester in the noncredit course numberMUS-P 105 Keyboard Proficiency. The successful comple-tion of the examination confers the grade of S; the comple-tion of only part of the examination, or failure to pass anypart of the examination, results in the grade of I. The refusalto attempt the examination results in the grade of F. Oncestudents pass part of the examination, they must attempt it ineach succeeding semester until all are passed. However, theyneed not reenroll in MUS-P 105 Keyboard Proficiency.

These degreesare built on a fundamental core of courses in drawing, two-and three-dimensional design, and art history. Areas ofadvanced study include painting, drawing, sculpture,ceramics, printmaking, photography, and the history of art.Students have the opportunity to pursue areas of individualinterests through an interdisciplinary course of study.Courses outside of the student's area of concentration fulfillelective requirements. Whether a student takes a singlecourse or chooses to follow one of the degree programsdescribed below, the study of the visual arts offers the oppor-tunity to observe and analyze the world around us andexpress our intellectual, emotional, and physical relation-ships to it. TRANSFER STUDENTS Transfer students with studio credit from their previous insti-tutions must submit portfolios for faculty evaluation.Separate portfolios that contain work representative of thecourse work for transfer must be submitted for each area ofstudy. Students must submit work by the middle of their firstsemester. Transfer students who do not submit a portfolio donot receive credit for their previous course work. BACHELOR OF ARTS(122 CR.)

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS The programs of undergraduate studies provide opportuni-ties for breadth of education as well as for a reasonableamount of specialization. As a member of AACSBInternational \u2014The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, IU South Bend's School of Businessand Economics subscribes to the principle that a significantportion of a student's academic program should center ingeneral education subjects. The general education aspects of the program are then com- plemented by study in the basic areas of business adminis-tration. The application of this principle ensures the planningof balanced study programs and, at the same time, enables astudent with an interest in one or another professional area ofbusiness to specialize in that field. In addition, all undergraduate study programs include courses that ensure the development of a basic understandingof the principles and practices involved in the managementof business firms in the dynamic, social, and political envi-ronment of the world today. Consideration is also given to basic trends of development that are likely to shape the patterns of the world in the yearsahead. Beyond these basic requirements, students are givenan opportunity to pursue studies in a general program or toselect a major from a wide variety of subject areas. Upon admission to senior standing, the student enjoys a number of privileges and opportunities. The range of elec-tive courses is wider than at any other stage of the program.Special opportunities are provided for discussion and coun-seling with senior members of the faculty. Courses on thislevel assure widespread participation by students in the dis-cussion and solution of cases, projects, and special problemsdrawn from the contemporary business scene. Also, seniorstypically hold responsible offices in professional studentorganizations, affording them unusual extracurricular oppor-tunities for development.The course BUS-X 310 Business Career Planning andPlacement prepares students for transition to the world ofbusiness and helps them locate and select employmentopportunities that hold greatest promise for them. The study program does not end with graduation. In recogni- tion of the importance of continuing education beyond theclassroom and after completion of formal courses, the school'sfaculty encourages all seniors to pursue a program of guidedreading and general development following graduation. Undergraduate students in the school may pursue curricula in: \u0081 A general program \u0081 Specialized subject-matter fields \u0081 Combined programs based on selected courses in the school and in various other academic programs of theuniversity ADMISSION Students eligible to apply for admission to the undergraduate program in the School of Business and Economics must: \u0081 Have completed a minimum of 56 credit hours that count toward graduation on the college level either at IU South Bend or elsewhere (have completed their freshman andsophomore years) \u0081 Have earned a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 over all courses taken (averages are com-puted on the basis of all course enrollments in whichgrades A, B, C, D, and F were awarded; all WF and FNgrades are counted as F in determining the grade pointaverage) \u0081 Have completed the following courses (or their equiva- lents) either at IU South Bend or elsewhere with a min-imum grade point average of 2.0 (C) and a minimum gradeof C in any of those courses marked with an asterisk (*) BUS-A 201 Introduction to Financial Accounting* BUS-A 202 Introduction to Managerial Accounting* BUS-K 201 The Computer in Business*BUS-L 201 Legal Environment of Business* or BUS-L 203 Commercial Law I* 3 ECON-E 103 Introduction to Microeconomics*ECON-E 104 Introduction to Macroeconomics*ECON-E 270 Introduction to Statistical Theory in Economics and Business* ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition*ENG-W 232 Introduction to Business Writing*MATH-M 118 Finite Mathematics*MATH-M 119 Brief Survey of Calculus I*SPCH-S 121 Public SpeakingSelect from B 399 offerings, page 35One of the following: PSY-B 190 Human Behavior and Social InstitutionsSOC-B 190 Human Behavior and Social Institutions ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS COURSES NUMBERED 301 ANDABOVE Business and economics courses numbered 301 and above areoffered only to students who meet one of the following criteria: 1No credit for juniors and seniors in the School of Business and Economics.2No credit for juniors and seniors.3Accounting majors should take BUS-L 203 in lieu of BUS-L 20166 SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS \u0081 Students officially certified to the School of Business and Economics as Bachelor of Science degree majors (pro- vided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0081 Students officially registered in the minor in business (provided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0081 Students registered for other university programs that specifically require upper-division business or economicscourses (provided the student has accomplished a min-imum of 56 credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0081 Other students who have obtained specific permission from the School of Business and Economics (providedthe student has accomplished a minimum of 56 credithours, junior-class standing) Freshmen, sophomores, and prebusiness students are not permitted to enroll in business and economics courses num-bered 301 or above. ENROLLMENT RESTRICTION No undergraduate student, except those who declare busi-ness as their major, is allowed to take more than 23 percentof his/her course work credit in business courses under anycircumstances. The undergraduate business program has theresponsibility of monitoring the implementation of thisrequirement. Any minor in business is subject to approval bythe undergraduate business program office. TRANSFER CREDIT POLICY Students of approved colleges who transfer to undergraduatestudy in the School of Business and Economics must take thecourses required in the freshman and sophomore years by theSchool of Business and Economics if they have not hadequivalent courses in the school from which they transfer. Courses taken at other institutions that appear similar in either title or objective to the 300- or 400-level (junior andsenior) courses offered by the School of Business andEconomics are transferred as undistributed electives and arenot regarded as equivalent unless at least one of the fol-lowing validation processes is performed: \u0081 Completion of a course review with documented evalua- tion of the content, level, method of instruction, objec- tives, etc., used in the course(s) validated. The evaluationmust be performed by an appropriate member of theschool's faculty; or \u0081 Successful completion of an examination based upon the material covered in that course. At least one of the validation processes must be completed and documented before any administrative action can betaken to officially equate a transferred course with a courseoffered by the school. The validation process can be completed prior to a student's certifying to the school, but no actual transfer course equiv-alency can be effected until after the student has officiallycertified to the school.The validation process cannot take place prior to receipt ofan official IU South Bend credit transfer report or if the stu-dent is registered in a course offered by another institution. Courses in advanced business subjects, not open to freshmen and sophomores, which have been taken at other institutionsin the freshman and sophomore years, are not accepted asequivalents of the courses offered at Indiana Universityunless the student passes special examinations of the Schoolof Business and Economics in such subjects. Additionally,courses in advanced business subjects, not open to freshmenand sophomores, which have been taken at two-year institu-tions, are not accepted as equivalents of the courses offeredat IU South Bend. Credit hours earned through junior and community colleges are limited to a maximum of 60 credit hours. Only credit hours earned at Indiana University count toward a student's grade point average. Grades from other universi-ties transfer as credit only, although transfer grades appearon the credit transfer report. The school accepts transfer stu- dents as late as the senior year. STUDENT 'SRESPONSIBILITY All colleges establish certain academic requirements thatmust be met before a degree is granted. Advisors, directors,and deans always help a student meet these requirements,but each student is individually responsible for fulfillingthem. If requirements are not satisfied, the degree is withheldpending adequate fulfillment. For this reason, it is importantfor each student to be well acquainted with all requirementsdescribed in this Bulletin. CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENTS The minimum number of credit hours required for the bachelor'sdegree is 123 credit hours in courses meeting the various require-ments stated in this Bulletin . Of these, at least 48 credit hours shall be in business and economics courses, and at least 53 credithours shall be in courses other than business and economics. PASS/FAILOPTION Business students may elect to take one course each semesterwith a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail), with a maximum of twosuch courses each school year, including summer sessions.The election of this option must be exercised by the studentwithin the first three weeks of the semester. Limitations on useof the Pass/Fail policy are as follows: Business students maynot take any business course Pass/Fail. Also, the Pass/Failoption cannot be used for courses that satisfy the general edu-cation requirements. The option can be used for courses thatare pure electives taken outside the School of Business andEconomics. A grade of P is not counted in the cumulativegrade point average, but a grade of F is included. A grade of Pcannot be changed subsequently to a grade of A, B, C, or D. CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Business, economics, and speech courses may not be takenby correspondence to count toward degree requirements. AllSCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS 67 students wishing to apply credit from correspondence study toward a degree must secure the advisor's signature on theenrollment application before submitting it to the correspon-dence study program. Any exceptions to the above policymust have the approval of the dean. REPEATING A COURSE LIMITATION POLICY Business majors are not permitted to retake a course in whichthey have received a grade of B- (2.7) or higher. Independentstudy courses and all other courses that allow students toobtain additional credit by retaking the same course numberare exceptions, as would any other extraordinary situations. All business majors are restricted to three attempts to com- plete a credit course. Viable exceptions may be accepted bypetitioning the school. The word attempts is intended to mean a transcript record of W, F, FN, or a completed courseletter grade. In particular, WX is excluded (dropping a classwithin the first week). REPEATING A FAILED COURSE The School of Business and Economics, for its own internalpurposes (e.g., admission, probation, graduation, etc.), cal-culates grade point averages where a failed course isinvolved using both the original grade of F and the makeupgrade. This policy applies to all courses taken by undergrad-uate students admitted to the school. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIP RULE Any student who does not possess the necessary preliminarytraining, or who lacks other qualifications, may be requiredby the Committee on Admission and Probation to enroll insuch courses as the committee may designate or to take suchother corrective action as is necessary or desirable.

ADVERTISING The advertising curriculum provides an educational foundationfor those preparing for careers in which advertising may play amajor role. Such careers include work in the management ofadvertising; advertising sales; product management with thosefirms where strong emphasis is placed on advertising; or spe-cialized areas of copy, layout, design, or production. Employment in these careers may be with advertising departments of manufacturing, distributing, or retailingfirms; with media, including television stations, newspapers,or magazines; with advertising agencies; or with companiesdealing in specialized aspects of advertising and sales pro-motion. Because the advertising function in a business firm consti- tutes part of a total marketing program, the advertising cur-riculum provides, first of all, a base of general business andmarketing studies. The capstone of this program is a modestdegree of specialization in advertising courses. CONCENTRATION REQUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

BANKING This program provides a solid financial background alongwith entrepreneurial skills to service this growing market. Theneed for specialized education arises from the increased com-petitiveness within the financial services industry. Manybanks make tremendous efforts to serve not only the buddingentrepreneur, but also those entrepreneurs successful ingrowing to new heights in sales and market expansion.Growing entrepreneurial businesses have significant fundingneeds. As is often the case with a growing business, there areinsufficient internally generated cash flows to finance expan-sion. Firms can choose to go public, seek private equity, orturn to their banker to supply the funds needed to stoke futuregrowth. Banks need skilled employees with the ability to rec-ognize those entrepreneurial opportunities, who possess thedepth of finance knowledge to evaluate the deal's potential,and who have the ability to close the sale. The program offersa wide variety of courses in finance, entrepreneurship, andsales management to ensure that graduates possess the skillsnecessary to be successful in this growing industry.

FINANCE The ability to analyze a corporation's financial status, and toimplement sound financial programs for raising capital and forchoosing from among competing investment opportunities, isof the utmost importance to any business organization. Students who graduate with a finance concentration are pre- pared for entry-level positions in finance. This includes posi-tions in financial institutions such as commercial banks, sav-ings and loans, credit unions, brokerage and investmentbanking firms, investment advisory organizations, insurancecompanies, mutual funds, and pension funds. In addition toopportunities in the financial services industry, extensiveemployment opportunities exist in the corporate sector as wellas in government. Courses on financial institutions, financial decision making, business financial management, investments, securityanalysis, and portfolio management enable students to acquirea depth of understanding in areas of particular interest. The field of finance traditionally is divided into three sub- fields: financial markets and institutions, investments, andbusiness financial management. Financial markets and institu-tions examine the ways in which financial intermediaries suchas commercial banks, insurance companies, and pension fundsfacilitate the transfer of funds from savers/investors to deman-ders of funds who engage in the production and consumptionof real economic goods and services. Services provided by financial institutions include the eval- uation and bearing of risk and the repackaging of funds interms of maturity and size of investment. Also examined, ona macro basis, are the markets for financial securities createdby corporations and financial intermediaries. Typical questions would be what sectors of government and the economy are the foremost demanders of funds in different seg-ments of the business cycle and, in aggregate, what proportionof corporate financing has been provided by debt over time. Investments is the study of how individuals and institutions allocate funds to financial assets such as stocks, bonds,options and futures contracts and, to a lesser extent, realassets such as real estate and precious metals. Investments isitself divided into two areas: security analysis, concernedwith the valuation of individual securities; and portfoliomanagement, concerned with the selection of combinationsof assets such that return is maximized given the level of riskthat is borne. Business financial management concentrates on the manage- ment of a firm's assets, both short-term working capital andlonger-term capital projects, and on the financing of theseassets. Financing considerations include the choice of capital72 SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS structure (proportions of debt and equity used in the financing mix) and dividend policy.

The director of student teaching notifiesthe candidate, school, and school corporation. When a studentteacher is removed from a placement, the reasons areexplained in writing. If the candidate wishes to attempt asecond placement, the candidate is required to develop andsatisfactorily complete a professional improvement planbefore he/she is assigned a second placement. The profes-sional development plan is a written document created col-laboratively between the student teacher and the director ofstudent teaching. The department head is involved as neededand must sign the plan. The director of student teaching mayenlist the assistance of the department head, dean, or adesignee in determining if the student teacher's progress issatisfactory and warrants a second placement. Written pro-fessional development plans must adequately address allareas of concern and be aligned with IU South Bend stan-dards. The director of student teaching determines if the can-didate is to receive an Incomplete or Fail for the semesteraccording to grading policies, or if the candidate is to with-draw from the course. Candidates are only provided two opportunities for suc- cessful placements. The second placement is in the nextspring or fall semester following the semester in which thecandidate is withdrawn from the first placement. 88 SCHOOL OF EDUCATION STUDENT SERVICES ACADEMIC ADVISING AND PROGRAM PLANNING Academic advising is available from the Office of Education Student Services in Greenlawn Hall 120.

A candidate preparing for early adolescent/youngadults may elect to receive a Pass/Fail rating in classes to ful-fill general education requirements, providing they are not inthe major teaching areas or part of the requirements in pro-fessional education. The request for a Pass/Fail option mustbe completed during the first three weeks of fall and springsemesters, and during the first two weeks of a summer ses-sion by processing the prescribed request in the Office ofEducation Student Services. This election is not reversible.The limitation on Pass/Fail options described on page 30 ofthis Bulletin applies. N OTE: STUDENTS SHOULD REALIZE THAT AN FIN A CREDIT BEARING COURSE WILL BE CALCULATED IN THE GPA. ALSO, PASS/FAIL COURSES DO NOT COUNT TOWARD THE REQUIRED CREDIT HOURS FOR THE DEAN'SLIST. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND LETTERS OF CONCERN In addition to academic performance, IU South Bend'steacher certification candidates are evaluated on the basis oftheir professional conduct, dispositions, and teaching perfor-mance. It is particularly important that IU South Bend educa-tion candidates demonstrate professional behavior and dispo-sitions in host schools since they represent the university.Improper conduct on their part can adversely affect the livesof children. Unsatisfactory professional conduct or perfor-mance on the part of an IU South Bend education candidate,whether on campus or in host schools, may result in that can-didate's separation from the Teacher Education Program. The process by which unprofessional performance or con- cerns regarding dispositions is documented is the Letter ofConcern. The letter may be used by any professional con-nected with the Teacher Education Program to identify a can-didate in the program whose professional performance orapproach is questionable. Because grades reflect the candidate's academic perfor- mance, this letter is not used to report academic problems. Rather, it is used when there is a strong concern about a can-didate's ability to become a professional educator. Forexample, a candidate may exhibit a genuine dislike for chil-dren, frequently miss class or be tardy, or have behaviors thatwould seem inconsistent with the requirements of the educa-tion profession. The intent of this system is to add professional judgement to the teacher education process. When a Letter of Concern isfiled, the candidate, the dean, and the advising office receivescopies. Confirmation of this notification is sent to the personwho filed the Letter of Concern. Except in very serious situ-ations, two Letters of Concern must be received before a can-didate's case is reviewed by the dean, an advisor, and a fac-ulty member. It is assumed corrective action will be taken andcandidate performance will be monitored. Such a review canresult in termination of the candidate's involvement in theprogram. PROBATION , DISMISSAL , AND REINSTATEMENT Candidates may be placed on probation or be dismissed atany point in the program when the academic criteria forpreeducation majors and for the Teacher Education Programas outlined in the following sections are not met. If candidates do not meet the required standards and are not allowed to proceed in the program, efforts are made to assistcandidates with corrective plans.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS The program has several distinct elements: \u0081 A recommended sequence of general education\u0081 A professional education component \u0081 Student teaching or other supervised practicum experienceGENERAL EDUCATION General education refers to courses and other experiencesthat lay the foundation for IU South Bend's TeacherEducation Program. There is a focus on building skills inwritten and oral communication, information technology,inquiry, science, literature, quantitative reasoning, and bothglobal and democratic perspectives. The general education requirements for elementary educa- tion and early childhood education define the strong gener-alist preparation that is imperative for elementary teachersand early childhood educators. Candidates are encouraged to complete a program of general education by enrolling in courses designated for educationmajors whenever they are available. In particular, candidatesare urged to follow the general education template for thefirst 30 credit hours of their program. The sequence has beenplanned to provide the strongest foundation in learning andto build the most powerful connections between the contentof the individual courses. PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION The professional education component of the TeacherEducation Program develops the knowledge, dispositions,and skills required for entry to the teaching profession. Somecourses focus on knowledge, dispositions, and skills thatunderlie all teacher education regardless of the develop-mental focus. Other courses and field experiences focus onwhat it takes to promote effective teaching and learning at aparticular developmental level or in a particular school set-ting. At IU South Bend, the professional education compo-nent (72 credit hours) is not a collection of isolated courses,but rather a carefully articulated program of study. Coursesare taken in a prescribed order. Some must be taken in blocks. STUDENT TEACHING The 12 credit hours of student teaching and the accompa-nying integrated seminar represents the culminating experi-ence in the Teacher Education Program. By assuming fullresponsibility for a class of students, candidates demonstratetheir achievement of standards, and reflect both on studentlearning and on their own effectiveness as teachers. At IU South Bend, most candidates are prepared to teach at two developmental levels and can expect to complete twoseparate student teaching assignments. Student teachingtakes one full semester. ADDITIONAL LICENSES Elementary education majors may also complete the require-ments for licenses in reading, English as a new language,mild interventions (special education), and preschool.92 SCHOOL OF EDUCATION BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION SECONDARY EDUCATION The IU South Bend School of Education offers several pro- grams in secondary education. Successful secondary educa-tion graduates are licensed in one or more content areas forthe middle school, junior high, and high school settings . Each candidate's program is aligned with the developmental stan-dards for both the early adolescence (middle school) and ado-lescent/young adult (high school) levels as defined by theIndiana Professional Standards Board. Candidates may selectone or more of the following content areas: \u0081 English/language arts\u0081 Mathematics\u0081 Science (candidate selects one or more areas from the fol- lowing: life science, Earth/space science, physical sci-ence, physics, or chemistry) \u0081 Social studies (candidate selects three areas from the fol- lowing six options: historical perspectives, governmentand citizenship, geographical perspectives, economics,psychology, and sociology) \u0081 World languages (French, Spanish, or German) Candidates may choose to add to any of the above contentareas: \u0081 English as a new language\u0081 Reading\u0081 Special education\u2014mild interventions A license in any of the areas listed above requires the com-pletion of specified general education, professional educa-tion, and content courses for a minimum total of 124 credithours for the Bachelor of Science degree. Candidates are advised that there are very few elective courses in the sec-ondary education programs and that early program selectionand advising is important for timely graduation. For specific courses and advising information, candidates must contactthe Office of Education Student Services to speak with anundergraduate advisor. For general program information,candidates may also request to speak with the departmenthead. SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM All teacher education candidates seeking a teaching license inspecial education major in either elementary or secondaryeducation and complete the requirements for licensure intheir major area. Candidates also complete a series of coursesfor an additional license in mild interventions. Mild interventions is the new term used by the state to license people to teach students with a variety of disabilities. In thepast, teaching licenses were given according to specific dis-ability categories; future licenses no longer specify disabilitycategories. The special education course sequence is designed to prepare teacher education candidates to work with students with spe-cial needs who participate in the general education cur-riculum and who require mild levels of support or mild inter-ventions to be successful. Teacher education candidates who complete the mild inter-ventions license should be well prepared to work with avariety of students with special needs. This background, incombination with their elementary or secondary teaching cre-dentials, will serve them well as they pursue future teachingopportunities.

The chief purpose of the organization is to aidin the preparation of students for the assumption of profes-sional responsibilities. Programs may encompass health careissues, legal aspects of nursing, interdisciplinary programs,and community programs. GENERAL POLICIES PROGRAM PLANNING Students in the School of Nursing are responsible for plan-ning their own programs and for meeting degree require-ments. Academic advisors are available from the Office ofNursing Student Services to assist students in understandingdegree requirements. It is important for students to acquaintthemselves with all regulations and to remain properlyinformed throughout their studies. All provisions of this Bulletin are in effect as soon as a nursing student begins the nursing program. This includes both prenursing students newly admitted to IU South Bendand those changing their major to nursing. Students interrupting their studies, students pursuing part- time study, or full-time students who take more than twoyears to complete prerequisite requirements are subject topolicy and curriculum changes as they occur. Curriculumchanges during progress toward the degree may result inrevision of degree requirements. THECODE OF ETHICS FOR NURSES Students preparing to enter the profession of nursing areexpected to follow the Code of Ethics for Nurses. Eachperson, upon entering the profession, inherits a measure ofresponsibility and trust in the profession and the corre-sponding obligation to adhere to standards of ethical practiceand conduct set by the profession. The code was adopted bythe American Nurses'Association in 1950 and most recentlyrevised in 2001. It is the student's responsibility to know, understand, and follow the Code of Ethics for Nurses.1.

Documentation of any requestedaccommodation must be submitted to the Admission,Progression, and Graduation Committee in the School ofNursing for review at least two months prior to matriculationinto the nursing major. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES The university is committed to helping temporarily and per-manently disabled students make the transition to studentlife. Students with physical, mental, or learning impairmentsare encouraged to consult with advisors from the School ofNursing and Disability Support Services for assistance inmeeting degree requirements. Students with disabilities must meet all academic and tech- nical skill requirements as outlined in the Statement of Essential Abilities and any other standards related to profes- sional licensure. Modifications in the learning environment toassist students in meeting these requirements are made inaccordance with federal and university guidelines and in con-sideration of individual needs. Disability Support Services islocated on the first floor of the Administration Building. ELIGIBILITY FOR LICENSURE Any person who makes application for examination and reg-istration as a registered nurse in the state of Indiana shallsubmit to the Indiana State Board of Nursing at the HealthProfessions Service Bureau written evidence, verified byoath, that he or she: \u0081 Completed an approved high school course of study or the equivalent, as approved by the appropriate educational agency \u0081 Completed the prescribed curriculum in a state-accredited school of nursing and holds a diploma or certificate there-from \u0081 Has not been convicted of any act that would constitute a ground for disciplinary sanction under the state board rulesand regulations or of any felony that has direct bearing onthe individual's ability to practice competently International students and graduates of schools of nursing that are outside the United States must meet the requirementsof the Indiana State Board of Nursing for eligibility to sit forthe National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX). CLINICAL REGULATIONS CLINICAL HANDBOOK All nursing students are provided with a Clinical Handbook at the clinical orientation beginning with the sophomoresemester. This document is updated (at least) annually toreflect ongoing changes in clinical and program require-ments and policies. The School of Nursing provides theseupdates, but it is the student's responsibility to maintain thecurrency of the handbook and refer to the most current reg-ulations. CPR R EQUIREMENT All nursing major students enrolled in clinical classes mustpresent evidence of current health care provider certificationprior to the beginning of each semester. Two options areavailable: \u0081 American Heart Association's Health Care Provider level (preferred) \u0081 American Red Cross CPR AED for the professional rescuer OSHA R EGULATIONS Health requirements and OSHA regulations include annualeducation on blood borne pathogens. See Clinical Handbook for annual regulatory requirements. Clinical agencies mayhave additional requirements which must be met. HEALTH REQUIREMENTS All nursing students must show annual proof that they havemet the immunization, physical examination, and laboratoryexamination requirements of hospitals and other healthagencies used for clinical experiences. Specific instructionsare distributed prior to clinical assignment. Special circum-stances may arise which require additional action. Failure tomeet health requirements and their deadlines makes the stu-dent ineligible for clinical classes and the student is admin-istratively withdrawn from all nursing courses. The studentis then considered to be out-of-progression in the nursingprogram. CRIMINAL CHECKS Federal mandates for clinical agencies require criminal his-tory inquiries through certified background checks or desig-nated alternate state or federal inquiry program. Students areresponsible for applying for the criminal check and all feesassociated with the check upon application to the major andprior to the seventh semester courses.116 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES HEALTH AND CPR R EQUIREMENTS Upon Admission to the Nursing Program In accordance with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations and local health facilities requirements,nursing students are required to provide: \u0081 Immunization verification for Hepatitis B \u0081 Immunization verification for Tetanus/Diphtheria (within 10 years) \u0081 MMR (two doses of MMR or two doses of or mumps titer of 1:10 is required) \u0081 Varicella vaccine or history of the disease \u0081 Tuberculosis screening (PPD or chest x-ray)\u0081 Up-to-date completed health evaluation (within one year)\u0081 CPR (professional level) certification Titers are acceptable forms of documentation. Any interna- tional student or student whose country of origin where TBis considered endemic must be tested at the IU South BendHealth and Wellness Center. Those testing positive will berequired to have a blood test confirming their TB status.Requirements may change as recommendations of the CDCindicate. Specific, current information and guidelines can befound in the Clinical Handbook . The deadlines for submitting the health and safety require-ments for students entering the fourth semester are: \u0081 Fall semester July 15 \u0081 Spring semester October 15\u0081 Summer semester May 1 Failure to do so results in the student being automatically withdrawn from all clinical nursing courses for which theyare registered and the student is considered to be out-of-pro-gression in the nursing program. Students who come to classand are in noncompliance are not allowed to enter the clin-ical setting. Students admitted late to the nursing programare handled on a case-by-case basis. All applicants are encouraged to begin gathering the necessary documentation to avoid delays upon admission. Even studentsadmitted late must have all documentation on file with theSchool of Nursing prior to beginning the clinical nursingcourses. Failure to do so results in the student being automat-ically withdrawn from all clinical nursing courses for whichthey are registered and the student is considered to be out-of-progression in the nursing program. For Continuing Nursing Students Nursing students are responsible for making sure they receive annual TB screening (PPD or X-ray) and annual CPR recerti-fication. In addition, immunization status must be updated asnecessary. It is the student's responsibility to monitor thestatus of these and to submit proper documentation to theSchool of Nursing in a timely manner. If any of these itemsexpire during the course of the semester, certification mustoccur before the student may enroll in any clinical courses thatsemester. Additional requirements may be added as clinicalregulations are updated. Clinical agencies have the right torequest additional health and safety stipulations.Documentation of annual TB screening, annual CPR recertifi-cation, and up-to-date immunization status must be submittedto the School of Nursing's student services office no later thanAugust 1 for students enrolled in clinical nursing courses inthe fall semester. If the student is enrolled in clinical nursingcourses during fall semester, documentation of CPR recertifi-cation, TB screening, and immunizations must be validthrough December 20. If the student is enrolled for the springsemester, CPR recertification, immunizations, and TBscreening documentation must be submitted to the School ofNursing's student services office no later than December 1 andmust be valid through May 15. For summer these must bevalid May 1 to August 20. (For example, if a student's CPRcertification expired on March 1, 2011, the student must suc-cessfully complete CPR recertification before he/she isallowed to begin spring 2011 semester classes.) Students whocome to class, and are in noncompliance, are not allowed toenter the clinical setting. For students finishing an incomplete grade in a nursing course with a clinical component, the CPR recertification,immunizations, and TB screening must be valid until thecourse requirements are complete. STUDENT INJURIES If a student is injured in a clinical agency, the student mustreport to the clinical instructor and follow the policy of theagency where the injury occurred. Students should also con-tact their primary care provider. Follow-up care may berequired from the student's primary care provider. UNIFORMS Strict uniform and appearance code regulations are enforcedthroughout the student's clinical experience. Guidelines foruniforms, agency dress codes, and professional appearanceare located in the Clinical Handbook . NAME PIN/IU S OUTH BENDPATCH Name pins are required for all clinical experiences, alongwith individual agency requirements for personal identifica-tion. Students are additionally identified as an IU South NURSING 117 Bend student by a school patch or embroidery on their uni- form. More information can be found in the ClinicalHandbook. SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT Students are required to purchase a laboratory skills supplypack and basic assessment equipment for the sophomore-year laboratories and clinicals. See Clinical Handbook for details and estimated prices. HEALTH INSURANCE The School of Nursing encourages students to carry healthinsurance and is not liable for any health problems requiringmedical treatment. Health insurance information is availableupon request. PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE All students in the School of Nursing having patient/clientcontact are covered under the malpractice contract forIndiana University. This liability insurance does not extendto employment outside of course-related activities. The stu-dent should know that failure to pay course and other feesresults in noncoverage under Indiana University's malprac-tice contract. Such noncoverage makes the student ineligibleto attend clinical classes. APA F ORMAT The most recent American Psychological Association (APA)format is the standard used for all written work in all nursingcourses. Students should consult course syllabi for specificdetails. REMEDIAL COURSE REQUIREMENTS Applicants to the B.S.N. degree program must successfullycomplete all developmental courses in which they place,including the following: EDUC-X 100 Practical Reading and Study for Self Improvement EDUC-X 101 Techniques in Textbook ReadingENG-W 31 Pre-CompositionENG-W 130 Principles of CompositionMATH-M 4 Introduction to AlgebraMATH-M 14 Basic Algebra (4 cr.)MATH-M 107 College AlgebraStudents interested in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing pro-gram should complete courses in mathematics as early as pos-sible to facilitate completion of science prerequisite courses. CORRESPONDENCE /INDEPENDENT STUDY COURSES All required and elective courses for the nursing major, otherthan public speaking, available through the IndianaUniversity Independent Study program, must be taken forcredit. Students should contact a School of Nursing acad-emic advisor before enrollment. Students are required tohave the academic advisor's signature for all correspondencecourses used to satisfy degree requirements. Correspondencecourses with nursing numbers do not satisfy residencyrequirements. Final examinations in all correspondencecourses must be taken no later than six weeks prior to theexpected graduation date. Nursing students shall have completed any correspondence or independent study courses prior to enrollment in theirfinal semester of the program, or register for the on-campuscourse in that final semester. PORTFOLIO OPTION The portfolio review process is available to all students whobelieve that their prior experiences can meet the learningobjectives/competencies required of a specific nursingcourse within their program of study, subject to facultyapproval. The portfolio is a mechanism used to validate theacquisition of knowledge and skills congruent with courseexpectations and student learning outcomes. Students may exercise the portfolio option for all B.S.N. major courses listed for the degree as long as it does notinterfere with other standing university or schoolcourse/credit hour policies related to progression or gradua-tion. Undergraduate students must complete a minimum of30 credit hours on the campus awarding the degree.Courses/credit hours which are reviewed for portfolio creditdo not count toward undergraduate residency requirements.Please contact the School of Nursing for portfolio guide-lines. SATISFACTORY /FAILOPTION The School of Nursing, in grading undergraduate clinicalnursing courses, uses the Satisfactory/Fail option. Grades arerecorded as S or F. Students must demonstrate a satisfactorylevel of clinical competence and skill to receive a satisfactorygrade in these courses. Satisfactory performance standardsare stated in each course syllabus and faculty evaluate thequality of student clinical performances by these standards.Inability to receive a grade of S constitutes failure. An S indi-cates a grade of A, B, or C (2.0). Students receiving an Fcannot progress in their nursing program until this deficiencyis corrected.N OTE: THIS IS A SCHOOL OF NURSING POLICY FOR NURSING COURSES AND IS NOT THE SAME AS THE IU S OUTH BEND POLICY FOR THE PASS/FAIL OPTION LOCATED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS BULLETIN . 118 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS A student must complete a minimum of 30 upper-division credit hours in the Indiana University School of NursingBachelor of Science in Nursing degree program to be eli-gible for graduation. A maximum of 6 lower-divisionnursing credit hours may apply toward this residencyrequirement. Students must petition the appropriate acad-emic officer to apply those lower-division nursing credithours toward the residency requirement. Credit for corre-spondence courses and advanced standing by the validationprocess may not be used to meet residency requirements.

COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH COORDINATOR :Sofhauser OFFICE :Northside Hall 446 TELEPHONE :(574) 520-4336 INTERNET ADDRESS : www.iusb.edu/~sbnurse/complementary Lay and professional discourse surrounding complementarytherapies abounds and consumers are seeking out and usingthem. Therefore, it is critical that all interested students, par-ticularly future health care providers, be given the academicopportunity to learn about and explore complementary thera-pies and the issues surrounding their use. Students achieving aminor in complementary health gain a thorough understandingof a number of complementary therapies. This understandinginvolves exploring the foundational belief systems of thesetherapies and the cultures from which they are derived.Students critically examine complementary therapies in lightof the disease processes for which they are prescribed as wellas explore the inherent political, economic, and ethical issuessurrounding these therapies. Any interested IU South Bend student may complete a minor in complementary health. Students interested in pursuing aminor must register their intentions with the School ofNursing and consult with a faculty advisor prior to enrollmentin required core courses.MINOR IN COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH The minor in complementary health consists of 15 credithours and is awarded by the School of Nursing on the IUSouth Bend campus. Students are required to take a core oftwo required courses for a total of 6 credit hours and a 1credit hour capstone course. The two required courses maybe taken in any order to facilitate student completion of theminor. However, it is recommended that students takeNURS-K 301 The Art and Science of ComplementaryHealth before NURS-K 401 Integrative Health. Students may select a total of 8 credit hours of electives to fulfill the requirements of the minor. Elective courses enablethe student to expand and build upon knowledge acquired inthe core courses. Selection of electives permits the student topersonalize the minor in a way that proves most helpful intheir chosen field. Acceptance of elective courses for credittoward the minor is granted by the IU South Bend School ofNursing Admission, Progression, and Graduation (APG) Committee. REQUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) Core Courses (7 cr.) NURS-K 301 The Art and Science of Complementary Health NURS-K 401 Integrative HealthNURS-K 490 Clinical Nursing Elective: Capstone in Complementary Health (1 cr.) Electives (8 cr.)

Additional courses dealing with complementary healthrelated issues may be reviewed and considered (aromatherapy, nutrition, healing touch, etc.). Courses on Asian cul-tures or other non-Western cultures are particularly helpful,since most complementary therapies are derived from teach-ings indigenous to those cultures. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) degree pro-gram strives to offer a creative curriculum for meeting thecurrent and future health needs of society. The curriculumprepares a generalist in professional nursing and serves as abasis for graduate study. The B.S.N. degree program is offered at several Indiana University campuses. All campuses share similar admissionstandards, program outcomes, and courses. Admission andtransfer policies are set by individual campuses and course sequencing may vary. The purpose of the bachelor's program is to produce gradu- ates who think critically; are culturally, ethically, and legallycompetent; are effective, politically aware, communicatorsand coordinators of community resources; and are compe-tent providers of health care, professional role models, andresponsible managers. The curriculum focuses on health andwellness as well as alterations in states of wellness andviewing persons as part of their environments.

See program admission policies. Cumulative Grade Point Average Cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is a reflection of all work completed at Indiana University. Courses transferredfrom another institution are not used in calculating thisaverage. (Transfer course GPA is calculated in AGPA forB.S.N. application for admission. See B.S.N. degree pro-gram admission.) Nursing Grade Point Average Nursing grade point average (NGPA) is a reflection of all work completed, including grades earned in initial and repeatenrollment (FX policy applies), that apply toward the require-ments of appropriate programs. Courses transferred fromother institutions are included in calculating this average. PROBATION Academic Probation A prenursing student is placed on academic probation according to the policies of IU South Bend. A nursing studentis placed on academic probation when the cumulative gradepoint average falls below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Academic proba-tion is removed following the semester in which the cumula-tive and semester grade point averages are 2.0 or higher.Nursing students should also see progression policies listedunder Clinical Progression in the School of Nursing program . Disciplinary Probation Disciplinary probation is administered under the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, the Statement of Essential Abilities and Code of Ethics for Nurses. DISMISSAL A prenursing student is dismissed based upon the dismissalpolicies of IU South Bend, found earlier in this Bulletin. A nursing student is dismissed from the program when, inthe judgment of the APG Committee on the campus ofenrollment, there is a lack of progress toward the degree.Lack of progress includes, but is not limited to the following: \u0081 Failure to achieve a 2.0 semester grade point average in any two consecutive semesters \u0081 Failure to achieve a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 in any two semesters \u0081 Failure to achieve a minimum grade of C (2.0) or S (Satisfactory) in any one nursing course (didactic, orpracticum/clinical) by the second attempt, or any two nursing courses (didactic or practicum/clinical) on the firstattempt \u0081 Failure to meet Indiana University School of Nursing essential abilities expectations (refer to the Statement of Essential Abilities listed under General Policies of the School of Nursing in this section of this Bulletin) Dismissal may occur without prior probation. Any student who is academically dismissed at one Indiana University campus is also in dismissal status at all otherIndiana University campuses. Falsification of records andreports, plagiarism, or cheating on an examination, quiz, orany other assignment is cause for dismissal (see IndianaUniversity Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct). The faculty reserves the right to dismiss any nursing student whose personal integrity, health, or conduct demonstratesunfitness to continue preparation for the profession ofnursing. Integrity and conduct is judged according to thestandards of the most recent Code of Ethics for Nurses as adopted by the American Nurses' Association and the IUSchool of Nursing Statement of Essential Abilities. The dismissal of any nursing student is contingent upon review by the APG Committee on the campus of enrollment.Nursing student dismissal is subject to the appeal process onthe campus of enrollment. REINSTATEMENT Students who have been dismissed and desire reinstatementmust submit a written request for reinstatement to the APGCommittee. The written request must be submitted by July 1for fall reinstatement, October 1 for spring reinstatement,and February 1 for summer session reinstatement. Thisrequest requires a list of the specific courses in which thestudent wishes to enroll and, as appropriate, an explanationof any extenuating circumstances that may have hinderedacademic performance, and a Plan for Success addressingareas of deficiency. Reinstatement requests are evaluated individually by the APG Committee on the basis of academic standing, potentialfor progress toward the degree, availability of resources, andsatisfactory completion of any conditions and/or faculty rec-ommendations existing at the time of dismissal.Reinstatement to the School of Nursing is not automatic. Appeals for immediate reinstatement are not considered except as warranted by extraordinary circumstances. In suchcases, students reinstated by the APG Committee have pre-scribed standards of performance for the semester for whichthey are reinstated. Failure to meet these standards results inan irrevocable dismissal. Students who are reinstated must adhere to policies in effect at the time of reinstatement. (See Clinical Handbook,Bulletin, and policy updates.) A nursing student is reinstated only one time. A reinstated nursing student is dismissed from the School of Nursingupon failure of one additional nursing course, breach of theNURSING 121 Code of Ethics for Nurses, the Statement of Essential Abilities, or the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (see dismissal policy). For reinstatement priority, refer to Clinical Progression in thenursing program section of this Bulletin. PROGRAM ADMISSION Courses required for admission may be taken at any IndianaUniversity campus or may be accepted as transfer credithours from other accredited institutions. However, admis-sion is campus specific and priority consideration is given tothose students completing the majority of their course workat IU South Bend. Admission to the major is highly compet-itive. Please contact a student services advisor for moreinformation. Specific admission requirements vary from campus to campus of Indiana University. When choosing courses tomeet curriculum requirements, students who begin theirprenursing course work on one campus of Indiana Universitybut plan to apply for admission on another campus ofIndiana University should be in close contact with theSchool of Nursing advisor on the campus to which they planto apply. Submission of an official credit transfer report(CTR) to the School of Nursing is required for all workbeing transferred from another university by establisheddeadlines. To obtain an official CTR, the student mustrequest an official transcript from the other institution(s) tobe forwarded to the IU South Bend Office of Admissions forevaluation. Admission to the university as a prenursing student and suc- cessful completion of the prerequisite course work do notguarantee admission to the nursing major. The number ofadmitted students is limited to those who can be accommo-dated given available resources. APPLICATION AND ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS \u0081 Admission to Indiana University as a degree-seeking stu- dent. \u0081 Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average of no less than 2.5 on a 4.0 scale. \u0081 Maintenance of an admission GPA of no less than 2.7 on a 4.0 scale. Although a 2.7 AGPA is the minimum required for application, admission is competitive and ahigher AGPA may be required in a given application pool. \u0081 Completion of chemistry (a one-year high school course, or CHEM-C 101 Elementary Chemistry I, CHEM-C 121Elementary Chemistry Laboratory I equivalent) with agrade of C (2.0) or higher within the past five years. \u0081 Passing a comprehensive criminal background check.\u0081 Completion of the following required courses with a grade of C or higher by the second attempt: CHEM-C102 Elementary Chemistry II ENG-W 131 Elementary CompositionMICR-M 250 Microbial Cell BiologyMICR-M 255 Microbiology Laboratory (2 cr.)PHSL-P 261 Human Anatomy and Physiology I (5 cr.)PHSL-P 262 Human Anatomy and Physiology II (5 cr.)

Students offered admission to the nursing majormust enroll in nursing course work at a time designated bythe School of Nursing. Failure to enroll in nursing coursework in the designated semester necessitates reapplying tothe program. Students admitted to the nursing major must formally accept or decline admission to the program, in writing, prior to thebeginning of the semester to which they are admitted.Students accepted to the program but decline acceptancemust reapply to the program of choice and compete with theapplicant pool for the semester in which they requestentrance. Students have only two opportunities to declineadmission in writing prior to losing their eligibility to apply. Students admitted to the nursing major who withdraw from course work within the first semester must reapply foradmission to the program. These students have one opportu-nity for readmission, must reapply within a time frame thatwould allow the student timely completion of the programconsidering the seven-year limit of specific courses, andmust adhere to the published dates for application on theircampuses. REPEAT POLICY The School of Nursing policy requires students to achieve agrade of C (2.0) in each required course. Students who earna grade of less than C (2.0) in a required course must earn agrade of C by the second completed attempt. Students whoearn a grade of less than C in a required course are stronglyurged to successfully complete the course in the nextsemester of enrollment, providing the course is offered. Both prenursing and nursing students who do not success- fully complete all required general education courses with aminimum grade of C by the second completed attempt areineligible for admission to the nursing program or are dis-missed from the School of Nursing. Students may repeat only three courses, or a maximum of 11 credit hours, of the required general education courses in aneffort to achieve a C or higher in each course (two science orthree general education electives). The School of Nursingfollows the IU South Bend grade replacement policy . SEVEN -YEARLIMIT Courses in life span development, required sciences, and sta-tistics must have been completed within seven (7) years priorto the semester in which a student begins the nursing major.This policy does not apply to registered nurse students. TRANSFER STUDENTS Intercampus Transfer Nursing students in good academic standing may seek inter- campus transfer by petitioning the APG Committee at least122 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES one semester in advance of the requested transfer. Due to the difference in course sequencing, students seeking an inter-campus transfer should do so only at the completion of allnursing courses required in the sophomore or junior year.Intercampus transfer requests submitted to the APGCommittee that ask for mid-year transfer consideration isdiscouraged. Intercampus transfer requests are evaluated individually on the basis of the student's academic record, the availability ofspace in the required courses, and faculty and facilityresources. Nursing students who wish to transfer between campuses should check for the process on the campus to which they aretransferring. To transfer to the South Bend campus, the stu-dent must submit a written request for intercampus transferto the APG Committee by July 1 for fall transfer, October 1for spring transfer, and February 1 for summer sessiontransfer. Transfer from Non-Indiana University Nursing Program Nursing students in good academic standing at another uni- versity who wish to transfer should contact the School ofNursing coordinator of student services. Nursing courses com-pleted at other universities must be evaluated by the IU SouthBend School of Nursing APG Committee for transfer equiva-lency and for student placement. Students must supply exten-sive documentation, including copies of the syllabi for eachnursing course completed at another university and a releaseof information form. These syllabi must be evaluated in com-parison to the IU South Bend nursing courses. This processcan take time. Therefore, students are encouraged to contactthe IU South Bend School of Nursing at least three monthsprior to the semester they wish to begin at IU South Bend. A.S.N./A.D.N. nursing courses are nontransferable to the B.S.N. degree program. Dismissed Transfer Students IU South Bend School of Nursing does not accept students into the nursing major if the student has been dismissed or has afailing record from another nursing program, including IndianaUniversity programs, in the past five years. If the five yearshave been exceeded an individual record review occurs. CLINICAL PROGRESSION IN THE NURSING PROGRAM After admission to the nursing program, placement in nursingcourses is based upon the following priority ranking: 1. Full-time, regularly progressing students 2. Part-time, regularly progressing students3. Students who interrupted their studies but are in good academic standing 4. Students who failed and successfully repeated a nursing course 5. Students who need to repeat a nursing course6. Students who were dismissed and are reinstated7. Intercampus transfers8. Transfers from other nursing programs according to APG guidelines If additional criteria are needed to determine placement, thedate of becoming out-of-progression and CGPA is used. OUT-OF-PROGRESSION Nursing students who withdrew from the second sophomoresemester, junior year, or senior year of course work, or havefailed a nursing course are considered to be out-of-progres-sion. Students who do not meet health and safety require-ment deadlines are considered to be out-of-progression.Nursing students who withdraw from all or part of the firstsophomore semester of the B.S.N. degree program mustreapply to the program. REENTRY Prenursing students who interrupt their studies and are ingood standing may reenter at any time without priorapproval of the School of Nursing. These students are sub-ject to the policies in effect at the time of reentry and spaceavailability. Prenursing and nursing students in poor standing (or dis- missed) must request approval to continue from the APGCommittee. Students must include in their request a Plan forSuccess addressing areas of deficiency. Nursing students who wish to reenter must submit a written request for reentry to the APG Committee by July 1 for fallreinstatement, October 1 for spring reinstatement, andFebruary 1 for summer session reinstatement. This requestrequires a list of the specific courses in which the studentwishes to enroll and, as appropriate, an explanation of anyextenuating circumstances that may have hindered academicperformance, and a Plan for Success addressing areas ofdeficiency. All requests for reentry are evaluated on the basisof available resources, and, if appropriate, on the satisfactorycompletion of any conditions and/or faculty recommenda-tions existing at the time of withdrawal. Students who reenter must adhere to the academic policies in effect at the time of reentry. For reentry priority, refer to the previous section on Clinical Progression in this Bulletin. SKILLS VALIDATION POLICY Students who interrupt their studies are required to demon-strate validation of clinical skills to reenter the clinicalcourses. Also, transfer students who completed clinicalcourses in another program must successfully complete a clin-ical skills validation and mathematics proficiency examina-tion prior to admission into clinical courses. (See Clinical Handbook for current skills validation requirements.) CLINICAL HOURS REQUIREMENTS Clinical hour requirements are carefully calculated to meetacademic and accreditation standards. Therefore, all clinicalhours are mandatory and all missed time must be made up.See the Clinical Handbook and/or course syllabus for spe-NURSING 123 cific clinical requirements and policies regarding missed time. Insufficient clinical hours results in course failure. WITHDRAWAL POLICIES Withdrawals (grade of W) are issued to students wishing towithdraw from any or all courses if the official withdrawalforms are completed by the deadline dates established by theregistrar's office for each semester. A grade of W appears onstudent transcripts when students complete the official with-drawal forms and obtain the appropriate signature(s). \u0081 Students enrolled in a modular (half-semester) nursing course must withdraw from that course before the course meets for the sixth time. \u0081 After the ninth week of a sixteen week course, the grade awarded is an F unless the student petitions the faculty foran exception to the policy. An exception may be grantedonly if the student has a didactic grade of at least C (2.0)or a clinical grade of S (Satisfactory), and has compellingreasons for withdrawing. The faculty and campus dean(or designee) determine if the grade of W is issued. \u0081 A grade of F is recorded on the official transcript if a stu- dent stops attending but does not officially withdrawfrom a class. \u0081 Students may be withdrawn from (a) nursing course(s) until a required prerequisite general education course issatisfactorily completed. \u0081 Students withdrawing from nursing course work must complete this work prior to progression in the program. \u0081 Withdrawal from a required nursing didactic course requires withdrawal from corequisite nursing clinicalcourse(s). Students who withdraw from the nursing major in the first semester must seek readmission to the program. Admissionis subject to competitive review. Withdrawal from nursing program courses constitutes a dis- ruption in progression and requires that a student seek rein-statement or reentry to the program. (Refer to reinstatementand/or reentry policies.) Students withdrawing from required nursing course work are considered to be out-of-progression students. The date ofgraduation for out-of-progression students is not guaranteed. More than three academic withdrawals in a semester is con- sidered lack of progress toward the degree. If a student with-draws from a didactic course that requires automatic with-draw from a corequisite course, this withdrawal from the twocourses is counted as one withdrawal. A pattern of with-drawals may influence a request for consideration of progres-sion, reinstatement, or reentry to the nursing program. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.N. Students assume responsibility for meeting degree require-ments and for filing an official application for a degree.Application for the degree must be made at the time of pro-gram planning for the final semester. The student must filethe degree application with the School of Nursing recorderby September 15 for December graduation and by January15 for May, June, or August graduation. Minors are declaredand approved on the official application for degree andrequire the signature of the appropriate department chair toconfirm completion of the minor. Students in the B.S.N. degree program are responsible for meeting the following degree requirements. Though theSchool of Nursing makes every attempt to provide studentswith academic advising and program planning assistance,students are accountable for complying with all publishedacademic policies related to the B.S.N. degree program. Tobe eligible for graduation from the Bachelor of Science inNursing program students must: \u0081 Complete a minimum of 123 credit hours with a grade of C or higher in each course required for the degree. Of the 123 credit hours, 64 credit hours must reflect nursingmajor courses. Credit hours earned in remedial learningskill courses and repeated courses do not count in the 123credit hour total, nor in the 64 nursing credit hour total. \u0081 Achieve a grade of C or higher in all didactic courses applied to the B.S.N. degree and an S (Satisfactory) in allclinical/practicum courses. \u0081 Achieve an Indiana University cumulative grade point average of at least a 2.0 (C). This includes all transfercourse work applied to the degree. \u0081 Complete at least 30 credit hours of required nursing major courses on the Indiana University campusawarding the B.S.N. degree. \u0081 Complete all B.S.N. degree requirements within six years of enrolling in the first nursing course in the nursing major. \u0081 Apply for degree candidacy the semester prior to com- pleting all degree requirements, following the publishedprocedures on the campus awarding degree. \u0081 Nonlicensed students are required to complete an NCLEX readiness examination. COMPLETION OF DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The registrar must receive all removal of Incompletes, deferred grades, special credit, and independent study gradesno later than three weeks prior to the end of classes of the stu-dent's last semester or summer session before graduation. APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE EXAMINATION The School of Nursing makes available the necessary formsto take the National Council Licensure Examination(NCLEX) in Indiana. Those students taking the examinationin other states are responsible for obtaining the appropriateforms from those states. It is the student's responsibility tocomplete the application procedure and meet the mailing andpayment deadlines for taking the NCLEX. The School of Nursing administers required assessment tools for preparation for the NCLEX in the last semester ofthe program. These are outlined in the current Clinical Handbook and/or the final semester courses.124 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES CURRICULUM DESIGN Course work in the B.S.N. curriculum is divided into two separate areas: general education and nursing. GENERAL EDUCATION For a more detailed description of the IU South Bend generaleducation curriculum, including lists of approved courses,please see page 33 in this Bulletin . All courses certified as meeting the campuswide general edu-cation requirements are designated in the Schedule of Classes . General education courses help lay the foundation for thenursing courses and also serve to provide the student with awell-rounded education. The general education portion ofthe B.S.N. curriculum consists of approximately 57 credithours, divided into area or course clusters. The campuswidegeneral education requirements are incorporated into theprogram of study. Although some courses may meet therequirements of more than one cluster, a single course canonly be used to meet one requirement. All courses requiredfor the degree must be taken for a grade. Certain coursesrequire prerequisite or developmental courses, which are notlisted here. CAMPUSWIDE CURRICULUM (33-39 CR.) (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) I.

P ROGRAM TRACK The accelerated B.S.N. program track is designed for stu-dents with an earned bachelor's degree in a disparate disci-pline who are interested in earning a second undergraduatedegree. To be considered for the accelerated B.S.N. program track, students are eligible to apply for admission upon completionof all required science and core general education prerequi-sites. Once accepted, students complete the full-time pro-gram in fifteen months using the full calendar year.Additional requirements for admission are: \u0081 Apply for and be granted admission to IU South Bend.\u0081 Apply to IU South Bend School of Nursing's accelerated program. \u0081 Provide documentation showing a previously earned bachelor's degree in a nonnursing field. Transcript(s) should demonstrate a minimum overall undergraduatedegree grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale. \u0081 A minimum application grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale is required for all core science prerequisites andgeneral education courses counting toward the B.S.N.degree. \u0081 A personal statement to include a response to a question, as directed on the application. \u0081 Upon receipt of your application, a personal interview is set with members of the Accelerated Option AdmissionCommittee. The accelerated program option typically begins studies during IU South Bend's summer session. All academic policies in effect for the B.S.N. degree pro- gram apply for the accelerated B.S.N. program track. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM FOR REGISTERED NURSES The IU South Bend School of Nursing program forRegistered Nurses (R.N.) continuing their education througha B.S.N. degree strives to involve the R.N.'s talents, experi-ences, and expertise in the curriculum. As such, the cur-riculum prepares a generalist in professional nursing andserves as the basis for graduate studies. The purpose of thebachelor's degree program is to offer a creative curriculumfor the education of professional nurses competent inmeeting the current and future health needs of society. For the R.N., the curriculum builds on the nurse's basic preparation and is designed to maximize their completedformal education and experiences in nursing. A bachelor'sdegree education begins with an ample foundation in the sci-ences and humanities to assist the graduate expand theirappreciation for, and participation in, the broader communityand culture. These general education courses are typicallyoffered in the traditional semester format in the evenings orduring the day. The upper-division nursing courses preparenurses for career enhancement and transitions in ourchanging health care system and world. Efforts are made toalternate these courses so that several courses are offeredeither on a single day or in the evenings. Interactions in theclassroom and clinical sites with other B.S.N. students andfaculty benefit everyone in their professional development. Following a thorough self-assessment of past experiences, education and professional goals, the R.N. can design an indi-vidual course plan to best meet his or her needs and aspira-tions. (While every effort is made to develop a plan to meetrequirements in a timely manner, interruptions in study plansdo not guarantee the courses for the initial plan or the gradua-tion date.) Nurses with clinical and/or management work126 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES experience can exchange this background for clinical courses through special credits or the portfolio option. Nurses mayalso request course substitutions for content offered by otherdisciplines which may be a part of their career plans. To help the R.N. meet the curriculum requirements in a flex- ible and individual manner, the R.N. faculty advisor canclarify curriculum requirements as well as assist with theprogression assessment and plan of study. Students must also meet the requirements for admission to IU South Bend. ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS \u0081 Full admission to Indiana University \u0081 Verification of a current registered nurse license in Indiana \u0081 Cumulative grade point average of 2.50 or greater GENERAL EDUCATION A minimum of 58 credit hours in general education coursesare required for the R.N. in the B.S.N. degree completion pro-gram. Courses in addition to those required can be selectedfrom the cluster course list available from the R.N. facultyadvisor. Courses from accredited schools can be transferred inand applied to the B.S.N. Submission of an official credittransfer report (CTR) to the School of Nursing is required forall work being transferred from another school. To obtain anofficial CTR, the student must request an official transcriptfrom the other institution(s) to be forwarded to the IU SouthBend Office of Admissions for evaluation. Each studentrecord is individually evaluated for applicability of coursestoward the campus general education requirements and theB.S.N.

RADIOGRAPHY AND ALLIED HEALTH DIRECTOR :Howard OFFICE :Northside Hall 405 TELEPHONE :(574) 520-5570 INTERNET ADDRESS : www.iusb.edu/~radahlt E-MAIL ADDRESS : radahlt@iusb.edu CLINICAL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR :Howard CLINICAL COORDINATOR /LECTURER :Balmer PROGRAM ADVISOR :Joy RADIOGRAPHY PROGRAM Radiography is an art and science which involves the med-ical imaging of patients to produce a radiograph for the diag-nosis of disease. The main goal of the radiographer is to pro-duce the highest quality diagnostic image using ALARA(As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable) Radiation Standardswith a minimum amount of patient discomfort. A radiographer's job duties involve multiple areas of exper- tise\u2014trauma, surgery, fluoroscopy, portable/mobiles, andgeneral diagnostic radiography. Constant growth in the fieldhas created many new and exciting careers in ultrasound, PetScan, Computerized Tomography (CT), MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI), cardiovascular/interventionalradiography, radiation therapy, and nuclear medicine. The radiographer functions in many different roles within the health profession. They may work independently orinteract with other members of the health care team such asradiologists, surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, car-diologists, and nurses. Radiographers are employed in hos-pitals and out-patient facilities such as occupational andurgent care centers, clinics, imaging centers, and doctors'offices. MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the radiography program is to provide ourstudents with a comprehensive education in radiography andto prepare them to enter the radiographic profession as acompetent entry-level diagnostic radiographer. The studentis to be exposed to all available methods of instruction inboth didactic and clinical radiography. Upon graduationfrom the program the student is to be sufficiently prepared topass the National Registry Examination.RADIOGRAPHY 127 128 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM Graduates receive an Associate of Science degree and are eligible to take the certification examination of the AmericanRegistry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) to becomecertified as a Registered Technologist, R.T.(R).

The state accepts the ARRT registry forcertification. CREDENTIALS REQUIRED TO PRACTICE R.T(R) Radiologic Technologist. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM LENGTH OF THE PROGRAM The radiography program is a 34+ month program. STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM The radiography program is a systemwide program offeredat several Indiana University campuses. Although the cam-puses may have comparable admission standards, programoutcomes, and courses, each is individually accredited by theJoint Review Committee on Education in RadiologicTechnology. Additional admission and transfer policies are set by indi- vidual units. Course content and sequencing may vary. The general education courses may be taken on a part-time basis; the clinical/professional program is presented in a full-time, day format, with minimal weekend and evening clin-ical education. DESIGN OF THE PROFESSIONAL CURRICULUM The curriculum follows a pattern designed to educate the radi-ographer to become adept in the performance of any medicaldiagnostic radiographic procedure. Courses in radiographicprinciples, radiographic procedures, clinical application oftheory, computed digital imaging, radiation protection, radio-biology, pathology, and general education are included in thecurriculum. Students also receive instruction in the theory andpractice of other specialty diagnostic imaging modalities. PROGRAM FACILITIES Program facilities of the radiography program are located onthe campus of IU South Bend. Clinical education classes areconducted in the radiology departments of area institutions:Memorial Hospital; St. Joseph Regional Medical Centercampuses in Plymouth and South Bend; Elkhart GeneralHospital; and Goshen General Hospital. ACCREDITATION The radiography program is accredited by the Joint ReviewCommittee on Education in Radiologic Technology. GENERAL POLICIES PROGRAM PLANNING Academic advisors are available to assist students in planningfor their program and for meeting degree requirements. It isthe student's responsibility to acquaint themselves with all theregulations and policies and to remain properly informedthroughout their studies. All provisions of this Bulletin are in effect as soon as a student begins the radiography program. Preradiography and clin- ical/professional students, however, are subject to policy andcurriculum changes as they occur. Curriculum changes duringprogress toward the degree may result in the revision ofdegree requirements. CODE OF ETHICS Students preparing to enter the profession of radiography areexpected to follow the Code of Ethics for the Radiologic Technologist. Each person, upon entering the profession,inherits a measure of responsibility and trust in the professionand the corresponding obligation to adhere to standards of eth-ical practice and conduct set by the profession. The code wasadopted by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. It is the clinical/professional student's responsibility to know, understand, and follow the Code of Ethics for the Radiologic Technologist. \u0081 The radiologic technologist conducts himself or herself in a professional manner, responds to patient needs, and sup- ports colleagues and associates in providing quality patientcare. \u0081 The radiologic technologist acts to advance the principle objective of the profession to provide services to humanitywith full respect for the dignity of mankind. \u0081 The radiologic technologist delivers patient care and ser- vice unrestricted by concerns of personal attributes or thenature of the disease or illness, and without discriminationon the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, or socio-economicstatus. \u0081 The radiologic technologist practices technology founded upon theoretical knowledge and concepts, uses equipmentand accessories consistent with the purpose for which theywere designed, and employs procedures and techniquesappropriately. \u0081 The radiologic technologist assesses situations; exercises care, discretion, and judgment; assumes responsibility forprofessional decisions; and acts in the best interest of thepatient.\u0081 The radiologic technologist acts as an agent through obser- vation and communication to obtain pertinent information for the physician to aid in the diagnosis and treatment ofthe patient and recognizes that interpretation and diagnosisare outside the scope of practice for the profession. \u0081 The radiologic technologist uses equipment and acces- sories; employs techniques and procedures; performs ser-vices in accordance with an accepted standard of practice;and demonstrates expertise in minimizing radiation expo-sure to the patient, self, and other members of the healthcare team. \u0081 The radiologic technologist respects confidences entrusted in the course of professional practice, respects that patient'sright to privacy, and reveals confidential information onlyas required by law or to protect the welfare of the indi-vidual or the community. \u0081 The radiologic technologist continually strives to improve knowledge and skills by participating in continuing educa-tion and professional activities, sharing knowledge withcolleagues, and investigating new aspects of professionalpractice. ADMISSION GENERAL INFORMATION Students may apply for admission to the preradiography pro- gram after qualifying for regular admission to IndianaUniversity. Upon acceptance to the program, students enrolledin general education courses required for the Associate ofScience degree are classified as preradiography. If students have a disability and need assistance, special arrangements can be made to accommodate most needs. Forthe hearing impaired, SPRINT provides services at (800) 743-3333. For more information, please contact the programdirector. Admission to the clinical/professional program is based upon each applicant's admission grade point average of thecompleted preradiography general education courses, a per-sonal interview, and a rating point system. A maximum of 21students are admitted each fall semester. Students must becertified by their academic advisor as eligible to apply for the clinical/professional program and must submit a formalapplication for admission consideration by February 1 of the year of anticipated entry. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students enrolled in the preradiography or clinical/profes-sional program are subject to academic standards as estab-lished by IU South Bend. Failure to maintain these standardscould lead to academic probation or dismissal from the pro-gram. The standards are explained to students during theirinitial orientation/advising session. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS In addition to admission policies and requirements found atthe beginning of this Bulletin , the following requirements apply to the radiography program.PRERADIOGRAPHY PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION FOR PHYS-P 261 H UMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY I To qualify for entry into PHYS-P 261 Human Anatomy andPhysiology I, all preradiography and allied health studentsmust meet at least one of the following conditions: \u0081 Within the last three years, completed the IU South Bend PHSL-P 130 Human Biology course with a grade of C orhigher \u0081 Within the last three years, completed CHEM-C 102 Elementary Chemistry II with a grade of C or higher \u0081 Within the last three years, completed the IU South Bend CHEM-C 105 Principles of Chemistry I and CHEM-C125Experimental Chemistry I and CHEM-C 106 Principles ofChemistry II and CHEM-C 126 Experimental Chemistry IIwith a grade of C or higher in the respective lecture andlaboratory classes If you have completed human anatomy and physiology orchemistry at another college or IU system campus or if youneed additional information, please contact the IU South Bendradiography department by calling (574) 520-4504 to discussthe guidelines for transfer credit equivalency consideration.All transfer courses are evaluated by the IU South Bendbiology and/or chemistry departments to insure that coursecurriculum standards were met.

Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale for all work completedat Indiana University. Courses for which the grades of I, S,P, R, W, or X are assigned are not used to calculate the CGPAsince there are no points assigned to these grades. Courses transferred from other institutions are used in calcu- lating this average. Transfer grades must, however, meet theIndiana University standard of C or higher. This requirementis applied at the time of program application and must bemaintained.TECHNICAL STANDARDS The IU South Bend radiography program has specified tech-nical standards critical to the success of the students in theclinical/professional program. Students must be able to meetthe requirements which include the ability to lift and transferpatients to and from the x-ray examination table; move,adjust, and manipulate equipment to perform radiographicprocedures; review and evaluate radiographs to determinethe quality of the image; communicate orally and in writingwith patients, doctors, and other personnel; and to followwritten and verbal directions. Students must demonstratethese standards with or without reasonable accommodationto succeed in the program. A copy of the Technical Standardsis sent to each applicant to review and sign, certifying thatthey can meet those standards. PROGRAM PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS A student entering the IU South Bend radiography clin-ical/professional program must understand that they areentering a field of medicine that requires certain professionalstandards that other career choices may not. Professionaldress, appearance, and modes of communication must be ofcertain standards to maintain the confidence and care of thepatient. Patients present themselves in all ages, cultures, andof various ethnic origins; therefore trendy modes of dressand appearance are not allowed. The program has an established dress code and a code of conduct that students must follow throughout their clinicalexperience. A copy of the IU South Bend Radiography Program Professional Standards is sent to each applicant to review and sign, certifying that they understand the require-ments of the program and that they agree to abide by thesestandards. INTERVIEW An interview is required for admission consideration and isscheduled during the months of April and May. VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE Although not a requirement, volunteer experience is recom-mended and is very helpful in making a career choice.130 COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES CLINICAL /PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM GENERAL INFORMATION Admission to the university as a preradiography student, and successful completion of the general education course work,does not guarantee admission to the Associate of Sciencedegree program. The number of clinical/professional stu-dents admitted each fall is dependent upon the number ofopenings available in the radiology departments in the areahealth care institutions designated as clinical education sites(Memorial Hospital, St. Joseph Regional Medical Centercampuses in Plymouth and South Bend, Elkhart GeneralHospital, and Goshen General Hospital). ADMISSION CRITERIA At the conclusion of the spring semester of program applica-tion, students in the applicant pool are scored to determinetheir rank order. The criteria for admission consideration isbased on a 128 point weighted scale as follows:0-75 points\u2014AGPA (Admission Grade Point Average) of the preradiography general education course work completedby the end of the spring semester of application 0-25 points\u2014Interview scores0-28 rating points\u2014Students can earn rating points (max- imum 28) which are added to their overall combinedscore as follows: One point given for each credit hour of a required general education course completed with a C or higher by the endof the spring semester of program application. Pointsavailable = 0-23 Five points given for completion of PHYS-P 261 Human Anatomy and Physiology I and PHYS-P 262 HumanAnatomy and Physiology II with a C or higher by the end of the spring semester of program application. Pointsavailable = 5 Students offered a clinical position within the associatedegree program must formally accept or decline admission,in writing, to the program prior to the beginning of thesemester to which they are admitted. Students offered a posi-tion in the clinical/professional program but decline accep-tance or become academically ineligible can reapply to theprogram the following year. They must compete with theapplicant pool for the semester in which they requestentrance with no preference or wait listing given. Studentshave only two opportunities to decline admission in writingprior to losing their eligibility to apply. CRIMINAL CHECKS Federal mandates for clinical agencies require criminalchecks through the Indiana State Police. Students are respon-sible for applying for the criminal check and all fees associ-ated with the check.ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

Withdrawal from radi-ography major courses constitutes a disruption in progressand requires that a student seek reinstatement to the pro-gram. Students desiring reinstatement must reapply within a time frame that would allow the student timely completion of theprogram. A written request must be submitted at least sixweeks prior to the term of desired reentry. All requests forreentry are evaluated by the program director on the basis ofavailable resources, and if appropriate, on the satisfactorycompletion of any conditions and/or recommendationsexisting at the time of withdrawal. Reinstatement to the IU South Bend radiography clinical/professional program isnot guaranteed. AWARDS The program faculty recommend graduating students withsuperior academic performance for degrees awarded withdistinction. The student with the highest GPA in the clin-ical/professional program is awarded the MallinckrodtAward of Excellence.

Klein GENERAL INFORMATION The program in labor studies is a unit of the statewide School of Social Work, based at Indiana University Purdue University -Indianapolis. IU South Bend students majoring in labor studies receive their degrees from IU South Bend. Labor studies is an interdisicplinary field that explores issues of work and the work place, social inequality and class struc- ture, and the struggles of workers and their organizations. As a field that was originally developed to educate union membersand leaders labor studies sees labor organizations, including trade unions, as basic organizations for the mainatinance andexpansion of a democratic society. In addition to its roots in labor and union education, labor studies is an academic field th at draws on such areas as political science, economics, history, legal studies, sociology, and anthropology to explore the experi-ence of workers (of all kinds) and their efforts to achieve a greater voice in society.136 LABOR STUDIES PROGRAM CERTIFICATE AND DEGREES The Labor Studies Program offers a certificate, minor, Associate of Science in Labor Studies, and Bachelor ofScience in Labor Studies. The program has a long history ofworking with unions in the state of Indiana to develop anddeliver educational courses. These courses are coordinatedby members of the labor studies faculty. They and associatefaculty members also teach the courses. Faculty qualifica-tions typically combine academic credentials with unionbackground. MINOR IN LABOR STUDIES A minor in labor studies requires the completion of 15 credithours in labor studies courses consisting of 6 credit hours fromour list of core courses and 9 additional credit hours to bedetermined through consultation with the campus faculty. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS For the Associate of Science in Labor Studies, at least 12credit hours must be earned from Indiana University, 10credit hours of these after admission to the Labor StudiesProgram. No more than 15 credit hours may be earnedwithin a single subject other than labor studies. For the Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies, at least 24 credit hours must be earned from Indiana University, 20 ofthese after admission to the Labor Studies Program. No morethan 21 credit hours may be earned within a single subjectother than labor studies. Thirty credit hours must be earnedin 300- or 400-level courses, and at least 12 of the 30 credithours must be earned in labor studies courses. For the certificate in labor studies and both the associate and bachelor's degrees, an overall 2.0 (C) grade point averagemust be maintained. Courses in which grades below C -are received may be counted only as electives. For the associateand bachelor's degrees, courses within a major area must bein at least two different subjects. For additional standards,see the section of this Bulletin on Academic Policies. MAJOR AREAS OF LEARNING Following are representative subjects and courses fallingunder each of the three major areas of learning listed undercertificate and degree requirements.

These groupings are laborstudies courses, major areas of learning, and electives. The accompanying chart shows the credit hour distribution requiredfor each certificate and degree in labor studies.SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS Astronomy Geology Biology Mathematics Chemistry PhysicsComputer Science/ Zoology Technology SOCIAL AND BEHA VIORAL SCIENCES Anthropology Political Science Economics Psychology Geography Sociology Linguistics ELECTIVES Students may select any of the courses offered by IU SouthBend to fulfill elective requirements. Students are encour-aged to consult with their academic advisor and to concen-trate their elective course work in related subjects. APPLICATION AND ADMISSION The certificate and degree programs in the Labor StudiesProgram are open to all qualified high school graduates orpersons with the General Educational Development (GED)certificate. Adults over 21 who do not meet these require-ments may be admitted on a provisional basis and may applyfor regular admission upon successful completion of 12credit hours. Applicants must submit the following: \u0081 A completed application for admission to the Labor Studies Program \u0081 A nonrefundable application fee payable to IU South Bend, if you have not previously been admitted to IU South Bend \u0081 A high school transcript\u0081 An official transcript of previous college work, mailed by the college All application materials must be forwarded to the Labor Studies Program office on the campus where the applicantintends to enroll. Applicants not living within commuting dis-tance of a campus and wishing to participate through theonline program should send materials to the Bloomingtonoffice, attention Independent Study Program. Internationalstudents should request the international application foradmission and related materials from the Bloomington office.The address of the Bloomington office is: Labor Studies Indiana UniversityPoplars 628400 E. Seventh StreetBloomington, Indiana 47405-3085 CREDIT TRANSFERS Official transcripts, when received, will be forwarded to the admissions office for evaluation. Within a few weeks, appli-cants should receive an official notice of admission statusand a credit transfer report indicating which courses areaccepted at Indiana University. The labor studies office willthen prepare a summary of how these courses apply to thelabor studies certificate and degree requirements. Correspondence participants should contact the Bloomington office for advising and should use the currentbooklet entitled Indiana University School of ContinuingStudies Distance Education Courses . At this point, if you have not already done so, proceed toplan your program in consultation with your advisor andenroll in courses. Check with the labor studies office forschedules and directions. PROGRESS OPTIONS One or more of the methods listed in this section may pro-vide the labor studies participant a means of receivingIndiana University credit without taking conventional class-room-based courses. This allows accelerated progresstoward a labor studies degree. COLLEGE -LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) has availabletests in a variety of subject areas. If your score exceeds a cer-tain level on an Indiana University accepted test, you receivecredit (3 credit hours for most examinations). CLEPbrochures are available at the Labor Studies Program office. INDEPENDENT STUDY BY CORRESPONDENCE While most students prefer the online labor studies courses,some labor studies courses are also available by correspon-dence through the Indiana University School of ContinuingStudies Independent Study Program. Please contact the laborstudies office for further information. The Indiana University Independent Study Program offers over 200 university-level independent study courses.Students enrolling in independent study courses receive alearning guide that contains reading assignments in therequired textbooks, discussion sections, and written assign-ments. Lessons are sent to an instructor, who comments onand grades student work. Most courses have one or moreexaminations, which must be taken under supervision at anaccredited school. Students are allowed one year to completea course. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE Depending on the length and type of training you havereceived, you may receive up to 6 credit hours based on mil-itary service. Additional credit hours may be awarded forspecial training programs in the military. This credit can onlybe applied as elective credit for labor studies degrees. Toapply, present your DD-214 form and, if applicable, trainingcompletion certificates to the labor studies office. CREDIT FOR SELF-ACQUIRED COMPETENCIES Labor studies participants may apply up to 15 credit hours ofSelf-Acquired Competencies (SAC) to the Associate ofScience degree and up to 30 credit hours (including anyLABOR STUDIES PROGRAM 137applied to the associate degree) to the Bachelor of Science degree. SAC credit can be awarded for learning gained out-side the university and may be based on a wide variety ofexperiences. Labor studies students can apply for SAC crediton the basis of learning derived from their union activities. Self-Acquired Competencies refer to learning or compe- tency that can be documented. SAC credit is not grantedsimply for time served. Thus, it is not granted on the basis ofthe number of terms served as a union officer. Nor is it mul-tiplied by the number of times the same experience has beenrepeated. A secretary-treasurer who has performed the samefunctions for four terms is not likely to receive significantlymore credit hours than one who has performed the samefunctions, and has learned as much, from one or two terms. SAC credit is of two types: \u0081 Course-specific credit hours are granted where the appli- cant's competency is substantially equivalent to the com- petency that is expected in an Indiana University course.Credit hours for the specific course is awarded. \u0081 General credit hours are granted for competencies that are not the full equivalent of individual courses but are nev-ertheless the equivalent of college learning. This is the only form of SAC credit hours available outsideof the Labor Studies Program. In general, the following procedures and limitations govern the award of credit hours for SAC: \u0081 A student must be admitted to the labor studies program and be in good standing before any credit for SAC isawarded. \u0081 A maximum of 15 credit hours of SAC credit may be applied to the Associate of Science in Labor Studies anda maximum of 30 credit hours to the Bachelor of Sciencein Labor Studies. HOWTOAPPLY FOR SELF-ACQUIRED COMPETENCIES The process of building the SAC portfolio is time con-suming. It begins with the development of a resume and thelisting of experiences that may have led to college-levelcompetencies. The competencies are then organized andphrased to demonstrate the connection to specific laborstudies courses or to general areas of knowledge in laborstudies. Finally, appropriate documentation is added. Each portfolio is evaluated by two members of the Labor Studies Program faculty, who also conduct an interview withthe applicant. Supplementary materials and counseling are available from labor studies faculty on campuses offering the program. TRANSFER OF SELF-ACQUIRED COMPETENCIES CREDIT WITHIN THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY SYSTEM Self-Acquired Competencies credit awarded by the facultyof one Indiana University campus is recorded and explainedon the student's permanent record. Such credit will be hon-ored, therefore, on any other Indiana University campus towhich the student may transfer in order to complete the asso-ciate or bachelor's degree in labor studies. The studentshould be aware, however, that such credit will not neces-sarily be honored by other degree programs of IndianaUniversity or by other institutions. ACADEMIC POLICIES Institutional academic policies are stated in the front section of this Bulletin. All these policies pertain to students enrolledin labor studies; however, the following policies are particu-larly relevant. ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS POLICY FOR FORMER INDIANA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS Students with academic deficiencies (cumulative grade point average below 2.0 or C average) in course work done withinthe Indiana University system may be admitted to the laborstudies program on probation. The student must achieve a2.0 grade point average for all courses taken at IndianaUniversity before and after admission to the program inorder to obtain a degree. Students who have been dismissedfrom another academic program of Indiana University maynot be admitted to labor studies programs until at least onecalendar year has passed from the date of dismissal. A student prevented from attaining a cumulative 2.0 grade point average because of poor work in a semester at IndianaUniversity that was completed five or more years beforeenrollment in the labor studies program may request theremoval of the poor semester from the Labor StudiesProgram records. In general, such a request is granted auto-matically, particularly in those cases where the studentwould be prevented from graduating because of the one poorsemester. All credit earned during this one semester is alsoremoved from the grade point average by the Labor StudiesProgram under this forgiveness policy. A similar request may be made for the forgiveness of a poor semester completed at Indiana University within five yearsprior to admission to the labor studies program. Approval ofsuch requests is usually dependent, however, upon the suc-cessful completion of 12 credit hours in the labor studiesprogram. Because all credit earned during the forgivensemester is removed from the grade point average, studentsare encouraged to consult with their advisor concerning theadvisability of this procedure. This policy is designed to avoid placing an excessive burden on students who, in the past, have made a poor start atIndiana University. It is not intended to permit students withchronically poor performance in the university to stay inschool, nor to raise false hopes for students who are notmaking progress toward a degree. ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS POLICY FOR STUDENTS DISMISSED FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS Students who have been dismissed from another postsec-ondary institution may not be admitted to the labor studiesprogram until at least one calendar year has passed since thedate of the dismissal.138 LABOR STUDIES PROGRAMUniversity regulations require that the admissions office indicate any deficiencies in grade point average (averagegrade below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale) at another institution on thecredit transfer report. The policy is to maintain a student'sgrade point average based only on work done at IndianaUniversity. These grades must be of average, or C quality(2.0 on 4.0 scale) in order to earn a degree. If a student'scumulative grade point average from another institution isbelow 2.0, however, the student is admitted on probation. GRADUATION Degrees are awarded every December, May, and August.Participants expecting to graduate must file written notice ofintent, citing the degree and expected date of graduation,with the labor studies office at least three months prior tograduation. GRADUATION WITH HONORS Students completing a minimum of 30 credit hours for theAssociate of Science in Labor Studies or 60 credit hours forthe Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies at IndianaUniversity will be graduated with honors if they haveattained the appropriate grade averages: 3.90, highest dis-tinction; 3.75, high distinction; 3.50, distinction. UNION EDUCATION PROGRAM The Labor Studies Program also offers an extensive non-credit program-the Union Education Program (UEP). UEP open enrollment courses and conferences are available to workers in communities throughout the state. They areoffered in local union halls, on the various campuses ofIndiana University, and on the campuses of other educationalinstitutions.Classes usually meet weekly for 4-10 weeks. They are opento participants from both large and small unions, craft andindustrial unions, and public and private sector unions.Typical topics for these classes are labor law, collective bar-gaining, steward training, communications, OSHA, and arbi-tration. Other programs are designed to meet the educational needs of individual unions. Local or international unions may con-tract with the Labor Studies Program to conduct these pro-grams. Enrollments are limited to members of the con-tracting union. There are no special entrance requirements, tests, or grades. Participants who complete a class or conference are awardeda Certificate of Achievement from the Labor StudiesProgram. Upon completion of 150 classroom hours in theUEP, the participant is awarded a Certificate of Recognition.Upon completion of 300 classroom hours in the UEP, theparticipant will be awarded a Certificate of Recognition anda plaque. There is a nominal charge for UEP classes and con-ferences. ORGANIZATION AND FACULTY The labor studies faculty are made up of people with bothunion experience and academic credentials. The faculty uses avariety of teaching methods, including videotape recording,case studies, films, group discussion, and role playing to pro-mote student interest and participation. A Statewide Advisory Committee on Labor Education and Research, appointed by the president of Indiana University,advises the program on educational courses offered to Indianaunion members. Similarly, the LaPorte, Michiana, andWarsaw Area Labor Education Advisory Committees guidethe program at IU South Bend.LABOR STUDIES PROGRAM 139 140 ASSOCIATE DEANS :McMillen, Torstrick DIRECTOR OF ADV ANCE COLLEGE PROJECT :Dimitrakopoulos COORDINATOR OF STUDENT SERVICES :M. Nurenberg DIRECTOR OF ACADEMIC ADVISING CENTER :Lynker GENERAL INFORMATION The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the nucleus of IU South Bend. Through studies with the faculties of the humani- ties, social and behavioral sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences departments, students have the opportunity to broadentheir awareness and knowledge of the major areas of human activity. By selecting an area of study in one of the traditional disciplines, students acquire in-depth understanding of a single field of investigation. Through their academic experiences, students also sharpen critical thinking skills, develop an appreciation for the arts, learn to communicate more effectively, enhance their self knowledge, and increase their tolerance for differences.Consequently, students graduate prepared for a lifetime of learning and are better able to cope with and enjoy the rapidlychanging world in which we live. Faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences advise all students with a declared major in the college, as well as those who are undecided but leaning toward a traditional arts and sciences major. In addition, faculty have accepted the responsi-bility of advising and welcoming all incoming freshmen students who are undecided about their major. Regular advising ses-sions are scheduled during summer orientation and by appointment throughout the year in Wiekamp Hall 3300B. The advisingtelephone number for students undecided about a major is (574) 520-4537.COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES LYNN R.

Generalstudies information is available in this Bulletin and by calling (574) 520-4260. Along with the programs leading to the associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees, the college offers courses that are thegeneral education component of all IU South Bend under-graduate degrees. THESTUDENT 'SRESPONSIBILITY All colleges establish certain academic requirements thatmust be met before a degree is granted. These regulationsconcern such things as curricula and courses, the require-ments for majors and minors, and university procedures.Advisors, directors, and deans are available to advise stu-dents on how to meet these requirements, but each student isindividually responsible for fulfilling them. If requirementsare not satisfied, the degree is withheld pending adequatefulfillment. For this reason, it is important for each student tobe well acquainted with all requirements described in thisBulletin. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS All students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciencesshould familiarize themselves with the AcademicRegulations and Policies in the front section of this Bulletin. A number of specialized regulations apply to the college. Occasional changes in the graduation requirements for liberal arts and sciences majors may lead to uncertainty as to whichBulletin is applicable for a given graduating student. For the general education requirements and other academic matters,the student may choose either the Bulletin in effect at the time of matriculation to IU South Bend or the Bulletin in effect at the time of graduation. For meeting requirements of themajor, the choice is between the Bulletin in effect when the student certifies into the college and the Bulletin in effect when the student graduates. ACADEMIC PROBATION A College of Liberal Arts and Sciences student who hasattempted 12 or more credit hours is placed on probation iftheir cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0, andremains on probation until it reaches or exceeds 2.0. If a stu-dent who is on probation fails to achieve a 2.0 in any regularfall or spring semester, the student is restricted to half-timeenrollment for the following six (6) months of enrollment. Ifthat student fails for a second time to achieve a 2.0 in anyone semester of enrollment, he/she is subject to dismissalfrom the university for at least one year, at the discretion ofthe probation committee.

Sernau, Tetzlaff A minor in African American Studies provides students with a focused understanding of the vital role of AfricanAmerican culture and contributions in American life. Theminor consists of a core introductory course, an AfricanAmerican history course, and three elective courses, forminga total of 15 credit hours. The approach is interdisciplinary,combining the social and behavioral sciences, the humani-ties, business, and education. In addition to broadening stu-dents' awareness, this minor is expected to enhance students'employability in our increasingly diverse society. African American Studies, as defined by one of its leading scholars, is \"the systematic study of the black experience,framed by the socioeconomic, cultural, and geographicalboundaries of sub-Saharan Africa and the black diaspora.\" MINOR IN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) A grade of C -or higher is required in each of the courses that count toward the minor. A cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 isrequired for the minor. REQUIREMENTS (15 CR.) Core Courses (6 cr.)

All students seeking this minor mustcomplete second-year Spanish or its equivalent. Students reg-istered in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences completethe language requirement by taking Spanish to fulfill the lan-guage requirements for the Bachelor of Arts. Students inother divisions take SPAN-S 204 Second Year Spanish II asan elective for the minor as well as meeting the languagerequirement. Students enrolled or contemplating this minorare encouraged to complete their language courses as early aspossible in their program. Both the Spanish and sociology component of the IU South Bend Mexico and Costa Rica programs, SOC-S 362 WorldSocieties and Cultures, can be applied to the minor and stu-dents are encouraged to consider this program or other inter-national experience. All course work for the minor should beplanned with an advisor from the Latin American/LatinoStudies Committee. This helps achieve a program of comple-mentary course work tailored to a student's specific needsand interests.

Actuaries may work for insur-ance companies, employee benefits, consulting firms, or thebenefits department of general business and government agen-cies. The competitive actuarial profession requires mathematics graduates to have analytical, statistical, and computationalskills, which allow them to solve industrial problems, predictthe financial effects of uncertain future events, and carry outdecision-making analyses. Students graduating from the pro-gram who plan to pursue careers in actuarial science canexpect to succeed on the first one or two actuarial scienceexaminations, and thus be ready to enter the actuarial profes-sion. Students graduating from the program who choose not tobecome actuaries are well prepared to enter industry and workin such areas as quality control, computational analysis, infor-mation management, forecasting, risk analysis, simulation,and finance. A student wishing to pursue graduate study inmathematics or business is certainly prepared for either disci-pline.

Zynda ASSISTANT PROFESSORS : Ananth, Shockey, Shrader FACULTY EMERITI : Naylor, Robbins, Washburn Philosophy emphasizes clear, critical, and logical thinkingabout philosophical problems by locating these problems ineveryday experience and in the writings of the great philoso-phers. Philosophy also stresses reflection on establishedbeliefs and values so that we can achieve a better under-standing of ourselves and the world in which we live. Thecurriculum in philosophy is designed to contribute to theintellectual training of all undergraduates and to acquaintstudents with some of the most important developments inintellectual history. The curriculum is structured to meet theneeds not only of those who want to become professionalphilosophers, but also of those who want to pursue philos-ophy as a personal interest or as a concentration area to com-plement study in another field. The department offers courses both in philosophy and in the history and philosophy of science. It is one of several IUSouth Bend departments that offers courses in religiousstudies and in cognitive science. Students who wish to focustheir study on philosophy and a related area (e.g., art, reli-gion, women's studies, a social or behavioral science, math-ematics, a physical or biological science, the law) are invitedto talk with any member of the department about the possiblebenefits of such options as a double major or a minor in phi-losophy, religious studies, cognitive science, or women'sstudies.ASSOCIATE OF ARTS WITH A CONCENTRATION IN PHILOSOPHY (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

The department iscommitted to preparing students for the complex, multicul-tural, and transnational environment of life and work. Studentsare encouraged to consider taking a minor in a foreign lan-guage as a complement to their major in another discipline,remembering that a minor is now a College of Liberal Arts andSciences requirement. Students may pursue, in addition toworld language studies, the Certificate in International Studiesor a minor in an interdisciplinary program at IU South Bend,such as Latin American/Latino Studies, European Studies, orFilm Studies. Please contact an advisor in the department forfurther information. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT The study of languages other than English is essential to understand and appreciate our global community. In recog-nition of this fact, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciencesrequires that its Bachelor of Arts majors attain an inter-medriate-level proficiency in a second language. Thisrequirement can be met in one of three ways: \u0081 Successful completion of a fourth-semester language course designated in the IU South Bend Schedule of Classes as 204. (204 is the last class in a four-semester sequence: 101, 102, 203, and 204) \u0081 Successful completion of a 300- or 400-level course in which the primary instruction is in a language other thanEnglish. \u0081 Formal training, as evidenced by a secondary or univer- sity diploma, in a language other than English. Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree should con-sult with their major department to determine the languagerequirement. Students from other academic programs oncampus may take world language courses as electives andmay earn world language credits by placement examinationor advanced course placement as described below. PLACEMENT Students with no prior foreign language experience shouldenroll in 101; students with one to two years of foreign lan-guage study in high school should enroll in 102; studentswith three or more years of foreign language study shouldenroll in 203 and consider taking the placement examination.Students with three or more years of foreign language studyalso may qualify to register for upper-level courses in thedepartment. To determine placement in department courses,students take a department placement examination.

ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND POLICIES ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical stan-dards in all their course work and research. Individuals vio-lating that code of conduct are subject to disciplinary action;such breaches could lead to expulsion of the student fromIndiana University or to rescission of a degree alreadygranted. The Indiana University Graduate School has pre-pared a document entitled Integrity in Graduate Study , which, among other topics, deals with plagiarism, fraud, andconflicts of interest.ACADEMIC STANDING The university has established levels of competency,according to grade point average and semesters completed,which determine whether a graduate student is in goodstanding, on probation, or ineligible to continue studies.Good Standing: Those students who consistently maintain a minimum GPA on their cumulative and semester recordsas defined by the graduate program in which the studentis formally admitted. Probation: Students are on probation for the duration of the next regular semester or summer session following one inwhich the minimum GPA was not obtained and/or main-tained. Dismissal: Students may be dismissed from graduate pro- grams if they do not maintain satisfactory academicstanding as defined by the student's program of study. ADDITION OF COURSES A graduate student who wishes to enroll in additional coursework after the first two weeks of a regular semester, or afterthe first week of a summer session, may do so if the instructorof the course, the graduate advisor, and the graduate programdirector recommend to the dean that this be done.N OTE: SPECIAL FEES ARE ASSESSED FOR MOST LATE REGIS - TRATIONS . CREDIT TRANSFER Graduate Course Transfer and Academic Residency Each graduate degree offered through IU South Bend out- lines specific requirements and course work for successfulcompletion of a graduate degree. Some course workobtained at other accredited institutions may transfer to a particular degree program. Any transfer of course work mustbe reviewed and approved by your degree program. Each ofthe graduate programs has guidelines regarding the numberof credit hours that can be taken at other universities andcounted toward a graduate degree. The graduate programdirectors determine the number and content of courses andcredit (taken outside of the established program of study)which may be counted toward a particular graduate degree.The graduate program director makes any and all determina-tions of course work transferred and accepted based on theiracademic discipline and program requirements. Any coursework taken outside of the graduate program in which you areformally admitted must receive advisor approval. GRADE POINT AVERAGE A minimum grade point average (GPA) must be maintainedto remain in good academic standing in your master's degreeprogram. There are differences among the master's pro-grams. At no time may an earned grade of D or F be countedtoward a master's degree. The individual master's programshave minimum standards with some using a grade of B (3.0)as a minimum standard. Please review your graduate pro-gram GPA requirements for remaining in good academicstanding.200 GRADUATE PROGRAMS GRADUATE PROGRAMS 201 INDEPENDENT /CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Credit earned in correspondence courses may not be counted toward any graduate degree. It is possible, however, thatsuch work may be used by the student to make up entrancedeficiencies. For more information, call your academicadvisor. SEMESTER LOAD Graduate students shall be considered full time if they areregistered for 8 credit hours (4 credit hours during eachsummer session) and their programs of study meet with theapproval of the academic programs. Courses taken as anauditor may not be counted in the definition of full-timestudy; however, courses taken to remove undergraduate defi-ciencies for admission may be counted. Graduate students may take no more than 16 hours of credit in any semester, nor more than a total of 16 credit hours in all thesummer sessions in any one year without permission of theirgraduate advisor. Students who are employed are advised totake into account the demands that such activities make ontheir time and to reduce their course loads accordingly. TIMELIMITS FOR GRADUATE STUDY The age of course work and/or degrees earned may impactthe number of transfer credit hours, courses, and number ofhours needed to complete your educational objectives. Theage of credit hours and changes in course work vary in eachgraduate program.There are also time limits imposed for completion of grad-uate degrees. These limits vary; however, most programsrequire completion within five years from the start of grad-uate course work. You are required to work closely with yourprogram advisor to plan your course work and the comple-tion of your degree. WITHDRAWAL Withdrawals prior to the last day to drop a course (see offi-cial calendar for each semester) are automatically marked W.According to university regulations, withdrawal after thisdate is permitted only with the approval of the dean of thestudent's school for urgent reasons related to the student'shealth or equivalent distress. In all such cases, the studentmust submit a request for late withdrawal to the advisor or tothe graduate program director. This request must be sup-ported by the instructor of the course, the graduate advisor,and the graduate program director, and then be forwarded tothe dean with an accompanying statement outlining the rea-sons for the request. If the dean approves the request, the stu-dent's mark in the course shall be W, if the work completedup to the point of withdrawal is passing; otherwise a grade ofF shall be recorded. Failure to complete a course without anauthorized withdrawal results in the grade of F. N OTE: TERMINATION OF CLASS ATTENDANCE DOES NOT CON - STITUTE OFFICIAL WITHDRAWAL AND RESULTS IN A GRADE OFF.

ADVISING Either prior to or during the week of registration, enteringstudents are urged to consult the graduate programs coordi-nator or music advisor to determine the most suitable cog-nate field for their master's degree. Although a bachelor'sdegree with the same major is a prerequisite for eachmaster's degree, the demonstrated equivalent of the bach-elor's degree may be offered instead, thus allowing a changeof major at the graduate level. Only after results of theentrance examinations and auditions are known and aftercareful consideration of the prerequisites, requirements, andultimate goals of each degree plan can the major and cognatefields be approved. Advising conferences are held near the end of each semester. Students currently enrolled should have their programsplanned at that time to speed the registration process.Students failing to attend these conferences may be requiredto register after classes have begun.

A past criminal history may become a significant barrier to clinical practicum rotation placements. In addition, currentIndiana law states that individuals who have been convictedof certain crimes may not be employed by or operate a homehealth facility or work in the Indiana public school system.While a conviction of a crime does not automatically dis-qualify a student from participation in community-basedclinical, a criminal history may be grounds for denying pro-gression depending on the facts and circumstances sur-rounding each individual case.

The program is designed primarily for teachersin secondary education but is applicable also to elementary andcommunity college teaching. Individuals with an undergrad-uate degree in history or the social sciences may pursue thisdegree and teacher certification concurrently. The M.A.T. in social studies program permits concentration in subject areas while advancing the student's teachingskills. The degree requires a total of 36 credit hours,including 12 credit hours in a major field and 6 credit hoursin each of two minor fields. The remaining 12 credit hoursare for elective subjects. There is no language or thesisrequirement. Residency requirements are fulfilled by taking12 credit hours at Indiana University Bloomington, eitherduring one semester or during summer sessions. Everyone who receives the M.A.T. degree in social studies must be certified to teach in Indiana schools. The certifica-tion can be the result of one's undergraduate studies, or canbe earned through the M.A.T. program itself. In the lattercase, the certification requirements can be met by takingappropriate education courses for the 12 credit hours of elec-tive work allowed within the program plus an additional 6credit hours of work in education (student teaching).The M.A.T. degree in social studies is conferred by IndianaUniversity Bloomington, which establishes admission anddegree requirements. The program must be initiated throughBloomington, but some course work may be done at IUSouth Bend. Students interested in applying for admission to this program should contact: Mr. C.

M OST REQUIRED IU SOUTH BEND CLASSES ARE OFFERED EVERY SEMESTER . COMPUTER GRAPHICS Computer Graphics Technology (CGT) is an important formof communication for scientists, engineers, technologists,and technicians. Each technical profession uses graphics inspecific ways to explore its technology, to design solutionsto technological problems, to document its products and ser-vices, and to conduct marketing worldwide. The fields of computer graphics employ a diverse group of individuals. It is a heterogeneous mix of artists, engineers,designers, and technologists who create the volumes of tech-nical documentation required of industry. Advancing technology dictates a more flexible worker, capable of adapting to rapidly changing tools, and willing toacquire a broader and deeper knowledge of how images arecreated, edited, stored, transmitted, and combined with textand data to form the basis of technical documentation. Because computer graphics requires a highly developed sense of visual form, some individuals choose to specializein interpreting engineering and technological informationgraphically. These graphics technicians and technologistsfacilitate communication within and between technical spe-cialties and the general population. They are highly visualpeople interested in how images are used in all areas ofsociety. They aid in the preparation of engineering and archi-tectural drawings, technical manuscripts, reports, textbooks,video, and film. They prepare exhibits, models, graphs,charts, brochures, and technical renderings or artists' con-ceptions. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)
