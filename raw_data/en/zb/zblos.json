It has also gone through a monumental transition with individuals moving from modern medicines to alternative methods of treatment and a holistic way of living. Modern medicine and therapies have limitations when it comes to curing chronic and lifestyle conditions. As a result, the healthcare industry has been in the quest of making the health ecosystem more inclusive, holistic, and affordable. These approaches have recently brought Ayurveda into the limelight again. [Ayurvedic therapy](https://fazlaninaturesnest.com/wellness-journey/ayurveda/), known as the 'Sister Science' of yoga, is one of the most renowned traditional systems of medicine that has evolved into a comprehensive healthcare management system. It has been playing an important role in shaping the discourse around the modern healthcare system. Moreover, the current crisis acts as a powerful reminder of the need for more sustainable healthcare solutions and the importance of Ayurveda. Basic Doctrine Principles of Ayurveda Ayurveda therapy believes that the entire universe is composed of five elements (referred to as Pancha Mahabhoota) \u2014 Vayu (air), Jala (water), Aakash (space), Prithvi (earth), and Teja (fire). These five elements are believed to form the three main body types and personality characteristics, otherwise known as Doshas or Tridoshas' in varying combinations. - Vata \u2014 The catabolism of the body is believed to be governed by Vata dosha. It helps maintain cellular transport, balance electrolyte, and eliminate waste products. Dryness increases the effect of this dosha. - Pitta \u2014 The metabolism of the body is believed to be governed by Pitta dosha. It regulates the optic nerve coordination and body temperature while aiding in hunger and thirst management. The body's heat conditions aggravate this dosha. - Kapha \u2014 The anabolism of the body is believed to be governed by Kapha dosha. It provides lubrication to the joints for proper functioning. Sweet and fatty foods increase this dosha. In Ayurveda, it is believed that a perfect balance between these three doshas and natural elements is important to maintain a healthy state of mind and body. Any imbalance between them can cause a state of illness or disease.
