Every day Austin Public Health staff perform activities to prevent disease, promote health, and protect the well-being of all people who live and visit Austin and Travis County. T he 2019 Critical Health Indicators Report represents Austin Public Health Department's efforts to gather, analyze, and present information on adverse health conditions that reveal the overall well-being of the county's population. This report provides an updated overview of the community's health noted in three prior reports published in 2012, 2015, and 2017. The report notes many successes in preventing disease and protect ing the health of the community. Fewer people are smoking tobacco products. Lung canc er deaths rates are steadily decreasing. The incidence rates for human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis are the ir lowest levels in the past ten years. F ewer people are sickened with acute hepatitis A and B viruses, evidence that vaccinations work. I n spite of the successes, a number of challenges persist. About 9% of the adult population has been told they have diabetes. More than half of Travis County adults are considered overweight or obese. A quarter of births are to mothers who received late or no prenatal care. Too many residents of our community die by suicide. Many diseases disproportionately strike people based on their racial or ethnic group or their social economic status. A ustin Public Health continues to be committed in address ing these public health challenges. On behalf of the Austin Public Health, I am pleased to share with you the 2019 Critical Health Indicators Report. I hope this report generates questions and discussions on how to best improve the health status of the population and to ensure our vision that \"Everyone will have an optimal quality of life, health, and well-being\" .

In 201 8, eight years later, the City of Austin was ranked as the 11th most populated city in the United States. From 2010 to 2018, the City of Austin population increased 22% . The City of Austin is ranked as the 4th most populous city in Texas. Travis County is ranked as the 5th most populous county in Texas. Table 1.1 shows selected demographic characteristics for the population s of the City of Austin, Travis County, and the State of Texas. Almost one million people are estimated to have resided in the City of Austin in 2017. The City of Austin population comprise d about 3% of the State of Texas population. The Travis County population comprised about 4% of the State of Texas population. For the City of Austin and Tra vis County, a similar percentage, from 21 to23%, of the population is younger than 18 years of age. A majority (7 5%) of people living in Aust in and Travis County are white ; most are non -Hispanic. In 2017, Blacks and Asians comprised 7.6% and 7.0% of the City of Austin population, respectively. The percentage of the City of Austin and Travis County populations who are foreign born is 18.4% and 17.8% respectively. These percentages are slightly higher compared with the Texas population ( 16.9%) and the United States population (13.5%). Spanish is spoken at home for about 24% of the populations five years of age and older in the City of Austin a nd Travis County compared with 29.5% of the population five years of age and older in Texas. Table 1.2 shows aspects of educational attainment and poverty level for populations of Austin, Travis County and Texas.

Differences in leading causes of death demonstrate the underlying health disparities that exist within the county. Un derstanding of the leading causes of death is critical to helping focus prevention efforts. Many of the rates provided in the following graphs have been age -adjusted to prevent the influence of the underlying age distribution of the county's population. Mortality In Travis County in 2017, there were a total of 5,656 deaths. Cancer and heart disease are the top two leading causes of death for Travis County as shown in Figure 2.1. In 2017, cancer accounted for 21.0% of total deaths and heart disease for 18.6%. These values differ from Tex as as a whole where heart disease is the leading cause of death followed by cancer and cerebrovascular disease. Compared to data from 2015, Alzheimer's has surpassed chronic lower respiratory diseases to be the fifth leading cause of death for Travis County. Figure 2.1.

Additionally, Blacks have an 84.2% increased rate of mortality due to heart disease compared to Hispanics. As shown in Figure 2.2 when compared to W hites and Hispanics, B lacks also had much higher rates of cerebrovascular disease. For W hites the third leading cause of death is accidents w hile for B lacks and Hispanics the third leading cause is cerebrovascular disease. Suicide is within the top leading causes of death for W hites but not for Blacks nor for Hispanics. Figure 2.2. Age -Adjusted Mortality Rates per 100,000 Population for Lead ing Causes of Death by Race/Ethnicity, Travis County, 2015- 2017 Source: CDC WONDER Online Database , Age-Adjusted rates use 2000 standard population Figure 2.3 shows the mortality rates related to cancer and heart disease for various racial and ethnic groups for persons 35 to 64 years of age in Travis County. B lacks in Travis County have higher mortality rates from cancer and heart disease at younger ages tha n Whites or Hispanics. In the 35 -44 year age group, Bl acks have a mortality rate of 49.3 per 100,000 from heart disease (compared to 13.3 per 100,000 for W hites and a suppressed value for Hispanics ). Within the 45- 54 year age group, the cancer related mo rtality rate for B lacks (105.8) is nearly double the rate for W hites (63.2) or Hispanics (54.5) at the same age. Figure 2.4 shows a s the mortality rates related to cancer and heart disease for persons 64 to 85 years and older. Blacks consistently have higher rates of mortality from cancer and heart disease compared to Whites and Hispanics for these age groups. 0 50 100 150 200Chronic Lower Respiratory DiseaseDiabetesAlzheimer'sAccidentsCerebrovascular DiseaseHeart DiseaseCancer Rate per 100,000 White Hispanic Black 9 Figure 2.3.

When comparing only 2008 to 2017, mortality within each r acial /ethnic group has decreased however the percentage decrease varies by race. Blacks and Hispanics have had the largest percent decreases in mortality from 2008 to 2017 (18.2% and 25.1% respectively). Whites have h ad a smaller percentage decrease in mortality (10.4%) from 2008 to 2017. Figure 2.5. Age -Adjusted All -Cause Mortality Rates by Race/Ethnicity, Travis County, 2008- 2017 Age-Adjusted rates use 2000 standard population Source: CDC WONDER Online Database Figure 2.6 shows how morality trends have changed in Travis County over the past ten years. While cancer and heart disease remain the leading causes of mortality, there has been a decrease in mortality rates from both of these diseases over time. There has also been a slight but steady increase in Alzheimer's related mortality over the past ten years from 23.9 in 2008 to 32.6 in 2017. While cancer, heart disease, accidents, and cerebrovascular disease persist across this ten -year period as top leading c auses of death, the fifth leading causes have fluctuated between chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's, and suicide. Figure 2.7 shows how mortality patterns of selected diseases have shifted over time. Since 2000 in Travis County, there have be en reductions in the percentage of deaths related to heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. At the same time, there has been a slight percentage increase in deaths attributed to Alzheimer's , accidents and suicides . 01002003004005006007008009001,000 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Rate per 100,000 YearBlack Hispanic Total White 11 Figure 2.6.

In 2016, there were 3,886 newly diagnosed cancer cases and 1,147 total cancer related mortalities in Travis County. Cancer exists in a variety of different types, many of which can be screened for or prevented. Cancer leads to abnormal cell growth which can spread to other parts of the body and be harmful to bodily systems. 1 Figure 3.1 shows the trend in age -adjusted mortality rates for selected cancers within Travis County. The overall highest rates of cancer mortality are attributable to lung and bronchus cancers. Although lung and bronchus cancers have the highest rates of mortality in Travis County, the mortality related t o these types of cancers has decreased 40% from 2002 to 2016. Additionally, there has been a slight decline in mortality related to breast cancer over the 15 -year period. In comparison to mortality rates from 2002, mortality related to all of these leadi ng types of cancer has declined. As of 2016, Travis County is experiencing fewer deaths from each of these types of cancers compared to data collected from 2002. Figure 3.1. Age -Adjusted Cancer Mortality Rates, Travis County, 2002- 2016 Age-adjusted ra tes use a US 2000 standard population Source: Texas Cancer Registry Cancer Mortality Figures 3.2 and 3.3 examine the incidence rates and the mortality rates of certain common types of cancer. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of cancer within a certain time period while morality refers to the number of deaths attributable to a certain type of ca ncer. In Travis County, prostate cancer and breast cancer have the highest rates of new cases over time. While there is higher incidence of prostate and breast cancer, these types of cancers have 1 https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/index.htm 05101520253035404550 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate per 100,000 Year Breast Colon and Rectum Lung and Bronchus Pancreas Prostate 13 slightly lower rates of associated mortality. Similarly, lung and bronchus cancers have lower incidence rates but much higher rates of mortality. Uterine cancer may have high incidence but is not a leading contributor to cancer related mortality. A type of cancer may have high incidence but lower mortality due to the availability of screening tests and treatment methods to manage that type of cancer and prevent mortality. Figure 3.2.

Regardless of sex , Blacks in Travis county experience higher rates of cance r related mortality compared with W hites or Hispanics. White females have the lowest cancer related mortality overall followed by Hispanic females. Black males have more than two times the cancer related mortality as W hite females .

Heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and heart failure are all classified into the category of cardiovascular disease. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillanc e System (BRFSS) survey captures information related to cardiovascular diseases in a number of ways. Participants are randomly selected within Travis County and Texas to participate in the survey and provide a snapshot of health for Travis County and Texa s as a whole. Within the survey data, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is calculated to include any person who has been diagnosed by a doctor as having had a heart attack, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart diseases, or a stroke. Data was combined from 2014- 2018 to provide a larger sample size. Figure 4.1 shows that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in both Texas and in Travis County has increased from 2014 compared to 2018. While the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Travis County is lower than that of Texas, from 2014 to 2018 the prevalence for Travis County has increased over 50%. The prevalence in Texas has increased 17% during the same time period. Figur e 4.1. Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence among Adults, Travis County and Texas, 2014- 2018 Source: Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2014 -2018 Table 4.1 summarizes select demographic characteristics for cardiovascular disease in Travis County and Texas. In general, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Travis County adults is lower compared with adults in Texas. For both Travis County and Texas, higher prevalence is 012345678910 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Percent Year Texas Travis 17 seen with increased age. Employed individuals have lower prevalence . Prevalence decreases as education level in creases. Additionally, with increasing household income, there is a decrease in prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Table 4.1.

In the last 20 years the number of adults with diabetes has double d. Diabetes inhibits the body's ability to create or use insulin, a hormone which helps to regulate blood sugar levels. The disease presents in two different types: with type 1, the body does not make insulin at all, while in type 2 the body creates insulin but does not use it efficiently enough to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is more commonly seen in adults and can be delayed or prevented through lifestyle modifications . Complications from diabetes can lead to other disorders such as heart and kidney disease. While there is not a cure for diabetes, treatment is available to help manage the disease . 2 Data on diabetes prevalence was available from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey . To account for smaller sample sizes, data was combined from 2014- 2018 to provide better estimates of diabetes prevalence locally. T he examined prevalence data is self - reported survey data that asks participants if a doctor has ever told them they have diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes were excluded from the data for Texas and Travis County. Survey data is intended to serve a s estimates of the total population. Diabetes prevalence in Travis County and Texas is shown in Figure 4.2. Texas overall has a higher prevalence of diabetes in comparison to Travis County. In Texas, prevalence increased from 11.0% in 2014 to 12.6% in 2018. In comparison, Travis County had a prevalence of 7.2% in 2014 and a prevalence of 9.2% in 2018. Prevalence in Travis County peaked at 10.4% in 2016 and decreased the following two years. Figure 4.2.

Higher prevalence exists in those 65 years of age and older . The table also shows higher prevalence of diabetes in individuals with lower education levels, those who are unemployed, and those who ma ke less than $25,000 annually. Certain demographic and socioeconomic factors put individuals at an increased risk for diabetes. 0246810121416 Black Hispanic WhitePercent Race/Ethnicity 20 Table 4.2.

Overall, the life expectancy for people who smoke is at least 10 years shorter and the mortality rate is three times higher compared to those who d o not smoke. 3 Tobacco use also leads to increased risk of developing chronic disease such as cancer and respiratory disease. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey assesses tobacco use across Texas. The survey examines the use o f cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and smokeless tobacco. Survey participants are asked to report their smoking status into one of four categories: everyday use, occasional use, former smoker, or never used. Data from BRFSS was co mbined for years 2014- 2018 to provide a larger sample size. The BRFSS defines a current smoker as a person who smokes every day or some days or has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. In Travis County from 2014- 2018, 12.4% of people identif y as current smokers and 34.9% have tried smoking in their lifetime .

Ever smoker is defined as a current smoker (every day or some days) or a former smoker. 23 In years past, Travis County has had a lower prevalence of current smokers than Texas as shown in Figure 5.1. However, in 2016 the current smoker prevalence in Travis County equaled that of Texas. From 2016- 2017 there was a decrease in the pr evalence of current smokers which has since continued to increase. When compared to 2011, current smoker prevalence in Travis County has decreased from 16.3% to 11.7% as of 2018.

BRFSS incorporated data related to ENDS use in Texas in 2016 and 2017. The data for these two years shows that in Travis County 22.5% of individuals reported ever having used an ENDS device and 8.3% reported current use. These numbers were nearly equal to those for Texas as a whole at 22.2% and 7.3% respectively. The use of ENDS in Texas has a higher prevalence among W hite, non- Hispanic males. Individuals with some college or a college degree have higher prevalence of use of these products in addition to people within the 18-44 age group. 0510152025 Less than High School High School Graduate Some College College GraduatePercent Education Level Texas Travis County 25 Obesity Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation tool used to classify a person's weight into various categories of health. When a person's BMI exceeds a recommended healthy level, that person's weight may meet the classification of overweight or obese. Obesity can lead to a variety of health problems such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cer tain types of cancer. 4 Data from the Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was combined for years 2014- 2018 to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity for Travis County. The survey takes self -reported height and weight data to calculate BMI which s erves as a measure to determine obesity. Figure 5.3 shows the prevalence of obesity in adults in Travis County and Texas. Obesity prevalence is lower for Travis County adults compared with adults in Texas . However, obesity prevalence in Travis County has increased from 20.5% in 2014 to 29.5% in 2018. Figure 5.3.

BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. There is not sufficient data to present demographic characteristics for an underweight group. Within Travis County, 34.2% of residents meet the classification of overweight and 25.0% classify as obese. From 2014- 2016, the overweight prevalence for Travis County and for Texas were relatively equal. From 2016- 2017 the overweight prevalence for Trav is County decreased from 34.8% to 30.5% but then increased slightly again the following year. 27 Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the relationship between obesity and age group and education level.

This section presents birth and infant mortality data for a variety of maternal and infant characteristics. The data provides an understanding of the relationships between risk factors and infant mortality. However, it is also important to note that women with one risk factor will often also have additional risk factors. Prenatal Care During 2010 through 2016, women from Travis County gave birth to 15,494 to 16,386 babies annually. Late initiation of prenatal care or no prenatal care, both of which are often related to a mother's ability to access medical care, is an important risk fac tor for infant mortality . As noted in Table 6.1, about a quarter of births in Travis County are with no or late prenatal care. Typically, Black and Hispanic mothers are twice as likely to have late or not prenatal care compared with White mothers). In T ravis County, about a third of all Hispanic and Black infants were born to mothers with late or no prenatal care. Table 6.1.

Percent calculated for \"Late or No Prenatal Care\" is based on the total number of births. 30 Preterm Births A baby born before 37 weeks of gestation is considered preterm . Preterm babies are at higher risk of disability and death. The causes of preterm births remain poorly understood. Behavioral, medical, social, personal and economic conditions may affect a woman's risk of preterm birth. 5 In Travis County, the annual pe rcentage of premature births has been fairly consistent (10% to 11%) from 20 10 to 2016. Premature births are more likely for Black mothers as noted in Table 6.2 and shown in Figure 6.1. Table 6.2.

Prenatal Risk Factors by Race/Ethnicity, Travis County, 2010- 2016 Source: Center for Health Statistics, Texas Department of State Health Services Infant Mortality The death of a baby before his or her first birthday is called infant mortality. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. In general, the infant mortality is considered a summary measure of the health of a population, and the differential between infant mortality rates for babies born to White and Black mothers in the United States has been a focal point in public health for many years. Infant mortality rates for Travis County, Texas and the United States are shown in Figure 6.2. The infant mortality rate in Travis County has been lower than either Texas or the national rate from 2000 through 2016. Over the 17- year period , the Travis County rate has varied between 3.8 and 6.4 deaths per 1,000 live births with the changes in the rate from year to year , but overall has been decreasing during the last 10 years . 051015202530354045 Prematurity (<37 weeks gestation)Late or No Prenatal Care Low Birth WeightPercentage White Black Hispanic 32 Figure 6.2.

In the United States, HIV is most commonly transmitted from person to person through unprotected anal or vaginal sex and through needle and syringe use . Less commonly, t ransmission also can occur through transfusion of blood or its components from infected persons. In addition, a mother can pass HIV to her baby during pregnancy, during labor, or through breastfeeding. HIV infection is diagnosed by testing blood or saliva for antibodies to the virus or by directly testing for the presence of the virus. HIV weakens a person's immune system leading to immunodeficiency ; that is, th e immune system is deficien t in its ability to fight disease and infection . Acquired immunodeficiency s yndrome (AIDS) is the late stage of infection with HIV. The time from HIV infection to the development of AIDS is extremely variable ranging from less than one year to over 15 years. No vaccine or effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the medicine used to treat HIV. ART can prolong the lives of many people infected with HIV, keep them healthy, and greatly lower their chance of infecting others. 8 Today, more options than ever are available to prevent HIV. Using condoms correctly every time you have sex, limiting your number of sexual partners, never sharing needles, and taking advantage of highly effective medicines such as pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post - exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can reduce the risk of HIV infection . PEP is used after a perso n is potentially exposed to HIV, while PrEP is daily pill taken to prevent HIV for those at high risk for becoming infected with HIV. 8 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate s that 1,122,900 adults and adolescents were living with HIV at the end of 2015. Of those, 162,500 (15%) had not received a diagnosis. While HIV can affect anyone, certain groups are at higher risk due to particular risk factors. In 2017, 38,739 people received an HIV diagnosis in the US. The annual number of new HIV diagnoses remained stable between 2012 and 2016 in the United States (US) and dependent areas. However, annual new diagnoses have increased among some groups. In the United States, African Americans experience a high est burden of HIV compared with other races and ethnicities. Additionally , gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are considered most at risk of HIV infection. In 2015 young MSM, aged 13- 24, accounted for the majority of new HIV diagnoses, with young African American MSM affected even more severely. 9 Table 7.1 shows the number of new HIV and AIDS cases repor ted in Travis County during 2009 through 2018. The annual number of new HIV diagnoses ranged from 191 to 295. In 2015, the majority of new diagnoses were male (89.1%). The age group of 25- 34 years old was the most impacted (40.3%), followed by the age group between 15- 24 years old (23.4%). Additionally, most cases identified as Hispanic (42.4%), followed by White (32.2%), and then Black (16.3%). 8 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/inde x.html 9 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html 36 The number of cases of AIDS are those who were diagnosed in that year regardless of whether they were previously diagnosed as HIV only or if they were newly diagnosed and had already met the AIDS case definition.

Chlamydia could be easily treated with antibiotics. 10 In 2018, a total of 145,874 Chlamydia cases were reported in Texas.11 Since 2008, the annual number of cases in Travis County has increased from 5,471 to 9,028. Table 8.1 shows the number of reported Chlamydia cases i n Travis County in 2018 by sex and race/ethnicity. For those with known race/ethnic ity, Hispanics comprise about a third (29.7%) of the cases, with females representing more than half (57.9 %). Table 8.1.

Infections due to gonorrhea, like chlamydia, are a major cause of pelvic inflammatory disease. Additionally, studies have shown gonococcal infections facilitate the transmission of HIV infection. 12 Transmission occurs through contact with discharges from mucous membranes of infected persons. The clinical illness differs between males and females. In males, gonococcal infection presents as a discharge from the urethra with dysuria or painful urination within two- seven days after exposure. In females, infection is followed by the development of mucopurulent cervicitis. The cervicitis is usually as ymptomatic. Gonorrhea is effectively treated with antibiotics. 12 In 2018, a total of 46,958 gonorrhea cases were reported in Texas. In 2018, a total of 3,420 gonorrhea cases were reported in Travis County. Table 8.2 presents the number of gonorrhea cases reported in 2018 by sex and race/ethnicity. A majority (72.7%) of cases were males. For males with a known ra ce/ethnicity, Hispanics and Whites comprised more than half of the cases, with 28.6% and 27.9% of the cases respectively . Table 8.2.

Syphilis in adults is categorized into four clinical stages. These stages are primary, secondary, latent, and late or tertiary syphilis. The primary stage is characterized by a single or multiple lesions or ulcers at the location where Treponema pallidum entered the body. Without treatment, the lesions may last several weeks. Secondary syphilis occurs several weeks or months after the primary stage. The secondary stage is characterized by a rash. Other signs and symptoms of this stage include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, and muscle aches. Latent or hidden syphilis is typically without symptoms of disease. Tertiary syphilis occurs several years after the primary stage. Tertiary syphilis is associated with damage to the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and bones. Syphilis is spread by direct contact with sores during sexual contact. Transplacental infection of the fetus occurs during pregnancy with an infected woman. Syphilis is curable with the right antibiotics from your health care provider. However, certain damage due to the infection can be permanent.13 In 2018, a total of 2,528 primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were reported in Texas.13 A total of 241 P&S syphilis cases were reported in Travis County that year. Table 8.3 shows the number of reported P&S syphilis cases reported in Travis County in 2018 by sex and age group. More than 90% of reported cases are males. More than half (56.4%) of the cases were between the ages of 15 to 34 years. In 2018, incidence rates per 100,000 population for males (35.2) was 17 time s higher compared with females (3.6). Comparing 2015 and 2018 rates, both rates for males and females increased, the first one about 175% (12.7 vs. 35.2) while the rate for females increased more than 100% (1.6 vs. 3.6). Table 8.3.

The bacteria most often affect the l ungs, but TB bacteria can affect any part of the body such as bones and the brain . Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB -related exist: and preventable, but if not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. When TB bacteria live in the body without making you sick, it is called LTBI. In most people who breathe in TB bacteria and become infected, the body is able to fight the bacteria to stop them from growing. People with latent TB infection do not feel sick. People with LTBI cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However , those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition, diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of progressing to active TB disease. 15 People with TB disease are sick. They also may be able to spread the bacteria to people they spend time with every day.15 Figure 9.1 shows the number of active TB cases and incidence rates for Travis County from 2006 through 2017. In 2017, there were 35 TB cases in Travis County, a decrease of 59% from 2015 and an incidence rate decrease of 58.0%. Figure 9.1.

The virus causes a blister -like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, and people with weakened immune systems. It also can be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters. During 2016- 2018, the annual number of reported chickenpox cases ranged from 53 to 69 in Travis County. Figure 10.1 shows the annual incidence rates for chickenpox, pertussis, and invasive pneumococcal disease for 2010- 2018. Since 2010, the incidence rate for pertussis has shown the greatest decrease compared with chickenpox and invasive pneumococcal diseases. In 2018, the incidence rates for these three diseases ranged from 5.0 to 7.0. 52 Figure 10.1.

Pertussis begins with cold- like symptoms then progresses to severe coughing or coughing fits over several weeks. In infants the cough may be minimal or absent, but they may develop apnea, or pause in their breathing pattern. Pertussis can cause serious illness in infants, children and adults. Incidence rates for pertussis are highest in children less than one year of age. In 2010, 905 pertussis cases were reported in Travis County. Since 2015, the annual number of reported cases has been less than 200. During 20 16 through 2018, t he annual number of pertussis cases in Travis County ranged from 69 to 96 (Table 10.1) . Pertussis was identified more frequently in children (Figure 10.2) . In the past, the pattern for Texas was cyclical and peaked every 3 to 5 years. 17 17 https:/www.dshs.texas.gov/idcu/diseases/pertussis/ 0102030405060708090 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Rate per 100,000 Year Chickenpox (Varicella) Pertussis Pneumococcal disease, invasive 53 Figure 10.2.

From 2010 to 2018, the incidence rate of varicella has decrease 60% (Figure 10.1). Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, or pneumococcus, can cause many types of illnesses. These illnesses include pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia or blood stream infections. Persons less than two years of age and those 65 years of age and older have t he highest rates of disease. In 2018, 82 cases of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections or invasive pneumococcal disease were reported in Travis County, the majority of those cases were identified in adults aged 40 years or old er (Figure 10.2). 010203040506070 Chickenpox (Varicella) Pertussis Pneumococcal disease, invasiveNumber of Cases Disease 0-19 years 20-39 years 40 years 54 11.0 Foodborne Diseases Foodborne disease is a term used to collectively describe illnesses resulting from the consumption of contaminated foods. These diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins produced by these organisms. Contamination may occur during food production and preparation via inadequate sanitization, improper food handling, or holding food items at inadequate temperatures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that one in six Americans, approximately 48 million people , have a foodborne illness each year. 18 Table 1 1.1 shows the number of cases of various foodborne diseases reported in Travis County from 2016 through 2018 and reported in Texas for 2018.

Foodborne botulism and listeriosis are rarely reported in Travis County. The most common foodborne diseases reported in Travis County and Texas were salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and shigellosis. All three diseases are caused by bacteria and result in a self - limiting diar rheal illness; however, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Figure 1 1.1. Number of Selected Foodborne Diseases by Age Group , Travis County, 2018 Source: Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit, Austin Public Health - National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Commonly associated with consumption of contaminated food or water, or contact with infected animals, salmonellosis has been associated with many food items and animal exposures over the past several years. Nationally, salmonellosis is identified more frequently in children 3 which is also the case in Travis County. From 200 to 300 salmonellosis cases are reported annually in Travis County (Fi gure 11 .2). Nationally the number of salmonellosis cases have increased 13.1% from 2007 to 2017.19 Campylobacteriosis is usually associated with eating raw or undercooked p oultry, raw milk dairy products, contaminated produce and drinking water. Figure 11.1 shows that campylobacteriosis does not vary by age group in Travis County; however, this is different from national trends which indicate higher risk among children. 20 Travis County has seen an increase in the number of campylobacteriosis cases reported annually from 2008 to 2018 ( Figure 11.2) . 19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC 20-39 years 40 years 56 Figure 11.2.

Travis County has seen a significant decrease in shigellosis cases from 2015 to 2018 as shown i n Figure 11.2. This is similar to national trends which have shown a decrease from 2015 to 2017. 20 21 https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/general -information.html 050100150200250300350400450500 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Number of Cases Year Campylobacteriosis Salmonellosis Shigellosis 57 borne Disease s The term \"v ectorborne disease\" is commonly used to describe a disease transmitted to people by blood- sucking arthropods. The arthropods that most commonly serve as vectors of infectious agents include mosquitoes , fleas, and arachnids such as mites and ticks. The arthropod typically becomes infected with an infectious agen t while feeding on infected vertebrates (e.g., birds, rodents, other larger animals, or humans) . For almost all vectorborne diseases , the infectious agent must infect and multiply inside the arthropod before the arthropod is able to transmit the disease t hrough its salivary glands. The most common vectorborne diseases in Texas and Travis County are carried by mosquitoes and fleas. Table 12.1 shows the number of cases of various vectorborne diseases reported in Travis County for 20 16 through 2018. The most commonly reported vector borne disease in Travis County is murine typhus , which is an infection c aused by a flea- borne bacteria named Rickettsia typhi. These bacteria are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected flea or by inoculation with flea feces containing Rickettsia typhi. During 2016- 2018, 69 murine typhus cases were reported. Travis County experienced an outbreak of West Nile virus (WNv) in 2012, with a total of 153 cases. Since then, only a few West Nile virus cases have been reported each year in Travis County.

These three diseases are primarily associated with travel to endemic areas outside the United States. The y are reported infrequently in Travis County. Other vectorborne diseases that are reported in Texas include Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, plague, and tularemia. These diseases are rarely reported in Travis County although in 2015 one case of Chagas' disease and one case of leishmaniasis were reported in Travis County. 58 13.0 Unintentional Injury (\"Accidents\") Unintentional in juries - falls, motor vehicle crashes, poisonings, drownings, and other events sometimes called \"accidents\" - are a leading cause of death in Travis County. In Travis County, unintentional injuries are: The number one killer of residents aged 1 -44 years (~ 66% of the county population) The third leading cause of death for all ages The biggest killer of children Responsible for the death s of nearly 500 residents per year Only cancer and heart disease take more lives than unintentional injuries. As shown in Figure 13.1, the number of deaths due to unintentional injuries has increased in the last decade. The number of deaths ranged from a low of 320 in 2008 to a high of 488 in 2014; over 4,000 deaths due to unintentional injuries occurred during this 10- year period. Figure 13.1.

However, for Travis County as a whole the top three causes of unintentional injur y deaths are motor vehicle crash, poisoning, and fall. Figure 13.4 shows the trend of these top three causes in Travis County between 2008 and 2017. Each of these unintentional injury causes killed more than 1,000 residents during that 10- year period. Figure 13.4. Top Three Causes of Unintentional Injury Deaths, Travis County, 2008- 2017 Source: CDC and NCHS. CDC WONDER Since 2008, the number of deaths resulting from falls and poisonings has generally increased and the number of deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes has generally remained constant. In 2017, the rank order of unintentional injury deaths was related to falls (153 deaths), poisonings (132 deaths), and motor vehicles (115 deaths). Those adults older than 75 years of age have the highest mortality rate from unintentional falls. As Figure 13.5 shows, the mortality rate increases with age, with those 85 years and older having the highest deaths rates. The unintentional fall injury mortality rate for those 85 years and older nearly doubled between 2008 and 2017 ( 364 to 649 per 100,000 population, respectively). 020406080100120140160180 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Number of Deaths Year Motor Vehicle Fall Poisoning 61 Figure 13.5.

A mortality rate statistically modified to eliminate the effect of different age distributions in the different populations. BMI. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. BMI Categories: Underweight = <18.5; Normal weight = 18.5-24.9 ; Overweight = 25-29.9 ; Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater BRFSS. Behavioral Ris k Factor Surveillance System. The BRFSS is an on -going data collection program designed to measure behavioral risk factors in the U.S. adult, noninstitutionalized, civilian population. The objective of the BRFSS is to collect uniform, state -specific data o n preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases. Data are collected from a random sample of adults (one per household) through a telephone survey. Case. In epidemiology, a countable instance in the population or study group of a particular disease, health disorder, or condition under investigation. Sometimes, an individual with the particular disease. Crude mortality rate. A mortality rate without adjustment. Demograph ic information. The ``person'' characteristics --age, sex, race, and occupation--of descriptive epidemiology used to characterize the populations at risk. Ethnicity. The classification of a person's ethnicity, i.e. Hispanic or non- Hispanic, is generally derived from how the person self -reported when asked. Hispanic. Refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. Health. A state of complete physical, mental, and soci al well -being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Health indicator. A measure that reflects, or indicates, the state of health of persons in a defined population, e.g., the infant mortality rate. Incidence rate. A measure of the frequency with which an event, such as a new case of illness, occurs in a population over a period of time. The denominator is the population at risk; the numerator is the number of new cases occurring during a given time period. Low birth weight . A birthweight less than 5.5 pounds (2500 grams). Low birth weight is the single most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and is a determinant of post- neonatal mortality. MMW R. The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a weekly scientific publication prepared and published by the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). MMWR contains data and reports on specific health and safety topics. The data are on specific diseases as reported 67 by state and territorial health departments.

The infant mortality rate is usually expressed per 1,0 00 live births. Prematurity/Premature birth. It is a birth that is at least three weeks before a baby's due date. It is also known as preterm birth (or less than 37 weeks \u2014 full term is 40 weeks). Population. The total number of inhabitants of a given area or country. In sampling, the population may refer to the units from which the sample is drawn, not necessarily the total population of people. Prevalence. The number or proportion of cases or events or conditions in a given population. Race. Th e classification of a person's race is generally derived from how the person self - reported when asked. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. Black. A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.

An expression of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population. Risk factor. An aspect of personal behavior or lifestyle, an environmental exposure, or an inborn or inherited characteristic that is associated with an increased occurrence of disease or other health -related event or condition. Surveillance. The systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health data on an ongoing basis, to gain knowledge of the pattern of disease occurrence and potential in a community, in order to control and prevent disease in the community. Trend. A long- term movement or change in frequency, usually upwards or downwards. 68 Appendix A.
