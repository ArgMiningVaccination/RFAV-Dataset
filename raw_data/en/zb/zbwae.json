The balance is maintained by the sensations in the nervous system that regulate hormonal and enzymatic digestive processes. A three-part series by Dennis Klocek will explore this relationship from the point of view of temperamental patterns in the life organs, the digestive organs and the qualitative influence of the daily sense activity on overall health. Part 1 The first session will survey the liver, lung, kidney and heart in the context of the four temperaments of cold, moist, hot and dry. The focus will be on polarities in water soluble digestive processes in human nutrition. Part 2 The second session will address the relationships between protein, nitrogen and pathogens from the point of view of the mandala of the four temperaments. The focus will be on herb combinations that are useful for enhancing healthy membrane perfusion between the cells and the blood. Part 3 The third session will explore inner exercises based on a seasonal mandala of the four temperaments. Understanding seasons provides insight into the diurnal digestive rhythms of the liver. Imaginations of earth and sun rhythms can be used to create seasonal harvest and processing schedules. They also provide blueprints for crafting digestive aids that can be made in the kitchen from plants. Dennis Klocek, MFA, is Co-founder of the Coros Institute and founder of Consciousness Studies at Rudolf Steiner College. He is the author of many books including the newly released, Esoteric Physiology and also Sacred Agriculture: The Alchemy of Biodynamics. Dennis is known as an international lecturer. "}
