A biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain is recommended which combines pharmacological interventions with behavioural and non-pharmacological treatments. Acupuncture represents one of a number of non-pharmacological interventions for pain. In the current climate of difficult commissioning decisions and constantly changing national guidance, the quest for strong supporting evidence has never been more important. Although hundreds of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses have been conducted, most have been inconclusive, and this has created uncertainty in clinical policy and practice. There is a need to bring all the evidence together for different pain conditions. The aim of this review is to synthesise SRs of RCTs evaluating the clinical efficacy of acupuncture to alleviate chronic pain and to consider the quality and adequacy of the evidence, including RCT design. Materials and Methods: Electronic databases were searched for English language SRs and meta-analyses on acupuncture for chronic pain. The SRs were scrutinised for methodology, risk of bias and judgement of efficacy. Results: A total of 177 reviews of acupuncture from 1989 to 2019 met our eligibility criteria. The majority of SRs found that RCTs of acupuncture had methodological shortcomings, including inadequate statistical power with a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity between RCTs was such that meta-analysis was often inappropriate. Conclusions: The large quantity of RCTs on acupuncture for chronic pain contained within systematic reviews provide evidence that is conflicting and inconclusive, due in part to recurring methodological shortcomings of RCTs. We suggest that an enriched enrolment with randomised withdrawal design may overcome some of these methodological shortcomings. It is essential that the quality of evidence is improved so that healthcare providers and commissioners can make informed choices on the interventions which can legitimately be provided to patients living with chronic pain.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-12-24", "cleaned_text": "Acupuncture for the Relief of Chronic Pain: A Synthesis of Systematic It has been estimated that 28 million adults in the UK (43%) are affected by chronic pain and that the pain of 7.9 million of these adults is moderately or severely limiting [ [2](#B2-medicina-56-00006)]. The prevalence of chronic pain is higher in older age groups, with an estimated 62% of people over 75 being affected [ [2](#B2-medicina-56-00006)]. Individuals living with pain often experience a very poor quality of life, it affects their ability to work, socialise, sleep and maintain good relationships and can lead to depressive illness, decreased motivation and a reduction in physical activity [ [3](#B3-medicina-56-00006)]. As such, chronic pain represents a major challenge for health service provision and government policy. [4](#B4-medicina-56-00006)]. Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as part of a comprehensive pain management programme, including lifestyle adjustments, pain education, and physical, psychological and complementary therapies. [5](#B5-medicina-56-00006), [6](#B6-medicina-56-00006)]. The unique identity of acupuncture lies in the process of inserting needles ('acu') in the skin ('puncture'), although a modern definition should include the need to do this at specific points in accordance with known physiological or anatomical rationale [ [7](#B7-medicina-56-00006)]. [8](#B8-medicina-56-00006)] with over one hundred systematic reviews (SRs) (some with meta-analyses) attempting to synthesise available evidence. Many SRs of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture have been inconclusive and this has created uncertainty in clinical policy and practice. This uncertainty was highlighted in 2016 when the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reversed its 2009 recommendation to offer acupuncture as a first line treatment for non-specific, chronic low back pain because evidence indicated that it was no more effective than sham acupuncture [ [9](#B9-medicina-56-00006), [10](#B10-medicina-56-00006), [11](#B11-medicina-56-00006)]. Interestingly, there had been no significant change in evidence provided by RCTs between 2009 and 2016. Presently, NICE only recommends acupuncture as a prophylactic treatment for chronic tension-type headache and migraine [ [12](#B12-medicina-56-00006), [13](#B13-medicina-56-00006)]. [8](#B8-medicina-56-00006), [14](#B14-medicina-56-00006)]. One reason for this uncertainty may be related to the clinical research methodologies used to determine clinical efficacy. [15](#B15-medicina-56-00006)]. Practitioners and policy makers may feel overwhelmed by the volume of SRs on acupuncture, suggesting a need to bring all this evidence together. In doing so, there is an opportunity to appraise RCT design and whether it is fit for purpose. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Inclusion Criteria 2.2. Exclusion Criteria 2.3. Evidence Synthesis [16](#B16-medicina-56-00006), [17](#B17-medicina-56-00006)] and adopted by the Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care group from Cochrane Collaboration in their risk of bias assessment. They suggest that trial arms with fewer than 200 participants in RCTs or fewer than 500 participants in meta-analyses are at a high risk of bias, which seriously undermines confidence in findings. Thus, reviews were categorized as meeting our criteria for adequacy if they contained a pooled analysis of 500 events or at least one RCT with >200 participants in each arm of the trial. We categorised efficacy as: Sufficient evidence and in favour of acupuncture (+), sufficient evidence in favour of control/placebo (), sufficient evidence but conflicting/inconclusive (=) and insufficient evidence to make a judgement (?). We also noted statements within manuscripts about RCT methodology across the following themes: - The nature of placebo/sham interventions. - Quality and risk of bias (including blinding). - Sample size in relation to treatment effect. We used criteria developed by Dechartres [ [18](#B18-medicina-56-00006)] when commenting on adequacy of sample size as: adequately powered (200 patients per treatment arm), moderately powered (100-199 patients per treatment arm) and underpowered <100 patients per treatment arm). 3. Results [Table 1](#medicina-56-00006-t001)). There were two overviews of Cochrane reviews, ten overviews of non-Cochrane SRs and 145 non-Cochrane SRs. The earliest systematic reviews were published in 1989 by ter Riet [ [19](#B19-medicina-56-00006), [20](#B20-medicina-56-00006), [21](#B21-medicina-56-00006)]. There were 20 Cochrane SRs (including updates), with the earliest published in 2000 by Tulder et al. [ [22](#B22-medicina-56-00006)] and the most recent published in 2018 by Choi et al. [ [23](#B23-medicina-56-00006)]. Findings are presented according to the most frequent evaluations of acupuncture for different types of pain and described chronologically to provide a sense of the evolution of evidence over time. A statement of current clinical guidance from NICE is provided where available. 3.1. Chronic Pain Irrespective of Aetiology or Pathophysiology [24](#B24-medicina-56-00006)]. The first overview of SRs was published in 2006 and concluded that acupuncture was not shown to be efficacious for a variety of pain conditions [ [25](#B25-medicina-56-00006)]. [26](#B26-medicina-56-00006)]. Hopton et al. pooled data from eight meta-analyses of acupuncture for chronic pain and concluded that acupuncture was more effective than a placebo, despite an absence of statistical significance for individual conditions, except osteoarthritis of the knee and headache [ [27](#B27-medicina-56-00006)]. Two overviews published in 2011 concluded that there was tentative evidence that acupuncture might be effective for headache, peripheral joint osteoarthritis and neck pain (overview of eight Cochrane Reviews [ [28](#B28-medicina-56-00006)], overview of 57 SRs [ [29](#B29-medicina-56-00006)]), although reviewers agreed that the quality of the primary studies was poor, with a high risk of bias. [30](#B30-medicina-56-00006), [31](#B31-medicina-56-00006)]. Since then, SRs were generally inconclusive because of methodological shortcomings and small sample sizes in primary studies [ [32](#B32-medicina-56-00006), [33](#B33-medicina-56-00006), [34](#B34-medicina-56-00006), [35](#B35-medicina-56-00006), [36](#B36-medicina-56-00006)]. In 2018, Vickers et al. concluded that evidence supported the efficacy of acupuncture for various chronic pain conditions associated with musculoskeletal disorders, headache and osteoarthritis, with beneficial effects persisting at long-term follow-up (39 RCTs, [ [37](#B37-medicina-56-00006)]). The long-term effects of acupuncture were consistent with evidence from an earlier SR by MacPherson et al. [ [38](#B38-medicina-56-00006)]. 3.2. Headache (Including Migraine) [28](#B28-medicina-56-00006)] (described above) that claimed there to be evidence that acupuncture was effective for tension-type headache (1 Cochrane review [ [45](#B45-medicina-56-00006)]) and migraine review and cervicogenic headache (8 RCTs [ [47](#B47-medicina-56-00006)]). A similar pattern of 'promising' but not definitive evidence continued through the next decade (27 RCTs [ [53](#B53-medicina-56-00006)]; 8 RCTs [ [46](#B46-medicina-56-00006)]), including a Cochrane review of 26 RCTs of acupuncture for idiopathic headache [ [52](#B52-medicina-56-00006)]. Nevertheless, some reviewers have claimed that there is evidence that acupuncture is superior to sham for chronic headache (31 RCTs, only 2 RCTs were of high quality and adequately powered, Sun [ [48](#B48-medicina-56-00006)]), and a recent Cochrane review providing evidence of superiority of acupuncture over placebo for the prevention of tension-type headache ([ [44](#B44-medicina-56-00006)] 12 RCTs, including two adequately powered RCTs) and episodic migraine ([ [49](#B49-medicina-56-00006)], 22 RCTs, including two adequately powered RCTs). A systematic review published in 2016 is consistent with the latter finding that acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture for migraine (10 RCTs [ [50](#B50-medicina-56-00006)]). [12](#B12-medicina-56-00006)]. 3.3. Osteoarthritis (OA) [28](#B28-medicina-56-00006)], judged there to be evidence that acupuncture produced short-term improvements in pain based on a SR of 16 RCTs on peripheral joint osteoarthritis [ [69](#B69-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2019, an overview of non-Cochrane SRs that included a meta-analysis concluded that acupuncture was beneficial for alleviating pain associated with OAK, although RCT outcomes assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) indicated that the SR evidence was of mixed quality (12 SRs [ [55](#B55-medicina-56-00006)]). [71](#B71-medicina-56-00006)]). SRs on acupuncture for peripheral joint OA were inconclusive in 2006 (18 RCTs [ [70](#B70-medicina-56-00006)]), superior to waiting list controls in 2010 ([ [69](#B69-medicina-56-00006)], Cochrane review of 16 RCTs) and associated with reductions in pain intensity, improvement in functional mobility and quality of life in 2014 (12 RCTs [ [68](#B68-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2018, a Cochrane review by Manheimer et al. found little evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced pain associated with OA of the hip [ [67](#B67-medicina-56-00006)]. To date, the majority of SRs have evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for OA of the knee (OAK). [66](#B66-medicina-56-00006)]). Chronologically, SRs in 2002 (4 RCTs, [ [65](#B65-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2007 (11 RCTs [ [64](#B64-medicina-56-00006)]) were inconclusive, whereas a SR by Bjordal et al. in 2007 found statistically significant and clinically relevant short-term pain relief from two to four weeks of intensive electroacupuncture (7 RCTs [ [63](#B63-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2008 and 2012, two further SRs (10 RCTs [ [62](#B62-medicina-56-00006)]; 14 RCTs, [ [61](#B61-medicina-56-00006)] respectively) reported superiority over sham acupuncture. More recently, SRs in 2016 (10 RCTs [ [59](#B59-medicina-56-00006)]), 2017 (17 RCTs [ RCTs [ [57](#B57-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2019 (8 RCTs [ [56](#B56-medicina-56-00006)]) judged there to be evidence that acupuncture provides relief of pain associated with OAK when administered alone or in combination with other treatments. [60](#B60-medicina-56-00006)]), and judged there to be evidence of short-term efficacy. This finding was confirmed in another network meta-analysis published in 2018, which found that needle or electro-acupuncture decreased pain compared with other treatments (16 RCTs [ [57](#B57-medicina-56-00006)]). Nevertheless, reviewers consistently mitigate these positive findings by describing RCTs as having low methodological quality, thus reducing confidence in judgements. [67](#B67-medicina-56-00006)], although in contrast, evidence from non-Cochrane reviews suggests that there is moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture may be effective in the symptomatic relief of pain from OA of the knee. Why there should be a difference in evidence between the knee and the hip is not known. Interestingly, guidance from NICE (CG177) states: \"Do not offer acupuncture for the management of osteoarthritis\" Section 1.4.6. [ [198](#B198-medicina-56-00006)]. 3.4. Chronic Low Back Pain and/or Neck Pain [28](#B28-medicina-56-00006)] included one Cochrane review on low back pain [ [88](#B88-medicina-56-00006)] and judged there to be evidence that acupuncture might be an effective adjunctive intervention for low back pain. However, the quality of the primary studies was low. An overview of 16 SRs on acupuncture for low back pain published in 2015 judged that acupuncture either in isolation or as an adjunct to conventional treatment had short-term benefits but again, the quality of the included reviews was variable [ [78](#B78-medicina-56-00006)]. [19](#B19-medicina-56-00006)]) but the findings were inconclusive. The earliest SR that evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture specifically for chronic low back pain was published in 1998 by Ernst et al. (12 RCTs [ [94](#B94-medicina-56-00006)]), and found evidence that acupuncture was superior to various control interventions, but insufficient evidence to judge whether it was superior to placebo. The included studies were mostly of high-quality, but sample sizes were inadequate. In 2000, Smith et al. published a SR that found no evidence that acupuncture was effective for either chronic neck or low back pain (13 RCTs [ [99](#B99-medicina-56-00006)]). [93](#B93-medicina-56-00006)], 11 RCTs and 10 RCTs [ [90](#B90-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2010, Trigkilidas published a SR that evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for low back pain (4 RCTs [ [85](#B85-medicina-56-00006)]) that judged there to be evidence of superiority of acupuncture compared with usual care in treating chronic low back pain, especially when patients have positive expectations about the intervention. Between 2011 and 2017, none of the published SRs provided compelling evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture for chronic low back pain (2 RCTs [ [84](#B84-medicina-56-00006)], 7 RCTs [ [83](#B83-medicina-56-00006)], RCTs [77](#B77-medicina-56-00006)]), stenosis (12 studies, 6 RCTs [ [80](#B80-medicina-56-00006)]). [75](#B75-medicina-56-00006)]) and found evidence that dry needling was more effective for low back pain than conventional acupuncture or sham immediately post treatment, but at follow-up, was equal to acupuncture. In 2018, Tang et al. published a SR that evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for the relief of pain associated with lumbar disc herniation (30 RCTs [ [76](#B76-medicina-56-00006)]), which found insufficient robust evidence to draw firm conclusions because of methodological shortcomings in primary RCTs. However, there was tentative evidence that dry needling was more beneficial than lumbar traction, drug therapy or Chinese herbal medicine. In 2019, Xiang et al. published a SR on acupuncture for non-specific low back pain (14 RCTs [ [74](#B74-medicina-56-00006)]). There was moderate evidence of benefit but confidence in the results was diminished due to heterogeneity and small sample sizes in the included studies. [10](#B10-medicina-56-00006)]. This guidance produced much debate. Subsequently, NICE have updated guidance for the management of low back pain and sciatica in people over 16 (NG59) and currently recommend in Section 1.2.8 \"Do not offer acupuncture for managing low back pain with or without sciatica\", even though the evidence had not significantly changed [ [9](#B9-medicina-56-00006)]. 3.5. Myofascial Pain Syndrome and Myofascial Trigger Points [116](#B116-medicina-56-00006)]) and found no evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of any needling technique beyond placebo. In 2009, Tough et al. published a SR that evaluated the efficacy of dry needling acupuncture (7 RCTs [ [115](#B115-medicina-56-00006)]) which produced insufficient evidence to determine efficacy. A further systematic review by Tough et al. published in 2011 (3 RCTs [ [113](#B113-medicina-56-00006)]) had similar conclusions. In 2013, a SR found that acupuncture was superior to sham or placebo in reducing pain associated with upper quadrant myofascial pain immediately post-treatment and at four weeks, although the quality of the primary studies was low (12 RCTs [ [112](#B112-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2014, Ong and Claydon published a SR that evaluated the clinical efficacy of dry needling to alleviate pain associated with MTPs in the neck and shoulders (5 RCTs [ [111](#B111-medicina-56-00006)]) and found that there was no significant difference between dry needling and lidocaine. [106](#B106-medicina-56-00006)]) and found a possible short-term benefit following dry needling. In 2017, SRs have found tentative evidence that acupuncture alone or combined with other therapies improved outcomes associated with myofascial pain syndrome (10 RCTs [ [108](#B108-medicina-56-00006)]; 33 RCTs [ [107](#B107-medicina-56-00006)]), although substantial heterogeneity and a high risk of bias, including inadequate sample sizes in the primary RCTs, undermined confidence in the findings. 3.6. Cancer Pain [125](#B125-medicina-56-00006)], but only one systematic review on cancer-related pain [ [126](#B126-medicina-56-00006)]. We found that the earliest SR on acupuncture for pain associated with cancer and/or its treatment (7 studies with 3 RCTs [ [126](#B126-medicina-56-00006)]) concluded that there was evidence of efficacy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, but insufficient evidence to judge efficacy for cancer-related pain. In 2010, a SR of 7 RCTs provided tentative evidence that that acupuncture alleviated cancer-related pain [ [124](#B124-medicina-56-00006)], and in 2011, the first Cochrane review on acupuncture for cancer pain judged there to be insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy (3 RCTs [ [123](#B123-medicina-56-00006)]), and this was confirmed in an update in 2015 (5 RCTs [ [119](#B119-medicina-56-00006)]). Subsequently, non-Cochrane SRs in 2012 (15 RCTs [ [122](#B122-medicina-56-00006)]), 2013 (11 RCT [ [121](#B121-medicina-56-00006)]), 2014 (33 studies, 6 RCTs [ [120](#B120-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2016 (20 RCTs [ [120](#B120-medicina-56-00006)]) provide promising but inconclusive evidence of efficacy. In 2017, Chiu et al. published a Cochrane review that evaluated the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for cancer-related pain, which included treatment-related or surgery-related pain, and judged there to be evidence that acupuncture alleviated pain associated with malignancy (29 RCTs [ [117](#B117-medicina-56-00006)]), but there was a high risk of bias due to inadequate sample sizes. [199](#B199-medicina-56-00006)]. 3.7. Fibromyalgia [136](#B136-medicina-56-00006)]) and concluded that there was limited evidence supporting the use of acupuncture for fibromyalgia but this was based on only one high-quality study. Subsequently, SRs published in 2007 (5 RCTs [ [135](#B135-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2009 (6 RCTs [ [134](#B134-medicina-56-00006)]) concluded that acupuncture had no symptomatic benefit, and in 2010 were inconclusive (7 RCTs [ [133](#B133-medicina-56-00006)], and 25 studies, 12 RCTs [ [132](#B132-medicina-56-00006)] respectively). [131](#B131-medicina-56-00006)]) found low-quality evidence that acupuncture might be superior to no acupuncture or medication, and moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture was not superior to sham. Non-Cochrane SRs published in 2013 (16 RCTs [ [130](#B130-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2014 (9 RCTs [ [129](#B129-medicina-56-00006)]) were inconclusive. In 2019, two SRs have produced evidence that acupuncture was superior to sham but the evidence status was downgraded due to high levels of heterogeneity and inadequate sample sizes (10 RCTs [ [128](#B128-medicina-56-00006)]; 12 RCT [ [127](#B127-medicina-56-00006)]). 3.8. Pelvic Pain [138](#B138-medicina-56-00006)]). We found a number of SRs on acupuncture and associated therapies for primary dysmenorrhea, although all report a high-risk of bias leading to evidence that is inconclusive (30 RCTs [ [147](#B147-medicina-56-00006)]; 4 RCTs [ [146](#B146-medicina-56-00006)]; [ [142](#B142-medicina-56-00006)]; 60 RCTs [ [139](#B139-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2008, a SR investigating acupuncture for pelvic and back pain during pregnancy was inconclusive (3 RCTs [ [152](#B152-medicina-56-00006)]), and in 2010, a SR described RCTs findings as 'promising' but inconclusive for primary dysmenorrhea (27 RCTs [ [151](#B151-medicina-56-00006)]). A Cochrane review by Zhu et al. in 2011 on acupuncture for endometriosis included one low-quality RCT and was inconclusive [ [150](#B150-medicina-56-00006)]. A follow-up non-Cochrane review in 2017 including 10 RCTs still [ [143](#B143-medicina-56-00006)]. [149](#B149-medicina-56-00006)]; RCTs 4 RCTs [ [137](#B137-medicina-56-00006)]). [200](#B200-medicina-56-00006)] but this does not recommend any form of Chinese medicine for this type of pelvic pain, although acupuncture is not specifically mentioned. 3.9. Inflammatory Arthritis [153](#B153-medicina-56-00006)]). We found that the earliest SR on acupuncture for pain associated with inflammatory rheumatic diseases was published in 1997 and found insufficient high-quality evidence to make a judgement on efficacy. Subsequently, a Cochrane review published in 2005 (2 RCTs [ [159](#B159-medicina-56-00006)]) and various non-Cochrane SRs published in 2008 (8 RCTs [ [158](#B158-medicina-56-00006)]; 8 RCTs [ [157](#B157-medicina-56-00006)]), 2013 (10 RCTs [ [156](#B156-medicina-56-00006)]) and 2016 (28 RCTs [ [155](#B155-medicina-56-00006)]) have been inconclusive. The most recent SR on acupuncture for rheumatoid arthritis reported that RCT findings were tentatively positive but inconclusive (13 RCTs [ [154](#B154-medicina-56-00006)]). [201](#B201-medicina-56-00006)] for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but this does not recommend acupuncture. 3.10. Neuropathic Pain/Neuralgia [171](#B171-medicina-56-00006)]). [168](#B168-medicina-56-00006)]; various peripheral neuropathies, 15 studies, and diabetic peripheral 14 RCTs [ [164](#B164-medicina-56-00006)]). [170](#B170-medicina-56-00006)]; 33 RCTs [ [162](#B162-medicina-56-00006)]), two SRs on acupuncture for carpal tunnel syndrome (6 RCTs [ [169](#B169-medicina-56-00006)]; 12 RCTs [ [23](#B23-medicina-56-00006)]) and one SR on acupuncture for post-herpetic neuralgia (7 RCTs [ [165](#B165-medicina-56-00006)]). None were able to judge efficacy with any degree of confidence due to insufficient high-quality RCTs. [202](#B202-medicina-56-00006)] on the management of neuropathic pain, but acupuncture is not included in the list of recommended/not recommended treatments. 3.11. Other Pain Conditions [194](#B194-medicina-56-00006)]). In 2005, a Cochrane review found insufficient high-quality RCTs to judge the efficacy of acupuncture for shoulder pain. In 2011, a Cochrane review by Smith et al. found insufficient evidence to judge the efficacy of acupuncture or acupressure for labour pain (13 The high financial cost of continuing to undertake research that produces inconclusive evidence is of concern and demands reconsideration of the methodological design and delivery of future RCT design. We will discuss three common challenges to the design of RCTs of acupuncture that emerge from our evidence synthesis: adequate sample sizes, adequate acupuncture intervention, and adequate placebo controls. 4.1. The Challenge of Inadequate Sample Sizes [18](#B18-medicina-56-00006)] found that treatment effects were, on average, 48% larger in trials with fewer than 50 patients. Overestimation of treatment effects occurs in studies with sample sizes of 100-200 participants per treatment arm, suggesting that at least 200 participants per treatment arm is necessary to achieve a low risk of bias. Roberts [ [205](#B205-medicina-56-00006)] argued that the production of fewer but broader reviews that exclude underpowered trials would increase the validity of review findings and create a more trustworthy evidence base. Turner et al. [ [203](#B203-medicina-56-00006)] examined the distribution of statistical power within meta-analyses published as part of Cochrane reviews and argued that the results of meta-analyses that contain at least two adequately powered studies are not influenced to any significant degree when underpowered studies are omitted. At present, the inclusion of underpowered studies in meta-analyses is at the discretion of reviewers. [206](#B206-medicina-56-00006), [207](#B207-medicina-56-00006)]. There is a likelihood that scores of pain intensity produce U-shaped rather than bell-shaped distributions, with some participants experiencing large reductions in pain and others not. Thus, pain intensity data from acupuncture responders may be diluted by data from non-responders [ [208](#B208-medicina-56-00006)]. For this reason, the Pain and Palliative Support and Care group of the Cochrane collaboration recommends the use of primary outcome responder rates of participants reporting relief of 30% or greater (i.e., at least moderate pain relief) or 50% or greater (i.e., significant pain relief) expressed as frequency (dichotomous) data. 4.2. The Challenge of Appropriate Controls [209](#B209-medicina-56-00006), [210](#B210-medicina-56-00006)]. It has been argued that the reason why some RCTs fail to detect differences in treatment effects between real and sham acupuncture is that sham needling techniques are not physiologically inert, and this may have contributed to an underestimation of acupuncture effects in the evidence base [ [211](#B211-medicina-56-00006)]. This argument is valid but can be misleading if taken at face value. The purpose of a control intervention is not to be physiologically inert but rather to control for outcomes associated with non-specific effects of the act (theatre) of receiving the treatment. No placebo control (including a sham needling) is ever physiologically inert because it instigates changes in physiological (and psychological) state. The human body evolved to detect and respond to disturbances in the internal and/or external environment (i.e., stimuli) from physical, physiological, social and/or environmental change. This is the premise of homeostasis. [212](#B212-medicina-56-00006)]. [213](#B213-medicina-56-00006)]. 4.3. The Challenge of Adequacy of Dose [214](#B214-medicina-56-00006)]. Delivering identical acupuncture prescription to all participants runs the risk of some participants receiving sub-optimal dose. Often, acupuncture interventions used in RCTs are grounded in principles of Western acupuncture with flexibility to individualise treatment at the discretion of individual practitioners. Individualising acupuncture treatment increases between-subject variability in treatment (e.g., needling number, location, technique, duration). At face value, this may appear to conflict with classical RCT methodology that aims to standardise methodology and treatment intervention under strictly controlled conditions. However, standardisation can be based on the principles of optimising treatment per individual, as is the case when titrating drug dosage to therapeutic window. What constitutes adequacy of acupuncture technique and dose has been a matter of much debate [ [56](#B56-medicina-56-00006), [214](#B214-medicina-56-00006), [215](#B215-medicina-56-00006), [216](#B216-medicina-56-00006)]. [217](#B217-medicina-56-00006)] to encourage accurate reporting of the acupuncture intervention [ [218](#B218-medicina-56-00006)]. STRICTA recommend that six items should be included: rationale, details of needling (e.g., points used, depth, angle, needle thickness, number of needles), treatment regimen, co-intervention, practitioner background and control interventions [ [219](#B219-medicina-56-00006)]. The impact of using STRICTA has been positive with improvements in reporting quality of RCTs on acupuncture [ [220](#B220-medicina-56-00006), [221](#B221-medicina-56-00006), [222](#B222-medicina-56-00006), [223](#B223-medicina-56-00006)]. In 2008, White et al. published a meta-analysis that provided evidence that better outcomes in comparisons of acupuncture with non-acupuncture controls were achieved when noted that greater numbers of needles and treatment sessions were used [ [214](#B214-medicina-56-00006)]. In 2019, Sun et al. conducted a systematic review of eight RCTs (2106 participants) to determine whether the effect of acupuncture is dose-dependent for symptom management in knee osteoarthritis [ [56](#B56-medicina-56-00006)]. Sun et al. proposed a scoring system whereby +1 score was awarded if 9 points needled, if de qi was present, if 2 treatment sessions a week and if 8 treatment sessions in total. A score of 1 was awarded to each of these parameters if they were below these thresholds. The sum of scores was taken and high dosage categorised for total between 1 and 4, medium dosage for a score of 0 and low dosage for scores from 4 to 1. Sun et al. categorised one RCT as low dose, one RCT as medium dose and 6 RCTs as high dose and concluded that higher dosage of acupuncture was associated with better pain relief and functional improvements. It is becoming common for journal editors to require STRICTA in RCTs of acupuncture and this will improve comparison and assessment of adequacy of acupuncture dose in systematic reviews. What is less common, however, is the inclusion and reporting of 'run-in phases' in RCTs, whereby optimisation of technique and dosage is titrated over a period of weeks prior to randomisation into real and placebo acupuncture. 4.4. Design of Future Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTS) [224](#B224-medicina-56-00006)]. The potential for using such designs in the assessment of pharmacological agents has been recognised [ [225](#B225-medicina-56-00006)], although EERW designs are rarely used to assess non-pharmacological interventions. The EERW trials consist of (i) an observational 'open-label' phase with all participants receiving active treatment (acupuncture), during which treatment technique and dosage would be titrated and optimized, followed by (ii) a RCT phase, whereby participants who had potential for response were enrolled (i.e., an enriched sample) and randomised to receive either experimental (real needling) or control interventions (sham needling). Selection of participants for the enriched sample of the RCT is based on the findings from phase one and would exclude participants who did not wish to continue treatment or experienced non-manageable adverse events, although their data from phase one would be analysed. Trials with EERW designs increase sensitivity to detect treatment effects by enriching the sample of participants enrolling into the randomised controlled phase of the trial, thus reducing the need for large sample sizes [ [207](#B207-medicina-56-00006)]. 4.5.
