He sent me a jpeg copy of a short piece that was published (in Portuguese) in the April, 2012 issue of Scientific American Brasil. He was appalled that this appeared under the aegis of Scientific American, and so was I. He provided the translation which follows. Warning: this is painful. The Questioned Effectiveness of Homeopathy Application of this technique in agriculture shows recuperation of plants and environment. Homeopathy is known as an alternative treatment for human beings, but few people know about its utilization on animals, plants, soils, and water. This technique is the target of critiques regarding results and efficacy. One of them is about the \"placebo effect\" of its remedies, which do not contain any trace of the raw material used in its preparation. To answer this criticism, a clarification is necessary: homeopathy is not related to chemistry, but to quantum physics, because it works with energy, not with chemical compounds that can be qualified and quantified. The application of homeopathy techniques to agriculture is not recent, as most people might think. One of the first studies in this field dates back to the 20s, with the research on plants carried out by the couple Eugen and Lili Kolisko, based on the theories of Rudolf Steiner about biodynamic agriculture. Since then a lot of studies have been done in countries like France, India, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Cuba, Italy, South Africa, and Brazil. Here the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa, in Minas Gerais, is a pioneer in this field. One needn't be a health or environment specialist to realize that the conventional methods of treating agricultural pests and diseases produce a disequilibrium in the ecosystem and, consequently, in human beings. Pathogenic agents and pests acquire, over time, resistance to pesticides (which, by market strategy, have come to be called \"agricultural defenses\"). Therefore, the quantity and aggressiveness of these chemical products must be increased to overcome this situation, causing a disastrous cascade effect: the soil becomes poorer and its yield is diminished; rural workers get severely sick by constantly handling these toxic products; water supplies, including underground ones, are contaminated; and the people who depend on agricultural products get all this exposure to poison, triggering a series of health problems. With the exception of the pesticide and chemical fertilizer industries, who else benefits from the practice of these conventional treatments? If Hippocrates could reassess his principle of opposites, represented by allopathy, in view of its later consequences on living beings and the environment, he would remove it from his considerations. Today, homeopathy as a sustainable technique, economically viable, and ecologically correct, has become indispensable to the equilibrium of the planet and to the health of all beings that live in it. Author: Nina Ximenes, a biologist and postgraduate environmental education student. This is so bad, I hardly know where to start. Homeopathy is nothing but an elaborate system for delivering placebos. It is based on magical thinking. Basic science tells us it [can't possibly work as claimed](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/fun-with-homeopaths-and-meta-analyses-of-homeopathy-trials/) (with water remembering a substance that is no longer present and with more dilute solutions producing stronger effects). And there is no credible evidence that it has any objective therapeutic effect on humans, much less on animals, plants, soils and water. It has nothing to do with quantum physics: quantum effects are only important at the atomic and subatomic scales, and couldn't explain homeopathy's claim that the water \"remembers\" the original substance, much less explain how that memory could affect health. The claim that homeopathy \"works with energy\" is just imagination, not substantiated by any evidence. Rudolph Steiner was a philosopher who founded the spiritual movement called anthroposophy. His \"science\" is so-called \"spiritual science.\" Anthroposophical medicine and biodynamic agriculture are two branches of his \"science\" that are still popular in some spheres but that have been accurately characterized as pseudoscience by real scientists. If you want to know more about anthroposophical medicine, you can read what Dr. Gorski wrote about it last year [here](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/a-university-of-michigan-medical-school-alumnus-confronts-anthroposophic-medicine-at-his-alma-mater/). The author uses inflammatory language to make extravagant claims of harm from pesticides and fertilizers, with no attempt to provide any context or supporting evidence. She uses the term \"allopathy,\" a meaningless pejorative word invented by Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, to disparage his mainstream rivals. She refers to Hippocrates' \"principle of opposites,\" a distortion and over-simplification of his ideas. Hippocrates was a smart guy, and I like to think if he were alive today he would have rejected the old \"four humor\" theory and homeopathy alike, and would have adopted scientific medicine wholeheartedly. She asks \"who else benefits\" from conventional agricultural practices. I would argue that there are benefits to people who might have starved from food shortages if fertilizers and pesticides had not worked to increase the availability of food. That's not to say current practices shouldn't be improved and made safer, but discarding them wholesale and replacing them with homeopathy is hardly the answer! I wondered if this might be some kind of satire, but I think not. It is on a page with the heading \"Advances\" and is labeled \"Health.\" Is she pulling our leg, or can she possibly really believe homeopathy has \"become indispensable to the equilibrium of the planet and to the health of all beings that live in it\"? Perhaps she is talking about some other planet in a parallel universe, or in her dreams. If Alice's White Queen tried to [practice believing this before breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Queen_(Through_the_Looking-Glass)), her brain might explode. If this is what passes for science in Brazil, Brazil is in trouble. Apparently things haven't changed very much since [Richard Feynman had his disappointing encounter with the Brazilian educational system](http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education). Of course it really isn't fair to single out Brazil, because the same things happen in other countries. If this is what passes for science in Scientific American, the magazine is a reprehensible travesty and should strike the word \"scientific\" from its title. What were the editors thinking when they foisted this kind of rubbish on their readers? For shame! Note: Thanks to Felipe Nogueira Barbara de Oliveira for bringing this to my attention and for providing the English translation of Ximenes' article. He also provided a Portuguese translation of this blog post and suggested that I include it for the convenience of his compatriots. Here it is: Portuguese Version of the Above Recentemente recebi um email de um dos leitores do SBM no Brasil, Felipe Nogueira pequena mat\u00e9ria publicada na edi\u00e7\u00e3o de Abril de Ele ficou horrorizado que isso apareceu sob a dela.
