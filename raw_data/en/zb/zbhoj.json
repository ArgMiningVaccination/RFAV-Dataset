The formulas will often be adjusted as your presentation changes over time. Length Of Treatment The length of time you will need to take Herbal Medicine will vary based on your condition and how long you have had it. Absence Of Symptoms Herbal Medicine can and often does result in a complete absence of symptoms, even in severe conditions that have been present for years.
