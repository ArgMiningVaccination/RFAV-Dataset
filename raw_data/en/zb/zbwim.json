A [Florida inpatient detox center](https://www.tidesedgedetoxcenter.com/drug-and-alcohol-detox-programs-fl/inpatient-detox-center-florida/) or holistic detox ensures that you can safely and successfully detox from your substance of choice. Substance abuse disorders, alcoholism, and addiction are chronic and incurable conditions that can destroy your life. Addiction can cause you to lose friends and family members, struggle financially and lose control of your life. More than 30 million Americans have a substance abuse disorder each and every year, making it one of the most common medical and mental health problems nationwide. Addiction can not only lower your overall quality of life, but it can also lead to death. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in the country and the number one cause of death among Americans 50 years of age and younger. How Addiction Works Drugs and alcohol are neurotransmitter inhibitors, causing your brain to release an excessive amount of neurotransmitters whenever you use. Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by your brain that create positive emotions. Dopamine, serotonin, and GABA are among the most well-known neurotransmitters and are the neurotransmitters most commonly involved in addiction. Psychoactive substances are either central nervous system stimulants or central nervous system depressants. Examples of substances that are considered stimulants include: - Cocaine and crack - Methamphetamine - Adderall - Amphetamine - Ritalin Examples of common depressants include: - Alcohol - Opiates - Benzodiazepines like Xanax and Ativan - Tranquilizers Drugs and alcohol are both physically and psychologically addictive. Your body and brain can both become dependent on your substance of choice in order to function. The brain can become incapable of releasing neurotransmitters without your substance of choice and you can deal with painful withdrawal symptoms when you don't use. Your brain's pleasure and reward center associates your substance of choice with pleasure and rewards your drug use while punishing your abstinence. Florida's holistic detox programs can help you during the early stages of recovery. Since cravings become severe during withdrawal, a Florida holistic detox can help limit your symptoms.
