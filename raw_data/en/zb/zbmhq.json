Even the description \"Ayurvedic Director\" barely does him justice. After all, Dr Raman has devoted himself heart and soul to Ayurvedic medicine - which he regards as his main purpose in life. No wonder then that he enjoys the highest reputation not just among our guests(...) Doctor Molly is a humble, petite lady who has experienced a lot in her life. It is immediately obvious that she puts her heart and soul into her professional work. As a child, she already knew that she wanted to become a doctor and help other people. But it was her father who made the(...) Dr Sobhanakumari was already hugely empathetic even as a child. Even then, she says her greatest wish was to bring an end to human suffering. Growing up in a small village, she often came into contact with people whose lives were less privileged than her own. From a very young age, she made it her(...) Dr Lal may be one of our younger doctors, nonetheless, he has quickly won over not just his colleagues but also Somatheeram's guests thanks to his qualifications and his dedication to his work. His career so far in the international environment and his capable approach to work indicate a hugely promising future for him. Despite(...) \"Laughter is the best medicine\" or \"Laugh more, live longer - and most importantly of all, feel healthier\". These are well-known sayings that will be familiar to everyone. So it's hardly surprising that you feel better when you are with people who make you laugh with their sense of humour. Someone who has humour running(...) The most notable thing about Dr. Reshmi is undoubtedly the warmth with which she cares for her patients. She has an incredible ability to sense a person's mood in a matter of moments. Ayurvedic blood runs through her veins - and maybe that has something to do with her passion for this discipline. Even as(...) \"The basic idea of the family is the concept for our society\", says Dr. Kavitha. Ayurveda translates literally as \"the science of life\", so it forms the foundation for your approach to professional and family life. \"If we are healthy and happy, then so is our society\", she continues. Her moral principles and the strength(...) Although Dr. Sameer is one of the youngest doctors on our team, he has been with us since 2012 and is a familiar face to most of our returning guests. He's been winning people over with his cheerful laugh for years. His positive character and also his caring and professional attitude to his patients underscore(...) The first chapter in Somatheeram's successful story begins around 1985 in Monheim am Rhein, in Germany. This small town, not far from D\u00fcsseldorf, was home to Dr Polly Mathew and his family, the founder and, for many years, managing director of Somatheeram. This was where he developed his plan to introduce Ayurveda to an international(...) It's difficult to do justice to Suresh John's importance. He is vital for Somatheeram in a way that is virtually unparalleled. That is why we need to give you a bit of background information to really explain his role within the Somatheeram family. The Somatheeram Ayurvedic Health Resort has experienced a very turbulent, but also(...) Lars is part of the German-Indian management team. He has been part of the Somatheeram family from as early as 2009 and knows the resort like the back of his hand. Whenever a strategic decision has to be made about Somatheeram, his expertise is called upon. Lars also influences countless other avoidable little things that(...) Our staff are focused on the well-being of our guests both in public and behind the scenes. The employees in red seen on the right in the foreground of the picture ensure, for example, that the rooms are clean and the linen is changed. The Ayurveda team consists of doctors, therapists and yoga teachers. Lots(...) For a long time we looked in vain for a general manager who would understand the needs of our clients and who could help shape our corporate social responsibility and exemplify this philosophy through their own day-to-day life. In 2017 we found the ideal recruit in Ajith Prassad. He is passionate about his contribution to(...) He is as much a part of Somatheeram as the palm trees and the sound of the sea. James has been a yoga master at the Somatheeram Ayurvedic Health Resort for 12 years and is hugely popular with our guests. Not least because he radiates calm through his very nature. Last year he almost took(...) Aekalavya Aswathy Rekha began her yoga training at the age of 21. But she did not make a definitive commitment to yoga until she was 33. After intense training, she now designs her courses to be particularly challenging both at a physical and mental level. As a female yoga teacher, she is something of a(...) Even before he had left school, Jinu was sure he wanted to become a yoga master one day. Despite the fact that nobody among his family or friends practised yoga, he was totally committed and started doing yoga at the age of 15, completing his initial yoga teacher training about a decade later. Even as(...) As an Ayurvedic centre that is steeped in tradition, we also produce our own medicines here. An experienced team of specialists is responsible for this process, notably Dr Sundareswaran, who oversees quality assurance. He was brought up in the Ayurvedic tradition and even as a child he showed an interest in this Indian therapeutic practice.(...) "}
