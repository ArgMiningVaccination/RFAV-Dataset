Some people who have seborrheic dermatitis also have another skin disease. If your dermatologist sees signs of this, you may need a culture (a bit of skin scraped off) or a skin biopsy. If you need a skin biopsy, your dermatologist will numb the area and remove a small bit of skin. Your dermatologist will perform the skin biopsy during your office visit, and you'll remain awake the entire time. The skin removed during a skin biopsy or scraping will be looked at under a microscope in a medical laboratory. The doctor who looks at the tissue under the microscope will write a report that tells what they saw. This helps your dermatologist give you an accurate diagnosis. Once your dermatologist diagnoses you, they can talk with you about treatment. How do dermatologists treat seborrheic dermatitis?
