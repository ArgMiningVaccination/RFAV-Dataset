Conventional medicine offers powerful tools for unblocking closed coronary arteries, controlling cholesterol, relieving angina and warding off heart attacks. But the most cutting-edge treatment is no substitute for exercise and good nutrition. These neglected complementary therapies can improve a person's health at almost any stage of illness. How effective are they? Diets low in saturated fat and trans fats--and high in fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains--can reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke by 20 to 80 percent. And even moderate exercise, such as walking briskly for three or more hours each week, can reduce your risk by 30 to 40 percent. Combining stress management and smoking cessation with diet and exercise not only preserves health but also interrupts the disease process. Rigorous lifestyle programs, such as those developed by Dr. Dean Ornish and Nathan Pritikin, have been shown to slow the arterial narrowing and clot formation that cause most heart attacks. Most experts still doubt that such programs offer a realistic alternative to surgery, angioplasty or medication for people with advanced heart disease. But these regimens can clearly help reduce people's symptoms and improve their ability to function. Can other natural remedies help keep your heart healthy? Supplements containing folic acid (a B vitamin) or omega-3 fatty acids may help protect people at high risk for heart disease. And large studies, including Harvard's Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study, found reduced rates of heart disease in people whose diets are rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin A and beta carotene. Still, there is no strong evidence that taking these vitamins in pill form reduces your risk. And no one has shown convincingly that chelation therapy (a technique normally used to clear toxic metals from the bloodstream) improves cardiovascular health. The technique has an avid following, however, and the federal government is now supporting a large study to evaluate it. Some botanical substances can help reduce risk factors for heart disease. Red yeast rice, for example--a fermented starch used in Chinese cooking and sold as a supplement under the brand name Cholestin--can help lower cholesterol and triglycerides. But no herb has yet been shown to reduce heart attacks or strokes in a controlled study. Some herbal products may even create risks. Ginkgo biloba could theoretically cause excessive bleeding if taken with blood-thinning drugs. And herbal stimulants such as ma huang (ephedra) can cause dangerously high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms. When combined with conventional treatment, mind-body therapies such as relaxation, meditation, support groups and prayer therapy can improve both clinical status and quality of life, and help people change their diet, exercise and attitude. Many of today's conventional treatments were once considered alternative. The best of today's alternatives will likely become mainstream tomorrow. "}
