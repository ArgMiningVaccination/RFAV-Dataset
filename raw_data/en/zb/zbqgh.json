Neuro-Emotional Technique (NET) for Mind-Body Health NET or Neuro-Emotional Technique is one of the services we offer at Hands On Acupuncture and Massage. It is not part of Traditional Chinese Medicine but is a modern technique derived from principles of TCM and Chiropractic medicine. Because of this, not all acupuncturists are trained to perform NET. However, the therapists at Hands On have completed the necessary certification to perform NET. With that in mind, let's look at what it is. NET is a physical therapy that can reconcile unresolved emotional patterns and emotional components to stress and injury. It is a non-invasive treatment for psychosomatic issues, and mind-body health. It uses muscle testing and emotional mappings of the acupuncture meridians to retrain your body and brain from negative emotional patterns. It is not talk-therapy, but a physiological adjustment that corrects maladapted neurological/emotional complexes. It affects the body and brain to remove disruptive emotional patterns and restore homeostasis within these systems. When is NET useful? It is useful for emotional problems resulting from or strongly tied to physical injury. It's useful for feelings of unresolved trauma, whether conscious or subconscious. It is useful for compulsive behaviors or general emotional upset. Benefits include feeling less stress, less \"drama\" in our daily lives, and generally feeling more \"at ease\". It also benefits the physical side of psychosomatic illness. With regular treatments, we see improvements to both the body and the mind. If any of this resonates with you, please inquire with one of our NET certified therapists to answer any further questions. Thank you, and stay well!

Sound healing has many benefits including: - reducing stress and anxiety - improves circulation - deepens relaxation - increases mental & emotional clarity. - restores balance Vibrational sound healing can be traced back from present-day trends to many ancient civilizations including India, Africa, Europe, and the Orient. The idea is to restore balance to the chakra system and clearing the blocked energy within ourselves. Sound healing is similar to reiki healing; It is a form of energy healing that allows your body to self-regulate and self heal. Let the sounds vibrate through you to feel the power of self-preservation and healing.
