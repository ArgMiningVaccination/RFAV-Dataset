Numbers in the text and tables may not add up to totals because of rounding.Some of the figures in this report indicate periods of recession by using shaded vertical bars. The bars extend from the peak to the trough of each recession. The recession that began in March 2001is assumed to end in the first quarter of calendar year 2002. Data for real gross domestic produc t are based on chained 1996 dollars. For purposes of comparison, the figure on the cover shows projections for 2002 through 2011 because that was the period covered by CBO's January 2001 baseline. The current projection period extends from 2003 through 2012. A glossary of budgetary and economic terms used in this report is ava ilable on CBO's Web site (www.c bo.gov). Other supplemental material that will appear on the site shortly includes CBO's Economic Forecasting Record and Uncertainties in Projecting Budge t Surpluses: A Discussion of Data and Methods .Preface This volume is one of a series of reports on the state of the budget and the economy that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues each year. It satisfies the requirement of section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for CBO to submit to the Committees on the Budget periodic reports about fis cal policy and to provide five-year baseline projections of the federal budget. In accordance with CBO's mandate to provide impartial analysis, the report con- tains no recommendations. The baseline spending projections were prepar ed by the staff of CBO's Budget Analysis Division under the supervision of Robert Sunshine, Pete r Fontaine, Janet Airi s, Thomas Bradley, Kim Cawley, Paul Cullinan, Jeffrey Holland, and Jo Ann Vines. The economic outlook was pre-pared by John Peterson and Eric Warasta of the Macroeconomic Analysis Division, with assistance from the staff of the division, under the direction of Robert Dennis. The revenue estimates were prepared by the staff of the Tax Analysis Di vision under the supervision of Thomas Woodward, Mark Booth, and David Weiner, with assistance from the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Uncertainty About Credit R eestimates for Spectrum Loans 137Summary The economic recession and recent laws have combined to sharply reduce the budget sur-pluses projected a year ago. In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projectedthat under the laws and policies then in force, the fed-eral government would run surpluses in fiscal years 2002 through 2011 totaling $5.6 trillion. 1 In CBO's new projections, that cumulative surplus has fallen to$1.6 trillion\u2014a drop of $4 trillion (see SummaryTable 1). About 60 percent of that decline results from legislation\u2014primarily the tax cuts enacted in Juneand additional discretionary spending\u2014and from itseffect on the cost of paying interest on the federaldebt. Changes in the economic outlook and varioustechnical revisions since last January account for theother 40 percent of that decline. For both 2002 and 2003, CBO now projects that, instead of surpluses, the total budget will showsmall deficits, if current policies remain the same andthe economy follows the path that CBO is forecast-ing. In 2001, by contrast, the federal government rana surplus of $127 billion (see Summary Table 2). The deficit projected for this year\u2014$21 billion \u2014represents a change of more than $300 billion fromlast January's projection. Over 70 percent of thatreduction results from the weak economy and relatedtechnical factors, which have considerably lowered the revenues expected for this year and next. For the current 10-year projection period, 2003 through 2012, CBO estimates a total surplus of nearly$2.3 tr illion. However, almost half of that total co- mes from the surpluses projected for 2011 and2012\u2014the last two years of the projection period and thus the most uncertain. The surpluses for thoseyears also reflect the scheduled expiration in Decem-ber 2010 of the tax cuts enacted last June. In CBO's new baseline, the off-budget accounts (which reflect the spending and revenues of SocialSecurity and the Postal Service) run surplusesthroughout the projection period. In the on-budgetaccounts, by contrast, surpluses do not reemerge until2010. CBO's baseline projections are intended to serve as a neutral benchmark against which to mea-sure the effects of possible changes in tax and spend-ing policies. They are constructed according to rulesset forth in law and long-standing practices and aredesigned to project federal revenues and spendingunder the assumption that current laws and policiesremain unchanged. Thus, these projections will al-most certainly differ from actual budget totals: theeconomy may not follow the path that CBO projects,and lawmakers are likely to alter the nation's tax andspending policies. Therefore, CBO's baseline shouldbe viewed not as a forecast or prediction of futurebudgetary outcomes but simply as the agency's bestjudgment of how the economy and other factors willaffect federal revenues and spending under currentlaw. 1. That projection appeared in Congressional Budget Office, The Bud- get and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011 (January 2001).xiv THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTL OOK: FISCAL YEAR S 2003-2012 January 2002 Summary Table 1.

Technical changes are revisions that are not attributable to new legislation or to changes in the components of CBO's economi c forecast. The Budget Outlook If current policies remain in place, CBO projects, the total budget will be in deficit for the next two years.Those deficits are expected to be small, amounting toonly 0.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) in 2002 and 0.1 percent of GDP in 2003(see Summary Table 2). After that, surpluses are pro-jected to reemerge and gradually increase.For the five years from 2003 through 2007, CBO projects a cumulative surplus of $437 billion.That figure represents off-budget surpluses totalingmore than $1 trillion by on-budget deficits thattotal $617 billion. For the 10-year period through2012, the total budget surplus under current policiesis projected to approach $2.3 trillion. Again, thatamount is made up of surpluses in Social Security($2.5 trillion) offset by a cumulative on-budget defi-cit ($242 billion). Without the scheduled expirationSUMMARY xv Summary Table 2.

Off-budget surpluses comprise surpluses in the Social Security trust funds and the net cash flow of the Postal Service. of last June's tax cuts, the total 10-year budget sur- plus would fall to $1.6 trillion. The total surplus is projected to equal 1 percent of GDP by 2006 and grow to 3.7 percent of GDP by 2012. Estimates of large surpluses should be viewedcautiously, however, because future economic devel-opments and estimating inaccuracies could changethe outlook substantially. In addition, future legisla-tive actions are almost certain to alter the budgetarypicture. Changes in the Past Year As an illustration of how quickly the budget outlookcan change, CBO's projection of the cumulative sur-plus for 2002 through 2011 has plunged by $4 trillionin just one year (see Summary Table 1). 2 Some $2.4 trillion of that drop can be attributed to legislativeactions. The legislation with the largest effect wasthe Economic Growth and Tax Relief ReconciliationAct of 2001, enacted in June. That law is estimatedto reduce surpluses by nearly $1.3 trillion over 10years (not including associ ated debt-service costs). Additional discretionary spending since last January accounts for another $550 billion reductionin the projected surplus for the 2002-2011 period.That amount stems from both regular and supplemen-tal appropriations. CBO's January 2001 baseline as-sumed that discretionary budget authority for 2002 2. About 45 percent of that reduction results from changes made since CBO issued its updated Budget and Economic Outlook in August 2001. The drop since August totals $1.8 trillion and is attributed,in relatively equal measures, to legislative, economic, and technicalchanges.xvi THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTL OOK: FISCAL YEAR S 2003-2012 January 2002 would total $665 billion.3 The actual amount appro- priated for 2002 in the 13 regular appropriation actstotaled $691 billion. In addition, the Congress andthe President enacted $20 billion in supplementalbudget authority in December as part of their re-sponse to the terrorist attacks of September 11\u2014thereby generating a total of $711 billion in budgetauthority for 2002, $45 billion more than CBO as-sumed last January. Under the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, CBO'sbaseline assumes that annual appropriations for dis-cretionary programs continue at their current level,increasing only by the rates of inflation projected foreach year. As a result of the appropriations enactedfor 2002, projections of discretionary spending in thecurrent baseline begin at a level that is $45 billionhigher than a year ago. Furthermore, two supplemental appropriation laws enacted in fiscal year 2001\u2014one for defensepersonnel and readiness programs and another in im-mediate response to the attacks of September 11\u2014will generate outlays totaling around $25 billion in2002 and beyond. However, budget authority fromactions in 2001 is not carried forward into the base-line projections for future years because those appro-priations occurred before the current year. Overall, legislated reductions in revenues, addi- tional discretionary spending, and other laws withsmaller budgetary effects have reduced projected sur-pluses\u2014and thereby increased the government's bor-rowing needs\u2014by $1,858 billion for 2002 through2011. That increased borrowing is projected to resultin an extra $562 billion in net interest costs over the10-year period. Changes in the economic outlook since January 2001 account for another $929 billion decline in the10-year surplus. About three-quarters of that totalreflects lower revenue projections, mostly resultingfrom the substantially weaker economic growth ex-pected in the near term a nd the slightly lower average growth rates projected for the following severalyears. Much of the rest of the decline attributable to the economic outlook represents added debt-servicecosts resulting from the reduction in anticipated reve-nues. Technical changes\u2014those not driven by new legislation or by changes in CBO's economic fore-cast\u2014have reduced the projected 10-year surplus bya total of $660 billion since last January. As with theeconomic changes, revenues account for over 75 per-cent of the technical changes, and debt service ac-counts for much of the rest. The technical changes torevenues stem primarily from revised projections ofcapital gains realizations and adjustments for lower-than-expected tax collections in recent months. Homeland Security Since the attacks of September 11, federal agencies,state and local governments, and the private sectorhave perceived a heightened threat to the UnitedStates and a need to commit more resources to home-land security. On the federal level, legislation fol-lowing the attacks increased the budget authority pro-vided for such security from $17 billion in 2001 to$22 billion for 2002. What level of resources to com-mit to homeland security will undoubtedly be a keyissue as the Congress and the President make deci-sions about spending and other policies this year. The Outlook for Federal Debt In the January 2001 Budget and Economic Outlook , CBO estimated that federal debt held by the publicwould reach a level in 2006 that would allow theTreasury to retire all of the debt available for re-demption. At that time, CBO also projected that thestatutory ceiling on all federal debt (which includesdebt held by governme nt accounts) would not be reached until 2009. Now, CBO estimates that debtheld by the public will not be fully redeemed withinthe 10-year projection period and that the currentdebt ceiling will be reached in the next few months.Nevertheless, if the surpluse s projected in the current baseline materialize, debt held by the public will fallto about 15 percent of GDP in 2010\u2014its lowest levelsince 1917. 3. That figure was calculated by assuming that the amount appropri- ated for the base year of 2001 would grow at specified rates of in-flation.SUMMARY xvii The Economic Outlook In CBO's view, the most likely path for the economy is a mild recession that may already have reached itsnadir. CBO expects the annual growth rate of real(inflation-adjusted) GDP to accelerate from -0.2 per-cent in 2001 (measured from the fourth quarter ofcalendar year 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2001) to2.5 percent in 2002 and to accelerate further to 4.3percent in 2003 (see Summary Table 3). Some unusual features of the current recession will cause it to be mild, CBO believes. Chief amongthose features are the rapidity of policymakers' re-sponses, the moderating behavior of prices, and anearly reduction in businesses' inventories. In lessthan one year, the Federal Reserve has cut the federalfunds rate 11 times\u2014from 6.5 percent to 1.75 per- cent. Also, the tax cuts enacted in June preventedconsumption from slowing more than it might haveotherwise, and additional federal spending in re-sponse to the terrorist attacks will boost GDP in2002. Lower prices for oil and natural gas and mildprice increases for other items are supporting con-sumption by boosting real disposable income. Fur- thermore, businesses began to reduce inventories ear-lier in this recession than they did in past downturns,which may mean that fewer cuts in inventories re-main than at this stage of the typical recession. CBO projects that weak demand in the short run will translate into weak employment, pushing the un-employment rate higher for the next several quarterswhile restraining inflation. With growth of real GDPnear zero early this year, the unemployment rate isexpected to increase to 6.1 percent in calendar year2002 from 4.8 percent last year. The rate of inflationfaced by consumers is for ecast to fall from 2.9 per- cent last year to 1.8 percent in 2002. Lower oilprices account for most of the projected decline ininflation, although the recession also plays a role. Asoil prices stabilize in CB O's forecast, inflation bounces back to 2.5 percent in 2003. Looking out through 2012, CBO expects the growth of real GDP to average 3.1 percent during the2002-2012 period\u2014roughly the same rate that CBOprojected last January for the 2002-2011 period.Nonetheless, the level of real GDP is lower each year Summary Table 3.

Uncertainty of the Projections CBO's baseline projections represent the midrange ofpossible outcomes based on past and current trendsand the assumption that current policies remain thesame. But considerable uncertainty surrounds thoseprojections for two reasons. First, future legislationis likely to alter the paths of federal spending andrevenues. CBO does not predict legislation\u2014indeed,any attempt to incorporate future legislative changeswould undermine the usefulness of the baseline as abenchmark against which to measure the effects ofsuch changes. Second, the U.S. economy and thefederal budget are highly complex and are affectedby many economic and techni cal factors that are dif- ficult to predict. As a result, actual budgetary out-comes will almost certainly differ from CBO's base-line projections. In view of such uncertainty, the outlook for the budget can best be described as a fan of probabilitiesaround the point estimates presented in this report(see Summary Figure 1). Not surprisingly, thoseprobabilities widen as the projection period extends.As the fan chart makes clear, projections that arequite different from the baseline have a significantprobability of coming to pass. The Long-Term Outlook Despite the sizable surpluse s projected for the later years of CBO's 10-year b udget outlook, long-term pressures on spending loom just over the horizon.Those pressures result from the aging of the U.S.population (large numbers of baby boomers will startbecoming eligible for Soci al Security retirement ben- efits in 2008 and for Medicare in 2011), from in- creased life spans, and from rising costs for federalhealth care programs. According to midrange esti-Summary Figure 1. Uncertainty in CBO's Projections of the TotalBudget Surplus Under Current Policies SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTES: This figure shows the estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the surplus under current policies. Thecalculations are based on CBO's past track record.CBO's baseline projections fall in the middle of the dark-est area. Under the assumption that policies do notchange, the probability is 10 percent that actual sur-pluses will fall in the darkest area and 90 percent thatthey will fall within the whole shaded area. Actual surpluses will of course be affected by legislation enacted during the next 10 years, including decisionsabout discretionary spending. The effects of future leg-islation are not included in this figure. An explanation of how this probability distribution was calculated will a ppear shortly on CBO's Web site (www.cbo.gov). mates, if current policies continue, spending on So- cial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid combined willnearly double by 2030, to almost 15 percent of GDP. Taking action sooner rather than later to address long-term budgetary pressures can make a significantdifference. In particular, policies that encourage eco-nomic growth\u2014such as running budget surpluses toboost national saving and investment, enacting taxand regulatory policies that encourage work and sav-ing, and focusing more government spending on in-vestment rather than on current consumption\u2014canhelp by increasing the total amount of resourcesavailable for all uses.Chapter One The Budget Outlook Over the past year, the outlook for the federal budget has changed substantially. Last Janu-ary, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that if the tax and spending policies then ineffect remained the same, the government would runsurpluses totaling more than $5.6 trillion over the 10-year period from 2002 through 2011. CBO revisedthose projections in August, reducing the 10-yearsurplus to $3.4 trillion. 1 Now, CBO projects that the cumulative surplus for 2002 through 2011 under cur-rent policies would total $1.6 trillion\u2014a drop of $4trillion from last January's figure. Approximately 60percent of that decline ($2.4 trillion) results fromlaws enacted in the past year. The other 40 percentreflects changes in the outlook for the economy andvarious technical adjustme nts to CBO's projections. The message is much the same over a shorter, five-year horizon. Last January, CBO projected thatunder current policies, the government would show a surplus in each year and run a cumulative surplus ofmore than $2.0 trillion during the 2002-2006 period.Revisions to the baseline in August reduced that five-year figure to $1.1 trillion. Now, CBO projects thatthe total budget would be in deficit in 2002 and 2003and would show a cumulative surplus of only $250billion through 2006 under current policies. Abouthalf of the drop in that figure since last January ($870billion) reflects new legislation. Changes in the eco-nomic outlook caused another $530 billion of the de-cline, and technical changes accounted for the re-maining $356 billion.If current tax and spending policies remain in place, the total budget will show a deficit of $21 bil-lion in 2002 and $14 billion in 2 003, CBO projects (see Tables 1-1 and 1-2). Total budget surpluses re-emerge in 2004 in CBO's baseline and accumulate toalmost $2.3 trillion between 2003 and 2012 (the cur-rent 10-year projection period). But 80 percent ofthat cumulative surplus occurs in the last five years of the period, and almost half comes in the final twoyears\u2014when the projections are, by their nature, themost uncertain. The surpluses projected for fiscalyears 2011 and 2012 are particularly large because allof the remaining tax-cut provisions of the EconomicGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001(EGTRRA) are scheduled to expire in December2010. That expiration sign ificantly boosts projected revenues. Unlike total surpluses, on-budget surpluses\u2014 which exclude the transactions of Social Security andthe Postal Service\u2014do not reappear until 2010 inCBO's new baseline. Although those off-budget ac-counts are projected to show net surpluses every yearthrough 2012, the rest of the budget is projected topost deficits of $181 billion in 2002, $193 billion in2003, and declining amounts through 2009. The pro-jected on-budget surplus jumps in 2011 and 2012after most of the tax-cut provisions expire. If law-makers extended those tax cuts, the total 10-year sur-plus would be about one-third less than the $2.3 tril-lion projected under the assumptions for the baseline(see Box 1-1 on page 4). As dramatically as the budget outlook has wors- ened in the past year, it remains relatively bright byhistorical standards. Before 1998, the governmenthad recorded deficits in 36 of the previous 37 years. 1. The August 2001 revisions appeared in The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update ; the $2.2 trillion reduction in the projected 10- year surplus reflected a $1.4 trillion decline in revenues and a $0.8trillion increase in outlays.2 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 1-1.

NOTE: * = between zero and $500 million.a. Off-budget surpluses comprise surpluses in the Social Security trust funds as well as the net cash flow of the Postal Service . The total deficits projected for the next two years are as small or smaller as a percentage of the nation'sgross domestic product (GDP) than in any of thoseyears (see Figure 1-1 on page 5). More important,public debt continues to decline in CBO's currentbaseline, albeit more slowly than in last year's pro-jections. Under current policies, federal debt held bythe public would equal 25 percent of GDP by 2006(see Figure 1-2 on page 5). By 2010 (before the expi-ration of EGTRRA), proj ected debt would fall to roughly 15 percent of GDP \u2014the lowest level since 1917. Uncertainty and the Projection Horizon Budget projections are always subject to considerable uncertainty (see Chapter 5 for more details). How-ever, that uncertainty is particularly great this year asthe nation continues to wage war on terrorism andrecover from a recession. Actual budget totals willdiffer from the projections in this report, perhaps sub-stantially. The major reason is that CBO's baseline,by law, must show future spending and revenues un- der current laws and policies\u2014even though thosewill almost certainly change. For example, the firstsession of the 107th Congress left a number of policyissues unresolved, including an economic stimuluspackage, additional discretionary spending, prescrip-tion drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, andthe extension of agricultural programs. Those poli-cies could significantly af fect spending and revenues for years to come. Another source of uncertainty about the budget outlook is the accuracy of the economic and technicalassumptions that underlie CBO's baseline. In recentyears, economic growth has surpassed expectations,fueling projections of higher revenues and biggersurpluses. Now, the projections hinge on how rap-idly and strongly the economy will rebound from thecurrent recession and whether growth over the next10 years will match the levels experienced in the late1990s. Uncertainty compounds as the projection hori- zon lengthens. Even small annual differences in themany key factors that influence the budget projec-tions\u2014factors such as inflation, increases in produc-CHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 3 Table 1-2.

The Expiration of Revenue Provisions The scheduled expiration of various tax provisions has a significant impact on the outlook for the budget over thenext decade. 1 Three provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) expire bythe end of calendar year 2006, and the rest\u2014representing themajority of the law's budgetary cost\u2014expire on D ecem- ber 31, 2010. Many other provisions of the tax code, en-acted before EGTRRA, either expired at the end of 2001 orare scheduled to expire in the next 10 years. They includethe treatment of nonrefundable credits under the alternativeminimum tax (AMT), which ended last year, and the re-search and experimentation credit, which expires in 2004. By law, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) budget projections must assume that almost all such provi-sions expire as planned. (The only exception is expiringexcise taxes dedicated to trust funds, which by statute areassumed to be extended.) An alternative measure of thelong-term budgetary effects of current tax policy could as-sume that the expirations do not occur as scheduled butrather that the Congress and the President immediately ex-tend the provisions indefinitely (including those that expiredin 2001). Under those assumptions, the Joint Committee onTaxation and CBO estimate, federal revenues would be $735billion lower during the 2003-2012 period than in CBO'sbaseline (see the table below). In addition, the government's debt-service costs would increase. As a result, the total sur-plus for that 10-year period would be about one-third less than the $2.3 trillion projected under baseline assumptions. More than three-quarters (or about $569 b illion) of the revenue loss over 10 years from extending all provisionswould result from extending EGTRRA. The majority of thatamount would occur in 2011 and 2012 (the years after mostof the law's provisions would have expired), but some ef-fects of continuing EGTRRA would appear earlier. Extend-ing the changes to estate and gift taxes could reduce reve-nues as early as 2003, b ecause if taxpayers knew that the law's repeal of the estate tax would become permanent in2011, some might postpone taxable gifts that they wouldotherwise have made during the decade. The estimates for EGTRRA shown below also assume that the higher exemption levels for the AMT, which expirein 2004, are extended at their 2004 levels. Under that as- sumption, the exemption level would not rise with inflation,so a growing number of taxpayers would still become sub-ject to the AMT over time\u2014albeit fewer than if the higherexemption levels expire as now scheduled. 1. It can also be expected to affect the economy, but only some of those effects are reflected in the estimated revenue impact ofthe expiring provisions.

(For details of howchanges in several key assumptions would affect thebudget outlook, see Appendix A.) Given such uncertainty, focusing on five-year projections may be more useful than relying on 10-year numbers. In addition, the current 10-year pro-jections are significantly affected by the scheduledexpiration, at the end of 2010, of last year's tax cuts.Many of the tables in this report show both five- and10-year totals (2003-2007 and 2003-2012 for the newbaseline; 2002-2006 and 2002-2011 when that base-line is being compared with last year's projections). Looking at the longer term remains important, however, as the baby-boom generation approachesretirement age. The recent worsening of the budgetoutlook\u2014along with its continuing uncertainty\u2014makes the budgetary challenges that loom beyond the10-year projection period even more difficult. By theend of that period, the baby-boom generation willbegin qualifying in large numbers for Social Securityand Medicare benefits, putting increased pressure on Figure 1-1.

By 2030, the number of workers is expected to rise by only about 15 percent while thenumber of Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries will nearly double. That growth, combined with in-creases in life expectancy, will boost spending onlong-term health care, about half of which is financedby Medicaid and Medicare. 2 Together, demographic changes and growth in medical costs are projected topush total federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid,and Social Security from just under 8 percent of GDPin 2001 to almost 15 percent of GDP in 2030. (Formore information about the long-term budget out-look, see Chapter 6.) The Concept Behind CBO's Baseline The baseline serves as a neutral benchmark that law- makers can use to measure the effects of proposedchanges in spending and revenue policies. It is con-structed according to rules se t forth in law, mainly in 2. See Congressional Budget Office, Projections of Expenditures for Long-Term Care Services for the Elderly (March 1999), pp. 1, 5-6.6 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Box 1-2. A Freeze in Discretionary Spending The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets the baseline for discretionary spend-ing as the level appropriated for the current year ad-justed for inflation and other specified factors. Butsome lawmakers view a freeze in discretionary spend-ing at the current year's level as the most logical start-ing point for considering future appropriations. In-deed, total discretionary outlays remained roughlyconstant from 1991 through 1996, largely because ofthe decline in defense spending after the Cold War.Since 1998, however, discre tionary spending has grown relatively rapidly, outpacing inflation.If total discretionary spending were frozen at the level enacted for 2002, the budget would be very closeto balance in 2003, and surpluses would grow largerin subsequent years than CBO's baseline projects. In that scenario, the total budget surplus would equal 5.2percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2012 (seethe table below). On-budget surpluses\u2014which ex-clude the balances of the Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service\u2014would equal 3.4 percent ofGDP by 2012. At that point, in dollar terms, discre-tionary spending would be nearly 22 percent belowthe inflation-adjusted level assumed in the baseline.

Those laws generally instruct CBO (and theOffice of Management and Budget) to project federalspending and revenues under current policies. For revenues and mandatory spending, section 257(b) of the Deficit Control Act requires that thebaseline be projected on the assumption that currentlaws continue without change. In most cases, thelaws that govern revenues and mandatory spendingare permanent. The baseline projections reflect an-ticipated changes in the economy, demographics, andother relevant factors that affect the implementation of those laws. 3 The rules are different for discretionary spend- ing, which is governed by annual appropriation acts.Section 257(c) of the Deficit Control Act states that 3. Section 257(b) of the Deficit Control Act also specifies that expir- ing spending programs are assumed in the baseline to continue ifthey have outlays of more than $50 million in the current year andwere established on or before the date when the Balanced BudgetAct of 1997 was enacted. Programs established after that date arenot automatically continued in the baseline. Expiring excise taxesdedicated to a trust fund are extended at current rates. But section257(b) does not provide for extending other expiring tax provisions,including those that have routinely been extended in the past.CHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 7 projections of discretionary budget authority after the current year should be adjusted to reflect inflation\u2014using specified indexes\u2014as well as a few other fac-tors (such as the costs of renewing certain expiringhousing contracts and of annualizing adjustments tofederal pay). Accordingly, CBO's baseline extrapo-lates discretionary spending from the current level,adjusting for projected rates of inflation and otherspecified factors over the next 10 years. This mechanical approach to developing base- line projections can be problematic. For example, alldiscretionary budget authority appropriated for thecurrent year is inflated and extended through the en-tire projection period even if it was enacted for anemergency or other one-time event. Thus, CBO'scurrent baseline projects into future years the $20billion in supplemental budget authority for 2002 thatwas appropriated in response to the terrorist attacksof September 11. 4 Some people might argue that such an appropriation was intended as one-timespending and should not be extended past 2002. But the Deficit Control Act does not provide for such ex-ceptions. And although that specific emergency ap-propriation may not be repeated, various types ofemergencies that necessitate additional appropria-tions arise every year. (Chapter 4 presents an alterna-tive path for discretionary spending that does not as-sume such appropriations in the future.) CBO traditionally presents at least one other benchmark for discretionary spending. Lawmakerssometimes use a freeze in appropriations\u2014the cur-rent year's amounts wit hout adjustment for inflation \u2014to gauge the impact of proposed levels of discre-tionary spending for the coming fiscal year. The bud-get outlook under such a freeze is shown in Box 1-2.CBO's baseline is intended to provide an objec- tive foundation for assessing policy options. It is notintended to be a prediction of future budgetary out-comes. Rather, the projections presented in this re-port reflect CBO's best judgment about how the economy and other factors will affect federal reve-nues and spending under existing laws and policies. Changes in the Baseline Since January 2001 Over the past year, CBO's projection of the cumula- tive surplus for the 2002-2011 period has fallen by $4trillion (see Table 1-3). Roughly $2.4 trillion of thatdecline is attributable to laws passed since last Jan-uary\u2014primarily the EGTRRA tax cuts of June 2001and increased discretionary spending. About $930billion results from changes to CBO's economic fore-cast, and the remaining $660 billion reflects revisionsto the projections that are technical in nature. 5 Lower projected surpluses result in additional accumulated debt, which in turn requires higherspending for interest on the debt. Those increaseddebt-service costs, which amount to about $1 trillionthrough 2011, account for one-fourth of the reductionin the projected 10-year surplus. Last January, CBOestimated that the steady paying down of federal debtheld by the public, which began with the onset ofsurpluses in 1998 and was projected to acceleratethrough the 2002-2011 period, would enable theTreasury to retire all of the debt available for re-demption by 2006. 6 In the current baseline, that pay- down has been interrupted\u2014at least temporarily.The small deficits projected for 2002 and 2003 willnecessitate additional net government borrowing.Not until 2004 will the emergence of a small surplusallow publicly held debt to begin declining again. Asa result, CBO no longer projects that all available 4. The 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recov- ery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United Statesprovided $40 billion in budget authority\u2014$20 billion in 2001 and asecond $20 billion that could be obligated only when enacted in alater appropriation act. Because the first $20 billion was appropri-ated before the current fiscal year, that amount is not extended inthe new baseline. However, the second $20 billion in emergencyappropriations, which was attached to the 2002 defense appropria-tion act, is part of the current-year total for budget authority and istherefore inflated throughout the 10-year projection period. 5. For a similar analysis of how CBO's baseline has changed since August 2001, see Appendix B. 6. Part of the debt, including some long-term bonds and savings bonds, will remain outstanding regardless of the size of the surplus.8 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 1-3.

That categorization of revisions should be interpreted with caution, however. For example, distinguishing between economic and technical reestimates is im-precise. Changes in some factors that are related tothe performance of the economy (such as capitalgains realizations) are classified as technical reesti-mates because they are not driven directly by changesin the components of CBO's economic forecast.

NOTE: EGTRRA = Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; * = between -$500 million and $500 million. Legislative Changes Since Last January Altogether, laws passed since January 2001 have cut about $2.4 trillion from the projected surplus for the2002-2011 period. Half of that amount comes fromlaws that reduce the amount of revenues that the gov-ernment is likely to collect, and the other half stemsfrom legislation that increases the amount of outlaysfor government programs or for paying interest on thegovernment's debt. Revenues . In all, some 30 percent of the $4 trillion decline in the 10-year surplus is attributable toEGTRRA, which was enacted in June. CBO and theJoint Committee on Taxation estimated that the lawwill lower revenues by $1.2 trillion over the 2002-2011 period. 7 Other laws enacted since January have had little effect on revenues. Outlays. The discretionary budget authority appro- priated for 2002 exceeded the amount that CBO hadprojected a year ago on the basis of 2001 appropria-tions. That increase results in $550 billion in addi-tional outlays over the 2002-2 011 period compared with last January's projections. More than half of therise in projected outlays, about $300 billion, repre-sents increased defense spending. The rest reflectshigher spending for all other discretionary programs. Legislative changes to mandatory programs in the past year raised projected mandatory outlays (ex- 7. For more information about the budgetary effects of EGTRRA, see Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update (August 2001).10 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Figure 1-3. Reasons for the Change in CBO'sProjections Since January 2001 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. cluding debt-service costs) by $103 billion through 2011. The largest contributor is EGTRRA's expan-sion of the child tax credit, which is estimated to in-crease outlays for refundable tax credits by $88 bil-lion during the 2002-2011 period. By far the biggest increase in mandatory spend- ing, however, comes from higher debt-service costsas a result of laws enacted since January. By conven-tion, CBO attributes increases or decreases in debt- service costs to the type of change (legislative, eco-nomic, or technical) that occasioned them. Of theaforementioned $1.0 trillion increase in projecteddebt-service costs over 10 years, CBO estimates that$562 billion is attributable to the effects of laws en-acted in the past year. Economic Changes Since Last January Revisions to CBO's economic forecast over the pastyear have trimmed $929 billion from the total surplusprojected for the 2002-2011 period. The recessionplays a large role in explaining those revisions, per-haps accounting for as much as half of that 10-yearbudgetary impact. But other, longer-term changes inthe outlook contribute as well. Virtually all of thoseother economic effects are traceable to a reduction inCBO's projection for investment throughout the2002-2011 period. The current recession and pro- jected future levels of investment are closely con-nected: the recession seems to have been precipitatedmostly by a period of unsustainable investment in thelate 1990s, and the recognition of that overinvestmenthas led CBO to reduce its estimate of the level ofsuch spending over the next decade. (For details ofthe economic outlook, see Chapter 2.) Revenues . Approximately three-quarters of the re- duction in the 10-year surplus caused by economicchanges represents lower projections for revenues:changes in the economic outlook since last Januaryhave lowered projected revenues by about $700 bil-lion over 10 years. In the near term, the recession hasslowed the growth of wages and salaries and thus ofprojected revenues from individual income taxes.The projected growth of investment continues to beslightly lower throughout the 10-year period, furthercontributing to the decline in receipts from individualincome taxes. In addition, corporate profits have de-clined significantly, reducing projected corporate in-come tax receipts. In CBO's outlook, as the economy recovers, tax receipts are anticipated to rise closer to the levelsprojected last January, although they remain belowthat level through 2012. Outlays. As noted earlier, most of the change in pro- jected discretionary spending results from recent in-creases in enacted appropriations. But changes inCBO's assumptions about two measures of inflation\u2014the GDP deflator and th e employment cost index for wages and salaries\u2014over the past year cause anadditional small net increase ($44 billion) in pro-jected discretionary spending through 2011. Projections of mandatory spending are also sen- sitive to changes in the economic forecast. Althoughsuch spending flows from the provisions of perma-nent laws, the growth of many mandatory programs iskeyed to the economy. For example, since last Janu-ary, lower inflation and wage growth have reducedprojected spending for Social Security over the 2002-2011 period by $57 billion and projected spending for Medicare by roughly $33 billion. In addition,lower projections of future interest rates have de-creased projected net interest costs during that de-cade by $53 billion. CHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 11 Offsetting those declines are much larger changes that raise projected mandatory outlays\u2014andthus reduce surpluses\u2014relative to last January'sbaseline. The largest change to mandatory spendingdriven by economic revisions in the past year is theadditional $279 billion in debt-service costs necessi-tated by the $929 billion drop in surpluses. In addi-tion, CBO is forecasting higher unemployment forthe next few years because of the weakened econ-omy; that change has increased projected 10-yearspending for unemployment compensation by $52billion in the past year. Technical Changes Since Last January Reestimates that cannot be ascribed either to newlaws or to changes in CBO's economic assumptionshave reduced the projected 10-year surplus by $660billion in the past year. As with the economic revi-sions, more than three-quarters of those technicalchanges involve revenues; the rest mostly reflect theresulting debt-service costs. Revenues. About $500 billion of the decline in pro- jected revenues since last January results from tech-nical changes that are closely related to the revisedeconomic outlook. Those changes reflect adjust-ments to the methods and assumptions that determinehow much tax revenue any given tax base will gener-ate. For example, the decline in the stock market hasreduced projected capital gains realizations and thetax receipts they generate for both the individual andcorporate income taxes\u2014reductions that tend to dis-sipate over time. Slower growth in overall wealthhas decreased projections of receipts from estate andgift taxes. In addition, current revenue collectionsare lower than CBO's economic forecast andrevenue-estimating models projected, for reasons notentirely understood. Outlays. Technical reestimates have had mixed ef- fects on projected spendi ng for both discretionary and mandatory programs since last January. For ex-ample, lower projections of Medicare enrollmenthave reduced expected outlays for that program overthe 2002-2011 period by $96 billi on. However, the largest change attributed to technical reestimates isthe additional debt-service costs resulting from tech-nical revisions\u2014a $207 b illion increase over the 2002-2011 period. The Outlook for Federal Debt Federal debt consists of two main components: debtheld by the public and debt held by government ac-counts. Debt held by the public\u2014the most meaning-ful measure of debt in terms of its relationship to theeconomy\u2014is issued by the federal government toraise cash. Debt held by government accounts ispurely an intragovernmental IOU and involves nocash transactions. It is used as an accounting deviceto track cash flows relating to specific federal pro-grams. Debt held by the public and debt held by gov- ernment accounts follow different paths in CBO'sbaseline. The holdings of government accounts haverisen steadily for several decades and are expected tocontinue doing so. Debt held by the public, in con-trast, fluctuates according to changes in the govern- ment's borrowing needs. After falling since 1998,publicly held debt is projected to increase in 2002and 2003 and decline again thereafter (see Table1-4). If current policies remain the same (and the taxcuts in EGTRRA expire as scheduled), debt will fallto 7.4 percent of GDP by 2012. Even before the ex-piration of EGTRRA, debt held by the public is pro-jected to decline to 14.8 percent of GDP in 2010. Debt Held by the Public When revenues are insufficient to cover spending, theDepartment of the Treasury raises money by sellingsecurities in the capital markets to investors. Debtheld by the public represents the accumulation ofthose sales. For example, between 1969 and 1997,the Treasury sold debt to finance deficits, and debtheld by the public climbed each year, peaking at $3.8trillion in 1997. That trend reversed in 1998 with theonset of surpluses. By the end of 2001, debt held bythe public had dropped by $453 billi on, to $3.3 tril- lion. As a percentage of GDP, publicly held debt12 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 1-4.

(which had reached 50 percent as recently as 1993) had fallen to less than 33 percent by 2001. Under current tax and spending policies, CBO's baseline projects that the recent steady decline indebt held by the public will be interrupted briefly asemerging deficits necessitate additional borrowing in2002 and 2003. Publicly held debt is projected tobegin falling again in 2004 under current policies, byamounts roughly equal to the size of future surpluses.It is projected to total less than $1.3 trillion (7.4 per-cent of GDP) by the end of 2012. The Composition of Debt Held by the Public. About 85 percent of publicly held debt consists ofmarketable securities, such as Treasury bills, notes, and bonds and inflation- indexed notes and bonds. The remainder of that debt comprises nonmarketablesecurities (such as savings bonds and state and localgovernment securities), which are nonnegotiable,nontransferable debt instru ments issued to specific investors. The Treasury sells marketable securities in reg- ularly scheduled auctions, although the size of thoseauctions varies according to fluctuations in the govern-ment's cash flow. For some time, the Treasury hasbeen shifting its borrowing toward shorter-term bills and notes. For example, it recently introduced a four-week bill and eliminated the 30-year bond. As aCHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 13 result, the Treasury securities sold to the public now range in maturity from one month to 10 years. Thosechanges may alter the composition of outstandingpublic debt in the future. However, the trend towardshorter-term securities may be offset to some extentif the Treasury curtails its recent program of buyingback bonds before they reach maturity. Why Changes in Debt Held by the Public Do Not Equal the Size of Surpluses and Deficits. In most years, the amount that the Treasury borrows or re-deems approximates the total surplus or deficit.However, a number of factors broadly labeled \"othermeans of financing\" also affect the government'sneed to borrow money from the public. Through theprojection period, public debt is expected to increaseby more than the amount of deficits\u2014and decreaseby less than the amount of surpluses\u2014as other meansof financing activities increase the Treasury's bor-rowing needs. In most years, the largest component of other means of financing is the capitalization of financingaccounts used for federal credit programs. (In 2001,that component accounted for three-fifths of the totalfor other means of financing.) Direct student loans,rural housing programs, loans by the Small BusinessAdministration, and other credit programs require thegovernment to disburse money in anticipation of re-payment at a later date. Those initial outlays are notcounted in the budget, which reflects only the esti-mated subsidy costs of such programs. For the 10years of CBO's current baseline, the amount of theloans being disbursed is typically larger than the re-payments and interest. Thus, the government's an-nual borrowing needs are $11 billion to $17 billiongreater than the annual budget surplus or deficitwould indicate. In 2001, other means of financing led to a net rise in borrowing of $37 billion, about $23 billionmore than in 2000. That change largely resultedfrom higher-than-average increases in a host of fi-nancing activities, including premiums paid in theTreasury's bond buyback program, reestimates ofsubsidies for federal credit programs, payments to theInternational Monetary Fund, and cash balances heldin commercial banks as compensation for financialservices. CBO does not exp ect most of those higher- than-usual increases to recur in future years. In 2002, other means of financing are projected to boost borrowing by $39 billion, about $20 billionmore than in the other years of the projection period.Approximately $16 billion of that increase reflectsthe initial purchase of private securities by the Na-tional Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. (Formore information about that new entity, see Box 4-3in Chapter 4.) The rest of the increase is largely at-tributable to premiums paid in the bond buyback pro-gram, which CBO expects to be scaled back after2002. Debt Held by Government Accounts In addition to the securities it sells to the public, theTreasury has issued about $2.5 trillion in securities tovarious federal government accounts. All of the ma-jor trust funds and many other government funds in-vest in special, nonmarketable Treasury securitiesknown as the government account series. In practicalterms, those securities represent credits to the variousgovernment accounts and are redeemed when fundsare needed to pay benefits and other expenses. In themeantime, the government both pays and collectsinterest on that debt. Debt issued to government accounts is handled within the Treasury and does not flow through thecredit markets. Because those transactions and theinterest accrued on them are intragovernmental, theyhave no direct effect on the economy. The largestbalances of such debt are in the Social Security trustfunds (nearly $1.2 trillion at the end of 2001) and theretirement funds for federal civilian employees ($543billion). The balance of the Social Security trustfunds is projected to rise to $3.8 trillion by 2012 andthe balance of all federal trust funds to more than$5.9 trillion (see Table 1-5). Gross Federal Debt and Debt Subject to Limit Gross federal debt and its companion measure, debt subject to limit, include debt issued to governmentaccounts as well as debt held by the public. The fu-ture path of gross federal debt will be determined bythe interaction of those two components. In CBO's14 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 1-5.

The Treasury's authority to issue debt is re- stricted by a statutory limit set by the Congress. (Thedebt subject to limit is nearly identical to gross fed-eral debt, except that it excludes securities issued byagencies other than the Treasury, such as the Tennes-see Valley Authority.) The current debt ceiling is$5.95 trillion, enacted in August 1997 (see Figure1-4). CBO projects that, unde r current law, debt will exceed that limit sometime this year\u2014possibly asearly as March.Federal Funds and Trust Funds The budget comprises two groups of funds: trust funds and federal funds. Trust funds are those pro-grams explicitly designated as trust funds in law;federal funds include all other transactions with thepublic. Over 60 percent of federal spending comesfrom federal funds. The federal government has more than 200 trust funds, although fewer than a dozen account for thevast share of trust fund dollars. Among the largestare the two Social Security trust funds (the Old-Ageand Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Dis-CHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 15 Aug. Feb. Aug. Feb. Aug. Feb. Aug. Feb. Aug. Feb.

Trust fundshave no particular economic significance; they func-tion primarily as accounting mechanisms to track re-ceipts and spending for programs that have specifictaxes or other revenues earmarked for their use. Trust funds do not hold separate cash balances. When a trust fund receives payroll taxes or other in-come that is not currently needed to pay benefits, theexcess is loaned to the Treasury. If the rest of thebudget is in deficit, the Treasury borrows less fromthe public than it would have to otherwise to finance current operations. If the rest of the budget is in bal-ance or in surplus, the Treasury uses the cash fromtrust fund programs to retire outstanding debt held bythe public. The process is reversed when a trust fund's in- come falls short of its expenses. In that case, the fed-eral government must raise the necessary cash byboosting taxes, reducing other spending, borrowingmore from the public, or (if the total budget is in sur-plus) retiring less debt.Including the cash receipts and expenditures of trust funds in the budget totals with other federal pro-grams is necessary to assess the effect of federal ac-tivities on the economy and capital markets. CBO,the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other fiscal analysts therefore focus on the total sur-plus or deficit. Under current policies, the total deficit is pro- jected to be $21 billion in 2002, which can be dividedinto a federal funds deficit of $243 billion and a trustfund surplus of $222 billion (see Table 1-6). Thatdivision is somewhat misleading, however, becausetrust funds receive much of their income in the formof transfers from federal funds. Such transfers in-crease the federal funds deficit and augment the trustfund surplus. Those intrag overnmental transfers will total $340 b illion in 2002.

Because intragovernmental transfers reallocate costs from one part of the budget to another, they donot change the total surplus or the government's bor-rowing needs. As a result, they have no effect on theeconomy or on the government's future ability to sus-tain spending at the levels indicated by current poli-cies. The Expiration of Budget Enforcement Procedures The rules that have formed the basic framework for budgetary decisionmaking over the past d ecade are set to expire on September 30, at the end of this fiscalyear. Those budget enforcement procedures com-prise annual limits on discretionary appropriationsand a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement for newlaws that affect mandatory spending or revenues.CHAPTER ONE THE BUDGET OUTLOOK 17 They were established by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) and later extensions. Lawmakers are facing the issue of whether, or in what form, to continue that framework at a timewhen the large projected surpluses of recent years aregone. Although, under current policies, the return ofdeficits is projected to be short-lived, the current pro-jections raise some of the same issues of budgetaryconstraint and discipline that led lawmakers to adoptthe framework in the first place. A History of Today's Budget Enforcement Procedures The BEA built on an existing set of budget enforce- ment procedures. The Balanced Budget and Emer-gency Deficit Control Act of 1985 established aschedule of fixed, declining targets for the deficit thatbegan in 1986 and led to a target of zero for 1991.That law also created a procedure\u2014known as se-questration\u2014in which spending for many federalprograms would be automatically cut if the deficit fora fiscal year was estimated to exceed its target. Although deficits shrank somewhat in the late 1980s, they failed to meet the statutory targets\u2014insome years by wide margins. As a result of that fail-ure, the BEA was enacted in the fall of 1990 as partof a plan to reduce deficits by an estimated $500 bil-lion over the 1991-1995 period. 8 Th a t l a w ( w h i c h amended the Deficit Control Act) established newprocedures for deficit control, including annual capson the budget authority and outlays in appropriationacts and a PAYGO procedure to prevent new lawsdealing with mandatory spending or revenues fromincreasing the deficit. Both of those controls were tobe enforced by sequestration: a breach of the discre-tionary spending caps would lead to reductions indiscretionary programs, and a breach of the PAYGOcontrol would trigger cuts in certain mandatory pro-grams. The BEA retained the Deficit Control Act's concept of deficit targets, but it specified that the tar- gets could be adjusted for revisions in economic andtechnical estimates.The BEA's procedures were originally set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1995. But the Con-gress has periodically extended them, most recentlyin the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Currently, themajor provisions of the BEA are set to end on Sep-tember 30, 2002. Those provisions include the dis-cretionary spending limits and related sequestrationprocedures (set out in s ection 251 of the Deficit Con- trol Act) and the process for tracking the costs of leg-islation covered by the PAYGO requirement (under section 252 of the Deficit Control Act). 9 Evaluating the Budget Enforcement Act According to its proponents, the BEA helped provide budgetary discipline for most of the 1990s. From1991 to 1997, total discretionary outlays grew muchmore slowly than the rate of inflation (principally because of significant cuts in defense spending afterthe Cold War). During the same period, new manda-tory spending and revenue laws covered by thePAYGO requirement were estimated to reduce netdeficits. 10 Since enactment of the BEA, only two small sequestrations of discretionary spending havebeen ordered, both in 1991. Beginning in 1998, however, the fiscal environ- ment changed. Large and growing surpluses began toemerge that year. In a time of surpluses, the discre-tionary spending caps and PAYGO requirement 8. The BEA was enacted as title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Recon- ciliation Act of 1990.9. Section 252, which sets out the PAYGO procedure, does not expire at the end of 2002. After that time, however, OMB and CBO willno longer be required to track the budgetary effects of new manda-tory spending and revenue laws for the purpose of enforcing thePAYGO requirement. That tracking\u2014known as the PAYGO score-card\u2014generally records the five-year budgetary effects of all lawscovered by the PAYGO requirement. The termination of that track-ing will effectively shut down the PAYGO system for new laws.However, because section 252 itself does not expire, the possibilityof a sequestration of mandatory spending would continue throughfiscal year 2006 (the year that section 252 and other remaining pro-visions of part C of the Deficit Control Act will expire) for PAYGOlegislation enacted before the end of fiscal year 2002. Thus, anysequestrations after 2002 would occur solely on the basis of the netcosts from legislation enacted before the end of 2002. 10. PAYGO estimates and calculations for that period exclude the bud- getary effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the Taxpayer Relief Act of1997. Those laws, which combined were estimated to reduce defi-cits, included provisions that prohibited their budgetary effectsfrom being counted on the PAYGO scorecard.18 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 (when enforced) generally bar legislative actions that would diminish projected surpluses. As surpluses grew to record-setting levels, those procedures (as extended in 1997) were often circum-vented. For example, in 1999 and 2000, lawmakersenacted record levels of emergency appropriations\u2014which are effectively exempt from the budget en-forcement procedures\u2014and used advance appropria-tions, obligation delays, timing shifts, and other fund-ing devices to increase discretionary spending wellabove the caps set in 1997. For 2001 and 2002, law-makers set new, higher caps to accommodate sub-stantial increases in total discretionary spending. 11 They also eliminated PAYGO balances for thoseyears, removing the need to offset estimated costs of about $11 billion in 2001 and $130 billion in 2002caused by new mandatory spending and tax laws en-acted during the past two years. Despite recent experience, however, the under- lying philosophy of the Budget Enforcement Act\u2014that appropriations should be enacted within enforce-able limits and that the estimated costs of new man-datory spending and tax legislation should generallybe offset\u2014has proved to be effective in the past.Now, with deficits or small surpluses on the horizonfor the next few years, lawmakers may decide thatsuch discipline can again contribute to overall bud-getary restraint. 11. The caps for the discretionary category were raised as part of the Congress's final action on regular appropriation acts for 2001 and2002. The new outlay cap for 2001 was about $60 billion higherthan the one for that year set in 1997 (as adjusted). The new outlaycap for 2002 was about $130 billion higher than the comparable1997 cap (as adjusted).Chapter Two The Economic Outlook The U.S. economy entered a r ecession in 2001, and most forecasters, including the Congres-sional Budget Office, believe that it will prove mild in comparison with mo st past downt urns. How- ever, in the aftermath of the events of September 11,new risks to both the nation and the economy havebecome evident, and policymakers must face the pos-sibility of a significantly different outcome. CBO's forecast of the U.S. economy's most likely path, which is described in this chapter, antici-pates that the recession will be over by the end of thefirst quarter of 2002 (unle ss otherwise specified, all years in this chapter are calendar years). 1 CBO esti- mates that the annual rate of growth of real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product will accelerate from-0.2 percent over the four quarters of 2001 to 2.5 per-cent in 2002 and then quicken further, to 4.3 percent,in 2003 (see Table 2-1). (Chapter 5 explores lesslikely outcomes, both those that are more optimisticand those that are more pessimistic.) The recession ended an economic expansion that was unusual in many ways. At 10 years, fromMarch 1991 to March 2001, it was the longest in the nation's history. 2 Midway through the period, therate of growth of labor productivity sped up signifi- cantly, from an annual average of 1.6 percent, be-tween 1991 and 1995, to 2.6 percent, between 1995and 2000. That acceleration di ffered from the typical pattern, in which productivity growth slows in thelater stages of an expansion. Several factors contrib-uted to that increase in growth, but the most impor-tant was a historically high level of business invest-ment, spurred by stunning technological advances in information technology (computers, peripherals, soft-ware, and communications equipment) and a surge instock prices, which reduced the cost of capital. The10-year expansion was also unusual in that the rapidgrowth of productive capacity at home, together with excess capacity overseas, kept inflation from pickingup as much as it ordinarily does in the later stages ofexpansions. Just as the economy's behavior in the 1990s was unusual, the current recession has been out of theordinary. Expansions typically end after imbalancesbuild up in the economy. Prior to most of the ninerecessions that have occurred since World War II, theimbalance\u2014which was reflected in rising rates ofinflation\u2014had been a level of overall demand thatexceeded overall supply. Monetary tightening in re-sponse to the inflation then helped trigger those re-cessions. At the end of the 1990s, however, the pri-mary imbalance seems to have arisen not from anexcess of demand over supply but from overly opti-mistic expectations of the future profitability of new 1. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is a significant decl ine in activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, visible in industrial pro-duction, employment, real income, and wholesale-retail trade. Aneconomic expansion is the period between the end of one recessionand the beginning of the next. Recessions and expansions are bothphases of what economists term the business cycle. 2. The previous expansion, lasting from December 1982 to July 1990, was the second-longest peacetime expansion in the nation's history.(The second-longest expansion overall lasted from February 1961 toDecember 1969.) The NBER maintains the chronology of U.S.business cycles. For the annual record from 1790 to 1855, see Geoffrey H. Moore and Victor Zarnowitz, \"Appendix A: TheDevelopment and Role of the National Bureau of Economic Re-search's Business Cycle Chronologies,\" in Robert J.

Those expectations, which were particu- larly out of balance for companies that were produc-ing and intensively using information technology,drove both stock prices and levels of business fixedinvestment (spending on st ructures, equipment, and software) higher than was merited in retrospect. As a result, investment plunged beginning late in 2000. A sharp drop in profit margins, probablytied to excess capacity stemming from overoptimism,has worsened that fall. While this recession has beenmild so far, the contraction in the share of GDPclaimed by corporate profits is expected to be one of the worst since World War II. Further hurting production is that businesses have reduced their investment in inventory, espe-cially for items that are used to produce new equip-ment. As the growth of in come slowed in response to weaker production and households' equity wealtheroded, the rate of growth of consumption also slack-ened, but not by as much as did GDP growth. At the same time, the growth of foreign economies began toflag, worsening the downturn in this country by re- ducing demand for U.S. exports. The terrorist attacks on September 11 weakened demand still more in an already vulnerable economy.Some industries, such as airlines, hotels, and othertravel-related businesses, were directly affected.Consumers lost confidence and cut back their spend-ing on other items as well. \"Spreads\" (or differences)between the interest rates on corporate and govern-ment debt widened noticeably\u2014the financial mar-kets' signal that risk had increased\u2014while stockprices fell; both outcomes raised the cost of funds forbusiness investment. Firms both within and outsidethe travel sector cut payrolls, and the unemploymentrate jumped. Since September, however, many ofthose effects on the demand side of the economyhave been partly or even fully reversed. Other unusual features of the recession\u2014chiefly the rapidity of policymakers' responses, the moderat-ing behavior of prices, and an early reduction of in-ventories\u2014support CBO's expectation that the cur-rent downturn will not be severe. During 2001, theFederal Reserve cut the federal funds rate (the ratebanks charge for overnight loans) 11 times, from 6.5percent to 1.75 percent. Those cuts probably kept thestock market from sinking further than it did. Theyalso bolstered the housing market and auto sales byputting downward pressure on mortgage interest ratesand making it easier for automakers to offer new-carfinancing of zero percent late last year. On the fiscalside, the tax cuts that became effective in mid-2001helped prevent consumption from slowing more thanit did, and additional federal spending in response tothe terrorist attacks will boost GDP in 2002. Large declines in the prices of oil and natural gas and a lack of pressure on the prices of other itemshave propped up consumption by boosting real dis-posable income. Although the price picture indicates some erosion in firms' profit margins, which may behurting investment, the net impact of the low rate ofinflation is probably positive. Also to the good isthat businesses began to reduce inventories earlier inthis recession than they di d in past slowdowns, hurt- ing production last year but setting the stage forstronger production this year. Additional reasons foroptimism about the relative moderateness of the re-cession include the general health of the financialCHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 21 system and recent monthly indicators of recovery, including a downward tre nd, between October 2001 and early 2002, in initial claims for unemploymentinsurance. The unique character of the recession also bol- sters CBO's view that the ensuing recovery will bemodest. Since the level of residential constructionand purchases of consumer durable goods (such ascars and appliances) have not fallen as much as theyhave in other recessions, they are not likely to re-bound as much when growth returns. Moreover, thelingering presence of significant excess capacity willslow the recovery in busin ess investment. Continued economic weakness overseas means that exportgrowth will also be lower than it was during otherrecoveries. CBO forecasts that, in the near term (that is, the next two years), weak grow th in GDP, translated into weak growth in employment, will push the unem-ployment rate higher but also restrain inflation. For2002, CBO expects the unemployment rate to jumpto 6.1 percent, after averaging 4.8 percent in 2001 and just 4.0 percent in 2000 (see Table 2-2 and Fig-ure 2-1). The stronger growth that CBO forecasts forthe economy in 2003 trims unemployment to 5.9 per-cent. And the rate of inflation faced by consumers,as measured by the growth of the consumer price in-dex for urban consumers (CPI-U), falls from 2.9 per-cent in 2001 to 1.8 percent this year. Lower pricesfor oil account for most of that forecast decline, al-though the recession also plays a role. As oil pricesstabilize, inflation bounces back to 2.5 percent in 2003. CBO's and other forecasters' predictions of a mild recession and weak recovery may founder, how-ever, on the uncertainties that accompany the unusualeconomic patterns of recent years. The possibility ofeither a stronger recovery or, indeed, a much deeperdownturn than CBO foreca sts cannot be discounted. Forecasters' lack of experience with this type of re-cession also means that there are fewer precedentsfor forecasting the recovery, which increases the un-certainty of their estimates. 3 In addition, other ex-traordinary events\u2014such as another terrorist attack in the United States or turmoil in the Middle East thatcauses a severe and sustained rise in oil prices\u2014could deepen or prolong the economy's downturn. Looking out over the medium term (approxi- mately the next decade), CBO expects the growth ofreal GDP (production, or output) to average 3.1 per-cent. That projection for the 2002-2012 period isroughly the same as the projection CBO made in Jan-uary 2001 for the 2002-2011 period. Nonetheless,the level of real GDP is lower over the 2002-2011period in CBO's current forecast than in last Janu-ary's, for two reasons. First, actual GDP fell muchfarther in 2001 than CBO expected last January. Sec-ond, the average rate of growth of potential GDP inthe medium term is slightly lower in the current fore- cast than in last January's because CBO expects pro-ductivity to grow somewhat less rapidly than it pro-jected last winter. 4 That lower growth results from less business investment and an altered view of thesize of the computer sector: CBO no longer expectsthat component of the economy, with its high rate ofproductivity growth, to constitute as large a share ofGDP during the next decade as it expected last Janu-ary that it would. Recent Economic Developments The economy had already begun to contract before the events of September 11, a downturn that mighteven have been deep enough to qualify as a recessionwithout the attacks. A collapse in investment was thesingle most important source of weakness. Draw-downs in inventories, faltering foreign economies,and increased caution among consumers and inves-tors added to the difficulties. Nonetheless, the slow-down was unusual in that business investment playedsuch an important role. As the economy entered re-cession during the first half of 2001, growth of GDP 3. For an assessment of CBO's economic forecasts, see CBO's Eco- nomic Forecasting Record , which will appear shortly on CBO's Web site (www.cbo. gov).4. Potential GDP is the highest level of real gross domestic product that could persist for a substantial period without raising the rate ofinflation. CBO estimates potential GDP using projections of labor;capital; and total factor productivity, which is the average real out-put per unit of combined labor and capital inputs.22 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 2-2.

The Economic Forecast and Projections SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis; Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Board. NOTES: All data are annual values; percentage changes are year over year. The trough of the current recession is assumed to be in the first quarter of 2002. a. The change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, applying the current methodology to historical price data (CP I-U-RS). slowed to 0.8 percent from an annual rate of 4.0 per- cent in the first half of 2000. The terrorist attacks on September 11 dealt an- other blow to an already faltering economy. Inves-tors, consumers, and businesses lost confidence. Asa result, stock prices fell, consumers bought less, andfirms sharply reduced orders for new equipment.Lower demand in turn led businesses to reduce their workforces. Although many of the in itial ec onomic effects of the attacks have faded, the economy at theend of 2001 was still weaker than it was before theattacks. How much of that additional weaknessstems from the events of September 11 and howmuch reflects trends already in place before the at-tacks occurred is difficult to determine.24 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Business Fixed Investment and Inventories A dramatic downward shift in the rate of growth of business fixed investment and inventories was theprimary cause of the recession. Real nonresidentialfixed investment fell by 5.8 percent in the year end-ing in the third quarter of 2001, after an upward surgeof 10.2 percent in the prior four-quarter period. Dur-ing the first three quarters of 2001, businesses drewdown their inventories at an annual rate of $42 bil-lion, after building them at an annual rate of $51 bil-lion in 2000. The downturn in business fixed invest-ment and inventories accounted for 3.7 of the 4.7percentage points of slowing in the year-over-yeargrowth rate of the economy between the second quar-ter of 2000 and the third quarter of 2001 (see Figure2-2). Figure 2-2. Growth in Real GDP SOURCES: Congressi onal B udget Office; Department of Com- merce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. NOTE: Business investment includes business fixed investment (spending on structures, equipment, and software) andthe change in business inventories. Several factors contributed to the decline in in- vestment, but the most infl uential was probably over- investment in plant and equipment during the late1990s and early 2000. Overly optimistic expecta- tions of future growth in demand, which were re-flected in inflated stock prices, led businesses to in- vest in new plant and equipment at levels that appearexcessive in hindsight. In addition, many firms in theinformation technology (IT) sector invested ahead ofdemand, in an attempt to be first in new Internet andother IT markets. Even though not all such firmswere overinvesting, they were all investing at an un-sustainable pace. And while overinvestment in infor-mation technology appears to have been especiallypronounced, there is some evidence of overinvest-ment in other types of equipment as well. The decline in investment since early 2000 can be seen as comprising two steps. First, investmenthas declined from an unsustainably high rate to amore sustainable one. Second, businesses have tem-porarily reduced investment below that sustainable rate to work off the excess capacity that built upwhile they were overinvesting. Analysts' estimatesof the cumulative level of business overinvestment ininformation technology alone during the late 1990sand 2000, also known as the IT investment overhang,range from near zero to almost $200 billion\u2014com-pared with an annual rate of investment in informa- tion technology of roughly $350 billion. CBO's im- plicit assumption about the amount of the overhang isthat it falls in the middle of analysts' estimates. Financial developments since early 2000 exac- erbated the drop in firms' investment in plant andequipment. For example, the difference between theinterest rates on private and government debt, whichprivate borrowers must pay lenders to compensate fortheir greater risk of default, grew as the perceiveddefault risk rose. Rates surged on speculative-gradesecurities (debt carrying some risk of default or non-payment at maturity), which boosted the cost of capi-tal for firms that rely on such debt. Even for busi-nesses issuing investment-grade debt (which offers ahigh level of security of repayment at maturity), thespread between the interest rate those firms had topay and the rate the government paid widened\u2014which meant that the yields on corporate debt fell byless than the yields on Treasury debt (see Figure 2-3).A further development, reported in surveys by theFederal Reserve, was that banks' loan officers tight-ened lending standards and terms for business cus-tomers as a result of the uncertain economic outlook,reducing the availability of bank loans at any giveninterest rate. Moreover, falling profits last year re-CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 25 Figure 2-3. Interest Rate Spreads SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions credit indexes.

Breaks in data, most notably those after September 11, 2001, indicate days on which the bond markets were closed.duced cash flow for many businesses, further limiting their ability to finance new investment. The attacks on September 11 temporarily wors- ened those adverse financial conditions and increaseduncertainty, which curbed investment still further.Investor confidence plummeted, pushing the Standard& Poor's 500 stock index dow n by almost 12 percent between September 10 and September 21. (TheNASDAQ and Dow Jones industrial indexes fell byeven larger percentage amounts.) The spread be-tween yields on corporate securities (both specula-tive- and investment-grade) and Treasury bonds wid-ened further. In that environment of diminished ex-pectations, orders for nondefense capital goodsplunged by 13 percent in September, to their lowestlevel since August 1995. Although by mid-Novem-ber the major stock market indexes were back towhere they had been before the attack and spreads forcorporate bonds had receded nearly to their formerlevels, orders for nondefense capital goods crept upby just 6 percent in October and 5 percent in Novem-ber, leaving orders below where they had been in Au-gust. Shipments of nondefense capital goods alsoremained below their August levels in November. Adverse financial conditions prevailing since September 11 have probably also hurt demand fornew nonresidential structures. Vacancy rates forcommercial and industrial space have climbed sincethe end of 2000, as the economy has slowed. Al-though rising levels of investment in oil-drillingstructures, in response to hi gher oil prices, kept over- all construction growing through early 2001, invest-ment in new structures ha s fallen sharply since then. The reduction in inventories seen over the past year is primarily a reaction to slower sales, especiallyof IT equipment. For example, manufacturers ofcomputers and electronic pr oducts held only 13 per- cent of total manufacturing inventories in January2001, but they accounted for 31 percent of the reduc-tion in those inventories through November 2001.Slowing sales also led wholesalers and retailers toreduce inventories last year. Auto dealers made espe-cially large cuts. In addition, the ratio of inventoriesto sales rose somewhat in 2000, which produced aninventory overhang at the beginning of 2001 thatbusinesses have since been working off.26 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Consumer Spending and Residential Investment The rate of growth of consumption has also slowed since 2000, although the slowdown to date has beenmuch less severe than in most other recessions (seeFigure 2-4). Before September 11, real consumerspending was still growing, albeit more slowly thanin 2000. From January to August 2001, real con-sumption rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent, downfrom growth of 4.8 percent during 2000 (measuredyear over year) and 5.0 percent in 1999. Figure 2-4. Real Consumer Spending SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Com- merce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. Several factors account for the sagging growth in consumer spending prior to the attacks. In linewith the stalling economy, pretax income grew moreslowly in 2001 than in 2000. In additi on, the rapid rise in equity wealth from higher stock prices, whichhad helped fuel the growth in consumption in recentyears, stopped abruptly in 2000, then swung into re-verse. That about-face played a major role in haltingthe steady decline in the saving rate (which had re-flected faster growth in consumption than in income).More recently, tighter standards for consumer lend-ing may also have slowed the growth of consumption slightly.In fact, if those factor s had been the only influ- ences on consumption over the past year, the slow-down would have been more severe than it was. In-stead, three other factors helped support consumerspending. First, last summer's tax legislation boosteddisposable income, offsetting some of the income lostthrough lower growth of wages and salaries. Second,rising home prices cushione d the blow to household wealth from lower stock prices. Third, low mortgagerates encouraged many homeowners to refinancetheir mortgages. Those refinancings have allowedhouseholds to consume some of their newfound hous-ing wealth; according to Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise that provides funding to thehome mortgage market, more than half of the home-owners who refinanced durin g the first three quarters of 2001 took out at least 5 percent of their equity. For a short time, the terrorist attacks on Septem- ber 11 sent consumer confidence and consumer out-lays reeling. The University of Michigan's index ofconsumer sentiment fell from 92 in August to just 72during the second half of September, producing oneof the largest monthly declines ever. Consumer con-fidence, as measured by the Conference Board (abusiness information group), also dropped. The linkbetween consumption and confidence is not alwaysclose, but in this instance, it was: real consumerspending fell by 1.2 percent (monthly rate) duringSeptember, the biggest monthly decline in almost 15years. Travel was especially hard hit, as real spend-ing nosedived for domestic airline travel (down 35percent), foreign travel ( down 28 percent), hotels and motels (down 15 percent), and spectator amusements(down 17 percent). In addition, real outlays for dura-ble goods declined by almost 3 percent, and outlaysfor clothing and shoes tumbled almost 5 percent. Since then, consumers have overcome much of the initial shock of the attack s. According to the Uni- versity of Michigan's index, by the end of October,consumers regained about half of the confidence theyhad lost during the second half of September, andthey regained most of the rest by December. Con-sumer spending also rebounded, growing by 2.3 per-cent in October, an upswing that was spearheaded bya sharp rise in sales of light vehicles. (That categoryincludes such vehicles as cars, minivans, and pickuptrucks.) Offers of zero-percent financing by auto-makers pushed sales of such vehicles up by 34 per-CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 27 cent in October, to a record annual rate of 21.3 mil- lion. Moreover, sales of light vehicles in Novemberand December remained above their levels of a yearearlier. Excluding those sales, consumption rose by0.8 percent in October and 0.2 percent in November,but it remained below August's level. Because auto-makers made only minor changes in how much theywere producing, the sales led mainly to lower inven-tories rather than to higher GDP growth. Unlike consumer spending growth, the growth of real residential cons truction actually accelerated during most of 2001, averaging 5.6 percent annuallyduring the first three quarters of 2001 after a slightdecline in 2000. Normally, real residential construc-tion falls during the early stages of a recession, butuntil a drop in November 2001, it had held up well. At the end of 2001, indicators for the housing marketwere giving mixed signals. In October, permits fornew units fell to their lowest level since 1997, butthey jumped back in November to levels similar tothose before September 11. If the November jumpwas due mainly to unseasonably warm weather andnot to improving demand for new homes, residentialconstruction is likely to contract in coming months.But barring further major shocks, analysts do not an- ticipate a collapse. Monetary Policy In response to accumulating signs of economic weak-ness, the Federal Reserve eased monetary policy sub-stantially in 2001, cutting the target for the federalfunds rate from 6.5 percent in the first days of Janu-ary to 1.75 percent in mid-December (see Figure2-5). It was unusual for the central bank to act pre-emptively by cutting the rate noticeably even beforethe official start of the recession. A key factor that made such action easier was the low inflation in theeconomy\u2014in part the result of excess capacity\u2014asthe recession began. Indeed, the same overinvest-ment that helped cause the downturn may also havehelped pave the way for an aggressive response ofmonetary policy. However, several factors have muted the ability of those rate cuts to halt the downturn. First, long-term interest rates have fallen over the past 12months by less than one might expect, given the de- Figure 2-5. The Federal Funds Rate SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Federal Reserve Board. NOTE: The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge for overnight loans.28 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 cline in short-term rates; in some cases, they have even risen. Whether they have been sluggish becausebondholders expect only a brief recession, becausebondholders are demanding a risk premium for infla-tion (in the form of higher interest rates) as a result ofthe easier monetary policy, because foreign long-termrates have fallen by only a little, or because the out-look for the federal surplus has deteriorated over thepast year is unclear. Second, stock prices fell lastyear instead of rising, which further neutralized theimpact of lower short-term rates on businesses' costof capital. Third, dimming prospects for foreign eco-nomic growth have kept the dollar from falling withthe plunge in short-term rates. The dollar's strengthhas kept U.S. goods from becoming more competitivewith foreign goods, which means that another tradi-tional channel by which monetary policy may affectthe economy has been blocked. Finally, when excesscapacity is unusually large, interest rate cuts may beless effective in boosting investment than they typi-cally are. As a result of all those factors, the FederalReserve saw the balance of risks at the end of 2001as still mainly on the side of economic weakness. International Trade The trade sector has not played its usual stabilizingrole in this recession. The growth of real exports typ-ically holds up during recessions, while weak domes-tic demand reduces imports, causing a rise in real netexports that partially offsets weakness in other cate-gories of GDP. This time, however, foreign econo-mies withered in tandem with the United States', andreal exports fell by 9.0 percent between the thirdquarters of 2000 and 2001, preventing real net ex-ports from rising (see Figure 2-6). Although thenominal trade deficit narrowed over that period, theimprovement stemmed from a stronger dollar andlower oil prices rather than from an increase in realnet exports. The synchronous global downturn is an-other reason that the recovery from the current reces-sion is likely to be relatively weak and the risk of alonger recession cannot be ruled out (see Box 2-1). The global economy has been buffeted by the recessionary impact of three shocks\u2014the oil pricehike of 1999 and early 2000, a sharp pullback in in-vestment since 2000, and the terrorist attacks of Sep-Figure 2-6.

Countries that depend heavily on foreign direct investment tofinance purchases of new plant and equipment havebeen particularly hard hit by investors' heightenedsensitivity to risk after the attacks. (In foreign directinvestment, the party investing in a foreign countryretains control of the investment.) Economic conditions are worst in Asia and the Americas, but they are also troubling in Europe. Ja-pan's economy, the largest in Asia, is mired in itsthird recession in a decade and probably its most se-vere in 20 years. Many other Asian economies, un-able to sustain solid growth after the regional crisis in 1997 and 1998, have also entered their worst reces- sion in years. The collapse of the high-tech sectorand the sharp slowdown in U.S. demand have beendevastating for Asia's export-dependent economies,especially those that are most closely linked to theproduction of information t echnology, such as Singa- pore and Taiwan. In addition, the depreciation of theyen is now making it hard for emerging Asian econo-mies to stage a comeback. In the Americas, Canada'sand Mexico's economies have also been buffeted bythe global slowdown and the U.S. recession. Argen-tina's situation is even more dire. After entering itsfourth year of recession, Argentina devalued its cur-CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 29 Box 2-1. How the Global Downturn Could Affect Economic Recovery in the United States Whether the slowdown in the world economy is tech- nically a recession depends on the yardstick one uses, but most analysts agree that the global economy is inits weakest state since at least the 1982 recession. Forthe first time since 1974, the world's three biggesteconomies\u2014those of the United States, Japan, andGermany\u2014are contracting simultaneously. In addi-tion, a number of countries (for example, Japan, HongKong, Taiwan, China, and Argentina) are in the gripof deflation, or a decline in the general level of prices. Although weak foreign economies probably helped sustain the U.S. economy's recent expansion\u2014by providing financial capital and a low-cost source ofimports\u2014the current global downturn deepened lastyear's recession in the United States and could eventhreaten this y ear's anticipated recovery. Economic growth in the United States can bounce back morequickly and more strongly in an environment of robusteconomic growth abroad than in an environment ofglobal slowdown. If a U.S. downturn occurs during aforeign boom, U.S. exports will rise and imports willfall, boosting net exports and thus this country's gross domestic product. Net exports stop playing that cush-ioning role, however, when the world is in a synchro-nous downturn. In that cas e, both exports and imports fall, in line with slowing demand in the United Statesand overseas. That has been true in the current reces-sion, as real (inflation-adju sted) net exports have re- mained fairly constant, instead of rising as they did inmost recessions in the past.During a global recession, the United States is also more vulnerable to a worldwide financial crisis,which could develop at an alarming speed. U.S. in-vestors hold substantial assets abroad; if many foreigncountries began to default on their international debts, investors could incur large losses. Indeed, the risk ofsystemic financial turmoil that could adversely affectall countries, including th e United States, probably increases amid a global downturn. The world\u2014andthe United States\u2014are also vulnerable during a globalrecession to a surge of prot ectionism that could hinder recovery, such as that seen during the Great Depres-sion. Although the current worldwide recession has increased the probability of certain adverse outcomes,it has also led to two developments that offer reasonsfor cautious optimism: the reversal of the global oilprice shock and the countercyclical conduct of eco-nomic policy in the United States and abroad. Thedrop in worldwide demand for energy that began atthe end of 2000 has more than offset any concernsabout shortages in supply. In addition, many foreigncountries\u2014for example, Canada, the United Kingdom,Switzerland, Taiwan, and S outh Korea\u2014have aggres- sively eased both monetary and fiscal policy. Eventhe conservative European Central Bank lowered itskey interest rate by 150 ba sis points last year. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.)Those developments have helped mitigate the severityof the current downturn. rency and defaulted on its foreign debt at the end of last year. It now faces what could become a wave ofbankruptcies. Even West ern Europe, which is on a more solid economic footing than other regions are,saw its rate of GDP growth skid from 3.4 percent in2000 to about 1.5 percent in 2001. The worldwide plunge in business investment has hit U.S. imports and exports of capital goods es-pecially hard. A drop in imports of nonautomotivecapital goods accounted for 74 percent of the declinein real imports during the first three quarters of 2001,even though they cons tituted only 24 percent of all imports at the end of 2000. Capital goods also madeup a disproportionate share of the fall in exports.Labor Markets U.S. labor markets have deteriorated markedly overthe past year (see Figure 2-7). The unemploymentrate had already drifted up to 4.3 percent in March2001, the final month of the expansion, from a low of3.9 percent in October 2000. Between March andSeptember 2001, the unemployment rate rose by an-other 0.7 percentage points, to 5.0 percent. But eventhat higher rate was low by historical standards. Be- tween March and September, total nonfarm employ-ment fell by 424,000 jobs. The drop in private non-farm employment alone was nearly twice as large butwas partially offset by government hiring. The man-ufacturing sector accounted for almost all of the de-30 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Figure 2-7.

Lower demand after the terrorist attacks in Sep- tember led businesses to further reduce their work-forces. In October, the first month to fully registerconditions in the labor markets after September 11,the unemployment rate jumped to 5.4 percent. 5 The markets continued to deteriorate for the rest of theyear, and the unemployment rate climbed to 5.8 per-cent in December. Nonfarm employment fell bymore than 900,000 jobs between September and De-cember. Job losses were spread across many sectors,but travel-related and ma nufacturing industries suf- fered disproportionately, as did temporary workershired through agencies. Inflation Consumer price inflation excluding food and energy (which is also known as the core CPI-U) has beenremarkably stable for many years, in contrast to thepattern typically seen at the end of economic expan-sions in the past. The year-to-year growth in the coreCPI-U has remained between 2.0 percent and 2.8 per- cent since 1996. Through the middle of last year,after the slowdown had begun, core CPI-U inflationwas only 2.7 percent. Usually, inflation accelerates late in an expan- sion, as unemployment falls and the rate of utilizationof firms' capacity to produce rises. But the expan-sion of the late 1990s was unusual in that it was ac-companied by a rapid increase in both domestic pro-ductive capacity and foreign supply. Growth in totalfactor productivity (TFP)\u2014the productivity of bothlabor and capital together\u2014accelerated, and boominginvestment pushed the capital stock higher. In addi-tion, the percentage of domestic demand met by for-eign suppliers increased, and the prices of importsremained low. Annual grow th in the overall CPI-U, measured fourth quarter ov er fourth quarter, slowed to 2.2 percent during 2001 from 3.4 percent during2000, as energy prices changed course, shifting froma rapid increase to a rapid decline. CBO's Economic Forecast for 2002 and 2003 CBO forecasts that growth of real GDP will rebound to 2.5 percent in 2002 (measured fourth quarter overfourth quarter) as the economy emerges from reces-sion early in the year and will then accelerate to 4.3percent in 2003 (see Table 2-1 on page 20). Thus,CBO expects a mild recession and a subdued recov-ery, by historical standard s (see Box 2-2). Inflation is likely to remain moderate: CBO estimates that theCPI-U will climb by 2.3 percent over the four quar-ters of this year and by 2.5 percent next year. Short-term interest rates in CBO's forecast begin to rise inmid-2002, as economic growth picks up, but they arelower on average in 2002 than in 20 01. Those rates then continue to climb in 2003. CBO expects long-term rates to be somewhat higher in 2003 than in2002. CBO's current for ecast for 2002 and 2003 is much weaker than the forecast it published in January2001, reflecting both the economy's slide into reces-sion and a reduction of GDP in the national incomeand product accounts (NIPAs) following last year's 5. The September data do not reflect conditions following the attack because a person who was employed at any time from September 9to September 15 was considered employed during the month.CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 31 Box 2-2. How Does This Recession Compare with Others? In the view of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the current recession will be mild comparedwith the nine previous recessions since 1947. In fact,if CBO's forecast comes to pass, the decline in eco-nomic activity in this recession and the rise in the un-employment rate will be close to the smallest in thepost-World War II period. During the nine previousrecessions, gross domestic product (GDP), after ad-justment for inflation, dropped from its peak to itstrough (or lowest point) by an average of 2.1 percent,but CBO's forecast for the current slowdown indicates a drop of only 0.6 percent. By that measure, only therecession of 1970 was as mild. At the end of the cur-rent downturn, CBO expects, the percentage differ-ence between actual GDP and its trend level (knownas potential GDP) will be smaller than at the end ofmost recessions in the past (see the figure). Similarly, CBO anticipates that the jump in the unemployment rate in this recession will be smallerthan that in most past downturns. In CBO's forecast,the unemployment rate rises to a quarterly high of 6.2percent by the middle of this year, compared with anactual quarterly low of 4.0 percent in late 2000. Thatincrease of 2.2 percentage points is less than the hikesseen in seven of the previ ous nine recessions. Only in the downturns of 1960 and 1980 did the unemploy-ment rate increase by a smaller amount. CBO alsoexpects that the unemployment rate will peak at a level that is lower than the peak experienced in most reces- sions in the past.

NOTE: The potential output gap is the percent age differ- ence between real GDP and CBO's estimate ofpotential GDP. annual revision by the Commerce Department's Bu- reau of Economic Analysis. (CBO uses data from the NIPAs to prepare its forecast.) For 2002, growth ofreal GDP in CBO's current outlook is more than 2percentage points lower, the level of real GDP is al-most 5 percent lower, and the unemployment rate av-erages 1.6 percentage points higher than in its Janu-ary 2001 for ecast (see Table 2-2 on page 22). Al- though CBO's estimate now of the growth of GDP in 2003 is higher than last January's, its estimate of thelevel of GDP is lower. The estimate of consumerprice inflation in the current forecast is also lowerthan in last January's, especially for 2002, because ofboth a drop in energy prices and a weaker economy.The Federal Reserve's rate cuts in 2001 led to esti-mates of short-term interest rates that are much lowerfor 2002 and slightly lower for 2003; the forecast forlong-term rates is also slightly lower for 2002 but the same for 2003. CBO's current estimate of corporateprofits is down sharply from last January's, reflectingan unexpectedly large drop in profits in 2001. CBO'sdownward revisions of the projected growth of GDP are in line with a consensus of private forecasts (seeTable 2-3). Growth of Real GDP CBO's short-term forecast for real GDP rests on theassumption that the recession will end by early 2002,with recovery beginning before midyear. During theearly part of this year, CBO estimates, business fixedinvestment and exports will continue to decline, con-sumption will slow as zero-percent financing for32 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 2-3.

By mid-2002, however,the primary cause of the recession, the downturn ininvestment, will have finally run its course, and pro-duction and income will rise as businesses stop cut-ting inventories. Increased federal spending will alsohelp put growth back on track. The recovery willgather steam as exports, consumption, and residentialconstruction begin to grow and businesses restocktheir inventories. Although CBO's forecast anticipates that con- sumption and housing will slow in early 2002, both should be growing again by midyear, if not before.Zero-percent financing boosted sales of new lightvehicles in the fourth quarter of 2001\u2014but probably at the expense of future sales. Thus, real consump-tion is likely to fall in the first quarter of 2002. Afterthat, CBO estimates that it will rise along with realincome, or even somewhat faster, as greater confi-dence among consumers adds to spending. Residen-tial construction will follow a similar pattern, CBOforecasts, falling early in 2002 but rebounding withconsumers' renewed confidence about the future.Real business fixed investment will probably continue to decline during early 2002 but then beginto grow moderately again. By the end of 2001, asFigure 2-8 shows, investment had fallen by enough tobring the corporate financing gap down closer to itshistorical average. (The corporate financing gap is a measure of firms' capital expenditures minus theirinternal funds, and thus i ndicates the amount of fund- ing they must raise from outside the corporate sec-tor.) Also by the end of 2001, investment haddropped low enough to eventually draw down theexcess capacity built up during the late 1990s. How-ever, given the high levels of excess capacity thatmany firms still experience, the drawdown is notover, so few prospects exist for rapid growth of in-vestment. Consequently, in terms of investment, thisrecovery is likely to be one of the weakest of thepostwar period, with real business fixed investmentprojected to remain below its peak (in the fourthquarter of 2000) until late 2003. The federal budget will add to the growth of GDP in 2002 as a result of legislation passed in re-sponse to the terrorist att acks, automatic stabilizers, and the continued effect on consumption of last Figure 2-8.

NOTE: The corporate financing gap is measured as capital ex- penditures minus internal funds minus the inventory val-uation adjustment for the nonfarm, nonfinancial corpo-rate business sector.CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 33 year's tax cuts.6 CBO expects growth of real federal consumption and gross investment to pick up in 2002but then to slow somewhat in 2003. Personal taxrates on average will be lower in 2002 than in 2001.However, state and local governments are likely tocontribute little help to GDP growth in 2002, becausemany of them will probably cut back spending in re-sponse to paltry increases in revenues. Firms' investment in inventories will strongly augment GDP growth, whereas international tradewill be a net drag, CBO forecasts. During 2001, thereduction in inventories meant that real GDP grewmore slowly than did final sales. However, with thevery low levels of inventory that firms are now hold-ing, any rebound in sales will trigger a buildup ininventory, causing GDP to grow more rapidly thansales in 2002. Although real exports are expected to start growing again by mid-2002, CBO forecasts that netexports will hold down real GDP growth in 2002 and2003. The primary reason is that the economic re-coveries of important U.S. customers\u2014for example,the European nations\u2014are likely to lag behind theU.S. recovery. Japan, in particular, will remain inrecession in 2002, according to the InternationalMonetary Fund and the Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development. Thus, imports willrebound faster than will U.S. exports, reducing GDP.In addition, the appreciation of the dollar during 2001will modestly hurt real net exports by making U.S.products less competitive. Unemployment In CBO's forecast, the recession pushes unemploy-ment higher in 2002 than it was in 2001. CBO ex-pects that the unemployment ra te will rise to an aver- age of 6.1 percent in 2002, up from 4.8 percent in2001. As actual GDP begins to grow faster than po-tential GDP in 2003, the unemployment rate will easeback to 5.9 percent.Inflation Inflation, as measured by the CPI-U, slows to just 1.8percent in CBO's forecast for 2002 (down from 2.9percent in 2001) before rebounding to 2.5 percent for2003, as energy prices stabilize. Several factors un-derlie that benign forecast. First, the rate of price in-crease was already low as the recession began. Sec-ond, a weak ec onomy will keep that rate down by both restraining demands for higher wages and limit-ing businesses' ability to pass on any increase incosts to their customers. Third, falling oil prices will reduce the prices of energy and of goods and servicesthat are produced using energy. CBO expects that oilprices will be lower on average in 2002 than in 2001.In 2003, inflation is likely to pick up, primarily be-cause energy prices will be stable instead of falling. Interest Rates CBO forecasts that the Federal Reserve will gradu-ally raise short-term interest rates as the economyrecovers to prevent it from overheating and, thus,inflation from rising. Nevertheless, short-term inter-est rates are likely to remain relatively low over mostof the next two years. CBO expects that the rate onthree-month Treasury bills will average just 2.2 per-cent in 2002, roughly 1 percentage point less than in2001 and much lower than in 2000. As the growth ofGDP quickens its pace in 2003, the short-term ratewill rebound to 4.5 percent. Long-term rates typically fluctuate less than short-term rates do, and that is likely to be true againduring the forecast period. CBO expects the rate on10-year Treasury notes to average 5.0 percent in2002\u2014as it did in 2001. In 2003, CBO forecasts, therate will rise by 0.5 percentage points, which com-pares with a rise of 2.3 percentage points in short-term rates. Comparison of Two-Year Forecasts Overall, CBO's forecast for 2002 is similar to theBlue Chip consensus forecast published in January 2002 (see Table 2-4). (The consensus is an averageof roughly 50 private-sector forecasts.) CBO's esti-mate of GDP growth, relative to that in the Blue Chip6. In general, automatic stabilizers are factors that dampen the impact on GDP of a drop in demand. In the context of fiscal policy, auto-matic stabilizers are those provisions of tax law and the budget,such as the income-based tax system and unemployment insurance,that partially offset losses in pretax income arising from a drop indemand, thus reducing the consequent fall in consumption.34 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 2-4.

The consumer price index for all urban consumers.CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 35 forecast, is somewhat lower for 2002 but higher for 2003. Even so, CBO's forecast of unemployment isidentical to that of the consensus for 2002 and 0.2percentage points higher than the Blue Chip 's con- sensus for 2003. The two forecasts are similar intheir estimates of consumer price inflation and long-term interest rates, but CBO expects slightly lowerGDP price inflation in 2002 and higher short-terminterest rates in 2003. Why CBO Is Forecasting a Mild Recession CBO expects that the current recession will be mild, for several reasons. A prominent one is that the Fed-eral Reserve has already eased monetary policy ag-gressively, and the low inflation that prevailed as therecession began will give the central bank room to dostill more without worrying about exacerbating infla-tion in the near term. Analysts usually expect a lagof six to 18 months between a change in interest ratesand its impact on GDP; consequently, some effects ofpast easing are probably still in the pipeline. Legisla-tion following the attacks, automatic stabilizers, and last year's tax cuts are also likely to aid the recovery.Further bolstering CBO's expectation of a modest downturn is that financial conditions are better nowthan during, for example, the 1990-1991 recession.In particular, the banking system is stronger than itwas then, because financial institutions are bettercapitalized and have fewer bad loans relative to theirassets. Current moderate rates of consumer price infla- tion are another cause for optimism. Between May2001 and December 2001, the price of crude oil fellby almost $10 per barrel, as global demand for oilshrank faster than supply. Natural gas prices also fellduring that time. The re sulting drop in the cost of household energy boosted cons umers' real disposable income, offsetting some of what had been lost withthe rise in unemployment. Each decline of $1 in theprice of a barrel of oil directly adds nearly $3 billionto the amount consumers have available to spend onother goods and services. In addition, lower oilprices reduce the cost of doing business, allowingfurther markdowns in consumer prices. More broadly, price cutting triggered by excess capacity has pushed up real consumer income, pre-venting a decline in real consumption. Although the lower profit margins that accompany such cuts mayhurt investment by businesses, the net effect on GDPof lower prices is probably positive. Recent data also lend some support to the fore- cast of a mild recession. Stock prices have re-bounded from the lows they reached immediatelyafter the terrorist attacks in September. In addition,consumer confidence has bounced back. Consump-tion has been growing, even without factoring in the surge in sales of light vehicles. And initial claims forunemployment insurance, while still high, have nev-ertheless fallen well below the levels seen in theweeks immediately after the attacks. In addition, de-spite a drop in manufacturing employment in Decem-ber, average weekly hours worked in the manufactur-ing sector rose. As the economy goes forward, the currently low level of inventories means that any recovery shouldgain momentum fairly quickly. If inventories de-clined in the final quarter of 2001, as many analystsassume, it would be only the fourth time since WorldWar II that they had been drawn down for four con-secutive quarters. After the three previous declines(in 1949, 1953-1954, and 1982- 1983), inventory growth was strong (see Figure 2-9). However, stable Figure 2-9.

NOTE: Data are four-quarter moving averages.36 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 or recovering sales are key to the economy's picking up, since the drop in inventories during the first eightmonths of 2001 only mirrored the drop in businesses'sales, as reflected in a rela tively stable ratio of inven- tories to sales (see Figure 2-10). Figure 2-10. Ratio of Inventories to Sales SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Com- merce, Bureau of the Census. NOTE: Data are for inventories and sales in the manufacturing and trade sectors. The Outlook Beyond 2003 CBO's economic projections do not explicitly incor- porate specific cyclical recessions or booms beyond 2003. Instead, CBO reflects the likelihood that atleast one cyclical episode will occur in any 10-yearinterval by incorporating the average effects of typi-cal business cycles into its projections. The projec-tions for the medium term extend historical trends insuch underlying factors as the growth of the laborforce, the growth of productivity, the rate of nationalsaving, and the shares of GDP claimed by variouscategories of income. CB O's projections of real GDP, inflation, real interest rates, and tax revenuesdepend critically on those underlying trends.CBO projects that real GDP will grow at an av- erage annual rate of 3.2 percent between 2003 and2012, which is slightly faster than CBO's estimate ofthe growth of potential GDP (3.1 percent) over thesame span. CBO expects real GDP to grow morequickly than potential output after 2003 b ecause weak growth in 2001 reduced the level of real GDPbelow its potential, or trend, level and GDP will stillbe below potential in 2003. Thus, CBO assumes thatthe economy, in order to catch up, will grow fasterthan its trend rate during the recovery period (2002through 2005) and then expand at the level of itstrend from 2006 through 2012 (see Figure 2-11). Po-tential GDP grows more slowly in CBO's currentprojection than it did in last January's, largely be-cause CBO has revised its outlook for business in-vestment substantially downward from a year ago. Figure 2-11. Gross Domestic Product SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Com- merce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. CBO's projections of consumer price inflation and interest rates after 2003 are nearly identical withlast January's. However, CBO now expects that theunemployment rate will average 5.2 percent from2004 through 2007, compared with last January'sestimate of 4.8 percent. In both projections, CBO's estimate of the unemployment rate after 2007 is 5.2percent.CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 37 CBO's Projection of Potential Output CBO now projects that potential output will grow at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent over the 2002-2012 period, which is a reduction of almost 0.3 per-centage points from its projection in January 2001(see Table 2-5). Slower accumulation of capital isthe primary reason for that downward revision;growth in the index of capital services (\"capital in- put\" in the table) averages 4.2 percent annually dur-ing the 2002-2012 period, down from 5.3 percent inlast January's projection. That revision by itselfcrops 0.3 percentage point s from CBO's projection of the rate of growth of output and labor productivity inthe nonfarm business sector and accounts for most ofthe change to projected potential growth.

Estimated trend in the ratio of output to hours worked in the nonfarm business sector.38 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 CBO's projection of capital accumulation is lower than last January's because CBO, like the Blue Chip consensus of private forecasters, has reduced its projection of business fixed investment for the me-dium term (see Figure 2-12). That revision stems Figure 2-12. CBO's and Blue Chip 's Projections of Real Business Fixed Investment SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Aspen Publishers, Inc., Blue Chip Economic Indicators (October 10, 2000, and October 10, 2001). NOTE: The \" Blue Chip 2000\" and \"CBO 2000\" projections were made late in calendar year 2000; the \" Blue Chip 2001\" and \"CBO 2001\" projections were made late in calendaryear 2001. from three considerations. First, the Bureau of Eco- nomic Analysis (BEA) sharply lowered its estimatesof the level of investment over the 1998-2001 period;the changes were concentr ated in the information technology categories of inve stment, such as comput- ers and software. Second, business investment hasbeen weak during the current recession and is ex-pected to recover slowly. Third, the share of GDPdevoted to investment during the late 1990s now ap-pears\u2014in light of the experience of the past year\u2014tohave been unsustainable. CBO projects that potential total factor produc- tivity will grow by 1.3 percent on average during the2002-2012 period. That rate of growth is roughly 0.2percentage points slower than the rate CBO projectedlast January, despite the fact that the historical trendis down only slightly. Two factors explain the differ- ence. First, CBO has incorporated a rough adjust-ment to account for the effects on long-run growth ofadditional costs for security following the events ofSeptember 11. The adjustment, which trims growthin potential TFP by 0.06 percentage points during theprojection period, includes a one-time reduction of0.3 percentage points for 2002 as well as a cut in thegrowth rate of 0.03 percentage points for each year ofthe projection (see Box 2-3). Second, CBO's current estimate of the contribu- tion to overall TFP growth made by technologicaladvances in the computer manufacturing sector (0.1 percentage points) is smaller than last January's (0.2percentage points). That change arises not becausethe outlook for technical innovation in the computersector has altered but because purchases of comput-ers are now expected to make up a smaller share ofoverall output than was anticipated last January (afurther consequence of the downward revision tobusiness investment). CBO projects that slower capital accumulation and slower growth of potential TFP will combine torestrain the growth in potential labor productivity. CBO expects an average annual increase of 2.2 per-cent in that rate during the projection period, or 0.5percentage points less than its estimate in January2001. Partially offsetting the projected downward in- fluence that slower growth of capital and total factorproductivity will have on the growth of potential out-put is a small upward revision to growth in the laborinput. CBO's current pr ojection shows potential hours worked in the nonfarm business sector growingby 1.2 percent annually on average during the 2002-2012 period, or about a tent h of a percentage point faster than in last winter's projection. That revisionstems partly from the Economic Growth and Tax Re-lief Reconciliation Act of 2001, whose cuts in mar-ginal tax rates are expected to boost the labor forceby 0.3 percent in 2011. In making that calculation, CBO has not attempted to reflect the expiration ofthose cuts in 2011. Anot her contributor was CBO's reevaluation (spurred in part by revisions to the his-torical data following the 2000 census) of the trendsunderlying both the labor force and hours worked.That reassessment indicated a slightly faster rate ofCHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 39 Box 2-3. Effects on Productivity Growth of Increasing Spending for Security The terrorist attacks on September 11 do not have a large impact on the level of productivity or its long-run growth inthe Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) economic pro-jections for the medium term (the next decade). Alt hough those attacks exacted a great human toll, their effect on thenation's ability to produce, even in the short run, was smallrelative to the economy's immense size. Past experiencewith natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes,suggests that the physical destruction caused by the attackswill not generate significant, long-lasting economic effects.(For a discussion of further risks from terrorism, beyond itseffects on productivity, see Chapter 5. Chapter 7 discussesthe budgetary implications of actions by the federal govern-ment to counter terrorism.) One key difference between a terrorist attack and a natural disaster, however, is that an attack increases the per-ceived risk of another violent assault. In the medium term,the effects on economic growth of the events ofSeptember 11 depend on both how people respond to thatrisk and whether more terrorist incidents occur. Those ef-fects could operate through several channels, including in-creased costs for security (for example, in the form of addi-tional security guards, more scanning equipment, and higherdefense spending) and escalation in the costs of doing busi-ness that goes beyond security considerations (such as de-lays in shipping, higher costs for insurance, and the need tohold larger inventories). A further possible channel is thepsychological impact of the attacks, which could translateinto lower business investment or a change in consumerspending. Measures of productivity give a confused account of how spending on security affects well-being. Presumably,such spending enhances well-being, although it is also likelyto slow the growth of productivity slightly (see Box 7-1 inChapter 7). The effects on productivity noted above can be di- vided into those that have a one-time impact on its level andthose that would be expected to permanently affect itsgrowth. CBO's medium-term projections include roughestimates of the size of those effects. In light of the uncer-tainties in CBO's analysis, those estimates lean toward thepessimistic end of the range of possible outcomes, implyingthat the actual effects on productivity could well be smaller. Effects on Productivity Levels Effects on productivity are costs, borne by private compa- nies, that CBO assumes would reduce profits and the levelof productivity dollar for dollar in 2002 and beyond. Theyincorporate the cost of additional security guards and of de-lays in transportation resultin g from heightened security. CBO estimates that such costs will total approximately $20billion in 2002, or roughly 0. 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP, or output) in the nonfarm business sector.Therefore, the adjustment for spending on security reduces CBO's projection of the level of total factor productivity(TFP)\u2014real output per combined unit of capital and la-bor\u2014for 2002 and later years by about 0.3 percent. Effects on Growth CBO expects that over the medium term, firms will divert some business investment toward security equipment (suchas alarm systems, facility access systems, surveillance cam-eras, and protective fences). Accordingly, CBO has reducedits projection of TFP growth by an annual average of about0.03 percentage points. Capital goods acquired by privatebusinesses for security purposes are considered part of finaldemand, which means that producing them in pl ace of other goods does not immediately reduce GDP. However, firmsbuy and use those capital goods to produce a service\u2014security\u2014that is not considered part of final output. There-fore, if national saving does not rise to match the increasedoverall demand for capital, GDP will be reduced by thevalue of the goods and services that the security-related cap-ital would have provided if it had been used for productionthat was counted as part of GDP. 1 Capital expenditures for security equipment are analo- gous to businesses' spending on pollution abatement in thatthey generate an output that is not considered part of GDP.One study estimated that firms' expenditures to abate pollu-tion reduced real growth of GDP by about 0.13 percentagepoints on average over the 1973-1985 period. 2 Another study, however, found a smaller effect, estimating thatspending on pollution abatement reduced the growth of out-put by 0.07 percentage points on average between 1973 and1982. 3 During its peak in the mid-1970s, spending on pollu- tion abatement totaled roughly 10 percent of all nonresiden-tial business fixed investment (spending on structures,equipment, and software). How much additional spendingfirms will allocate to security equipment because of the at-tacks on September 11 is hard to predict, but it will probably be substantially less than th at spent on pollution abatement. 1. CBO approximates the effect of the diversion of capital on eco- nomic growth by adjusting TFP rather than capital servicesbecause the TFP adjustment is less burdensome to compute. 2.

Unemployment, Inflation, and Interest Rates The unemployment rate will decline gradually during the projection period, CBO estimates, falling to a rateof 5.2 percent in 2005 and averaging 5.2 percentthereafter. The decline in the unemployment rate mirrors the behavior of real GDP, which CBO pro-jects will grow more rapidly than potential GDP dur-ing the first part of the 2002-2012 period. CBO's current projections for inflation as mea- sured by the CPI-U are little altered from last Janu-ary's, and the average annual rate\u20142.5 percent\u2014isthe same. The GDP price index, CBO estimates, willgrow at an average annual rate of 2.0 percent be-tween 2004 and 2012, or about one-tenth of a per-centage point faster than CBO expected last winter.CBO assumes that the inflation rate will be deter-mined by monetary policy in the medium term andthat the Federal Reserve's policies will maintain the rate of CPI-U inflation near 2.5 percent on average. CBO projects interest rates by adding the pro- jection for inflation to its estimate of real interestrates. Using the CPI-U as a measure of changes inprices, CBO estimates that the real rate on three-month Treasury bills will average 2.4 percent duringthe 2004-2012 period and the real rate on 10-yearTreasury notes will average 3.3 percent. Combiningthose rates with the projected estimates of CPI-U in-flation implies nominal rates of 4.9 percent for Trea-sury bills and 5.8 percent for Treasury notes. Taxable Income CBO's budget projections ar e closely connected to its projections of economic activity and national income.However, different categories of national income aretaxed at different rates, and some are not taxed at all.Therefore, the distribution of income among its vari- ous components is a crucial factor in CBO's eco-nomic projections. Wage and salary disbursementsand corporate profits are particularly important be-cause they are taxed at the highest effective rates. Asa share of potential GDP, those two categories aver- age about 57 percent during the 2004-2012 period,which is roughly equal to their average during the1996-2000 period (see Figure 2-13). The high levelof that share in 2000 reflected the high level of actualGDP relative to potential. Figure 2-13. Corporate Profits Plus Wages and Salaries SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Com- merce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. The downward revision since last winter of CBO's projection of the gr owth of real GDP reduces income and, consequently, tax revenues. However,the projected loss in income and revenues is less thanmight have been expected on the basis of the down-ward revision to GDP, for two reasons. First, therevisions to the NIPAs reduced gross domestic in-come by less than they reduced GDP. For example,BEA revised GDP down by about 0.8 percent for theearly part of 2001, but it left national income virtu-ally unchanged. 7 The other reason that income has been trimmed in CBO's projection by le ss than the downward revi- sion to GDP stems from a secondary, offsetting effectof BEA's cut in its estimate of business investment 7. Those revisions were reflected in a more negative statistical dis- crepancy\u2014the difference between estimates of the sum of all ex-penditures on goods and services and the sum of all income paid tolabor and owners of capital.CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 41 during the 1998-2001 period and CBO's correspond- ingly lower projection. Less business investmentimplies a smaller capital stock and a lower level ofdepreciation. CBO estimates that depreciation will average 13.7 percent of national income during the2004-2012 period, down from 15.1 percent in CBO's projection of last winter. Since depreciation is an expense that is deducted from earnings before taxes,a lower path for depreciation raises the share of in-come subject to taxation.1956 1960 1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012-50510152025Percentage Change from Previous Year Actual Projected Revenues GDPChapter Three The Revenue Outlook The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if current policies remain unchanged, federalrevenues will total about $1,980 billion in fis- cal year 2002. That level of tax receipts would beclose to $10 billion less than total revenues in 2001and roughly $40 billion less than overall receipts in2000\u2014and would represent the first time since 1959that revenues had dropped for two years in a row.A combination of economic circumstances and tax legislation is expected to cause receipts to growmore slowly than gross domestic product, or output,in 2003; thereafter, revenues grow roughly in tandemwith GDP until 2011 (see Figure 3-1). At that point,CBO projects that revenues will increase sharply as aconsequence of the expiration of the tax cuts enactedin 2001. Figure 3-1.

Total Revenues as a Share of GDP, 1944-2012 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. CBO's current projections contrast sharply with the pattern of receipts from just a few years ago.From 1994 to 2000, revenues rose at an average an-nual rate of 8.3 percent, a much faster rate of growththan that of GDP. As a result, revenues as a share ofoutput climbed from 18.1 percent in 1994 to 20.8 per-cent in 2000 (see Figure 3-2). Nonetheless, CBO'sprojections of revenues relative to GDP for 2002through 2012 are still well above their average overroughly the past half century. Changes in CBO's Revenue ProjectionsSince January 2001 In January 2001, CBO projected that revenues would total about $28 trillion over the 2002- 2011 period. Its overall projection now, for the same period, isabout $2.4 trillion less (see Table 3-1). The alteredoutlook for revenues is principally responsible for thedecline in projected surpluses over the next 10 years.The main factors that led to CBO's new lower esti-mates of revenues are the tax cuts contained in theEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Actof 2001 (Public Law 107-16), which was signed into law last June, and the recession that began in March. EGTRRA's provisions affect several compo- nents of the tax code. The law created a 10 percentmarginal income tax bracket and gradually reducesfour of the five existing marginal rates. 1 It also ex- pands the child credit, softens the impact of the\"marriage penalty\" (which causes two married earn-ers to pay more in taxes than they would if they wereboth single) by adjusting marginal rate brackets andthe standard deduction, and provides additional tax incentives to save for retirement and education. In addition, the legislation repeals the current restric-tions on itemized deductions and exemptions forhigher-income taxpayers. Through 2004, the lawprovides some relief for taxpayers subject to the al-ternative minimum tax (AMT). EGTRRA also 1. Calculating a person's tax liability, or tax owed, involves measuring his or her total income, excluding particular kinds of income, toobtain adjusted gross income; subtracting personal and dependentexemptions and various deductions to determine taxable income;applying a set of six statutory marginal tax rates to different rangesof income; and subtracting any applicable credits. In addition, cal-culations must take account of income ranges over which certaintax provisions phase in or out, granting some or none of variousdeductions, exemptions, or credits. See Box 3-1 on pages 52 and53 for more information on rates, tax bases, and tax liability as wellas other revenue-related terms.CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 45 Table 3-1. Changes in CBO's Baselin e Projections of Reve nues Since January 2001 (I n billions of dollars) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Total, 2002- 2011 January NOTES: Legislative changes are as estimated at the time of enactment. * = unavailable (CBO did not break out the economic and technical changes for 2001). phases out the estate tax by 2010. In addition, it per- mitted businesses to shift payment of their corporateestimated income taxes from the final month of fiscalyear 2001 (September) to the first month of fiscalyear 2002 (October). All of its provisions still in ef-fect in 2010 expire at the end of that year. EGTRRA accounts for approximately half of the decrease from last January in the revenues pro-jected for the 2002-2011 period. Most of that re-duction\u2014more than $1 trillion of it\u2014is in the cate-gory of individual income tax receipts; 2 lower re- ceipts from estate and gift taxes account for over$100 billion of it. Other legislation\u2014principally theRailroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Actof 2001 (P.L. 107-90), the Investor and Capital Mar-kets Fee Relief Act (P.L. 107-123), and the Victimsof Terrorism Tax Relief Act (P.L. 107-134)\u2014ac-counts for an additional $19 billion of the decrease inprojected revenues over the period. 3In addition to its impact on the level of overall receipts, EGTRRA also significantly affects the pat-tern of revenues that CBO projects over the 2002-2012 period (see Figure 3-3 and Table 3-2). First,delaying corporate estimated payments that wouldnormally be due in Sept ember 2001 prune s receipts for that fiscal year by about 0.2 percent of GDP andraises receipts for 2002 by the same amount. Thatshift slightly distorts the apparent contribution of thecurrent recession to the pr ojected drop in corporate income tax revenues. Second, the sequence of reduc-tions in individual income tax rates from 2001 to2006, which are provided under EGTRRA, offsetsincreases that would otherwise have occurred in ef-fective individual income tax rates as real (inflation-adjusted) economic growth places more income inthe higher tax brackets. Third, the expiration of thelaw's provisions creates dramatic changes in receiptsin the final two years of the projection period.EGTRRA's tax cuts expire at the end of 2010, but the 2. Some of the tax benefits under EGTRRA\u2014about $90 billion over 10 years\u2014are counted as outlays. They consist of child tax credits and earned income tax credits that exceed taxpayers' tax liabilityand therefore represent payments by the government to individuals. 3. For the purpose of accounting for the changes in CBO's projec- tions, the effects of legislation shown in Table 3-1 are the effectsthat were estimated at the time of each law's passage. The CBObaselines against which those effects were measured incorporatedestimates of economic activity that were higher than those used inthe current baseline. Hence, estimates of the loss in revenues fromthe legislation passed since January 2001 would tend to be smallerif they were calculated now, using the current baseline. The effectsof EGTRRA shown in Figure 3-3 and Table 3-2 reflect CBO'scurrent baseline and latest information on the economy; thus, theydiffer from the effects incorporated in the estimates of Table 3-1.46 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Figure 3-3. CBO's Baseline Projections of Total Revenues, 2001-2011 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTE: EGTRRA = Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconcilia- tion Act of 2001. The s haded region represents the pro- jected effects of EGTRRA on revenues. legislation still reduces receipts in 2011 because of both the lag between when tax liability is incurredand when it is paid and the overlap of fiscal and cal-endar years. By 2012, CBO expects, receipts will beroughly back at the level they would have reachedhad the legislation not been enacted. Most of the remaining changes since last Janu- ary in CBO's projections of revenues are due to analtered picture of economic conditions. The reces-sion slowed the growth of wages and salaries, whichconstitute the tax base for payroll taxes and make upthe biggest part of the individual income tax base. Inaddition, corporate profits fell steeply, reducing re-ceipts from the corporate income tax. CBO has alsoslightly lowered its projections of economic growthover the longer term (the later years of the 2002-2012period). The altered estimates of overall economicactivity that CBO is now incorporating in its baselineaccount for about $700 billion of the projected reduc-tion in revenues. What CBO terms \"technical changes\" in its pro- jections (changes that are not driven by new legisla-tion or by modifications to CBO's macroeconomic forecast) also arise largely from economic conditions.The decline in the stock ma rket trimmed capital gainsrealizations and the receipts they generate in both the individual and corporate income tax categories.CBO's projections also reflect slower growth in over- all wealth, which reduces revenues from estate andgift taxes. In addition, total receipts are lower forreasons that are not entirel y understood; over the past year, collections have been smaller than those pro-jected by CBO's economic forecasting and revenue-estimating models. Overall, technical changes ac-count for about $500 billion of the reduction thatCBO has made in its revenue projections since Janu-ary 2001. Much of the decline in projected receipts attrib- utable to the current slow down in economic growth is likely to be temporary. As the economy recovers,CBO estimates that tax receipts will rise closer to thelevels it projected last January. But some of the dropin revenues, relative to those levels, will persist, CBOforecasts, because of slightly slower rates of eco-nomic growth over the longer term. In addition, CBOassumes that the portion of the shortfall in currentcollections not otherwise e xplained by legislation or economic performance will remain. As a result,CBO's revenue projection for 2011 is still about $50billion lower (excluding legislative changes) in thecurrent outlook than in last January's. Revenues by Source The sources of federal revenues are individual in-come taxes, corporate income taxes, social insurancetaxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs du-ties, and miscellaneous receipts. Individual incometaxes produce about half of all revenues and claimroughly 10 percent of GDP (see Table 3-3 and Figure 3-4). Social insurance taxes (mainly Social Securityand Medicare Hospital Insurance taxes) are the sec-ond largest sour ce of receipts, equaling a bout a third of total revenues and a little less than 7 percent ofGDP. Corporate income taxes contribute about 10 percent of overall revenues and represent approxi-mately 1.5 percent to 2 percent of output. Revenuesfrom the other taxes and duties and miscellaneousreceipts, including profits from the Federal ReserveSystem, make up the balance\u2014and represent about1.5 percent of GDP.CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 47 Table 3-2.

I n contrast, the effects of legislation shown in Table 3-1 (which include those of other laws besides EGTRRA) incorporate estimate s of the laws' effects that were produced at the time of enactment and that were based on CBO's economic projections at that time. EGTRRA's effects on revenues in 2012 are insignificant because the entire law expires at the end of 2010.Not included here are the law's effects on refundable outlays. At the time of enactment, CBO estimated that such outlays would increase by between $6 billion and $12 billion annually from 2002 through 2011. * = loss of less than $500 million. a. These effects derive from changes in due dates for estimated payments. Rising individual income tax receipts, bolstered primarily by increases in capital gains realizationsand in the effective tax rate, fueled the rapid growthof total revenues from 1994 to 2000. The higherlevel of realizations stemmed largely from sharplyrising stock prices over that span; increases in theeffective tax rate were partly the result of rapidly ris-ing income among higher-income taxpayers, who aretaxed at higher marginal rates. Now, both of thoseeffects appear to have leveled out or reversed course.That change, combined with the effects of EGTRRA,contributes to the slower growth of revenues thatCBO anticipates for the next few years. The pattern of individual income tax receipts in CBO's projections incorporates the offsetting effectsof several phenomena. Capital gains realizations re-vert to their historical relationship with GDP, whichtends to slow the rise of revenues relative to that ofoutput. In addition, the growth of income of higher-income taxpayers declines to a pace that is consistentwith longer-term trends\u2014which also tends to slowthe rate of revenue growth relative to the growth ofGDP. The higher nominal incomes in CBO's projec- tions tend to raise the average effective tax rate, asmore taxpayers become subject to the AMT, andgrowth in real income subjects more income tohigher marginal tax rates (a phenomenon known as\"real bracket creep\"). Both of those outcomes tend to boost the growth of receipts over the projectionperiod. Finally, the cuts in marginal tax rates sched-uled to take effect under EGTRRA tend to reduceincome tax receipts relative to GDP. These offsetting effects, CBO projects, will re- main in rough balance through 2010. CBO estimatesthat at first, they will cause individual income taxreceipts to decline slightly relative to GDP, as the effects from capital gains realizations, income growthamong high earners, and EGTRRA rate cuts predomi-nate. Then CBO expects individual income tax reve-nues to rise relative to GDP, as the effects of realbracket creep and the AMT grow stronger. EGTRRAexpires as of January 2011, and CBO estimates thatat that point, receipts as a share of GDP will begin to climb rapidly.48 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 3-3.

Numbers in the second half of the table are shown as a percentage of total GDP for this period.b. Social Security. The share of output claimed by social insurance taxes has changed little over the past decade. From 2002 through 2012, receipts from those taxes are also expected to remain essentially stable, falling onlyvery slightly relative to GDP. Corporate income taxes contributed some of the increase in revenues in the 1990s as corporate profitssurpassed their performance of the 1970s and 1980s.But the current recession has substantially reducedprofits\u2014and therefore corpor ate income tax receipts. Those receipts (which CBO adjusted to take into ac-count the shift in the timing of collections legislatedby EGTRRA) fell from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2000to 1.7 percent in 2001; CBO expects them (again,after adjusting for the timin g shift) to fall to 1.5 per- cent of GDP in 2002. The ratio of receipts to GDP isprojected to climb back to 1.9 percent by 2005 and remain near that level through 2012. However, thatshare of GDP is smaller than the unusually largeshares seen just a few years ago. Excise taxes are a relatively small source of rev- enues. CBO projects th at over the 2001-2012 period, they will decline slightly relative to GDP, droppingfrom 0.7 percent to 0.5 percent. The excise tax com-ponent of receipts is expected to contract relative toGDP because the real value of excise tax receiptstends to fall with inflation. Many such taxes are lev-ied per unit of a good or per transaction rather than asa percentage of value. Ex cise receipts therefore tend to rise mainly with increases in real, rather than nom- inal, GDP.CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 49 1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 2011024681012Percentage of GDP Actual Projected Excise TaxesIndividual Income Taxes Social Insurance Taxes Corporate Income TaxesFigure 3-4. Revenues, by Source, as a Share of GDP, 1960-2012 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. In its current outlook for revenues, CBO expects receipts from estate and gift taxes to change in im- portance over the projection period: their share ofGDP is forecast to decline from 0.3 percent to 0.1percent by 2010 and 2011 before jumping back to 0.3percent in 2012. That pattern results from phasingout the estate tax under EGTRRA and subsequentlyreinstating it after the law expires at the end of 2010. CBO estimates that the share of GDP claimed by all other sources of revenues\u2014customs duties andmiscellaneous receipts, in cluding receipts from the Federal Reserve System\u2014will remain steady at justabove 0.5 percent throughout the projection period. Individual Income Taxes Individual income taxes accounted for most of theexpansion of the GDP share of revenues that oc-curred from the early 1990s to 2000. With the ex- ception of 1998, when indivi dual income tax receipts were reduced by the cuts enacted in the TaxpayerRelief Act of 1997, the rate of growth of those re-ceipts averaged more than 10 percent a year from1993 to 2000. Their share of GDP reached a histori-cal peak\u201410.3 percent\u2014in that latter year. The taxcut that became law in June of last year and the re-cession that began in March halted that trend. None- theless, because the tax cuts under EGTRRA expireat the end of 2010, CBO expects individual incometax receipts to rise again, to 10.2 percent of GDP, in2011 and reach a new histori cal peak, 10.6 percent, in 2012 (see Table 3-4). Indeed, throughout the entire2002-2012 period, individual income tax receipts rel-ative to GDP are projected to remain well above theirpost-World War II average of 8.1 percent. CBO esti-mates that in every year of the period, they will reachor exceed 9.1 percent, a level that has been surpassedonly eight times in the history of the income tax. CBO's projections of indi vidual income tax re- ceipts over the 2002-2011 period are nearly $1.8 tril-lion lower than its January 2001 projections for thesame span. EGTRRA's tax cuts account for morethan $1 trillion of that fall. Approximately $400 bil-lion of the decline is due to the revisions in CBO'smacroeconomic forecast, and about $300 billion de-rives from technical factors closely related to thatrevised economic outlook. The most influential ofthose factors were the revi sions CBO made in its pro- jections of capital gains realizations and its adjust-ments for lower-than-expected tax collections sincelast January. Several minor changes in CBO's pro-jection methods also contributed a small amount tothe reduction in the projections.50 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 3-4.

Historically, revenues from individual income taxes have tendedto grow slightly faster than GDP\u2014but a few excep-tions to that tendency are notable. In 1969, for exam-ple, a surtax caused income tax receipts to grow sig-nificantly faster than output; also, before the tax codewas indexed for the effects of inflation on tax brack-ets, price increases pushed the growth of income taxrevenues well above that of the economy by effec-tively decreasing the levels of real income at whichhigher tax rates applied. From 1994 to 2000, how- ever, individual income tax receipts grew much fasterthan gross domestic product\u2014and for entirely differ-ent reasons. Understanding the growth of individual income tax receipts over that earlie r period helps explain the pattern of receipts projected for the years from 2002through 2012. CBO examined a sample of detailedtax-return data from tax years 1994 through 1999 (taxyears are essentially the same as calendar years) toidentify the sources of that growth. (Although de-tailed data for 2000 are not available, the same forceswere probably at work in that year as well.) Thesurge in individual income tax liabilities as a percent-age of GDP can be traced to four sources (see Table 3-5). 4 The rapid growth of components of GDP that are taxable to individuals was the first significantsource of the surge. (For more information on therelationship between tax liability, taxable income,and GDP, see Box 3-1.) Taxable personal income\u2014which is the sum of wages, interest, dividends, propri-etors' income, and rental income as measured in thenational income and product accounts\u2014grew fasterthan GDP during most of the 1994-1999 period. Theresulting rise in the ratio of taxable personal incometo total output boosted the tax base for the individualincome tax and accounted for about 16 percent of thegrowth of tax liabilities in excess of the growth ofGDP over that period. 4. CBO calculated the percentage contribution of each of the four sources using the amount of tax liability that would have accruedwithout the child and education tax credits that became effective intax year 1998. Excluding those credits allows consistent measure-ment across all years in the comparison.CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 51 Table 3-5.

NOTE: See Box 3-1 for a discussion of TPI, AGI, and effective rates.a. The estimates of tax liabilities for 1998 and 1999 do not include the child and education credits enacted in the Taxpayer Rel ief Act of 1997. The next two sources of the surge in individual income tax receipts are components of adjusted grossincome, or AGI (the actual income base of the indi-vidual income tax), that grew more rapidly than tax-able personal income over the period. The first com-ponent, capital gains realizations (which are not in-cluded in either GDP or taxable personal income),accounts for a large part of the growth in AGI. Be-tween 1994 and 19 99, realizations of gains nearly quadrupled, with much of that increase occurring be-fore the cut in capital gains tax rates in 1997 (seeTable 3-6). Thus, over the period, taxes on gains ac-counted for roughly 30 percent of the increasedgrowth of individual income tax liabilities relative tothe growth of GDP. The second AGI-related s ource of the individual income tax surge comprises other components of theAGI measure that are not part of taxable personal income or GDP and that also expanded more rapidlythan either of those measures. Among those compo-nents, retirement income in the form of distributionsfrom 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts,and taxable Social Security benefits were especially prominent. The growth of retirement and nonretire-ment AGI components together accounted for about10 percent of the increase in liabilities relative toGDP growth from 1994 to 1999. The fourth and most significant source of in- come tax liability growth relative to that of GDP wasthe increase in the effective tax rate on individualincome (see Figure 3-5). In tax years 1995 to 1999,increases in the effective rate (on income other thancapital gains) accounted for more than 40 percent ofthe growth of liabilities in excess of the growth ofGDP. Increases in real income for taxpayers gener-ally pushed more income into higher tax brackets.That phenomenon alone accounted for more than halfof the increase in the ratio of income tax liability to GDP that resulted from the rise in the effective taxrate. Much of the remainin g increase in the effective rate appears to result from the concentration of in-come growth at the top of the income distribution,which led to a greater proportion of income beingtaxed at the highest rates. Thus, even though no in-52 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Box 3-1. Tax Bases and Tax Liability Tax receipts vary with economic activity, but they do not move in lockstep with gross domestic product (GDP), oroutput. Although the bases for taxes on individual and cor-porate income and for social insurance taxes are related tothat economic measure, they differ from GDP in a number ofimportant respects, which means that they sometimes growfaster and sometimes slower than output. As a result, theratio of receipts to GDP may change even if tax laws remainthe same. The Individual Income Tax Base Taxable personal income is the first approximation of the individual income tax base. It comprises dividends, interest,wages and salaries, rent, and proprietors' income. It doesnot include depreciation, indirect taxes on businesses (suchas excise taxes), fringe benefits, or retained corporate profits. Despite its name, not all taxable personal income is actually taxed. Some of it accrues to tax-exempt ent ities such as hospitals, schools, cultural institutions, and founda-tions; some is earned in a form that is tax-exempt, such asincome from state and local bonds; and some is tax-deferred,such as in the case of income from retirement accounts, onwhich the tax is paid not when the income is earned butwhen the person retires and begins to draw down the ac-count. Also, personal interest and rental income compriselarge components of imputed income\u2014income that is notearned in a cash transaction, including personal earningswithin pension funds and life insurance policies and incomefrom owner-occupied housing\u2014that are not taxable. Conse-quently, a substantial amount of interest, dividend, and rental income is excluded from the taxable base of the in-come tax. Taxpayers make further adjustments, both additions and subtractions, to taxable personal income to derive ad- justed gross income , or AGI. Capital gains realizations \u2014 the increase in the value of assets between the time they arepurchased and sold\u2014are added to taxable personal income.Contributions from income to tax-deductible individual re-tirement accounts and 401(k) programs are subtracted, butdistributions to retirees from those programs are added.Taxpayers also make a variety of other, smaller adjustments. Exemptions and deductions are subtracted from AGI to yield taxable income, to which progressive tax rates\u2014thatis, rates that rise as income rises\u2014are applied. (Those rates are known as statutory marginal tax rates ; the range of taxable income over which a statutory marginal rate applies is known as an income tax bracket , of which there are cur- rently six.) The resulting tax may then be subject to further adjustments in the form of credits , such as the child tax credit for taxpayers with children under age 17, which re- duce the taxpayers' tax liability (the amount of taxes they owe). An important factor in calculating individual tax lia- bility is the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which re- quires some taxpayers to calculate their taxes under a morelimited set of exemptions, deductions, and credits. Taxpay-ers then pay the higher of the AMT or the ordinary tax. The ratio of tax liability to AGI is called the effective tax rate on AGI . come group was subjected to higher statutory tax rates, a larger share of income accruing to taxpayersfacing the top tax rates raised the effective rate over-all. 5 The Decline of Receipts in 2001 . After several years in which actual revenues exceeded CBO's pro-jections, individual income tax receipts in 2001 fellshort of the estimates of them that CBO had made inJanuary of that year. CBO projected that individual income tax receipts would total $1,076 billion, butactual receipts in 2001 were about $80 billion less, or$994 billion. About half of that reduction came fromthe cut in marginal tax ra tes enacted in EGTRRA; the legislation created a 10 percent tax bracket and \"re-bated,\" in 2001, the tax savings that otherwise would have shown up largely in 2002. And as economicgrowth slowed to a level below that underlyingCBO's earlier projections, revenues also ebbed. Inaddition, at least some of the phenomena responsiblefor the rise in individual income tax receipts relativeto GDP from 1994 to 2000 waned in 2001. On the basis of figures from the Department of the Treasury, the early rebate under EGTRRA re-duced receipts for 2001 by about $35 billi on. Other EGTRRA provisions were probably responsible foran additional decline of $3 billion in withholding andother individual income tax receipts. Of the remain-ing shortfall (compared with what CBO had pro-jected) of $42 billion, about $10 billion resulted fromthe slowdown in the growth of GDP and in those of 5. See Congressional Budget Office, Effective Federal Tax Rates, 1979-1997 (October 2001).CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 53 Box 3-1. Continued The Corporate Income Tax Base Corporate profits are the tax base of the corporate income tax. But the corporate profits component of GDP differs inseveral important respects from what is taxed by the corpo-rate income tax. First, the profits of the Federal Reserve System are counted as corporate profits in measures of GDP, but theyare not taxed under the corporate income tax (they are in-stead remitted to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts). Second, measures of GDP calculate corporate income on the basis of economic depreciation \u2014the dollar value of productive capital assets that is estimated to have been usedup in the production process. For tax purposes, however, corporations calculate book profits , which are based on book , or tax, depreciation . Book depreciation is typically more front-loaded than economic depreciation; that is, thecapital is assumed to be used up at a faster rate than the bestestimates of how fast it is actually used up, allowing firms toreport taxable profits that are smaller than economic profits. Third, taxable corporate income includes the foreign- source income of U.S. multina tional corporations when that income is \"repatriated,\" or returned, to the U.S. parent com-pany. Foreign-source income is not part of measured output. Several other, smaller differences exist between cor- porate profits as defined in the GDP measure and corpora- tions' calculation of their taxable income for tax purposes.If a corporation's taxable income is negative (that is, if the firm loses money), its loss (within limits) may be carriedbackward or forward to be netted against previous or futuretaxable income and thus reduce the firm's taxes in thoseother years. A statutory tax rate is applied to the corpora-tion's taxable income to determine its tax liability. A num-ber of credits (such as that for taxes imposed by other coun-tries on the foreign-source income included in a firm's tax-able profits) may further pare that liability. The ratio of ag-gregate domestic corporate taxes to aggregate taxable corpo- rate income is the average tax rate . The Social Insurance Tax Base Social insurance taxes, the other big source of receipts, use payroll as their base. Those taxes largely fund Social Secu-rity and Medicare's Hospital Insurance program (Part A ofMedicare). Social Security taxes are imposed as a percent- age of pay up to a taxable maximum that is indexed for the growth of wages in the economy. Medicare's Hospital In-surance taxes are not subject to a taxable maximum. Despite many adjustments that must be made to calcu- late the actual tax bases, a ready approximation is the sum ofwages and salaries and corporate book profits (see Chapter 2for a brief discussion). Those items pick up much of thebases of the individual income, corporate income, and socialinsurance taxes and therefore constitute the bulk of taxedincome. its components that constitute the tax base.6 The re- maining $30 billion of the decline was due to unex-pected changes in the amount of revenue that wasgenerated by the level of economic activity in 2001. Although capital gains realizations constitute a relatively small percentage of overall tax receipts,they played a significant role in the rise of total reve- nues relative to GDP in the second half of the 1990s(see Table 3-6). And they are probably a significant factor in the recent shortfall of receipts relative toprojections. CBO's January 2001 estimate of capitalgains realizations in tax year 2000 is an important calculation in its estimate of receipts for fiscal year2001, because a portion of the tax resulting from therealizations is paid with the subsequent filing of taxreturns, in 2001. CBO's estimate last January was$652 billion; that compares with CBO's best estimateto date of actual realizations, which is about $620billion. Thus, CBO's projection in January 2001 wasrelatively accurate, and the rise in gains of about 12percent was faster than that of GDP. Nevertheless,CBO's best estimate of actual realizations in 2000represents a level that, while strong, was still lowerthan the level that CBO had projected last year. CBO now estimates that capital gains realiza- tions in calendar year 2001 fell by nearly 20 percent,to $500 billion. That drop produces a small estimateddecline in capital gains receipts for fiscal year 2001. 6. Of that $10 billion, $6 billion appears as an economic revision to CBO's projections between January 2001 and August 2001.CBO's models suggest that $5 billion of the $20 billion shortfall inactual receipts (relative to the August projections) is due to changesin the economy.54 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 3-6.

NOTES: CY denotes data on a calendar year basis, and FY denotes data on a fiscal year basis. Realizations represent net positiv e long-term gains. Data for realizations and liabilities after 1999 and receipts data for all years are projected by CBO. a. The fiscal year receipts measure is CBO's estimate of when liabilities are paid to the Treasury. A second contributor to the reduction in 2001 in income tax receipts relative to the level of economicactivity may have been slower growth in income atthe top end of the income di stribution. Just as faster- than-average growth of income for very high earnershelped fuel the rise in the GDP share of receipts, soslower-than-average growth of that income wouldaccomplish the reverse. Detailed data on taxpayers'incomes are not yet available, but some evidence sug-gests that income growth at the top end of the incomedistribution has slowed over the past year. One source of that growth in the past was income from stock options. Estimates suggest that such in-come increased to more than $100 billion in 2000, or about 2 percent of wages and salaries. Much of thatincome presumably accrued to the highest-earningtaxpayers and thus was taxed at the highest rates.The weakening of the stock market in 2001 impliesthat income from stock options declined by perhaps20 percent to 40 percent from its level in 2000, whichmeans that a larger proportion than before of totalwage and salary income was subject to lower mar-ginal tax rates. Another source of the rapid growth of taxable in- come among high-earning taxpayers in the late1990s, CBO believes, was bonuses.

Tax years are essentially the same as calendar years. a. The estimates of tax liabilities that CBO used to generate the effective rates do not include the child and education credits enacted in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. year 2001 are not yet available, but anecdotal evi- dence, as well as preliminary projections from someof the states that closely monitor that source of in-come, indicates that bonus income in 2001 was lowerrelative to earlier years. The Expected Pattern of Future Receipts . CBO estimates that individual income tax receipts will de-cline in fiscal year 2002. Part of that projected fallresults from the tax cuts enacted in the EconomicGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.Another source is the economy. Although forecastersestimate that it will rebound in the coming months, itwill not reach full employment immediately. Thus,the depressed level of economic activity in 2002 isexpected to continue to dampen GDP growth and thegrowth of revenues. In addition, CBO for ecasts that indirect effects of that depressed activity on realiza-tions of capital gains and effective tax rates will fur-ther reduce receipts from the individual income tax. From 2003 to 2005, the pattern of revenue growth in CBO's projections is dominated by the nation'srecovery from the recession. Over the period, CBOestimates that individual income tax receipts will riseas economic growth picks up. But the path of those receipts over the 10 years from 2003 to 2012 is likelyto be influenced by several other factors as well. First, the provisions of EGTRRA will tend to ini- tially curb and then accelerate the growth of receipts.Under the law, marginal rates drop again in 2004 and2006. And over the 2006-2010 period, restrictionsphase out on itemized deductions and exemptions ofhigh-income taxpayers. Both of those changes willtend to reduce the growth of individual income taxreceipts, CBO estimates. Bu t at the end of 2010, all provisions of the law that are still in force expire, andrevenues are expected to climb sharply. Second, on its own, growth in income will tend to increase the relative growth of receipts. Even thoughthe individual income tax is indexed for inflation, thegrowth of real income will tend to shift a bigger pro-portion of taxable income into higher tax brackets sothat income tax receipts are likely to grow faster thanincome. Moreover, as income rises, the AMT\u2014which is not indexed for inflation\u2014will affect moretaxpayers and more income, providing an additional56 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 201205101520253035 024681012Tax Returns with AMT Liability (Left scale) AMT Receipts as a Share of Individual Receipts (Right scale)aMillions of Returns bPercentreason that the growth of receipts will tend to outstrip that of income. Third, the other phenomena that influence the ef- fective tax rate, including capital gains realizationsand income growth at the very top of the income dis-tribution, also operate over the 2003-2012 period. On the basis of its estimate of declining capital gainsrealizations in 2001, CBO expects receipts fromgains to fall in 2002. Thereafter, realizations arelikely to grow more slowly than overall income asthey gradually return to a level consistent with theirhistorical relationship to GDP. That assumed pattern of realizations, CBO estimates, will tend to slow thegrowth of receipts relative to GDP growth during theperiod. In addition, CBO assumes that the share ofwages going to the highest-earning taxpayers willrevert gradually to its longer-term trend, which willtend to reduce receipts relative to GDP during theprojection period's first few years. Until the very end of that period, CBO projects, all of these factors in combination will keep individ-ual income tax receipts roughly constant as a percent-age of GDP. The effects of the real growth of in-come and of the AMT will tend to raise receipts rela-tive to GDP throughout those years. The capitalgains effect, in contrast, will tend to lower them, butits impact will be strongest in the period's earlieryears. The income distribution effect will also tendto reduce receipts relative to GDP but only in the firstfew years of the period. Consequently, individualincome tax receipts relative to GDP are likely to de-cline very slightly from 2003 through 2006, but later,after 2006, the effects of th e growth of income will begin to dominate and boost receipts relative to GDP.In 2011 and 2012, CBO estimates, the expiration ofEGTRRA will swamp all other effects, sharply rais-ing individual income tax receipts as a percentage ofGDP. The effect of the AMT deserves special mention. Provided that tax law does not change, the growth ofnominal income will continue to increase both thenumber of taxpayers and the amount of income sub-ject to the minimum tax. In addition, the marginalrate cuts in EGTRRA w ill reduce regular tax liability relative to AMT tax liability ; that will also tend to increase the contribution that the AMT makes to totalrevenues. In 2001 through 2004, EGTRRA raises theamount of income that is exempt from the tax, which will temporarily help offset some of the growth in itsshare of revenues. But the AMT provision inEGTRRA expires at the end of 2004. After that, thenumber of taxpayers subject to the AMT will risesharply (see Figure 3-6). Figure 3-6.

NOTE: The alternative minimum tax requires some taxpayers to calculate their taxes under a more limited set of exemp-tions, deductions, and credits than the set applicable un-der the regular individual income tax. a. By calendar year.b. By fiscal year. Since the remaining provisions of EGTRRA expire at the end of 2010, comparing the number oftaxpayers subject to the AMT in 2001 and estimatesof the revenues from it with estimates of the samefactors in 2012 demonstrates how the AMT's effects increase as a result of the growth of nominal income.CBO estimates that in 2001, 1.4 million tax returnswill report AMT liability in the tax year, and receiptsfrom the AMT will total $8 billion in the fiscal year.In 2012, about 22 million returns will have AMT lia-bility, and the tax will add $50 billion to revenues.Thus, over that span, the relative importance of theCHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 57 AMT as a percentage of total individual income tax receipts more than triples. The rise and fall of the AMT's projected effects between 2004 and 2011 parallel the phasing in andexpiration of the cuts in the tax that are part ofEGTRRA. The number of returns that the AMT af-fects rises from 2.5 million in tax year 2003 to about32 million in 2010. In fiscal year 2010, the AMT adds more than $100 billion to revenues from the reg-ular tax, or about 7 percent of total individual incometax receipts. The differences between 2010 and 2012in AMT receipts ($50 billion) and returns affected(10 million) indicate the degree to which the cuts inmarginal tax rates under EGTRRA have less than their full effect because of the alternative minimumtax. Corporate Income Taxes In recent years, receipts from the corporate incometax and profits both grew more rapidly than the over-all economy. From 1994 to 2000, corporate incometax receipts as a percentage of GDP were 2 percent ormore, levels not achieved since 1980. That perfor-mance was largely driven by very strong corporateprofits. In 2001, however, corporate profits and cor- Table 3-7.

As noted earlier, EGTRRA delayed corporate estimated payments from September 2001 to Octoberand the new fiscal year, shifting approximately $23billion in revenues and distorting the pattern of cor-porate receipts. After adjusting its calculations to account for the shift, CBO estimates that corporate tax revenues fell from $207 billion in 2000 to $174billion in 2001; it expects them to fall to $156 billionin 2002. That overall projected decline is almost en-tirely due to the slowing of the economy. Becausecorporate profits have fallen relative to total output inCBO's projections, corporat e tax receipts have fol- lowed suit, sliding from 2.1 percent of GDP for 2000to 1.7 percent (adjusted for the timing shift) for 2001and 1.5 percent (adjusted) for 2002. CBO projects that corporate tax receipts will begin to recover in 2003 and that by 2005, the ratio of receipts to GDP will reach 1.9 percent and remainat that level until 2012 (see Table 3-7). Those esti-mates stem largely from the pattern of profits overtime, which is indicated by the measure of the aver-age tax rate (corporate receipts as a percentage oftaxable profits). Once the rate is adjusted for the tim-ing shift that affects receipts for 2001 and 2002 andfor a second, smaller timing shift between 2004 and2005, the average tax rate varies within a relativelynarrow band of 28.5 percent to 29.9 percent over therest of the projection period. The average tax rate includes a cyclical compo- nent because profits and losses are treated differently.Firms pay taxes to the government on the profits theyearn, but they do not receive payments from it if theylose money (except to the extent that they can carrytheir losses forward or backward to offset profits inother years). Therefore, when the economy declinesand the number of firms losing money increases, cor-porate tax receipts do not dr op by as much as net profits do. That means that the overall effective cor-porate tax rate (receipts divided by net profits) tendsto be higher when economic activity is depressedthan when it is not\u2014which explains the rise in theeffective corporate tax rate in 2002. The rise in therate that CBO projects over the longer term (that is,the portion of the rise that is not related to the rate'scyclical component) derives in large part from the expiration of various tax provisions, such as the re-search and experimentati on tax credit, that would otherwise tend to reduce corporate tax liability. Projections of corporate income tax receipts are always subject to a great deal of uncertainty, al-though the receipts' relatively small size dampens itseffect on projections of total revenues. Much of theuncertainty in corporate tax estimates stems from thefluctuation of corporate pr ofits. Profits are essen- tially the residual income in an economy\u2014what re-mains for the owners of firms after all of the otherproductive inputs (such as labor) have been compen-sated. As a result, profits tend to vary much morethan do other sources of taxable income, and thatmakes them difficult to project, especially in periodsof economic slowdown. CBO's current projections of corporate income tax receipts for the 2002-2011 period are about $150billion lower than the amounts it projected last Janu-ary for the same period. About $60 billion of thatreduction flows directly from changes in CBO's eco-nomic forecast, and about $120 billion stems fromtechnical changes, some of which derive from reduc-tions in CBO's estimates of corporate capital gainsrealizations for 2002 through 2011. The technicalchanges to the projections also reflect lower tax col-lections in 2001 than would otherwise be expected,given the economic conditions; part of that drop incollections is expected to be permanent. Offsettingsome of the reduction in projected corporate tax re-ceipts are the changes CBO made as a result of legis-lation enacted during the year. Those revisions in-crease revenues mainly because of the shift of re-ceipts under EGTRRA from 2001 to 2002. Social Insurance Taxes In CBO's projections for the 2002-2012 period, reve-nues from social insurance taxes claim a roughly con-stant share of wages and salaries (see Table 3-8). Byfar the largest generators of those receipts are SocialSecurity (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insur-ance, or OASDI) and Medicare (Hospital Insurance,or HI) taxes (see Table 3-9). A small share of socialinsurance revenues comes from unemployment insur-CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 59 Table 3-8.

Social Security and Medicare taxes are calcu- lated as a percentage of covered wages; unlike theMedicare HI tax, which applies to all such wages,Social Security taxes apply only up to a taxable maxi-mum that is indexed to the growth of wages overtime. Consequently, receipts from OASDI and HItaxes tend to remain a constant proportion of incomeas long as covered wages are a steady share of GDPand the distribution of income from wages stays rela-tively stable. CBO projects that social insurance tax receipts will decrease slightly relative to GDP over the nextdecade. That decline is partly the result of the unusu-ally high ratio of social insurance receipts to GDP in2001: the ratio climbed from 6.7 percent in 2000 to6.8 percent in 2001 and is expected to rise to 6.9 per-cent in 2002. Those higher levels are largely a conse-quence of the recession, which tends to increase theshare of total income claimed by wages when corpo-rate profits and interest inco me fall. The ratio is ex- pected to creep downward as the economy and profitsrecover.In general, receipts from Social Security and Medicare taxes over the 2002-2012 period w ill re- main a fairly constant proportion of wage and salaryincome, CBO estimates. And after the economyswings back to full employment, they will tend tomaintain a fairly steady share of GDP. From 2002 to2005, CBO projects, the ratio of total social insur-ance receipts to wage and salary income will rise,mainly because state unemployment systems will bereplenishing their trust funds in the wake of the out-flow of unemployment benefits during the recession.The slow decline in social insurance receipts as afraction of wages that CBO expects will occur after2005 is driven largely by three factors: states willhave completed replenishing their funds; revenuesassociated with other federal retirement programswill be lower, as the number of workers covered un-der Railroad Retirement and the old Civil ServiceRetirement System dwindles; and a slightly largerfraction of total wage and salary income will beabove the cap on earnings subject to Social Securitytaxes. Compared with last January's projections, CBO's current estimates of social insurance receiptsover the 2002-2011 period are lower by about $13060 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 3-9.

The reductions stem from changes in CBO's projections of wages and salaries as a consequence ofthe slowdown in economic grow th. Part of the over- all decrease is offset by technical changes that boostreceipts. (The changes are based on information thatcurrent collections of OASDI and HI taxes are actu-ally higher than revenue-estimating models predicted,given the level of economic activity.) Although thatextra revenue is projected to persist, the increase incollections of social insurance receipts does not re-sult in a net increase in projected total revenues\u2014because the increase in so cial insurance receipts is linked to an offsetting decrease in individual incometax receipts. Excise Taxes Receipts from excise taxes are expected to continuetheir long-term decline as a percentage of GDP, fall-ing from their share of 0.7 percent in 2001 to 0.5 per-cent by 2012. Most excise taxes\u2014those generatingabout 80 percent of total excise revenues\u2014are leviedper unit of a good or per transaction rather than as apercentage of value. As a result, excise receipts growwith real output, but they generally do not rise withinflation. Therefore, they do not grow as fast as does nominal GDP.Nearly all excise taxes fall into five major cate- gories: highway, airport, telephone, alcohol, and to- bacco. Almost half of all excise tax receipts are ear-marked for (allocated by law to) the Highway TrustFund; they come primarily from taxes on gasolineand diesel fuel (see Table 3-10). Most airport and telephone excise taxes are levied on a percentage ba-sis, so they grow at a faster rate than do the other cat-egories. CBO's projections of tobacco tax receiptsincorporate the effects of a small rate hike enacted in1997 to take effect on January 1, 2002\u2014which raisesthe level of receipts for this year. However, the pro-jections also reflect the drop in tobacco consumptionthat is expected from the ri se in tobacco prices result- ing from the tobacco industry's settlements with thestates. The net effect is that CBO's estimates of re-ceipts from tobacco excise taxes are roughly stable for 2003 through 2012. CBO's current projections of total excise tax receipts are lower than the estimates it produced lastJanuary for the same period (2002 through 2011).Lower projections of aviation-related taxes in thewake of the events of September 11 account for someof the drop. And some of it results from as-yet-unex-plained reductions, relative to earlier projections, inthe receipts collected for other excise taxes in 2001\u2014a pattern that CBO expects will continue through the2002-2012 period.CHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 61 Table 3-10.

Estate and Gift Taxes In the past, revenues from estate and gift taxes have tended to grow more rapidly than income because theunified credit for the estate and gift tax, which effec-tively exempts some assets from taxation, is not in-dexed for inflation. U nder EGTRRA, however, the estate tax phases out, and the gift tax remains in thecode but in a modified form. The amount of an estatethat the law effectively exempts from tax is sched-uled to rise, in a series of steps, from $1 million in2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. EGTRRA also reducesthe highest estate tax rate, from 50 percent in 2002 to45 percent by 2007. In 2010, the law calls for theestate tax to be eliminated. But the expiration ofEGTRRA's provisions at the end of that year meansthat the tax will be reinstated in 2011. Because ofnormal lags in the payment of estate tax liability andthe retention of the gift tax in the tax code, receiptsfrom estate and gift taxes do not disappear com-pletely in CBO's projec tions for the 2002-2012 pe- riod but instead reach a trough in 2011 (see Table 3-11). CBO estimates that in 2012 they will return totheir 2002 level relative to GDP. CBO's current projections of estate and gift tax receipts are lower than those from January 2001 byabout $180 billion. The source of most of that de-cline was legislation (specifically, EGTRRA), buttechnical changes also contribut ed to it. In particular, the weakening of the stock market led CBO to reviseits estimates of the household wealth that would besubject to the estate tax. Other Sources of Revenue Customs duties and numerous miscellaneous sourcesbring in much smaller amounts of revenue than dothe major levies (see Table 3-11). CBO projects thatcustoms duties will grow over time in tandem withimports. Over the next few years, however, theirgrowth will be curbed as tariff reductions enacted in1994 are phased in. The largest component of miscellaneous re- ceipts is the profits of the Federal Reserve System,which are counted as revenues once they are turnedover to the Treasury. Those profits depend on theinterest earned on the system's portfolio of securitiesand on gains and losses from its holdings of foreigncurrency. In recent months, earnings on securitieshave declined as the central bank engaged in acountercyclical monetary policy of lowering interestrates to try to stimulate economic growth and counterthe economy's downturn. In addition, the recessionhas shrunk the Federal Reserve's portfolio of assetsbecause of slower growth in the public's holdings of62 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 3-11.

U.S. currency. Those declines have led CBO to pro- ject that receipts from the Federal Reserve System in2002 and 2003 will be substantially below theamounts previously projected. The central bank'sincome, and therefore the receipts it remits to theTreasury, are expected to return to their previoustrends in 2004 and 2005. Another small but significant component of mis- cellaneous receipts is the Universal Service Fund.Collected from the telecommunications industry,money from the fund is intended to finance Internetservice for libraries and schools in low-income areasand to subsidize basic telephone service for high-costareas and low-income households. CBO's currentprojections of this source of revenues hover close to$5 billion for each year of the 2002-2012 period, al-though the level of total receipts expected from thissource has fallen compared with the level CBO pro-jected last January. CBO has reduced its projectionson the basis of new information about the establish-ment of state universal se rvice funds (the Telecom- munications Act of 1996 permitted the states to setup such funds to collect a nd disburse money). Re- ceipts from the state funds we re factored in to earlier projections of miscellaneous receipts, but CBO nowconsiders it unlikely that the funds will be estab-lished. (The drop in receipts that CBO's projectionsnow incorporate is offset on the outlay side of thefederal budget, so the overall effect on the budget isneutral.)A further reduction that CBO has incorporated in its current projections applies to the category of\"other\" miscellaneous receipts. Provisions of theInvestor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act, whichwas passed in December 2001, lower the fees thatCBO expects the Securities and Exchange Commis-sion (SEC) will r eceive over the period; the law also reclassifies them as offsetting collections\u2014whichappear in the budget as negative outlays rather thanrevenues. In sum, the changes in the SEC's fees and the revision related to state universal service funds ex-plain most of the $82 billion decline since last Janu-ary in CBO's projections of other miscellaneous re-ceipts (excluding those from the Federal ReserveSystem) for the 2002-2011 period. Expiring Tax Provisions CBO's projections of revenues rest on the assumptionthat current tax laws remain unaltered except forscheduled changes and e xpirations, both of which occur on time. (The sole exception to that approachis the expiration of excise taxes dedicated to trustfunds, which under budget rules are included in therevenue projections whether or not they are sched-uled to expire.) Yet expiring tax provisions can haveCHAPTER THREE THE REVENUE OUTLOOK 63 a significant effect on CBO's estimates\u2014even in or- dinary circumstances, when they do not include pro-visions such as the EGTRRA tax cuts, which are dueto expire in 2010. Many expiring provisions are ex-tended almost as a matter of course, and most of themreduce receipts; thus, if CBO incorporated the provi- sions' effects in its projections, those estimates ofrevenues would be lower than the revenues projectedunder current law. Because the EGTRRA tax cutsare included as expiring pr ovisions, the size of that category in CBO's current projections is substantiallylarger than in most past years. Provisions That Expired in 2001 Twelve tax provisions expired in late 2001, and all ofthem acted to reduce revenues (see Table 3-12). TheHouse included at least partial extensions of 10 of theprovisions in the Economic Security and Worker As-sistance Act of 2001, which was passed in December,although the legislation a nd extensions did not be- come law. The remaining measures\u2014the AndeanTrade Preference Initiative and the Generalized Sys-tem of Preferences\u2014were considered in separate leg-islation. Sometimes in the past, when provisions have recently expired, the Congress has subsequently ex-tended them either prospectively or retroactively. Ifall of those expired provis ions were immediately and permanently extended, they would reduce revenuesby a total of $93 billion over the 2003-2012 period.Over the same period, about $51 billion, or more thanhalf of the total cost of extending those expired pro-visions, would come from the measure that allowstaxpayers to claim certain personal credits against thealternative minimum tax. Without the extension ofthat provision, some taxpayers would be unable toclaim the education tax credits that were enacted inthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The provision al-lowing an exemption from taxable income for certainpassive income from financial activities abroadwould reduce revenues by an estimated $27 billionover the projection period if it was extended at leastthrough 2012. Provisions Expiring During the 2002-2012 Period A number of additional provisions will expire during the period from 2002 through 2012. The most signif-icant of them, from an overall budgetary perspective,were enacted in EGTRRA. 7 Three provisions from that law expire by the end of 2006, and the rest, rep-resenting the bulk of the law's budgetary effects, ex-pire on December 31, 2010. If those measures wereextended, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation(JCT) project that revenues would be reduced by$569 billion through 2012. Most of that reduction, or$430 billion, would be felt at the end of the period, in2011 and 20 12, as a result of extending the tax cuts that expired at the end of 2010. Those reductionsinclude the cuts in marginal tax rates for individuals,increases in the child tax credit, and repeal of the es-tate tax. About $140 billion of the loss in revenues from extending the expiring prov isions of EGTRRA would occur earlier than in 2011. Extending the changes toestate and gift taxes, which expire at the end of 2010,could reduce revenues as early as 2003, b ecause if taxpayers knew that the law's repeal of the estate taxwould become permanent in 2011, some might post-pone taxable gifts that they would otherwise havemade during the decade. In addition, CBO's andJCT's estimates of the effects of extendingEGTRRA's provisions also incorporate the assump-tion that the higher exemption levels for the AMT,which expire in 2004, are extended at their 2004 lev-els. Under that assumption, the exemption levelswould not rise with infla tion, so a growing number of taxpayers would still become subject to the AMTover time\u2014albeit fewer than if the higher exemptionlevels expired as they are now scheduled to do. Twoother provisions of EG TRRA expire before 2010\u2014 the deduction for qualified education expenses (in2005) and the credit for elective deferrals and contri-butions to individual retirement accounts (in 2006). 7.

The overall totals do not equal the sums of the separate provisions because they include estimated interactions among provisi ons in 2011 and 2012. Those interactions would occur if all of the provisions were extended together.66 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Eighteen provisions not related to EGTRRA also expire over the 2002-2012 period, and 11 ofthem, if extended, would reduce revenues. The onewith the greatest effect by far is the research and ex-perimentation tax credit, which was first enacted in1981. In 1999, the Congress extended that tax bene-fit through June 2004, the ninth and longest time ithas been extended since 1985. Extending the creditfrom 2005 through 2012 would reduce revenues byabout $54 billion. In all, extending those 11 provi-sions would decrease recei pts by $82 billion through 2012. Six provisions that expire between 2002 and 2005 would raise revenues if they were extended.Extending the provision imposing fees for the recla-mation of abandoned mines and the luxury tax onpassenger vehicles would each raise between roughly$200 million and $250 million per year; each of thefour other provisions would raise revenues by lessthan $50 million annually. Those other measuresinclude extending user fees charged by the InternalRevenue Service (IRS), allowing employers to trans-fer excess assets in defined-benefit plans to a specialaccount dedicated to health benefits for retirees, andproviding information to the IRS on government ben-efits received by veterans. One expiring provision has no effect on reve- nues. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act surchargebrings in about $2 billion a year; however, the addi-tional revenues from extending the provision wouldbe rebated to the states. CBO expects that the stateswould use them to lower their unemployment insur-ance tax rates. Since receipts from the state taxes arecounted as federal unemployment tax receipts, ex-tending the surcharge would have no net effect onrevenues.Expiring Provisions That Are Included in the Baseline In its projections, CBO takes into account excise tax receipts earmarked for trust funds, even if provisionsfor those taxes are scheduled to expire. The largest ofsuch taxes that are slated to expire during the nextdecade finance the Highway Trust Fund. Some ofthe taxes for that fund are permanent, but most ofthem expire on September 30, 2005. Extending themat today's rates contributes about $45 billion to CBO'srevenue projections in 2012, or about half of totalexcise tax receipts. Other expiring trust fund taxes, if extended, would account for smaller amounts in 2012, CBOestimates. Taxes dedicated to the Airport and Air-ways Trust Fund, which are scheduled to expire atthe end of 2007, would contribute about $16 billionto revenues in 2012. Taxes for the Leaking Under-ground Storage Tank Trust Fund, set to expire onMarch 31, 2005, would contribute about $250 mil-lion. No other expiring tax provisions are automati-cally extended in CBO's projections. Total Effect of Expiring Provisions If all expiring tax provisions were extended together,projections of total revenues would be lower by$4 billion in 2003, with revenue losses growing to$59 billion in 2010 before jumping to $189 billion in2011 and $297 billion in 2012. Over the 2003-2012period, revenues would be reduced by $735 billion. That estimate of the effects of jointly extending theexpiring provisions includes interactions among theprovisions, which reduce revenues by an additional$23 billion in 2011 and 2012.Chapter Four The Spending Outlook Federal spending totaled nearly $1.9 trillion in 2001\u2014a 4.2 percent increase from 2000. In 2002, the Congressional Budget Office pro- jects, spending will grow by 7.5 percent if cur- rent policies remain unchanged. Such an increasewould be the largest since 1990, when there was asizable jump in spending because of the savings andloan crisis. Excluding net interest (which has beendeclining in recent years), spending increased by 5.9percent between 2000 and 2001 and is expected toclimb by 10.6 percent from 2001 to 2002. Recently enacted legislation, by increasing ap- propriations for both defense and nondefense activi-ties, contributes to the substantial rise in the rate ofgrowth in spending this year. On the basis of legisla-tion enacted to date, CBO estimates that discretionarybudget authority will increase by 7.4 percent from the2001 level; discretionary outlays will grow by 12.8percent. Driving that jump in outlays are the rapidincreases in budget authority provided over the pastcouple of years and the spending of the emergencyappropriations related to the September 11 attacks.Similarly, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Rec-onciliation Act of 2001, which expanded the child taxcredit, adds more than $4 billion in outlays in 2002for the refundable portion of that credit. Economic weakness will also contribute to higher spending in 2002. The recession and its after-math are expected to push the unemployment rate to6.2 percent by mid-2002. As a result, unemploymentcompensation is anticipated to soar by 67 percentfrom the level recorded in 2001. As more people be-come unemployed, participation in other support pro-grams, such as Food Stamps, also increases. (Spend-ing on Food Stamps is projected to rise by 19 percentthis year.) CBO projects that without enactment of further legislation, the rate of growth in spending will mod-erate to an average of 3.8 percent a year over the next10 years. Total spending in CBO's baseline risesfrom $2.0 trillion in 2002 to $2.9 trillion in 2012.(See Tables 4-1 and 4-2.) Federal spending can be divided into categories based on its treatment in the budget process: \u007fDiscretionary spending\u2014 which pays for such things as defense, transportation, national parks, and foreign aid\u2014accounts for about one-thirdof the budget. Discretionary programs are con-trolled by annual appropriation acts; policy-makers decide each year how many dollars todevote to which activities. Certain fees andother charges that are triggered by appropriationaction are classified as offsetting collections,which offset discretionary spending. CBO'sbaseline depicts the path of discretionary spend-ing in accordance with the Balanced Budget andEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, whichstates that current spending (for this report, ap-propriations provided for fiscal year 2002)should be assumed to grow with inflation in the future. 1 1. The inflation rates used in CBO's baseline, as specified by the Defi- cit Control Act, are the employment cost index for wages and sala- ries (for expenditures related to federal personnel) and the grossdomestic product deflator (for other expenditures). 68 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 4-1.

The Congress generally controlsspending for those programs by setting rules foreligibility, benefit formulas, and other parame-ters rather than by appropriating specific dollaramounts each year. CBO's baseline projectionsof mandatory spending assume that existinglaws and policies remain unchanged and thatmost expiring programs will be extended. Offsetting receipts\u2014 fees and other charges that are recorded as negative budget authority andoutlays\u2014are collected without annual appropri-ation action. Offsetting receipts differ from rev-enues in that revenues are collected as an exer-cise of the government's sovereign powers,whereas offsetting receipts are generally col-lected from other government accounts or paidby the public for businesslike transactions (such as rents and royalties from leases for oil and gasdrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf). Net interest\u2014 which includes interest paid on Treasury securities and other interest that thegovernment pays (for example, on late refundsissued by the Internal Revenue Service) minusinterest that the government collects from vari-ous sources (such as from commercial banks fordeposits in tax and loan accounts)\u2014is driven bythe size of the government's debt, annual budgetsurpluses or deficits, and market interest rates. The mix of federal spending has changed signif- icantly over time. Today, the government spends less\u2014as a proportion of GDP\u2014on discretionary activi-ties and more on entitlement programs than it did inthe past. Discretionary spending fell from 12.7 per-cent of GDP in 1962 to 6.4 percent in 2001 (see Fig-ure 4-1). Over that period, spending on entitlementsCHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 69 Table 4-2.

(For detailed annual data on spending since1962, see Appendix F.) According to CBO's base line, discretionary out- lays will grow about half as fast as the economy, atan average annual rate of 2.7 percent, from 2002 to2012. Led by the two major health care programs,Medicare and Medicaid, mandatory spending (net ofoffsetting receipts) will grow slightly faster than theeconomy\u2014at a rate of 5.4 percent\u2014if current poli-cies remain unchanged. At that rate, mandatoryspending (net of offsetting receipts) will climb to10.8 percent of GDP by 2012. Although interest pay- ments currently consume a sizable portion of the fed-eral budget, CBO projects that, with a shrinkingamount of debt held by the public, such spending willdecline from 2.0 percent of GDP in 2001 to 0.5 per-cent of GDP in 2012.

That authority translates intooutlays when the money is actually spent. Althoughsome funds are spent quickly, others are disbursedover several years. In any given year, discretionaryoutlays include spending from both new budget au-thority and from amounts appropriated previously. Recent Trends in Discretionary Spending As a share of GDP, disc retionary spending has dropped from 9.0 percent in 1991 to 6.4 percent in 2001 (see Table 4-3). The figures for total discre-tionary spending, however, mask large programmaticshifts that occurred between 1991 and 1996\u2014defensespending declined from $320 billion to $266 from $214 on.

In 2001, defense and nondefense outlayswere $306 billion and $343 billion, respectively. Al-though spending for nondefense programs has out-stripped that for defense, growth in the economy has been greater still. As a result, at the end of 2001,nondefense spending was below its 1991 level as apercentage of GDP. (For additional information onthe growth in nondefense outlays, see Box 4-1.) For 2002, CBO estimates that defense spending will rise to $351 billion and nondefense outlays willreach $381 billion. Total discretionary outlays, CBOexpects, will increase by $84 billion (12.8 percent)from their level in 2001\u2014a much faster rise than ex-perienced in the 1990s. Emergency appropriationsrelated to the September 11 attacks will generateabout one-quarter of that growth. (For additional information on those appropriations, see Box 4-2.)Increased budget authority provided for 2002 andspending in the pipeline from appropriations before2002 will account for the remainder. Discretionary Spending for 2003 to 2012 CBO's projections should be viewed not as a predic- tion of future outcomes but rather as a reference pointfor assessing policy changes, in part because, as spec-ified in the Deficit Control Act, CBO inflates discre-tionary budget authority from the level appropriatedin the current year (in this case, 2002). In CBO'sbaseline, discretionary outlays reach $953 billion in2012. The economy, however, is projected to con-tinue growing faster than the baseline for such spend-ing; as a result, discretionary outlays decline as a per-centage of GDP from 7.1 percent in 2002 to 5.5 per-cent in 2012. Because the size of projected deficits and sur- pluses is sensitive to assumptions about discretionaryspending, CBO has prepared four alternative scenar-ios for such spending during the 2003-2012 period.One scenario assumes that budget authority grows atthe same rate as nominal GDP after 2002 (5.3 percenta year, on average, compared with the 2.6 percentrate of growth assumed in the baseline). That as-sumption would cause discretionary outlays to be$1.2 trillion higher than the baseline figures over the10-year period (see Table 4-4 on page 74).

Estimated. 2002 (7.6 percent)\u2014discretionary outlays would ex- ceed the baseline figures by a cumula tive $2.3 tril- lion. A third scenario does not inflate the $20 billionof emergency appropriations provided in Public Law107-117 for 2002, but it assumes that all other budgetauthority grows at the baseline rates from 2003 to2012. 2 Under that assumption, discretionary outlays over the 10-year period would be $0.2 trillion lowerthan the baseline figures. A fourth scenario assumesthat budget authority is essentially frozen at the dol-lar level enacted for 2002. Under that assumption,discretionary outlays over the 2003-2012 periodwould total $1.0 trillion less than those in the base-line.Entitlements and Other Mandatory Spending Currently, more than half of the $2 trillion that the federal government spends each year supports entitle-ment programs and other types of mandatory spend-ing (not including net interest). Most mandatory pro-grams make payments to recipients\u2014a wide varietyof people, as well as businesses, nonprofit institu-tions, and state and local governments\u2014that are eli-gible and apply for funds. Payments are governed byformulas set in law and generally are not constrainedby annual appropriation acts. As a share of total outlays, mandatory spending steadily increased from 32 percent in 1962 to 59 per-cent in 2001. If current policies remain unchanged,mandatory spending will continue to grow faster thanother spending, reaching 70 percent of total outlaysin 2012, CBO estimates. Among the largest manda-tory programs are Social Security, Medicare, andMedicaid, which together accounted for over 72 per-cent of mandatory spending in 2001 and are projected 2. In September 2001, the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropria- tions Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks onthe United States (P.L. 107-38) provided $40 billion of budgetauthority\u2014$20 billion in 2001 and a second $20 billion that couldbe obligated only though subsequent legislation. In December2001, enactment of the Department of Defense and EmergencySupplemental Appropriations for Recovery from and Response toTerrorist Attacks on the United States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-117),made the second $20 billion available; as part of current-year ap-propriations, that amount is extended throughout the 10-year base-line period.72 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Space and Science Research ($21.0, 5.5% )Other ($46.0, 12.1%)Health Research and Public and Environment ($27.5, 7.2%)Veterans' Benefits ($23.8, and The Growth in Nondefense Discretionary Outlays To focus on the increases in nondefense discretionary outlays since the emergence of a surplus in 1998, theCongressional Budget Office (CBO) examined suchspending for the four-year periods before and after thatyear\u2014for 1994 through 1998 and for 1998 through 2002(which encompasses one year of CBO's estimates). Overthe first period, nondefense discretionary outlays grew atan average annual rate of about 2 percent; for the secondperiod, CBO estimates a growth rate of approximately 8percent. All budget functions except one show increasesin outlays over the second period. In 2002, the followingfour categories will account fo r about half of nondefense discretionary outlays (up from 45 percent in 1998). The education, training, and social services category will claim 16 percent of nonde fense discretionary outlays in 2002, CBO expects (see the figure below). That bud-get function includes all federal programs related to edu-cation and employment as well as social services for chil-dren, families, the elderly, and disabled people. From1994 through 1998, spending for the category grew at anaverage annual rate of about 3 percent. For the secondperiod, CBO estimates that rate to be nearly 10 percent;much of that growth results from increased spending foreducation. Transportation (ground, ai r, and water) will account for 15 percent of nondefense discretionary outlays in2002, CBO estimates. For 1994 through 1998, transpor- tation spending grew slowly, at an average annual rate ofless than 2 percent; but for 1998 through 2002, CBO esti-mates a growth rate of almost 11 percent. Outlays forground transportation have been the largest contributor tothat growth, spurred by the Transportation Equity Act forthe 21st Century (Public Law 105-178). According to CBO's projections, health research and public health expenditures will make up more than10 percent of nondefense discretionary outlays in 2002.For 1998 through 2002, CBO estimates an average an-nual rate of growth in spending for the category that ismore than double the rate for the previous period. Fuel-ing such growth are additional grants and contracts toresearch diseases and promote disease-prevention pro-grams awarded by the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration and the National Institutes of Health. Since the mid-1990s, the federal government has stepped up its funding for the administration of justice atan average annual rate of more than 10 percent. Most ofthe increases have been devoted to correctional activitiesand law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bu-reau of Investigation, the Immigration and NaturalizationService, and the Customs Service. For 2002, CBO pro-jects that the category will account for almost 9 percentof nondefense discretionary outlays. Nondefense Discretionary Spending, by Budget Function, 2002 (In billions of dollars and percent)CHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 73 Box 4-2. $40 Billion of Emergency Discretionary Appropriations for 2001 and 2002 Responding to the events of September 11, the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Re-covery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on theUnited States (P.L. 107-38) provided $40 billion for disaster recovery and homeland security. That lawstipulated, however, that half of the funds could not be obligated until subsequent legislation was enacted; theDepartment of Defense a nd Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Recovery from and Response toTerrorist Attacks on the Unite d States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-117), made the second $20 billion available. From the first $20 billion, the Department of De- fense (DoD) obtained more than any other agency,about $14 of budget authority; the FederalEmergency Management Agen cy's (FEMA's) disaster relief program received the next largest amount, $2billion. Because P.L. 107-38 was enacted near the endof fiscal year 2001, CBO es timates that only $131 mil- lion of outlays from it occurred in 2001. The majorityof the outlays will be recorded in 2002 (see the tablebelow). Of the second $20 billion, less than $4 billion was alloted to DoD; the remaining $16 billion was forcombating terrorism, improving homeland security,providing aid, and promoting recovery. CBOestimates that the second $20 billion will result in out- lays of $8 billion in 2002, about $5 billion in 2 003, and the remainder in subsequent years. Altogether, a little more than half of the $40 bil- lion was provided to nondefens e agencies. The largest amounts went to FEMA ($6.6 billion), the Departmentof Health and Human Services ($2.9 billion), the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development ($2.7billion), and the Department of Justice ($2.2 billion). In accordance with the Deficit Control Act, CBO's baseline projects budget authority by inflatingthe level appropriated for 2002. Because the first $20billion was provided for 2001, its budget authority isnot inflated, but the resulting outlays are included inthe baseline. However, because the second $20 bil-lion was provided for 2002, its budget authority is in-flated through 2012 in the baseline. Table 4-4 shows an alternative path of spending that excludes the second $20 billion from total discre-tionary budget authority from 2003 through 2012.Chapter 7 describes how much is being spent forhomeland security, including a detailed breakout ofthe $40 billion of emergency appropriations (see Table7-4 on page 117). $40 Billion of Emergency Discr etionary A ppropriations, by Type of Spending (In billions of dollars) 2001 2002 20032004 and BeyondTotal, 2001-2012 Defense Budget authority 14 4 0 0 18Outlays * 13 3 1 18 Nondefense Budget authority 6 16 0 0 22Outlays * 9 6 8 22 Total Budget authority 20 20 0 0 40Outlays * 21 9 9 40 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office.

In CBO's projections, discretionary outlays are always higher than budget authority because of spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund, which is subject to obligation limitations in appropriation acts. The budget authority for such programs is provided in authorizing legislation and is not considered discretionary. Another reason why outlays exceed budgetauthority is that they include spending from appropriations provided in previous years. a. Using the inflators specified in the Deficit Control Act (the GDP deflator and the employment cost index for wages and salari es). b. When October 1 falls on a weekend, certain federal payments due on that date are shifted into September; consequently, milita ry personnel will be paid 13 times in 2005 and 2011 and 11 times in 2007 and 2012. c. The Department of Defense and Emer gency Supplemental Appropriations for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Atta cks on the United States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-117), provided $20 billion of supplemental budget authority for 2002. This scenario does not inflate that emergency appropriation from 2003 through 2012 but includes the outlays resulting from it.76 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 to reach almost 79 percent of mandatory spending in 2012. Less than one-fourth of entitlements and manda- tory spending, or about one-seventh of all federalspending, is means-tested\u2014that is, paid to individu-als who must document their need on the basis ofincome or assets that are below specified thresholds.In some cases, other criteria, such as family status,are also used. The remainder of mandatory spendinghas no such restrictions and is labeled non-means-tested. Means-Tested Programs Since the 1960s, spending on means-tested benefitshas more than tripled as a share of the economy\u2014from 0.8 percent of GDP in 1962 to a high of 2.6 per-cent in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000, means-testedoutlays declined slightly as a share of GDP, measur-ing 2.4 percent in 2000. They increased to 2.5 per-cent in 2001, and CBO projects such outlays to climbto 2.7 percent in 2002. Changes in spending formeans-tested programs are driven by several factors,including inflation, rising h ealth care costs, fluctuat- ing unemployment, growth of the eligible popula-tions, and new legislation. CBO projects that spend- ing for means-tested programs will grow more rap-idly than the economy over the next 10 years\u2014largely because of Medicaid's growth\u2014climbing to2.8 percent of GDP in 2012. Medicaid. Outlays for Medicaid, the joint federal/ state program that pays for the medical care of manyof the nation's poor people, made up over half of allspending for means-tested entitlements in 2001 (seeTable 4-5). Spending grew by 11.1 percent, markingthe fifth consecutive year that spending growth in theprogram accelerated. The spending increase in 2001resulted from a combination of higher prices and ris-ing enrollment and utilization. Most notably, spend-ing on outpatient prescription drugs jumped by 19percent (after rising by 18 percent in 1999 and 22percent in 2000). State and federal actions in recentyears to expand eligibility and benefits, increase pay-ment rates to providers, and conduct outreach haveincreased both enrollment and costs. States also ex-panded their use of financing mechanisms related toMedicare's upper payment limit (UPL) that generate additional federal payments. 3 In 2002, spending for Medicaid will increase by 9.5 percent, CBO estimates\u2014r eflecting higher costs for prescription drugs, a dditional enrollment of chil- dren and adults resulting from rising unemployment,and states' continuing us e of their UPL financing mechanisms. For 2003, CBO projects, spendinggrowth will dip to 6.5 percent because a provisionallowing \"transitional eligibility\" expires 4 and be- cause restrictions that take effect will limit both UPLspending and payments to hospitals that serve a largenumber of Medicaid benefi ciaries or other low- income people. Over the next decade, Medicaid spending is pro- jected to grow more rapidly than spending for othermeans-tested programs. Higher prices, greater con-sumption of services, and, to a lesser extent, higherenrollment will continue pu tting upward pressure on Medicaid costs\u2014pushing outlays from $143 billionin 2002 to $323 billion in 2012\u2014an average a nnual increase of 8.5 percent (see Figure 4-2). Spendingfor acute care services, which includes payments tomanaged care plans and payments for prescriptiondrugs, accounts for more than half of all Medicaidoutlays and is the most rapidly growing component ofthe program. Acute care spending is anticipated togrow from $76 billion in 2002 to $188 billion in2012. Spending for long-term care, which accountsfor about one-third of all Medicaid spending, is alsoexpected to grow rapidly, climbing from $42 billionin 2002 to $98 billion in 2012, as states expand eligi-bility for home- and community-based services inresponse to legal challenges under the Americanswith Disabilities Act. 3. The UPL is a regulatory ceiling in Medicaid's payment policy that prohibits states from paying certain groups of facilities more thanthey would under Medicare's rules. However, many states use par-ticular financing mechanisms to pay certain public facilities at ratesfar above Medicaid's normal rates, but below Medicare's upperpayment limit, and then receive federal matching funds for thosepayments. Those public facilities return the excess to the states,and the states then retain the additional funds from the federalmatch. 4.

Annual Growth of Federal Medicaid Outlays,1978-2012 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. Other Means-Tested Programs. Outlays for other means-tested programs are projected to grow at anaverage annual rate of 2.0 percent from 2002 through2012, although two programs will experience signifi-cant growth this year. Because of current economicweakness, spending for the Food Stamp program isprojected to jump 19 percent in 2002; however,growth will slow thereafter, yielding an average an-nual rate of 1.7 pe rcent over the next decade. Out- lays for refundable tax credits\u2014the earned incometax credit and the refundable portion of the child taxcredit\u2014are projected to increase by 21 percent in2002. Almost all of that jump results from the expan-sion of the child tax credit contained in the EconomicGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.Beyond 2002, outlays for refundable tax credits areexpected to rise to $43 billion in 2011 before fallingto $31 billion in 2012, the first full year after the ex-panded child tax credit is scheduled to expire. Although the student loan program is difficult to classify as either means-tested or non-means-tested,CBO includes that program in the former categorybecause historically the majority of loans have hadinterest subsidies and have been limited to studentsfrom families with relatively low income and finan-cial assets. However, in recent years, the fastest-growing category of loans involves no means-testing. For 2002, CBO estimates that about $37 billion instudent loans will be guaranteed or provided directlyby the federal government. Over the 2002-2012 pe-riod, total loan disbursements will top $475 billion.Of that total, the share of loans that are not means-tested will increase from 52 percent in 2002 to 57percent in 2012. The costs included in the federal budget for stu- dent loans reflect only a small portion of the dis-bursements. Under the Credit Reform Act, only thesubsidy costs of the loans are treated as outlays.Those outlays are estimated as the future costs in to-day's dollars for interest subsidies, default costs, andother expected costs over the life of the loans. CBOestimates that the subsidy and administrative costs ofthe student loan program will range from $3 billion to$5 billion a year from 2002 through 2012. Non-Means-Tested Programs Social Security, Medicare, and other retirement anddisability programs dominate non-means-tested en-titlements. Social Security is by far the largest fed-eral program, with expected outlays of $451 billionin 2002. It pays benefits to 46 million people\u2014anumber that is projected to increase to about 54 mil-lion by 2012. Most Social S ecurity beneficiaries also participate in Medicare, which is expected to cost$249 billion in 2002. Together, those two programsaccount for more than one out of every three dollarsthat the federal government spends (up from aboutone in four dollars in 1980). CBO projects that thetwo programs combined will grow by more than $569billion from 2002 to 2012 as the leading edge of thebaby-boom generation reaches the age of eligibility.In total, Social Security and Medicare account formore than half of the projected increase in federaloutlays over that period Social Security . During the past decade, Social Se- curity outlays grew by an average of about 4.9 per-cent a year. For the next 10 years, that figure willaverage about 5.5 percent a year, CBO projects. By2012, spending for Social Security will total $771billion. The share of the economy devoted to it willremain fairly constant at about 4.4 percent of GDPthrough 2012.CHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 79 Social Security's Old-Age and Survivors Insur- ance (OASI) program pays benefits to retired work-ers, their eligible spouses and children, and to somesurvivors (chiefly young children and aged widows)of deceased workers. It will pay a bout $384 billion in benefits in 2002. Most beneficiaries are elderly,and most elderly people co llect Social Security: three-fifths of people between the ages of 62 and 64and more than 90 percent of people 65 and older col-lect Social Security. Consequently, CBO bases itsestimates of the number of beneficiaries and of OASIoutlays primarily on the size of the elderly popula-tion. CBO projects that OASI benefits will cost $636 billion in 2012, an increase of 66 percent over the amount in 2002, reflecting an average growth rate of5.2 percent a year. In contrast, benefits grew by 56percent in the past decade, at an average rate of 4.5percent a year. Overall, of that 4.5 percent averageannual growth in OASI benefits during the past de-cade, roughly 2.7 percent can be assigned to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), 0.9 percent to increas-ing enrollment, and 0.9 percen t to growth in the aver- age real benefit (in excess of COLAs). For the nextdecade, CBO expects that the growth in COLAs willslow to 2.4 percent a year, enrollment will grow by1.4 percent a year, and the average real benefit willincrease by 1.2 percent a year. The smaller Disability Insurance (DI) program pays benefits to insured workers who have suffered aserious medical impairment before they reach retire-ment age and to their eligible spouses and children.According to CBO's projections, DI benefits willgrow even faster than OASI benefits, from $63 bil-lion in 2002 to $130 billion in 2012, at an averagerate of 7.6 percent a year. CBO ascribes 3.9 percentof that growth to increasing caseloads; 2.4 percent toCOLAs; and 1.1 percent to other factors, chiefly theeffect of wage growth on benefits. In the past de-cade, the average growth rate for the DI program wassimilar, measuring 8 percent. However, the source ofthat growth was somewhat different: CBO attributesroughly 5.3 percent to caseloads, 2.7 percent toCOLAs, and barely anything to other factors. Social Security outlays include about $4 billion in mandatory spending other than OASI and DI bene-fits. Almost all of that reflects an annual transfer to the Railroad Retirement program. Medicare. Currently, Medicare spending is about 55 percent as large as Social Security spending, but it isexpected to grow faster than Social Security spendingover the next decade. By 2012, CBO projects, spend-ing for the Medicare program will total more than$498 billion, and Medicare's share of the economywill have risen by about one-half of a percentagepoint, from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 2.9 per-cent. Partly because of the effects of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 on payment rates and a strongeffort by the federal government to ensure compli-ance with the program's payment rules, the annualchange in Medicare spending fell from almost a 9percent increase in 1997 to a 1 percent decline in1999. By the next year, the bulk of the savings hadbeen realized, so in 2000 and 2001 Medicare spend-ing grew by 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively.The acceleration in 2001 reflects large increases inpayment rates for many categories of services. Inaddition, there was a shift into September 2001 of theOctober payments to Medicare+Choice plans. With-out that payment shift, spending in 2001 would haveincreased by 8.6 percent. CBO projects that Medi-care spending will grow by 4.9 percent in 2002\u2014afigure that would have b een 7.7 percent without the payment shift. Through 2012, Medicare spendingwill increase by an average of 7.2 percent per year,CBO estimates. The projected growth in Medicare spending over the next decade stems from various factors.First, payment rates for most services in the fee-for-service sector (including hospital care and servicesfurnished by physicians, home health agencies, andskilled nursing facilities) are subject to automaticupdates based on changes in input prices and othereconomic factors, including changes in GDP and pro- ductivity. CBO estimates that automatic updates topayment rates will average 3.1 percent per year (al-though updates for specific services will vary consid-erably) and will account for roughly 45 percent of theincrease in Medicare spending from 2002 through2012.80 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Second, increases in caseloads make up an addi- tional 23 percent of the anticipated rise in Medicarespending over the 10-year period. CBO projects that the number of enrollees in Medicare's Hospital Insur-ance (Part A) program will expand by 17 percent,from 40 million to 47 million, between 2002 and2012. The increases in spending associated with newenrollees will be greater in the second half of the de-cade than in the first half, as baby boomers begin toqualify for Medicare coverage. Growth in enrollmentwill accelerate from 1 percent in 2002 to 2.6 percentin 2012, CBO estimates. The remainder of the increase results from other changes in covered benefits; from payment ratesrequired by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, theBalanced Budget Refinement Act, and the BenefitsImprovement and Protection Act of 2000; and fromsuch factors as changes in medical technology, bill-ing behavior, and the age distribution of enrollees. Other Non-Means-Tested Programs. Other federal retirement and disability programs, with outlays total-ing $97 billion in 2002, are less than one-fourth thesize of Social Security. They are dominated by bene-fits for the federal government's civilian and militaryretirees and the Railroad Retirement program. Thoseprograms are expected to average 3.9 percent annualgrowth from 2002 through 2012. The slowdown in economic growth has raised spending significantly for unemployment compensa-tion, as the number of people who have lost jobs hasswelled recently. The unemployment rate picked uprapidly at the end of fiscal year 2001, reaching 4.8percent\u2014almost a percentage point above its level ofa year before. By the end of fiscal year 2002, thatrate is projected to reach 6.2 percent. The change in2001 caused outlays for unemployment benefits togrow by 35 percent, from $21 billion the year beforeto $28 billion. The jump in 2002 will cause spendingfor unemployment compensation to leap 67 percent,to $47 billion, CBO projects. Even with renewedeconomic growth later in this fiscal year, the unem-ployment rate is likely to remain high for some time.CBO therefore projects that spending for unemploy- ment benefits will peak at $50 billion in 2003 beforedeclining in subsequent years.The balance of spending for non-means-tested programs funds a diverse set of activities\u2014mainlyveterans' benefits, health care benefits for militaryretirees, farm price and income supports, certain so-cial service grants to the states, and the UniversalService Fund. 5 CBO projects that spending for other non-means-tested programs will total $64 billion in 2002 (up from $59 billion last year) and it will fluctu-ate between $63 billion and $75 billion each yearover the next 10 years. By CBO's estimates, the in-troduction of additional health care benefits (medicalcoverage and prescription drug coverage) in 2003 formilitary retirees age 65 and over will increase manda-tory spending by $6 billion in its first year, a figurethat rises to $12 billion in 2012. Spending for farm price and income supports was $22 billion in 2001, down from $30 billion in2000. CBO projects that dow nward trend to continue as outlays fall to $14 billion in 2002 and to $5 billionin 2012. In recent years, the Congress has providedadditional money\u2014$14 billion in 2000 and $10 bil-lion in 2001\u2014through emergency or other one-timefunding. The drop in mandatory agricultural spend-ing over the 10-year period occurs in part becausesuch funding is not part of the ongoing mandatoryprogram and therefore is not projected in futureyears. In addition, with improved economic condi-tions and stronger demand for exports, CBO expects prices for major supported crops such as corn, cotton,and wheat to increase slowly throughout the decade. What Explains the Projected Rate of Increase in Manda tory Spending? As a whole, spending for entitlements and other man- datory programs has more than doubled since 1988\u2014rising faster than both nominal growth in the econ-omy and the rates of inflation. CBO's baseline pro-jections show that trend continuing. Why is mandatory spending projected to grow so much? One way to analyze that growth is to breakit down by its major causes. Such a breakdown 5. That fund receives payments from all providers of telecommunica- tions service and disburses them to those providers that serve high-cost areas, low-income households, libraries, and schools, as well asto rural health care providers.CHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 81 Table 4-6.

However, Medicare will make 13 payment s to Medicare+Choice plans in 2005 and 2011 and 11 in 2002, 2006, and 2012. Supplemental Security Income and veterans' benefits will be paid 13 times in 2005 and 2011 and 11 times in 2007 and 2012 . shows that 85 percent of the growth in entitlements and other mandatory programs between 2002 and2012 results from more participants; automatic in-creases in benefits; and greater use of, and increasingprices for, medical services. Rising numbers of participants produce about one-fifth of the total growth. Additional beneficia-ries increase spending by $11 billion in 2003 and$166 billion in 2012 relative to outlays in 2002 (seeTable 4-6). The majority of that spending is concen-trated in Social Security and Medicare and can betraced to a growing number of elderly and disabledpeople; most of the rest is in Medicaid. CBO esti- mates that the growth in the number of participantsalone will boost outlays for each of those three pro-grams by between 10 percent and 25 percent duringthe 2003-2012 period.Automatic increases in benefits account for more than one-third of the growth in entitlement pro-grams. All of the major retirement programs grantautomatic cost-of-living adju stments to their benefi- ciaries. The adjustment for 2002 is 2.6 percent, and CBO estimates that those adjustments, which arepegged to the consumer price index, will be 1.9 per-cent in 2003 and 2.5 percent thereafter. In 2002, out-lays for programs with COLAs total almost $597 bil- lion. COLAs are projected to add $9 billion to thatamount in 2003 and $156 billion in 2012. Several other programs\u2014chiefly the earned in- come tax credit, the Food Stamp program, and Medi-care\u2014are also automatically indexed to changes inprices and other economic factors. The incomethresholds above which the earned income tax creditbegins to be phased out and the maximum amount ofthe tax credit are both automa tically adjusted for in-82 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 4-7.

Medicare's payments to providers are based in parton special price indexes fo r the medical sector and other economic factors, including changes in GDP and productivity. The combined effect of indexingfor all of those programs is an extra $10 billion inoutlays in 2003 and $142 billion in 2012.The remaining boost in entitlement spending comes from increases that cannot be attributed to ris-ing enrollment or automatic adjustments to benefits. Two of those sources of growth are expected to be-come even more important over time. First, CBOanticipates that prices for Medicaid will grow withinflation even though the program is not formallyindexed at the federal level. Medicaid payments toproviders are determined by the states, and the fed-eral government matches those payments, accordingto a formula set by law. If states increase their bene-fits in response to increased prices, federal paymentswill rise correspondingly. Second, the health pro-grams have faced steadily escalating costs per partici- 6. Credits are administered through the individual income tax, but credits in excess of tax liabilities are recorded as outlays in the bud-get.CHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 83 Table 4-7.

Includes the Summer Food Service program and state administrative expenses. pant beyond the effects of in flation; that trend, which is often termed an increase in \"intensity,\" reflects theconsumption of more health services per participantand the growing use of more costly procedures. CBOestimates that the growth in Medicare and Medicaidfrom both of those sources will be $9 billion in 2003and $243 billion in 2012. In most federal retirement programs, the average benefit grows faster than the COLA alone. SocialSecurity is a prime example. Because awards to newretirees are buoyed by recent growth in wages, theirbenefits generally exceed the monthly check of along-time retiree who last earned a salary a decade or two ago and has been receiving only cost-of-livingadjustments since then. And because more womenare working today, more new retirees receive benefitsbased on their own earnings rather than smaller bene-fits based on their status as a spouse of a retiree. InSocial Security alone, CBO estimates, the resultingincrease in benefits will add $8 billion to outlays in2003 and $122 billion in 2012. Mandatory spending will increase or decrease in a given fiscal year depending on whether the first dayof the year, October 1, falls on a weekend. If it does,84 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 some benefit payments are made at the end of Sep- tember, which increases spending in the year justended and decreases spending in the new year. Thus,the Supplemental Security Income program, veterans'compensation and pension programs, and Medicare(for payments to health maintenance organizations)may send out 11, 12, or 13 monthly checks in a fiscalyear (see Table 4-6). Irregular numbers of benefitpayments will affect mandatory spending in 2002,2005 through 2007, 2011, and 2012. Most of the remaining growth in spending for benefit programs derives from rising benefits for newretirees in the Civil Service and Military Retirementprograms (fundamentally the same phenomenon as inSocial Security); the new program to provide medicalinsurance for Department of Defense retirees, whichwill begin in 2003; and larger average benefits forunemployment compensation (a program that lacksan explicit COLA but pays amounts that are gener-ally linked to the recent earnings of its beneficiaries)and some education programs for veterans. Thosefactors together contribute just $12 billion of the total $834 billion increase in mandatory spending in 2012. Legislation Assumed in the Baseline The general baseline concept for mandatory spendingis to project budget authority and outlays in accor-dance with current law. However, in the case of cer-tain programs with outlays of more than $50 millionin the current year, the Deficit Control Act directsCBO to assume that the programs will be extendedwhen their authorization expires. 7 The bulk of pro- jected spending associated with such programs oc-curs after 2002 (see Table 4-7 on page 82). The FoodStamp, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,and State Children's Health Insurance programs areexamples of programs whose current authorizationsexpire but that in the baseline are assumed to con- tinue. The Deficit Control Act also directs CBO toassume that cost-of-living adjustments for veterans'compensation are granted each year. In total, assum-ing that expiring programs are continued accounts forabout $55 billion in outlays each year from 2003 to 2006 and larger amounts in subsequent years. Offsetting Receipts Offsetting receipts are income that the governmentrecords as negative spending. Those receipts are ei-ther intragovernmental (reflecting payments from onepart of the federal government to another) or propri-etary (reflecting payments from the public in ex-change for goods or services). Collection of more (or less) money in the form of offsetting receipts generally requires a change inthe laws that generate such collections. Thus, offset-ting receipts are treated as offsets to mandatoryspending. Fees and other charges that are triggeredby appropriation action are classified as offsettingcollections. In those cases, the collections offset dis- cretionary spending. Intragovernmental transfers representing the contributions that federal agencies make to their em-ployees' retirement plans account for roughly 45 per-cent of offsetting receipts\u2014a share that is expected torange from 39 percent to 47 percent through 2012(see Table 4-8). Agencies' contributions go primar- ily to the trust funds for So cial Security, military re- tirement, and civil service retirement. Some contri-bution rates are set by statute; others are determinedon an actuarial basis. Those contributions arecharged against the agencies' budgets in the sameway as other elements of their employee compensa-tion are. The budget treats them as outlays of theemploying agency and records the deposits into re-tirement funds as offsetting receipts. The transfersthus wash out in the budget totals, leaving only thefund's disbursements\u2014for retirement benefits andadministrative costs\u2014refl ected in total outlays. The program providing health care benefits for military retirees will work in the same way. The pay-ment made by the Department of Defense will be off- 7. Section 257 of the Deficit Control Act stipulates that programs with current-year outlays of $50 million or more that were establishedprior to enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 should beassumed in the baseline to continue, but programs established afterthe 1997 law could be assumed in the baseline to expire. That deci-sion is based on estimates by the Office of Management and Budgetand CBO, in consultation with the House and Senate Budget Com-mittees. For example, the authorization for the Initiative for FutureAgriculture and Food Systems program, which was established in1998 and for which outlays of $72 million are projected in 2002, isassumed to expire after 2003.CHAPTER FOUR THE SPENDING OUTLOOK 85 Table 4-8.

The transfer will wash out, leaving only the fund's dis-bursements reflected as outlays. CBO projects thatthe program will collect $8 billion in receipts fromthe Department of Defense in 2003, an am ount that increases to $14 billion in 2012. The largest proprietary receipt that the govern- ment collects comprises premiums from the 38 mil-lion people enrolled in Supplementary Medical Insur-ance (Part B of Medicare), which primarily coversphysicians' and outpatient hospital services. Premi-ums in the program are set to cover one-quarter of itscosts. The monthly charge for beneficiaries is $54 in2002; it is projected to climb to $114 in 2012. Almost all enrollees in Part B of Medicare pay the monthly premium. In the case of Part A, the Hos-pital Insurance program, most beneficiaries are con-sidered to be entitled to those benefits and are not charged a premium. However, Medicare collects PartA premiums for about 400,000 enrollees who werenot employed in jobs covered by Medicare payrolltaxes long enough to qualify for free enrollment.CBO estimates that collections of premiums for bothparts of Medicare will increase from $26 billion in2002 to $62 billion in 2012; more than 95 percent ofthe increase in those collections is associated withenrollees' payments of the regular monthly Supple-mentary Medical Insurance premium. The federalgovernment, however, also pays a substantial share ofthose premiums because Medicaid pays the Part Bpremium (and, if necessary, the Part A premium) forMedicare enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid.CBO projects that collecti ons of premiums from non- federal sources will increase from $22 billion in 2002to $53 billion in 2012.86 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Other proprietary receipts come mostly from royalties and charges for oil and natural gas, electric-ity, minerals, and timber and from various fees leviedon users of government property and services. Auc-tions by the Federal Communications Commission ofrights to use parts of the electromagnetic spectrumare expected to continue through 2007, when the au-thority to conduct the auctions expires. CBO esti-mates that those auctions will bring in $500 millionin 2002, $3 billion in 2003, $11 b illion in both 2004 and 2005, and smaller amounts in subsequent years(for more details, see Box B-1 in Appendix B). Net Interest Interest costs are still a sizable portion of the federalbudget, even though they have been shrinking in thepast few years. (Net interest outlays peaked at $244billion in 1997.) In 2001, such costs totaled $206billion\u2014more than 11 percent of government outlays.Although debt held by the public is projected to in- crease in 2002 to finance the deficit, net interest pay-ments are anticipated to decline to $170 billion (seeTable 4-9). That drop is mainly attributable to therecent decline in interest rates\u2014particularly short- term rates\u2014as well as a sh ift toward issuing securi- ties with shorter maturity periods. As interest rates rise in CBO's economic fore- cast, net interest also rises, growing to $188 billion in2004 and remaining at that level in 2005. After 2005,as the decline in debt held by the public begins togain speed, net interest begins to gradually fall. Ac-cording to CBO's estimates, net interest as a share oftotal spending drops from 8 percent in 2002 to about3 percent in 2012. In general, interest costs are not covered by the enforcement provisions of the Deficit Control Actbecause they are not directly controllable. Rather,interest payments depend on the amount of outstand-ing government debt and on interest rates. The Con-gress and the President affect the former through leg- Table 4-9.

Interest rates are determined by marketforces and the Federal Reserve's policies. Net or Gross? Net interest is the most economically relevant mea-sure of the government's costs to service its debt.However, some budget watchers stress gross interest(and its counterpart, gross federal debt) rather thannet interest (and its counterpart, debt held by the pub-lic). But that choice exaggerates the government'sdebt-service burden because it overlooks billions ofdollars in interest income that the government nowreceives. Currently, about $3.3 trillion in federal securi- ties sold to the public to finance previous deficits isoutstanding. The federal government also has issuedabout $2.5 trillion in securities to its own accounts(mainly Social Security and other retirement trustfunds). Those securities represent the past surplusesof government accounts, and their total amount growsapproximately in step with the projected trust fundsurpluses (see Chapter 1). The funds redeem the se-curities as needed to pay benefits or finance pro-grams; in the meantime, the government both paysand collects interest on those securities. It also re-ceives interest income from loans and short-term cashbalances. Broadly speaking, gross interest encom-passes all interest paid by the government (even to itsown funds) and ignores all interest received. Net in-terest, by contrast, is the net flow to people and enti-ties outside the federal government. In 2001, net interest was about two-thirds as large as gross interest. CBO estimates that the gov-ernment will pay $332 billion in gross interest costs in 2002. Of that amount, however, $152 billion willbe credited to trust funds and not paid out by the gov- ernment. CBO also projects that the government willcollect about $10 billion in other interest and invest-ment income this year. Therefore, net interest costswill total $170 billion. Other Interest The $9 billion in other interest that CBO expects thegovernment to receive in 2002 is the net of paymentsand collections. On balance, however, the govern-ment takes in more such interest than it pays out.Among the expenditures are Treasury payments forinterest on tax refunds that are delayed for more than45 days after the filing date. Among the collectionsis the interest received from the financing accounts ofcredit programs (such as direct student loans). Other Investment Income Beginning in 2002, a new category in the budgetfunction for net interest will represent the earnings onthe private holdings of the newly created NationalRailroad Retirement Investment Trust (see Box 4-3).As part of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors'Improvement Act of 2001, that trust is now allowedto invest the balances of the Railroad RetirementTrust Funds in non-Treasury securities, such asstocks and corporate bonds; previously, all balancescould be invested only in nonmarketable Treasurysecurities. CBO makes no assumption about thegains or losses that the fund might incur when invest-ing in riskier securities; its projections assume thatsuch investments will earn a risk-adjusted rate of re-turn equal to the average interest rate projected forTreasury bills and notes. Such earnings total lessthan $1 billion each year through 2012.88 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Box 4-3. Budgetary Treatment of the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust When the President signed the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 (Public Law 107- 90) on December 21, 2001, the federal government re-ceived permission to acquire corporate stocks, bonds, and other assets to provide resources for an entitlementprogram (Railroad Retiremen t). Such action has no clear precedent and raises questions about how the fed-eral government might behave as an investor in privateenterprises. Proponents of the policy hope that the in- vestments will produce higher returns than the pro-gram's traditional portfolio of government bonds. Op-ponents express con cern that the government is taking on unnecessary risk and potentially involving itself incorporate governance or selective investing. The law requires that the Secretary of the Trea- sury transfer any money in the Railroad RetirementTrust Funds that is not necessary to meet the funds'immediate cash needs to the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investme nt Trust, which would manage and invest that money. The trust is not anagency or instrumentality of the federal government;however, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget agree that it should be included in the federal budget because it willbe acting as an agent of the federal government in man-aging the finances of a federal program. P.L. 107-90 specifies that \"[f]or all purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the BalancedBudget and Emergency De ficit Control Act of 1985, and chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, and not-withstanding section 20 of the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A- 11, the purchase or sale of non-Federal assets (other than gains and losses from such transactions) by the National Railroad RetirementInvestment Trust shall be tr eated as a means of financ- ing.\" That language suggests a budgetary treatmentsimilar to the one for purch ases and sales of private debt under the Credit Reform Act of 1990. Transac- tions of principal would be treated neither as outlays when securities were bought nor as offsetting receiptswhen they were sold. Income and losses on the trust'sinvestments, including interest, dividends, and changesin asset values, would be recorded as they accrued.Thus, the acquisition or sale of assets by the trustwould not be recorded as budgetary transactions, but its gains or losses would be reflected as decreases or in-creases in federal spending and thereby would affectthe surplus or deficit. How should returns on those investments be esti- mated for the purpose of base line projections over a 10- year period? One method is to project returns on thebasis of historical averages. Because the trust is ex-pected to invest in private equities, and history indi-cates that stocks have outperformed government bonds over most historical periods , that approach would prob- ably show the trust earning more by investing in privatesecurities than by investing in government bonds. Thatso-called arbitrage profit would make it appear as if thegovernment would come out ahead by borrowingmoney at the government interest rate and investing itin private markets. The more it borrowed, the more itwould gain. Such a presentation, however, would miss an im- portant aspect of the investments in private securities.Private stocks and bonds carry greater risk than govern- ment bonds. Investors are willing to take on the addi-tional risk of such investments only because the aver-age return is higher than that from government bonds. An investor choosing betw een a risky stock portfolio and low-risk bonds would almost certainly c hoose the bonds if the expected return were the same on both.Thus, in the market, the pr ice of bonds would be bid up relative to the price of stocks, until investors had nopreference between bonds a nd stocks at their new prices\u2014that is, until the additional expected yield onstocks exactly offset the costs of the investors' addi-tional risk. Therefore, on a risk-adjusted basis, securi- ties in private markets carry the same returns as govern-ment securities. Such reasoning suggests that budget projections of the returns on the trust's investments should be cal-culated using the low-risk rate of return, the govern-ment's borrowing rate. CBO has projected earningsfrom the trust's investments on that basis, and as a re- sult, the baseline projections of the surplus or deficit are unaffected by the fact that the government will is-sue more debt in order to invest Railroad Retirementfunds in private securities.Chapter Five The Uncertainty of Budget Projections The baseline projections in Chapters 1 and 2 represent the most likely of the possible out-comes for the budget and the economy, based on current trends and the assumption that policiesnow in place do not change. But considerable uncer-tainty surrounds those projections for two reasons.First, future legislation is likely to alter the paths offederal revenues and spending. The CongressionalBudget Office does not predict future legislation\u2014indeed, any attempt to inco rporate future legislative changes into its baseline would undermine the useful-ness of those numbers as a base against which tomeasure the effects of legislative action. Second, theU.S. economy and the federal budget are highly com-plex and are affected by many economic and otherchanges that are difficult to predict. As a result, ac-tual budgetary outcomes will almost certainly differfrom CBO's baseline projections, even after adjust-ing for new legislation. This chapter explores how the accuracy of the economic and technical assumptions that CBO incor-porates into its baseline can affect the accuracy of itsbudget projections. Looking back, the chapter de-scribes CBO's record of projections and shows howreliable CBO's current and future projections mightbe if they are as accurate as those of the past. Look-ing forward, it uses several scenarios to describe howthe budget might differ from CBO's baseline projec-tions. The outlook for the budget (given current legis- lation) can best be describe d not as the single row of numbers presented in CBO tables but as a fan of pos-sible outcomes around those numbers, which widensas the projection extends (see Figure 5-1). The fan inFigure 5-1. Uncertainty in CBO's Projections of the TotalBudget Surplus Under Current Policies SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTES: This figure shows the estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the surplus under current policies. Thecalculations are based on CBO's past track record. TheCBO projections described in C hapter 1 fall in the mid- dle of the darkest area. Under the assumption that poli-cies do not change, the probability is 10 percent thatactual surpluses will fall in the darkest area and90 percent that they will fall within the whole shadedarea. Actual surpluses will of course be affected by legislation enacted during the next 10 years, including decisionsabout discretionary spending. The effects of future leg-islation are not included in this figure. An explanation of how this probability distribution was calculated will appear shortly on CBO's Web site(www.cbo.gov).90 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 the figure is based on CBO's record of accuracy in its budget projections. The baseline budget projectionspresented in Chapter 1 fall in the middle of the high-est probabilities\u2014shown in the darkest part of thefigure. But nearby projections\u2014other paths in thedarkest part of the figure\u2014have nearly the sameprobability of occurring as do the baseline projec-tions. Moreover, projections that are quite differentfrom the baseline also have a significant probabilityof coming to pass. Based on the historical record, the budget surplus or deficit is likely to fall within the fan around CBO's projections about 90 percent of the time, in the absence of new legislation. Figure 5-1 is intentionally fuzzy because the uncertainties are themselves estimates; as such, theymay misstate the true uncertainty of current forecasts.The record on which the fan chart is based is short,and it may not be representative of future uncertain-ties. Historically, CBO's forecasts have been leastaccurate around cyclical turning points (times whenthe economy moves from expansion to recession, orvice versa), which economists are generally unable topredict reliably. However, from 1981 (the earliestyear for which complete data are available that aresuitable for this analysis) until 2001, the economyexperienced just two rece ssions and two long expan- sions. The first recession (that of 1981-1982) oc-curred at the start of the period, so the record in-cludes only one short-term forecast from before therecession and no longer-term forecasts that refer tothat recessionary period. Thus, CBO has very littleinformation on the accuracy of its forecasts aroundrecessions. In addition to uncertainty about cyclical turning points, the economic and budget trends that underlie the 10-year outlook are unusually hard to discern atpresent. Many commentat ors, including CBO, be- lieve that major structural changes have created a\"new economy\" centered on information technology.But CBO's projections, like those of other forecast-ers, are based on very limited information about in-creased growth of productivity and strong investmentin information technology over just a few years, fromthe mid-1990s through 2000. Moreover, in the pastyear, many companies central to the new economyhave suffered setbacks, reflected in the prices of theirstocks, and it has become clear that the investmentboom included some investments that proved unprof-itable. So even though CBO's 10-year projections continue to assume that the gains in the trend rate ofproductivity growth seen in the late 1990s (adjustedfor the effects of the business cycle) were real andwill persist\u2014though temporarily obscured by the cur-rent recession\u2014that projection has become more un-certain. Another way to show the uncertainty of projec- tions is to calculate the effects of specific sets of al-ternative assumptions on the economic and budgetoutlook. To illustrate the possible implications ofalternative cyclical and trend assumptions, CBO haschosen four scenarios. The two cyclical scenariosexplore the possibilities of a substantially faster re-covery from or a deepening of the current recessionthan the baseline projections assume. The two trendscenarios concentrate on differing assumptions aboutthe trends that might be experienced over a 10-yearperiod. One of those scenarios assumes that thefavorable economic trends seen from 1996 through2000 will continue for the next decade, once thenation emerges from recession; the other assumesthat the underlying trends the economy will followafter the recession is over will be less favorable, likethose of 1974 through 1995. The projections thatresult from those four scenarios suggest a very widerange of possible outcomes for the budget. Policymakers will have to decide what that de- gree of uncertainty means for a budget process thatcurrently relies on 10-year projections. Looking for-ward five or 10 years allows the Congress to considerthe longer-term budgetary implications of specificpolicy changes. But it also increases the likelihoodthat budgetary decisions will be made on the basis ofprojections that later turn out to have been far wrong. The Accuracy of CBO's Past Budget Projections Because baseline budget projections are destined to deviate from actual outcomes, assessing their histori-cal accuracy is not a simple matter. Baseline projec-tions are meant to serve as a neutral reference pointfor evaluating policy changes, so they make no as-sumptions about future legislation that might alterCHAPTER FIVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BUDGET PROJECTIONS 91 Box 5-1. Innovations in This Analysis The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) introduced the fan chart presentation of the uncertainty of projec- tions in its January 2001 repor t. This report takes that presentation a step farther, distinguishing inaccuraciesthat are correlated with the business cycle from inac-curacies in the assessment of trends that are unrelated to the business cycle. That is a useful distinction, be- cause inaccuracies in the assessment of trends arelikely to grow indefinitely as the projection horizonextends, but inaccuracies correlated with the businesscycle would not be expected to grow forever. Accord- ing to CBO's estimates, in fact, cyclical inaccuraciesare small in the first two years of a projection\u2014that is,the current year and the budget year\u2014when CBO at-tempts to reflect its view of the business cycle in itsforecast. They plateau at a constant level for the lastthree years of the projection, when CBO does not at-tempt to forecast the business cycle. The remaininginaccuracies grow almost linearly with the forecast horizon. According to that decomposition, discrepan-cies between CBO's budget projections five years out and budgetary outcomes have consisted in roughlyequal parts of discrepanc ies due to business cycles (which CBO does not attempt to project so far in ad-vance) and inaccuracies in assessing the economic andother trends that underlie the budget. That new analysis has widened the five-year fan of uncertainty in budget projections, compared withthe one CBO published in January 2001. It is de-scribed in detail in a document that will be availableshortly on CBO's Web site (www. cbo.gov).For the purpose of this chapter, discretionary spending is handled somewhat differently than inCBO's usual analyses of revisions to budget projec- tions (but in the same way as last year's chapter). Inthe analysis of revisions, CBO allocates part of any discrepancies between the assumptions for discretion- ary spending in the baseline and the amounts finallyenacted and spent to the category of economic or tech-nical differences. (For mo re details about those cate- gories, see Chapter 1.) Bu t discretionary spending, which is appropriated annua lly, is not controlled by the kind of permanent laws and automatic rules thatdetermine entitlement spending and taxes (in the ab-sence of new legislation). Indeed, when the Congresssets discretionary spending , it does so through new legislation. As a result, legislation accounts for thelion's share of the differences between baseline pro-jections and actual outlays for such programs. Be-cause attributing all discrepancies in discretionaryspending to legislation perm its the use of a larger his- torical record in this analysis, CBO has excluded thesmall variations for other reasons from the uncertain-ties discussed in this chapter. This analysis (like last year's) also omits any distinction between economic and technical differ-ences. That distinction can be arbitrary and subject tochange as the underlying economic data are revised.In any case, the distinction is unnecessary for thisanalysis. current budget policies. Of course, new legislation is likely to affect spending and revenues, but the pur-pose of baseline estimates is not to forecast legisla-tion. Consequently, this chapter concentrates on in-accuracies in forecasting that stem from economicand technical factors, not from the effects of new leg- islation. To assess the accuracy of its past annual projec- tions, CBO compared those projections with actual budgetary outcomes and attempted to determine thesources of any differences (after adjusting for theestimated effects of policy changes). (See Box 5-1.)The comparisons included 20 sets of projections forthe ongoing fiscal year (the one in which the projec-tions were made), 19 sets for the following fiscal year (referred to as the budget year), and 15 sets of projec-tions that extend five years into the future. 1 (CBO has also examined in greater detail its record of eco-nomic forecasts. See Congressional Budget Office, 1. The projections are those made in July 1981 and CBO's winter projections (usually published in January) from 1983 through 2001.Insufficient data were available to use either projections made be-fore 1981 or the projection made in early 1982. For projectionsmade before 1996, a full five years of projections could be used.For projections made since that date, progressively shorter projec-tion spans could be used because the most recent actual data againstwhich they could be compared for accuracy is for fiscal year 2001.To calculate the role of policy changes, CBO used estimates of thebudgetary effects of legislative changes that were made close to thetime the legislation was enacted. 92 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 CBO's Economic Forecasting Record , available at www.cbo.gov.) On average, the absolute difference (without regard to whether the difference was positive or negative)between CBO's estimate of the federal deficit or sur-plus and the actual result was 0.5 percent of grossdomestic product for the ongoing fiscal year, 1.1 per-cent for the budget year, and 3.2 percent for thefourth year beyond the budget year, adjusted for theeffects of subsequent legislation (see Table 5-1). If those averages were applied to CBO's current base-line, the actual surplus or deficit could be expected todiffer in one direction or the other from CBO's pro- jections by about $50 billion in 2002, $130 billion in2003, and over $350 billion in 2007. Misestimates of revenues have generally been larger than misestimates of outlays, reflecting thegreater sensitivity of revenues to economic develop- Table 5-1.

NOTES: This comparison covers the baseline budget projections that CBO published in July 1981 in Baseline Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 1982-1986 and the ones it published each winter between 1983 and 1999 in The Economic and Budget Outlook . The current year is the fiscal year in which the projections are made; the budget year is the following fiscal year.Differences are actual values minus project ed values. Unlike the average difference, the average absolute difference ignores arithmetic signs and thus indicates t he average distance between actual and projected values without regard to whether individu al projections are overestimates or underestimates. a. A positive average difference for the surplus or deficit means that, on average, CBO underestimated the surplus or overestima ted the deficit.CHAPTER FIVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BUDGET PROJECTIONS 93 ments. In absolute terms, revenue projections have differed from actual outcomes by an average of about1.8 percent of revenues for the current year, 3.9 per-cent for the budget year, and 11.9 percent for thefourth year beyond the budget year. Inaccuracies inoutlay projections were similar to those in revenueprojections for the current year but only half as largeas revenue inaccuracies for the budget year and sub- sequent years. The misestimates of the budget's bottom line went in both directions: sometimes the projectionswere too high and at other times too low. On aver- age, CBO's forecast of the deficit or surplus hastended to be slightly pessimistic\u2014that is, CBO over-estimated deficits\u2014for the current year and the bud-get year, and slightly optimistic for the fourth andfifth years of the projection. (That pattern may re-flect the fact that deficit projections made before1991 were optimistic and those made in more recentyears were pessimistic; data on the later years areincomplete for projections made after 1996.) How-ever, the average underestimates and overestimates ofthe budget balance at different horizons were not sta-tistically significant and thus were not incorporatedinto Figure 5-1. Sources of Past Inaccuracies in Projecting Revenues Misestimates of revenues can rarely be traced to a single cause, but a few major factors can be identi-fied. Both recessions and rapid expansions can be a problem for revenue projections\u2014as noted earlier,predicting turning points in the business cycle is oneof the most difficult challenges facing economic fore-casters. Thus, revenues tend to be overestimated inforecasts done just before recessions and underesti- mated in forecasts made before rapid expansions.Until the current recession, the major source of inac-curacies in revenue projections made during the eco-nomic expansion of 1995 through 2000 was the fail-ure to predict both the apparent acceleration in thetrend growth of the economy and the economicchanges associated with it, especially the boom in the stock market and the increasing concentration of in-come growth among taxpayers in the highest taxbrackets. The stock market boom led to huge capitalgains on paper, which boosted tax revenues as inves-tors began to realize those gains. It also raised the income of households in higher tax brackets throughstock options (which when exercised count as ordi- nary income and not capital gains). The causes of the projected shortfall in revenues in 2001 (after adjusting for legislation) will not beknown until data from tax returns are tabulated overthe next couple of years. It is likely, however, thatsome combination of the f actors that pushed receipts above expectations in the prior half-decade contrib-uted to the recent shortfall as well. Sources of Past Inaccuracies in Projecting Nondiscretionary Outlays Economic performance affects federal spending, both directly and indirectly. CBO often overestimated in-flation in the forecasts it made in the early 1980s, andmore recently it anticipated an upturn in inflationduring the late 1990s that did not occur. Estimates ofinflation that are too high result in overestimates ofcost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries of manycash benefit programs and overestimates of reim-bursements for health care providers. CBO alsooverestimated unemployment rates in the 1990s,which meant a corresponding overstatement of case-loads for means-tested benefit programs (such asFood Stamps and Medicaid) and of the number ofapplicants for unemployment and disability benefits. Misestimates of those broad economic trends, however, account for only part of the inaccuracies inpast projections of nondiscretionary outlays. Theremainder come from inaccurate assumptions aboutsuch factors as what propor tion of eligible individu- als and families will participate in benefit programs,how sound financial institutions will be, and howhealth care providers will behave. Those factors canbe extremely difficult to predict. For example, thedeposit insurance crisis of the 1980s came as a sur-prise, and the year-by-year costs for its cleanup werehighly variable and hard to estimate. CBO also didnot anticipate the states' expanded use of creativefinancing mechanisms to obtain federal Medicaidfunds, which occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, or the temporary slowing of the growth ofMedicare costs in the late 1990s.94 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Alternative Economic and Budget Scenarios The differences between CBO's past projections and actual budgetary outcomes could suggest how accu-rate future projections will be\u2014if future inaccuraciesmirror those of the past. But whether that will hap-pen is an open question. Another way of looking at the uncertainty of projections is to consider how dif-ferent assumptions could affect the projections. Suchalternative scenarios give a qualitative understanding of how projections might miss the mark, though it isgenerally not possible to assess the probability ofsuch alternatives. CBO's past performan ce probably should not be used to gauge how accurate short-term budget projec-tions will be in periods around recessions. Only tworecessions have occurred since CBO started to makefive-year projections, so the record is simply inade-quate for extrapolation. Even a larger record mightbe misleading because recessions do not tend to fol-low a closely similar script\u2014each one is different. Box 5-2. Risks from Terrorism The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11 have brought ma ny changes, but at least up to now there is little evidence of any large and per-sistent effect on the economy. (Actions that the fed-eral government might take to counter terrorism could have budget implications of their own. Those are dis- cussed in Chapter 7.) Shocking as the losses of lifeand property were, they did not have much impact onthe nation's $10 trillion economy. The new awarenessof vulnerability to attacks could, in principle, change the economy in a number of ways: by diverting bothpublic and private resources to security and away frommore conventionally productive uses; by discouragingcommitment to large and risky investments; or byleading people to save more in order to insure againsthard times in the future. Possible future actions by theUnited States could also have economic impacts: forexample, a widening of the war against terrorismcould have serious, though probably temporary, ef- fects on oil markets. The economic projections inChapter 2 reflect an estimate of the possible diversionof resources to security spending, which will tend toincrease business costs a nd thus reduce productivity. However, although those estimates are necessarilyhighly uncertain, they suggest that the overall eco-nomic impact is likely to be small. The impact of terrorism risks on spending by businesses for new buildings and equipment is evenharder to quantify and may be negligible. For thatreason, the ec onomic projections in Chapter 2 do not attempt to estimate that impact. However, it remains arisk to the forecast because insurance against lossesfrom terrorism may be very expensive or even unavail-able. The possibility of future terrorist attacks poses a difficult problem for the insurance industry, becausethose risks are impossible to quantify and thus to price correctly. If insurance companies and their reinsurerswere to decide that they did not wish to take up someproportion of those risks, owners of existing busi-nesses would probably self-insure to a large extentrather than go out of business. As a consequence,some companies' bond ratings could drop and stockprices could fall, reflecting the increased risk thatstockholders would assume . For new investment, businesses would have to take into account the in-creased risk from terrorism in deciding whether tospend. Certain projects, pa rticularly large, iconic buildings that might be attractive targets for terrorism,might not be built. In addition, some businesses re-quire insurance either as part of the terms of loanagreements (mortgages) or because of regulations. Ifinsurance became unavailable, those agreements andregulations would have to be changed to avoid busi-ness interruptions. The impact on investment is likely to be some- what smaller if insurance for terrorism risks remains available but its cost rises. Self-insuring is likely, inmany cases, to be more costly than purchasing insur-ance because the insurance market pools risk morewidely than self-insurers can. Moreover, the insur-ance market allows risk to be borne by those who canmost easily bear it. There is a distinct advantage tokeeping the insurance market for terrorism risks oper-ating, which is why many governments have re-sponded to those risks with devices\u2014such asgovernment-sponsored insurance pools and limitedCHAPTER FIVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BUDGET PROJECTIONS 95 In addition, making longer-term projections for the period after the current recession is over requiresassessing trends in the economy that can be very dif-ficult to determine. Will the performance of the next 10 years be like the extraordinary expansion of thelate 1990s, or will it revert to the relatively lacklusterperformance of the 1974-1995 period? Might theattacks of September 11, and the increased awarenessof terrorist threats that has followed them, weakenthe economy? (For more on that question, see Box5-2.) The accuracy of assumptions about those fac-tors\u2014together with assumptions about how revenuesrelate to gross domestic product and how much socialspending (especially on medical programs) will grow \u2014will determine the accuracy of the 10-year budgetprojections. To examine the implications of those questions, CBO has constructed additional scenarios that makealternative economic and budgetary assumptions\u2014two that describe a faster recovery from the currentrecession or a deepening of the recession, and twothat describe alternative views about the longer-termtrends that could affect the budget. The cyclical andtrend scenarios could in principle be combined. Forexample, a deeper recession could be combined with Box 5-2. Continued government reinsurance\u2014that maintain a large role for the private insurance market.1 As of January 2002, there is no evidence that withdrawal of coverage forterrorism risks is having a major effect on economicactivity. The fear of future terrorist attacks and business disruptions could also a ffect private consumption. Many economists thought th at the September 11 at- tacks would sharply diminish consumer confidenceand thus spending on consum ption. In fact, spending has held up surprisingly well since the attacks (seeChapter 2). If the war against terrorism was to widen, its effects could include a rise in the price of oil. So far,the oil market has been affected much more by theweakness of the world economy than by war risks, andthe price for the West Texas Intermediate contract (astandard price for oil) has fallen from about $28 perbarrel in December 2000 to roughly $20 per barrel atthe end of December 20 01. The Congressional Bud- get Office's (CBO's) projections assume that the cur-rent price weakness will be temporary and that theprice of a barrel of oil will return to around $25 as theworld economy improves. However, violence in thePersian Gulf region could disrupt the flow of oilenough to create a temporary price spike, such as oc-curred in 1990, when the price of oil rose briefly to$40 a barrel. Such a price spike would have only a 1. See Congressional Budget Office, Federal Reinsurance for Terrorism Risks (October 2001).small, temporary effect on the U.S. economy. More persistent price increases could occur if there wereincreased violence and unrest in the Gulf region thataffected oil production. A persistent increase in the price of oil from $25 to, say, $35 per barrel would raise costs to U.S. con- sumers and businesses and would in some ways act asa tax. Initially, the most significant effects on the U.S.economy would result from the diversion of consum-ers' expenditures toward energy purchases and awayfrom other things, and from a short-run increase ininflation. Assuming that the Federal Reserve allowed interest rates to rise to head off any permanent in-crease in inflation, growth of gross domestic productmight be lowered by 1 percentage point in the firstyear. In subsequent years, if oil prices continued at the higher level, on average, businesses would proba-bly alter their investment plans, retiring some equip- ment and purchasing new, more energy-efficientequipment. Both the higher depreciation and the in-creased importance of ener gy efficiency, rather than overall productivity, in business decisions about in-vestment might slow the growth of the economy\u2014indeed, some analysts attribute a significant part of theslowdown in productivity growth after 1974 to the oilprice increases of 1974 and 1980. According to CBO's simulations, such an increase in oil pricescould worsen the budget outlook by upward of $40billion per year for a few years as long as discretion-ary spending followed the ordinary rules of budgetprojections. In addition, high er oil prices would raise the cost of energy purchases by the federal govern-ment and could put upward pressure on discretionary spending.96 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 a less optimistic trend for the economy, in which case the budget would worsen by about as much as thesum of the effects in each of the scenarios. Whereasthe fan chart describes how unexpected events in thepast have affected the accu racy of CBO's budget pro- jections, the scenarios suggest how specific futureevents could affect budgetary outcomes. How likely is it that the actual 10-year outcomes for the budget will lie between the optimistic andpessimistic scenarios or that the budget in the nextyear will be within the bounds of the faster-recoveryand deeper-recession scenarios? No exact probabilitycalculation is possible, because those scenarios aremeant to illustrate the po ssibilities of events that might not be fully captured by the statistical analysispresented at the beginning of the chapter. The firstfive years of all of the scenarios lie within the bounds of the fan chart based on CBO's historical record. Recovery from Recession The current recession differs in important respects from previous recessions (as Chapter 2 discusses),and those differences make forecasting how the re-covery will develop particularly difficult. Real possi-bilities exist of either a quicker recovery than CBOcurrently envisages or a more prolonged recession.Economic news coming in during the first weeks of2002 seemed to point to a more rapid rebound, partic-ularly in consumption, than CBO's baseline projec-tions assume, but that could easily be reversed if con-sumers decide to cut back on their consumption topay off debts or because they are unsure of their em-ployment prospects. Three large sources of uncer-tainty are investment, the weakness of the worldeconomy, and the inventory cycle. In addition, largeror smaller realizations of capital gains, which arehard to predict but probably have a cyclical compo-nent, could also aff ect budgetary outcomes. CBO's baseline projections assume that the in- vestment overhang described in Chapter 2 is beingworked off and that investment will begin to pick upin the second half of 2002 as the economy recovers.That assumption could be wrong, however; there isno independent way to verify either the size of theoverinvestment or the degree to which investmentmust fall to bring business equipment in line withneeds. In CBO's forecast, investment begins to grow by the end of 2002 at about the pace of the late1990s. That pickup could be earlier or later, and thegrowth rate could be either more sluggish (if busi-nesses' confidence about future demand and profitsremains poor) or faster (if the need to build inven- tories boosts demand and profits more quickly thananticipated). Developments in other countries play an impor- tant role in the outlook for the United States, and thecurrent outlook for the rest of the world is morelikely to be weaker than stronger relative to whatCBO's projections assume. As of early January2002, forecasts for growth in Europe were being low-ered, the outlook for Japan was becoming evenbleaker, tensions between I ndia and Pakistan were on the rise, and Argentina's currency crisis had broughtdown the government (and several successors). Sofar, there is little evidence that Argentina's problemsare spilling over to other countries (as did currencyproblems in a few Asian countries in 1998). But theworld economy is clearly no stronger than CBO'sforecast assumes. In fact, it may be weakening fur-ther, which could reduce demand for U.S. goods andservices and prolong the recession. A few forecasters worry that if the recession deepened, the usual tools of monetary policy mightreach their limit because interest rates are alreadyvery low, so policy cannot push them down muchfarther (see Box 5-3). That possibility seems remote;there is still room to lower rates by 1.75 percentagepoints, and if the recession worsened dramaticallyenough to require such a drop in interest rates, theCongress would also have the option to add fiscalstimulus. More fundamentally, the U.S. financialsystem is sound, and it is resistant to the difficultiesthat cramped the effectiveness of U.S. monetary pol-icy in the 1930s and that of Japan today. In contrast, some forecasters see the possibility of a substantially sharper recovery because invento-ries were run down much more rapidly than expectedin 2001, setting the stage for a possible inventory re-building in 2002. Production could ratchet up morethan the CBO forecast assumes if firms try to rebuildinventories aggressively. In this recession, as in pastones, the swing in production is likely to exceed theswing in final sales considerably. However, econo-CHAPTER FIVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BUDGET PROJECTIONS 97 mists have had little success in predicting firms' in- ventory decisions, and a much more rapid rebuildingof inventory cannot be ruled out. Although those factors ca nnot be quantified pre- cisely, CBO has calculated illustrative budgetary im-pacts of a faster recovery or a continued and deeperrecession (see Table 5-2). Those scenarios are cho- sen to reflect, on the optimistic side, a rapid bounceback from recession such as occurred on two previ-ous occasions and, on the pessimistic side, a contin-ued recession that becomes as large as the averagepostwar recession (that is, considerably deeper thanthe mild one in CBO's baseline forecast) before re- Box 5-3. Could Monetary Policy Lose Its Clout? The economy remains weak even though the Federal Reserve has pushed the short- term interest rate on fed- eral funds down to 1.75 percent and the real short-term rate on Treasury bills to 0.1 percent. The reces-sion has been accompanied by a yearlong deflation incommodity prices and weak prices for goods in gen-eral, although the deflation has not spread to the largerservice sector of the economy. Despite general weak-ness, long-term interest ra tes have not followed short- term rates down. In those circumstances, some com-mentators are concerned that monetary policy mightnot be able to do much more to stimulate the economy.A few analysts go farther and point to the Great De-pression of the 1930s, when short-term rates wereeven closer to zero but failed to help the economy re-cover. They also point to current conditions in Japan, where the interest rates that the government uses to setmonetary policy are virtually zero, deflation has pre-vailed since 1999, and the economy remains mired ina long and painful recession. For monetary policy to stimulate economic activ- ity, the channels through which it affects demand mustbe operating. The most important channels operatethrough banks and other fi nancial intermediaries. Typically, the Federal Rese rve purchases short-term securities from banks and other dealers, loweringshort-term rates and increas ing the funds that interme- diaries can lend. If banks a nd other intermediaries are healthy (as is not the case in Japan), they will competeto make loans, causing longer-term rates to declineand encouraging businesses and households to borrow to finance spending. The decline in interest rates mayalso stimulate the stock and real estate markets, pro-viding additional monetary-policy channels, either ascorporations issue more stock or bonds to financetheir investments in plant and equipment or as house-holds increase spending in response to their capital gains. Declines in interest rates might also cause thedollar to depreciate, stimulating exports and shifting some import spending toward domestic alternatives. Although the monetary-policy channels are gen- erally working as usual in this economic downturn,analysts have observed a few worrisome weak spots.Banks have continued to lend in modestly growingamounts for real estate and consumer loans, but in-creased loan defaults have caused lending terms andconditions to tighten, and loans to businesses have declined. Businesses with good credit ratings havebeen able to borrow in growing amounts in the corpo-rate bond market, though at long-term rates that arerelatively high compared with short-term rates. More-over, companies with poor credit ratings face an ex- tremely scarce supply of credit at high rates, reflecting the perceived probability of default. The exchange- rate channel also has b een blocked by slowdowns abroad and strong foreign preferences for U.S. invest-ments that have caused the dollar's value to appreciateand held back U.S. exports. At some point, further economic deterioration could clog the monetary-policy channels, although thateventuality does not seem likely. Should more compa-nies lose money, cut payrolls , or slip into insolvency, lenders would be faced with further losses on loans to businesses and households. Losses from loan defaults and stock market declines that went beyond whatbanks and other intermedia ries can absorb could choke off lending, as happened to banks in 1991 and1992 and slowed the economy's recovery from reces-sion. If deflation sets in as a result of a greater col-lapse in overall demand, firms may be reluctant to bor-row, even at interest rates that are close to zero, if they see no prospect for profitabl e investments. Similarly, households may defer plans to purchase homes anddurable goods. However, such monetary difficultieswould not be likely to o ccur unless the recession be- came a great deal more severe than is now anticipated.98 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 5-2.

NOTE: See the text for a description of the faster-recovery and deeper-recession scenarios. covery begins in 2003. Those scenarios define a range that is much wider than the range in January2002 between the 10 most optimistic of the Blue Chip forecasters and the 10 most pessimistic of those fore-casters. 2 However, the amounts by which those sce- narios differ from the baseline forecast are similar tothe revision that has occurred since January 2001 inCBO's forecast for 2002. In the faster-recovery scenario, both GDP and the most important components of taxable incomestart to grow rapidly from the beginning of 2002, andthey continue to grow at a high rate in 2003. Recov- eries have occurred that quickly on two occasions: in1968, following the slowdown of 1967 (which didnot even qualify as an of ficial recession), and in 1972, from the recession of 1970. By 2004, thegrowth rates slip below those of the baseline, becausethese scenarios reflect only alternative outlooks forthe business cycle and do not envisage permanentlyhigher or lower growth. (T he possibility of different persistent trends in the economy is discussed in thenext section.) With such a strong recovery, interestrates would be likely to rise quickly to their long-term level. The total budget surplus would returnrapidly under that scenario, reaching nearly $100 bil-lion in fiscal year 2003 and $200 billion in fiscal year2006. The deeper-recession scenario assumes that the current recession does not end in the first quarter of2002 (as the baseline assumes) but rather developsinto a recession of average duration and depth basedon recessions from 1949 through 1990. Followingthe deeper recession is a more rapid recovery; as inthe previous scenario, this one does not envisage thatthe deeper downturn implies a slower trend rate ofgrowth. With a weaker economy, interest rates arelower, but not dramatically so; this scenario assumesthat the Federal Reserve, as well as Congressionalforecasters, are surprised by the extent of the reces-sion and cannot fully counteract it. Under this sce-nario, the budget would deteri orate rapidly, subtract- ing about $130 bi llion from the budget balance in fiscal year 2003. The budget would remain in deficit for an additional year but would return to surplus in fiscal year 2005. In addition to different economics, these scenar- ios assume that a faster recovery or a deeper reces-sion would most likely mean a weaker or strongerstock market. For that and other reasons, taxpayersmight alter their decisions about realizing capitalgains. CBO does not forecast stock prices, but itdoes project capital gains realizations (see Table 3-6in Chapter 3). About $10 billion of the better budget-ary outcome under a stronger recovery and of theweaker budgetary outcome under a slower recoveryis assumed to result from changes in capital gains receipts. 2. See Aspen Publishers, Inc., Blue Chip Economic Indicators (Janu- ary 10, 2002).CHAPTER FIVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BUDGET PROJECTIONS 99 Longer-Term Economic and Budget Trends CBO has also constructed two alternative scenarios about future longer-term trends. They are intended toreflect assumptions that\u2014although systematicallydifferent from the ones underlying the baseline pro-jections\u2014still seem reasonable to CBO analysts.They alter not only economic assumptions but alsosome assumptions that are usually labeled technical,such as assumptions about the level of capital gainsrealizations and the growth of spending for the majorfederal health care programs. (The scenarios illus-trate possible alternative paths and are not intendedto be symmetrical.) The two trend scenarios illustrate a wide range of possible outcomes for the budget. Over the 11years from 2002 through 2012, the optimistic trendscenario implies $3.7 trillion more in total surpluses than CBO's baseline projections do. The pessimistictrend scenario implies cumu lative deficits that in- crease the government debt held by the public bymore than $4 trillion by 2012 compared with CBO's baseline projections. The Optimistic Trend Scenario . In this scenario, the favorable trends for the budget that existed be-tween 1996 and 2000 continue more or less unabatedafter the economy recovers from recession. The av-erage growth of labor productivity from 2001 to 2012is 2.6 percent, matching its growth from 1996 to2000, rather than the 2.1 percent growth assumed inthe baseline. As a result, real GDP grows at a rate0.3 percentage points higher than in the baseline (seeTable 5-3). In addition, the scenario assumes that therecent dip in the effective tax rate is temporary: indi-vidual income tax liabilities as a share of taxable per-sonal income rise rapidly over the next five years, towhere they would have been had their growth in thelate 1990s continued. Those tax liabilities thereforereach 17.5 percent of taxable personal income by 2012\u20142 percentage points higher than in the base-line\u2014with a small amount of that increase resultingfrom the higher real growth and productivity assumedin this scenario.

In this scenario, the projected level of debt held by the public falls below CBO's estimate of debt available for redemption in 2009. Beyond that point, the federal government would accumulate \"uncommitted funds\"\u2014CBO's term for the surplus that remains each year after paying down all publicly held debt available for redemption. optimistic scenario assumes that spending for Medi- care and Medicaid will grow at an annual rate that isnearly 2 percentage points lower than the rate in thebaseline. The budget outlook would improve dramatically under the assumptions of the optimistic trend sce-nario (see Table 5-4). By 2012, if there was no other action to cut taxes or increase spending, the annualsurplus would exceed $1.3 trillion (more than twicethe surplus projected under the baseline assump-tions). With surpluses of that magnitude, the govern-ment's holdings of assets (uncommitted funds) wouldexceed federal debt held by the public to the tune of$2.4 trillion in 2012. 3 The Pessimistic Trend Scenario . This scenario reverses most of the assumptions of the optimisticscenario and assumes that the economy reverts inmany respects to its situation before 1996. In this scenario, trends in the economy are generally unfa-vorable to the budget. The pessimistic trend scenarioassumes that the recent burst of productivity willprove temporary, so future productivity growth aver-ages the 1.4 percent rate seen from 1974 through1995 (cyclically adjusted), implying correspondinglylower GDP growth. In addition, the scenario assumesthat individual income ta x liabilities decline relative to taxable personal income to levels recorded before the increases that occurred in the second half of the1990s (except that real bracket creep\u2014inflation-ad-justed growth in income that pushes people intohigher tax brackets\u2014is assumed to continue). Medi-care and Medicaid spending is assumed to grownearly 2 percentage points faster each year than in thebaseline. Under that scenario, the budget would remain in overall deficit for each of the 10 years of the projec-tion period. Debt held by the public would rise toalmost $5.5 trillion in 2012, compared with less than$1.3 trillion under baseline assumptions. 3. \"Uncommitted funds\" is CBO's term for the surplus that remains each year after paying down all publicly held debt available forredemption.Social SecurityMedicareMedicaid Social SecurityMedicareMedicaidPercentage of GDP 2000 2010 2020 20301416 12 10 8 6 4 2 0Chapter Six The Long-Term Budget Outlook In October 2000, the Congressional Budget Office wrote about the long-term challenges to the bud-get and the economy posed by the aging of the baby-boom generation, increasing life spans, and ris-ing costs in federal health programs. 1 At that time, the near-term budgetary outlook seemed very bright\u2014CBO projected that surpluses over the coming de-cade would enable the government to eliminate itsnet indebtedness within that time span. Even in thathighly optimistic environment, however, CBO pro-jected that pressures on spending would eventuallybring about a return of budget deficits and rising gov-ernment debt. Now, 15 months later, although debt held by the public is still projected to fall over the next 10 years,the near-term budgetary situation is less favorable.Furthermore, the onset of pressure for increasedhealth and retirement spending has only drawn neareras the baby-boom generation has moved one yearcloser to the time at which large numbers of themwill qualify for Social Security and Medicare bene-fits. This chapter describes the likely magnitude of pressures on spending over the next 30 years and thepossible budgetary and economic consequences. Itemphasizes measures such as total health and retire-ment spending and economic output, rather than thestatus of the Social S ecurity and Medicare trust funds. Trust fund measures, although useful forsome purposes, can be misleading. They can bechanged by accounting transactions that appear toimprove solvency but do not alter the government's underlying obligations or resources to pay those obli-gations. Moreover, they only partially reflect trendsin the overall economy that are paramount in deter-mining the government's ability to pay benefits overthe longer term. The long-term path of the federal budget will ultimately depend on the health of the economy and Figure 6-1.

How CBO Makes Its Long-Term Projections The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) long- term projections are based on a model of the economy,the Social Security programs, and the budget. 1 The projections are not predicti ons of what CBO thinks is likely to happen; fiscal policies, for example, willprobably change as pressure for spending on healthand retirement programs increases. Through 2010, the long-term projections flow from CBO's current 10-year baseline projections ofthe budget and the economy. In most of the projec-tions, the first eight years exactly match the baselineprojections. (In some of the projections, however, theuse of optimistic or pessimi stic population or produc- tivity assumptions causes them to differ from the base-line over that period.) The long-term projections fol-low only the first eight years of the 10-year baselineprojections because of the uncertainty surrounding thescheduled expiration of the tax-cut provisions in theEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Actof 2001. 1. CBO's Long-Term Actuarial Model (LTAM) is a macroeco- nomic growth model with a detailed Social Security sector.That sector has been constructed to mimic the results and sensi-tivities of the projections of the Social Security Administra-tion's Office of the Chief Actuary. See Congressional BudgetOffice, An Economic Model for Long-Run Budget Simulations , CBO Memorandum (July 1997), for a detailed description ofthe model on which the macroeconomic component of LTAMis based, and Uncertainty in Social Security's Long-Term Fi- nances: A Stochastic Analysis (December 2001), Chapter One, for a description of the Social Security sector of the LTAM.Budgetary Assumptions In CBO's long-term projections, most categories of spending and revenues other than health and retire-ment programs are extended after 2010 using simplerules rather than current law. Revenues and discre- tionary spending are adjusted in 2011 to produce asurplus in the total budget (including the Social Secu-rity trust funds) of 2 percent of gross domestic product(GDP). From 2011 on, reve nues other than payroll taxes are assumed to remain fixed as a share of the taxbase. CBO does not incorporate the impact of realbracket creep\u2014inflation-adjusted growth in incomethat subjects more income to higher tax rates\u2014in itsprojection of revenues. Similarly, discretionary spending remains a fixed share of GDP after 2011.CBO's projections assume that spending on govern-ment transfer programs other than Social Security,Medicare, and Medicaid grows with the size and agemix of the population and with GDP per capita. CBO projects spending and revenues for Social Security and Medicare under current law after 2010.The long-term projections of outlays for Social Secu-rity are based on forecasts by the trustees of the SocialSecurity trust funds, ad justed for CBO's economic assumptions; projections of Medicare and Medicaid outlays are based on projected health care costs perenrollee and the number and ages of enrollees. 2 2. The long-term projections also follow those of the Social Secu- rity trustees in assuming that Social Security benefits will con-tinue to be paid even after the trust fund is exhausted. on future policy decisions, which are impossible to predict. It is fairly certain, however, that health andretirement spending under current law will increasesubstantially over the coming decades. If current pol-icies continued, spending on Social Security, Medi-care, and Medicaid under CBO's midrange estimatewould rise to 14.7 percent of gross domestic productby 2030, almost twice its current share of 7.8 percent(see Figure 6-1 on the previous page). The healthprograms would account for about two-thirds of thatincrease. Projected spendi ng on those three programs would be substantial under a variety of alternativeassumptions\u2014for variables such as the rate of growthof productivity, the cost of health care, and the age composition and size of the population\u2014rangingfrom about 13 percent to 17 percent of GDP in 2030.(See Box 6-1 for a discussion of CBO's midrangeand other assumptions.) The pressure to boost spending on health and retirement programs will present the nation with dif-ficult choices. Some combination of reduced spend-ing on other priorities, increased revenues, and di-minished outlays for health and retirement programs(below levels projected under current law) will prob-ably be needed to balance the government's finances.CHAPTER SIX THE LONG-TERM BUDGET OUTLOOK 103 Box 6-1. Continued The projections' midrange assumption is that cost growth per enrollee in Medicare in excess of realwage growth and inflation will slow from 1.7 percentto 1 percent between 2012 and 2027 and remain at thatlevel thereafter. That assumption is similar to the in-termediate assumption made by the trustees of theMedicare trust funds. In so me alternative projections, CBO assumes that excess cost growth graduallyclimbs to 2 percent per year or falls to zero by 2027.However, the future path of health costs is extremelyuncertain, and outcomes outside the range that CBOexamined are plausible. All of CBO's projectionsassume that between 2012 and 2027, cost growth perenrollee in Medicaid gradually shifts from the rate inCBO's 10-year baseline to the long-run growth rateassumed for Medicare. Economic Assumptions CBO's projections assume that economic growth de- pends on total hours worked, the size of the capitalstock, and total factor productivity (TFP). Hours ofwork in turn depend on the size of the population andits age mix. CBO's midrange assumption for popula-tion matches the Social Security trustees' intermediateassumption; other projecti ons use the trustees' low- cost (optimistic) or high-cost (pessimistic) assump-tions. (Mortality, immigration, and birth rates arehigher under the low-cost assumption and lower underthe high-cost assumption.) Budget surpluses bolster national saving, raising investment, which boosts theprivate capital stock. The midrange assumption is forTFP to grow at the rate assumed in CBO's baselineuntil 2012, after which the rate of growth will gradu- ally rise to 1.6 percent ( its average over the postwar period plus 0.2 percentage poi nts to adjust for changes in the way prices are measur ed). Alternative optimis- tic and pessimistic assumptions raise and lower TFPgrowth by half a percentage point, respectively. Inthis analysis, the rate of productivity growth is treated as an exogenous, or independent, variable because thedeterminants of that growth rate are not yet well un-derstood by economists. CBO's projections assume that interest rates move in tandem with the return on capital (that is, thereturn earned on productive capital, such as plant andequipment, after corporate taxes). To be consistent with the economic variables in CBO's baseline, the long-t erm projections use the budget categories of the national income and productaccounts (NIPAs). NIPA m easures of spending and revenues differ from those in the budget because ofdifferences in accounting methods and the timing of some spending. 3 3. For a detailed description of the differences between NIPA and total budget accounting, see Appendix D, The Federal Sector of the National Income and Product Accounts . Policies that encourage economic growth also could help ease the burden of rising health and retirementspending. If none of those actions is taken, risingbudget deficits could ultimately harm the economy. Taking action sooner rather than later to allevi- ate future budgetary pressures has several advan-tages. Policies that encourage economic growth mayhave a greater impact on future output and budgetsthe sooner they are implemented, simply becausethey can affect the economy over a longer period oftime. Such policies could include running budgetsurpluses to bolster national saving and investment,implementing tax and regulatory policies that encour- age work and saving, and orienting governmentspending more toward investment than toward cur-rent consumption. In addition, acting sooner wouldbetter enable lawmakers to enact policy changes thatdo not take effect for many years. That would givepeople more time to adjust their lifetime work andsavings plans in response to any changes in expectedbenefits and taxes in programs such as Social Secu-rity, Medicare, and Medicaid. Finally, policychanges that drive down spending or push up reve-nues early on enable the government, because of re-duced interest costs, to finance more programmatic104 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020 2040012345Millions Actual Projected 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020 20400510152025Years Remaining Actual Projected Women MenFigure 6-2.

Higher sur- pluses or smaller deficits today result in lower levelsof debt and smaller interest payments in the future.Therefore, noninterest spending can be financed witha lower level of taxes, which can have a beneficialeffect on the economy. Pressures on Spending for Health and RetirementPrograms Under current law, spendi ng on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will rise significantly over thenext three decades. That expected surge in spendingstems from three fundamental factors. First, the largebaby-boom generation will begin to reach retirementage and become eligible to receive benefits from So-cial Security and Medicare (see Figure 6-2) . Second, people are likely to live longer than they did in thepast and therefore receive health and retirement bene-fits over a longer time frame. Third, history suggests that advances in medical technology and increaseduse of medical services will probably keep pushingup the cost of providing health care (see Figure 6-3).If policymakers adopted proposals to increase SocialSecurity, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits, spendingwould grow even more rapidly. The size of projected increases in health and retirement spending is sensitive to the economic anddemographic assumptions used to generate those pro-jections. To illustrate some of those sensitivities,CBO has varied within plausible ranges the assump-tions about three important but uncertain variables:cost per enrollee in federal health programs, the de-mographics of the U.S. population, and productivitygrowth (see Table 6-1). Growth in cost per enrollee is the most difficult aspect of health care spending to project, and it isalso a variable that has a powerful effect on spendingas a share of GDP. Even though the wages of healthcare workers are an important element of the costs offederal health programs, cost per enrollee of a givenage has typically grown faster than the average wageFigure 6-3. Estimated Cost Growth in Excess ofWage Growth per Enrollee in Medicare(Adjusted for age mix of beneficiaries) SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. has grown (see Figure 6-3). In all of CBO's long- term projections, cost per enrollee is assumed tomatch the levels in CBO's 10-year baseline through2012. Under CBO's midrange assumption, costgrowth per enrollee in Medicare will gradually slowfrom a rate that is 1.7 percent faster than wagegrowth (the rate projected for 2012 in the 10-yearbaseline) to a rate that is 1 percent faster than wagegrowth between 2012 and 2027; growth will remainat that rate thereafter. Cost growth per enrollee inMedicaid is assumed to slow to the same long-runrate as in Medicare between 2012 and 2027, althoughit starts at a higher rate. Both public and private medical expenditures have tended to grow faster than the economy over thepast few decades. That situation cannot continue in-definitely, however, or health spending will eventu-ally crowd out other cons umption. At some point, pressure from consumers and employers for lowerhealth insurance premiums and less expensive medi-cal care will probably rein in the growth of costs inthe private sector\u2014indeed, cost growth slowed sub-stantially over the past decade. CBO's midrange as-sumption reflects some further slowing, but the likeli-hood, timing, and extent of that slowdown are ex-tremely uncertain.106 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 6-1.

The assumptions about population under CBO's optimistic,midrange, and pessimistic alternatives match the low-cost,intermediate, and high-cost population assumptions of the So-cial Security trustees. c. For the midrange assumption, a nnual growth follows CBO's 10-year baseline projections from 2002 to 2012 and thenmoves to the long-run rate shown above over the next 15years. Annual growth under the optimistic assumption is 0.5percentage points higher, and under the pessimistic alternative0.5 percentage points lower, than the midrange assumption ineach year. In the projections CBO made before October 2000, it assumed that cost pe r enrollee slowed to the level of wage growth, rather than to the current mid-range assumption of 1 percent faster than wagegrowth, by the 25th year of the projection period. 2 Under that earlier, more optimistic assumption, spending on Social Secur ity, Medicare, and Medicaid would rise to 14.1 percent of GDP by 2030 (seeTable 6-2). In contrast, under the more pessimisticassumption that Medicare and Medicaid's cost perenrollee grows 2 percent per year faster than wagesin the long run, spending on the three programswould rise to 15.4 percent of GDP by 2030. Under each of the three assumptions about cost growth, theincrease in costs as a percentage of GDP is substan-tial. The number of people of different ages within the population also influences the degree to whichspending will rise. The Social Security trustees usethree different assumptions about population in their75-year projections: an intermediate assumption; a\"high cost\" assumption, and a \"low cost\" as-sumption, which projects fewer elderly and moreworking-age people. 3 Using the high-cost, or pessi- mistic, assumption, CBO projects that spending forSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will rise to 15.6 percent of GDP by 2030 (see Table 6-2). Evenunder the more optimistic low-cost assumption, CBOprojects that spending will rise to 13.8 percent ofGDP. A further influence on projected spending as a share of GDP is the rate of productivity growth. To-tal factor productivity (TFP) is the productivity mea-sure that CBO uses as an input in its long-term pro-jections. Growth in TFP is the portion of economicgrowth that cannot be accounted for by growth incapital or labor\u2014it is commonly thought of as a mea-sure of technical progress. Under CBO's midrangeassumption, the growth rate of TFP inches up from1.3 percent per year in 2012 to 1.6 percent per year in2022 and beyond (1.6 percent comprises TFP's aver-age annual growth rate over the postwar period plus0.2 percentage points to adjust for changes in the wayprices are measured). If TFP grew by half a percent-age point more in each year of the projection period\u2014the optimistic assumption\u2014spending on SocialSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid would be 14.2 per- cent of GDP by 2030 (see Table 6-2). If TFP grewby half a percentage point less\u2014the pessimistic as-sumption\u2014spending would rise to 15.2 percent ofGDP by 2030. Higher productivity growth means that both GDP and Social Security spending will climb, but at 2. Medicare's trustees also used a similar assumption until this year; they now use an assumption comparable to CBO's current mid-range assumption.3. The trustees' population assumptions used in CBO's projections do not incorporate information from the 2000 census, which tallied alarger current population than the trustees had assumed. Incorpo-rating that data will probably change the trustees' population pro-jections. CHAPTER SIX THE LONG-TERM BUDGET OUTLOOK 107 Table 6-2.

NOTE: For comparison, spending in 2001 amounted to 7.8 per- cent of GDP. a. Each alternative is based on assumptions about health costs, population, and productivity (among others). In generating thefirst six alternatives, CBO varied only one assumption, as indi-cated, and held the other two at their midrange levels (see Box6-1 for details). In the remaining two alternatives, all threeassumptions are optimistic or pessimistic simultaneously. different rates. Spending for Social Security rises when productivity increases because the program'sinitial benefits are based on an enrollee's history ofearnings as well as average wage growth in the econ-omy, both of which respond to changes in productiv-ity growth. Social Security spending rises moreslowly than GDP does, however, because new benefi-ciaries with histories of higher earnings (and there-fore higher benefits) enter the system slowly, overtime. Under the assumption that health costs, popula- tion, and productivity growth combined were morefavorable or less favorable than they were underCBO's midrange assumptions, the variation in pro- jected spending would be gr eater. For instance, if all three variables followed th eir optimistic assumptions, spending for Social Security, Medicare, andMedicaid would reach 12.8 percent of GDP in 2030, still well above the current level. Pessimistic as-sumptions for all three variables imply that healthand retirement spending would total 16.9 percent ofGDP in 2030. Those calculations offer some perspective on the likely increase in outlays over the next 30 yearsfor Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid undercurrent law. Although CBO used a particular set ofassumptions to generate its projections, the resultswould be similar under most reasonable assumptions.The bottom line is that if policies do not change, fed-eral spending on health and retirement programs forthe elderly will rise significantly as a share of theU.S. economy and the federal budget over the next 30years. Conclusion The aging of the large baby-boom generation andgrowth in the cost of health care will dramaticallyincrease spending for federal health and retirementprograms under current law. The pressure to increasespending will present policymakers with difficultchoices if they are to maintain the government's fis-cal balance. Policymakers could directly reduce therate of growth of spending for Social Security,Medicare, and Medicaid by changing those programs in ways that would reduce benefits relative to currentlaw or provide health care more efficiently. 4 If those programs are not changed, the nation will face theprospect of steep tax increases, big cuts in other gov-ernment spending, or large budget deficits. 4. For a general discussion of possible changes to Social Security, see Congressional Budget Office, Social Security: A Primer (Septem- ber 2001). For additional examples of possible changes to bothSocial Security and Medicare, see Congressional Budget Office,Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (May 1998) and Budget Options (February 2001).Chapter Seven Homeland Security Most of the activities that make up homeland security were being undertaken before Sep-tember 11, 2001, but the attacks of that date changed the nation's perception of the risks that itfaces and of its preparedness to deal with the conse-quences of such attacks on the homeland. Federalagencies, state and local governments, private busi-nesses, and individuals perceive a heightened threatto security and a need to commit additional resourcesto lower the risk of future attacks or to minimize theensuing harm. Those commitments have affectedboth the budget and the economy in fiscal year 2002and will undoubtedly be a focus of additional spend-ing and policy decisions that the Congress will makethis year. The federal government has accounted for a large part of the increase in the resources committedto homeland security following the attacks, most no-tably as a part of the 2001 Emergency SupplementalAppropriations Act for Recovery from and Responseto Terrorist Attacks on the United States (Public Law107-38). States and localities also have devoted moreresources to homeland security, for example, in re-sponse to a series of alerts issued by the federal gov-ernment since the September attacks. Likewise, theprivate sector has increased spending on physicalsecurity, particularly to protect facilities with the po-tential to be turned into weapons of mass destruction. As the Congress faces a heightened awareness of the risks of terrorism and the pressure that home-land security is likely to place on federal spendingand priorities in the near future, some f undamental questions emerge. First, what is homeland security,and what set of activities does it embrace? Second,what is currently being spent on homeland securityand by whom? Although some of the estimates pre- sented in this chapter are preliminary, they highlightthe fact that homeland security is an evolving conceptthat cuts across traditional budget categories and ju-risdictional boundaries. That wide scope makes thetask of evaluating different priorities and approachesparticularly challenging and suggests the value ofassessing trade-offs using a broad framework. What Is Homeland Security? Before September 11, homeland security was aphrase that was little known to the public and dis-cussed, for the most part, by a small group of analystsin the defense and law enforcement communities.Since the attacks, \"homeland security\" appears fre-quently in the media, has acquired an elevated stand-ing within the Executive Offi ce of the President, and has been offered as the reason to undertake a widearray of spending and policy initiatives. A core set ofactivities are widely recognized as part of homelandsecurity (for example, emergency preparedness andthe protection of government facilities), although theinclusion of others (for example, policies intended toincrease the domestic supply of energy) is a matter ofdisagreement. The definition of homeland security has impli- cations for both the measurement of and the controlover resources. A narrow view of the mission andactivities that constitute homeland security may im-ply that one actor\u2014a specific federal agency, for ex-ample\u2014should be responsible. A broader definitionmay suggest not only additional agencies but also a110 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 different structure to contro l the associated resources; for instance, instead of bein g directly responsible for the security of some function or activity, the federalgovernment could mandate particular security sys-tems that the private sector would then control.Moreover, a broader view would imply a broader setof trade-offs that should be considered in setting pri-orities and allocating resources. Within the defense community, a research insti- tute defines homeland security as, \"the prevention,deterrence, and preemption of, and defense against,aggression targeted at U.S. territory, sovereignty,population, and infrastructure, as well as the manage-ment of the consequences of such aggression andother domestic emergencies.\" 1 That definition is im- plicitly broad in its geographic scope and may en-compass major new national investments, most prom-inently in missile defense. By contrast, the missionstatement of the recently created Office of HomelandSecurity implies a narrower definition of homelandsecurity as comprising the federal government's ef-forts, in coordination with state and local govern-ments and the private sector , to develop, coordinate, fund, and implement the programs and policies nec-essary to detect, prepare fo r, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks withinthe United States. 2 Although clearly limited to the domestic arena, that definition explicitly grants a roleboth to state and local governments and to privateinstitutions in providing homeland security. For the presentation of federal spending that follows, the Congressional Budget Office adopts adefinition of homeland security that is based on theOffice of Management and Budget's most recent An- nual Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism . 3 That definition encompasses the activities that OMBhas classified as devoted to combating terrorism and protecting critical infrastructure. As described in OMB's report, those classifications are as follows: Physical Security of Government, which con- sists of activities to protect federally owned,leased, or occupied facilities and federal em-ployees, including high-r anking officials, from terrorist acts. It also includes activities to pro-tect foreign embassies, dignitaries, and otherpersons as authorized by federal law or execu-tive order. Law Enforcement and Investigative, which cap- tures activities to reduce the ability of groups orindividuals to commit terrorist acts and the in-vestigation and prosecution of terrorist actswhen they occur. This category includes intel-ligence collection activities and programs todetect and prevent the introduction of weaponsof mass destruction into the United States. Itincludes both antiterrorism investigations toidentify threats and vulnerabilities and activitiesto apprehend and prosecute terrorists. Preparing for and Respondi ng to Terrorist Acts, which includes the pla nning, training, equip- ment, and personnel direct ed at responding once terrorist acts have occurred. Research and Development captures activities to develop technologies to deter, prevent, ormitigate terrorist acts. Physical Security of the National Populace, which includes activities to protect the nationalinfrastructure, including air traffic, railroad,highway, maritime, and electronic distributionsystems; the production, distribution, and stor- age of electricity, natural gas, and petroleum;vital services such as banking and finance,water, and emergency services; and telecommu-nications systems. Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) is simi- lar to Physical Security of the National Popu- lace in that it also includes the protection of civilian infrastructure and services, but the 1.

Office of Management and Budget, Annual Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism (July 2001). Some analysts define homeland security as a subset of combating terrorism, with the former exclud- ing the physical security functions that the Departments of Defenseand State conduct overseas. OMB's report and CBO's analysisinclude those functions.CHAPTER SEVEN HOMELAND SECURITY 111 scope is slightly broader than defending against terrorist acts. Besides terrorism, CIP also ad-dresses threats to the national infrastructurefrom equipment failures, natural disasters, anddomestic crimes. CBO has chosen to includethis category in its accounting of spending forhomeland defense because many efforts to pro-tect critical infrastructure will probably be un-dertaken to address terrorist threats, includingthose against large economic and communica-tions structures, such as nuclear power plants,bridges, dams, and computer networks. 4 The definition adopted by CBO offers the ad- vantage of having an associated set of measures ofthe resources devoted to combating terrorism andprotecting critical infrastructure since 1998. 5 In fact, OMB's report is the sole compendium of data on fed-eral funds for combating terrorism and protectinginfrastructure. However, the definition is relatively narrow in scope and thus will probably be unable toaccommodate the full array of trade-offs that willlikely present themselves in this year's spending andpolicy debates. Moreover, any definition offerednow will likely evolve to encompass more activitiesthan were included in last year's report on combatingterrorism and protecting critical infrastructure.How Much Is Being Spent on Homeland Security? The federal government, state and local governments, and the private sector all spent money on securitybefore the attacks of September 11 and have all in-creased their spending since then. The federal in-crease has been the most visible. Data about thespending by other levels of government and the pri-vate sector are less available. (Box 7-1 discusses theeffects that spending for security has on the econ-omy.) A complication evident in all that follows is identifying the portion of spending that incrementallycontributes to homeland security. Many of the activi-ties associated with homeland security also serveother purposes. For example, spending on emer-gency preparedness improves response to natural di-sasters and industrial accidents, as well as to terroristattacks. Thus, it may be impossible in many cases toclearly separate the homeland security component forexpenditures that deliver benefits in more than onearea. Federal Spending Under the definition adopted by CBO, federal spend-ing (expressed in terms of budget authority) forhomeland security was $17.2 billion in 2001 and willbe about $22.2 billion in 2002. Those totals include funds provided in the 13 enacted appropriation lawsfor fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and portions of the$40 billion provided in the 2001 Emergency Supple-mental Appropriations Act for Recovery from andResponse to Terrorist Attacks on the United States(P.L. 107-38) and the Department of Defense andEmergency Supplemental Appropriations for Recov-ery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on theUnited States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-117). The imme- diate budgetary effect of the September 11 attacks isin part captured by the roughly $8.7 billion that theCongress provided afterward, over and above the$13.6 billion requested by the Administration forcombating terrorism and protecting critical infra-structure in its original budgetary proposal for 2002.4. In its tally for the CIP category, OMB focuses especially on costs for protecting the nation's computer networks against cyberattacks.OMB's current Annual Report to Congress on Combating Terror- ism does not account for activities to protect key physical infra- structure such as nuclear plants, dams, and bridges, although theCIP category as defined encompasses such activities. In the after-math of the recent attacks, protecting key elements of the nation'sphysical infrastructure will probably assume a higher priority. For purposes of this analysis, efforts to overcome any potential threats that could directly result in a large number of civilian casu-alties, such as attacks on transportation services, contamination ofdrinking water, and disruption or contamination of the mail service,are classified under Physical Security of the National Populace.Efforts dealing with threats to large economic and communicationsstructures, such as nuclear power plants, bridges, dams, and com-puter networks, are classified under Critical Infrastructure Protec-tion. 5. OMB has been collecting data from federal agencies, departments, and bureaus since 1998 in response to direction in the Fiscal Year1998 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85). Specifi-cally, the Congress directed the President to report on federalspending for counterterrorism, including funding to combat weap-ons of mass destruction.112 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Box 7-1. Homeland Security Spending and the Economy Terrorism reduces the well-being of U.S. citizens di- rectly, and given the increas ed threat, some increase in spending on security is necessary. Certainly, securityspending is valuable, but it uses up resources that could otherwise be used to produce something else. Conventional measures of economic perfor- mance do not account for how security spending af-fects well-being. The most commonly used aggregatemeasures, gross domestic product (GDP) and laborproductivity, do not gauge well-being but account foronly the value of goods and services sold and the costof providing government serv ices. By those measures, additional spending for homeland security is likely toslow real economic growth by 0.1 percent per yearduring the next decade, in large part because securityspending will result in slightly higher prices, withnominal GDP not significantly changed (see Table 2-5and Box 2-3 in Chapter 2). For example, private businesses such as airlines will be able to sell more and charge higher prices iftheir improved security systems can convince custom-ers that they will be safe. But the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) would not measure suchincreased security spending as an increase in output:any costs of security spending passed on to consumerswould increase prices. Thus , spending on security by private businesses (whether mandated or not) will tend to reduce measured real output per worker (productiv-ity) and increase inflation. Th e story is different if the increased spending is done by governments (for, say,airport security). The NI PAs cannot directly measure the output of government workers because it is notsold in the market. Therefore, government workers (inthis case, the security check point workers at airports) are presumed to produce services in line with theirwages. The result is that government spending on se-curity does not reduce measured real GDP, althoughin the long run, private spending does. Leaving aside the quirks of measurement, does increased security spending have any macroeconomicconsequences that will reflect back on the budget? Innominal terms, total income in the economy would beroughly unchanged if customers were willing to pay asmuch for the increased secur ity as it cost private busi- nesses. Thus, the total ta x base would be roughly un- changed. In the short run, the effects of spending on home- land security may be positive because the recessionhas idled some workers who can be employed in secu-rity without drawing resources from other activities.Employing those workers will provide a temporaryboost to incomes and consumption spending that willhelp speed the recovery from recession. That benefitwill dissipate, however, as the economy recovers andthe diversion of workers to security begins to affect other production. According to Administration reports produced before September 11, annual federal spending tocombat terrorism and protect critical infrastructuregrew from $7.2 billion in 1998 to $12 billion in 2001,an increase of 67 percent over four years. The Presi-dent's budget for fiscal year 2002 included $13.6 bil-lion for those efforts, a further increase of $1.6 bil-lion above the 2001 level. Thus, since 1998 the in-crease in federal spending for those efforts has beensteady (see Table 7-1). More specifically, homelandsecurity funding for the Department of Defense(DoD) and intelligence agencies grew by almost 50percent over the 1998-2001 period, and additionalgrowth was planned for 2002. Such funding for theDepartment of State increased dramatically in 1999to improve physical security after the August 1998attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) received thelargest relative increase in appropriations, whichclimbed from $53 million in 1998 to a request of$446 million for 2002 for its disaster response activi-ties, such as the stockpiling of vaccines and researchand development related to bioterrorism. The almost 90 percent increase between the 1998 level and the President's budget request for2002 may be overstated, however, because the annualaccounting of funding is complicated by programs'changing content. Although OMB attempts to nor-malize the data each year, agencies are always rede-fining programs that they consider to be combatingterrorism and protecting infrastructure. So, any costCHAPTER SEVEN HOMELAND SECURITY 113 Table 7-1.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Congress provided $40 billion in additional fund-ing for 2001 and 2002 conveyed in Public Laws 107-38 and 107-117. It also increased funding beyond theamounts originally requested by the President forcombating terrorism and protecting infrastructure for2002 in the annual appropriation acts. Congressionalaction can be summarized as follows. The Congress provided an additional $5.1 bil- lion above the original funding of $12 billion for2001 for combating terrorism and protecting infra-structure. Then, for 2002 it added $8.7 billion to thePresident's original request of $13.6 billion\u2014yield-ing $22.2 billion for this year. 6 In all, the Congress increased funding for those efforts by almost 45 per-cent above the original level for 2001 and then by about 65 percent above the level requested for 2002(see Table 7-2). Six agenci es\u2014DoD (along with the intelligence agencies), HHS, the Department of Jus-tice, the Department of State, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Energy\u2014re-ceived 87 percent of the total appropriations forhomeland security in 2001 and 2002, and almost 79percent of the total increase above the original levelfor 2001 and the requested level for 2002. Among the various purposes of spending for combating terrorism and protecting infrastructure(according to OMB's classifi cations), efforts related to the physical security of government received33 percent of the funding appropriated for 2002. TheDepartment of State, DoD and the intelligence agen-cies, and the Department of Energy got the largestshares of the $7.3 billion allotted to this category (seeTable 7-3). According to information gleaned fromAdministration documents, the Departments of De- fense and State expect to spend their shares on equip- ment to detect intrusions at, respectively, bases in thecontinental United States and bases and embas- 6. The effective 2002 level is about $27 billion because the $5.1 bil- lion was provided at the end of 2001.114 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table 7-2.

They exclude an estimated $1.25 billion authorized byPublic Law 107-71 for aviation security, which is to be offset by fees. These figures reflect CBO's estimates of homeland security funding for each agency. Actual spending will not be known until agencies make their budget allocations and report to OMB. a. Of the roughly $8.7 billion in added funds for 2002, about $8 billi on was from emergency supplement al legislation (P.L. 107-1 17), and about $700 million was added in the 13 regular appropriation acts, according to CBO's estimates.116 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 sies abroad. The Department of Energy expects to use its share of the funding to protect its facilities andsafeguard nuclear weapons materials. Twenty-two percent, or $4.8 billion, of the $22.2 billion will be used to prepare for and respondto terrorist acts. HHS and the Department of Justicereceived the majority of those funds. HHS receivedabout $2.5 billion to purchase pharmaceuticals andvaccines, provide grants to state and local health de-partments, and conduct other related activities. TheDepartment of Justice received almost $1 billion foractivities such as grants and training for local lawenforcement. Another 21 percent, or $4.7 billion, of the 2002 appropriations for homeland security will be used forlaw enforcement and inves tigative activities. DoD and the intelligence agencies and the Department ofJustice received almost 90 percent of the money al-lotted to this category. Of the $40 billion appropriated as emergency supplemental funds, CBO has classified $13.1 billionas devoted to combating terrorism and protecting crit-ical infrastructure. The remaining $26.9 billion($14.9 billion in 2001 and $12 billion in 2002) wasappropriated for items such as disaster relief for NewYork City and the Pentagon, foreign humanitarianassistance, and military operations in Afghanistan,which, while directly related to the September 11terrorist attacks, fall outside of the adopted definitionof homeland security (see Table 7-4). Some or all ofthose activities could be included if the Congress orthe Administration chose a broader definition ofhomeland security. (See Box 7-2 for more informa-tion on federal funding going to New York City.) Almost $24 billion of the $26.9 billion is for two activities\u2014disaster relief and military operationsin Afghanistan. Of that $24 billion, $11.9 billion isfor disaster relief, which includes recovery of the di-saster sites, economic aid to affected businesses, andmedical and financial relief for victims of the Sep-tember 11 attacks. The Federal Emergency Manage-ment Agency (FEMA) received $6.4 billion of themoney for disaster relief, the bulk of which will go toNew York City. An additional $2.7 billion was ap-propriated to the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, much of which was for block grants toaffected New York City businesses. DoD received about $1 billion to rebuild the Pentagon, includingrelocating damaged offices. Another $11.9 billion has been allocated for direct and indirect military operations for the war inAfghanistan as well as an increase in global intelli-gence activities related to the war on terrorism. (Thatfigure is CBO's rough estimate because related ac-tivities\u2014such as domestic combat air patrols and theactivation of reserves by DoD, which CBO classifies under Physical Security of the National Populace,one of the purposes that OMB cites for combatingterrorism\u2014are difficult to break out in the Administra-tion's pertinent documents.) About $ 840 million of the roughly $1.7 billion classified in Table 7-4 as \"other\" spending is associ-ated with border enforcement activities of the Immi-gration and Naturalization Service, the Customs Ser-vice, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Ser-vice. Another $150 million is for the Department ofEnergy's nonproliferation activities in the former So-viet Union. Like items mentioned above, these activ-ities could easily be considered as combating terror-ism under a broader definition. The issue of whether to consider border en- forcement activities as combating terrorism high-lights the problem of determining where to draw theline in examining the total costs for combating terror- ism as well as the difficulty and subjectivity of anaccounting of homeland security funding. Expandingthe scope of the definition to include border enforce-ment activities would add more than $13 billion eachyear that is not now capture d within the adopted defi- nition. About $10 billion of that $13 billion consistsof appropriations made to agencies such as the Ani-mal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Immi-gration and Naturalization Service, the Customs Ser-vice, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration. The remaining $3 billion comes fromfees collected by the Customs Service and the newTransportation Security Administration. In addition to the 13 appropriation acts and the emergency supplemental package, the Congress pro-vided security and disaster relief funding for 2002 infour other acts (see Table 7-5).

Of that $5.4 billion,about $750 million will be paid out in 2002, CBO estimates. The USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56) will in- crease federal payments to families of public safetyofficers killed in the line of duty.

Federal Spending to Aid New York City After the September 11 Attacks According to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) estimates, of the $40 billion of emergencysupplemental appropriations provided by the 2001Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Re-covery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on theUnited States (Public Law 107-38) and the Depart-ment of Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appro-priations for Recovery from and Response to TerroristAttacks on the United States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-117), about $ 10.2 bi llion is for assistance to New York City, providing both support to businesses andindividuals and support to state and local govern-ments. Disaster relief acc ounts for the largest portion of the spending, followed by economic assistance,which is mostly loans and assistance to businessesaffected by the attacks. Other aid includes improve-ments and repairs to infrastructure, such as roads andmass transit; unemployment assistance to displacedworkers; and health a ssistance and monitoring. Additional funds from the $40 billion will also benefit New York City. For instance, about $100 mil-lion will be spent to relocate and reconstitute federaloffices destroyed in the attacks. Also, New York Cityis likely to receive so me portion of about $1 b illionappropriated in the form of grants and other assistance to state and local law enforcement and other emer-gency personnel. Other laws provide compensation for victims\u2014 some of which will go to the families who lost rela-tives in the attacks in Pennsylvania and at the Penta-gon but the majority of which will go to families wholost relatives in the World Trade Center attacks. Ac-cording to CBO's estimates, the Air TransportationSafety and System Stabili zation Act (P.L. 107-42), the USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56), and the ofTerrorism Tax Relief Act (P.L. 107-134) provide forabout $5.8 billion in such compensation over the2002-2011 period. In accordance with the Deficit Control Act, CBO's baseline inflates budg et authority from the level appropriated in 2002. Thus, the $7.2 billion ap-propriated in 2002 for disa ster relief for New York City is inflated through 2012 in the baseline.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) was enacted to improve transportationsecurity through the establishment of the Transporta-tion Security Administration, which will coordinateall domestic aviation security. So far for fiscal year2002, $1.25 billion has been appropriated for thatfunction, and CBO estimates that the full amount willbe offset by fees paid by passengers and air carriers. Finally, the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act (P.L. 107-134), cleared by the Congress onDecember 20, 2001, provides specialized income taxtreatment for individuals who died as a result of therecent terrorist attacks. CBO estimates that imple-menting this law will cost about $190 million in 2002(both in terms of lost revenues and outlays) and about $360 million over the 2002-2011 period. The amounts for aviation and airport economic assistance conveyed in the emergency supplementalappropriations and in the aviation legislation (that is,the amounts shown in both Tables 7-4 and 7-5) sumto about $7.7 billion in authorizations and appropria-tions for the activity in 2001 and 2002. Summing theamounts for disaster relief yields a figure of $12.9billion for 2001 and 2002. State and Local Spending Although data for spending by state and local govern-ments are not yet available, in supplemental appropri-ations the federal government has provided signifi-120 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 cant assistance to those governments for homeland security. That assistance is included in totals for fed- eral spending on homeland security discussed earlierin this chapter, but CBO notes it separately here inorder to highlight functions that various levels ofgovernment support through their spending. Thatsaid, state and local governments continue to provideand fund services related to homeland security intheir traditional areas of responsibility: law enforce-ment, fire safety and control, emergency response,and public health. Supplemental appropriations for 2002 provided a significant source of federal funding for state andlocal governments. CBO has identified over $7 bil-lion in such assistance. It takes the form of eithergrants to state and local governments or increasedfunding for federal programs that directly supportongoing state and local activities, such as specializedtraining for emergency response workers. Well overhalf of the $7 billion can be attributed to public assis-tance awards through the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency. Initial estimates by CBO indicatethat at least $4.3 billion in assistance will be providedto the City of New York or the Metropolitan TransitAuthority to reclaim the World Trade Center site andto rebuild transit systems and government buildings.The supplemental appropriations provided another $1billion to the Department of Health and Human Ser-vices for grants to state and local governments to in-crease their ability to effectively respond to biologi-cal and chemical threats. Other items in the supple-mental funds include grants for law enforcementtraining and preparedness, increased port security,and reimbursement for losses resulting from airportclosures. Such activities are ones that CBO couldeasily identify in the budget and appropriation acts asclear examples of federal support available to stateand local governments for homeland security. In identifying the subset of federal spending targeted either for grants to state and local govern-ments or for the direct support of those governments'activities, CBO did not include several programs thatmay provide some residual, yet significant, benefit tothose governments. For example, CBO did not in- clude funding for federal emergency response teamsthat may augment state and local activities. Simi-larly, CBO did not include funding for federal datacollection and information systems that track andreport disease outbreaks or for additional deploy- ments by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for theWinter Olympics in Salt Lake City. However, all ofthose items, as well as the $7 billion in assistance thatCBO identifies as directly benefiting state and localgovernments, are included in the federal totals dis-cussed earlier. Private Spending Although the bulk of spending for security is done bythe government, the private sector contributes a sig-nificant portion as well. One academic study esti-mates that private businesses spent roughly $40 bil-lion on security in 2001, or about 10 percent of allcrime-induced spending in the economy. 7 Nearly half of the total spending for security by the private sectoris composed of a single category, security guards andother protective service employees. The rest of thespending falls into such categories as alarm systems,computer security, locks and safes, surveillance cam-eras, safety lighting, and guard dogs. Although mostof that spending is undertaken to prevent crime ratherthan terrorist threats, it should reduce the risk of alltypes of attacks. Businesses and consumers have incurred and will continue to incur other costs, as markets adjustto the perception of a riskier world and participantstake steps to reduce their risks. Air travelers facehigher costs as federal taxes associated with flyinghave increased. Those consumers and many produc-ers who rely on shipments that cross U.S. land bor-ders or enter U.S. ports also are burdened with costlylonger waiting times in tran sit to allow for security checks. And as discussed in Chapter 5, businessesseeking insurance against the consequences of futureterrorist attacks will pay higher premiums or pay theless visible cost of accepting more risks. 7.

In theaftermath of the September 11 attacks, funding home-land security initiatives has become a top priority.But budgetary resources are limited, and the benefitsof increased funding for homeland security must beweighed against other budgetary choices. As illus-trated by the spending that is already taking place, thescope over which priorities might be redefined is ex-ceptionally wide, encompassing many agencies of thefederal government, state and local governments, andthe private sector. The task of coordinating, financ-ing, planning, and putting integrated programs intoplace is correspondingly great. Because the politicaland economic systems in the United States are decen-tralized, the country has few opportunities beyond thefederal budget process\u2014and the budget resolution inparticular\u2014to plan major changes in priorities andput in place the programs necessary to carry themout. The recent debate on airline security illustrates the difficult issues that the Congress will face incrafting and funding policies intended to increasehomeland security. One key element of that debatewas whether to make airport security a federal re-sponsibility or to leave it in the hands of the airlines.The Aviation and Transportation Security Act re-solved this issue by shif ting primary responsibility tothe federal government. It also authorized the assess- ment of fees on passengers and airlines to help payfor the federal workforce and equipment necessary toscreen passengers and their baggage. The issues that arose during the debate about aviation security will return, and new ones will comeup as the Congress considers additional homelandsecurity proposals. A recu rring issue is who should pay for increased government spending on homelandsecurity. Should the costs be spread broadly oversociety or focused on the recipients of the govern-ment benefits? A second issue is which federal agen-cies should do what\u2014for ex ample, should the role of the military be expanded if its sk ills and equipment could be used effectively in activities currently un-dertaken by civilian or nonfederal entities? A thirdissue is whether the proposal in question only en-hances homeland security or whether it has additionalbenefits. Some measures to address terrorism\u2014forinstance, most proposed improvements in the publichealth system or better training for emergency per-sonnel\u2014have additional benefits. A fourth issue iswhether improvements in homeland security shouldbe administered by the federal government, state andlocal governments, or the private sector\u2014choicesthat elicit different views about the appropriate rolesof different levels of government and the private sec-tor. Thus, the policy and spending decisions that theCongress faces present a special challenge because oftheir complexity and the di fficult trade-offs they in- volve. AppendixesAppendix A How Changes in Assumptions Can Affect Budget Projections The federal budget is highly sensitive to eco- nomic conditions. Revenues depend on tax-able income\u2014including wages and salaries, in- terest and other nonwage income, and corporateprofits\u2014which generally move s in step with overall economic activity. The benefits of many entitlementprograms are pegged to inflation either directly (aswith Social Security) or indirectly (as with Medic-aid). In addition, the Treasury regularly refinancesportions of the government's debt at market interestrates, so the level of federal spending for interest onthat debt is directly tied to such market rates. To illustrate how assumptions about key eco- nomic factors can affect federal budget projections,the Congressional Budget O ffice (CBO) uses what it terms rules of thumb. Those rules are rough ordersof magnitude for gauging how changes in individualeconomic variables, taken in isolation, will affect thebudget's totals. The variables that figure in those rules of thumb are real (inflation-adjusted) growth, interest rates,and inflation. For real gr owth, CBO's rule shows the effects of a rate that is 0.1 percentage point lowereach year, beginning in January 2002, than the as-sumed rate of growth underlying CBO's baseline pro-jections (that rate and other economic assumptionsare outlined in Chapter 2). The rules for interestrates and inflation assume an increase of 1 percentagepoint over the rates in the baseline, also starting inJanuary 2002. Each rule is roughly symmetrical. Thus, the ef- fects of higher growth, lowe r interest rates, or lowerinflation would have about the same magnitude as the effects shown in this appendix, but with the oppositesign. The calculations that appear in this appendix are merely illustrative of the im pact that changes in as- sumptions can have. CBO uses variations of 0.1 per-centage point or 1 percentage point for the sake ofsimplicity; they should not be viewed as typical fore-casting inaccuracies. (For details about the accuracyof CBO's past budget pr ojections, see Chapter 5.) Furthermore, readers shoul d be careful about extrap- olating from small, incremental rule-of-thumb calcu-lations to much larger ch anges, because the magni- tude of the effect of a larger change is not necessarilya multiple of a smaller change. Moreover, budgetprojections are subject to other kinds of inaccuracies that are not directly related to economic forecasting. In addition to the rules of thumb related to eco- nomic projections, CBO presents two rules that dealwith the levels of projected surpluses. The first illus- trates the impact on projections of discretionaryspending of adding $10 billion to CBO's estimate ofbudget authority for 2002. The second shows theeffect on net interest payments of borrowing $10 bil-lion less than anticipated. Lower Real Growth Strong economic growth improves the federal bud-get's bottom line, and weak economic growth wors-126 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 ens it. The first economic rule of thumb outlines the budgetary impact of economic growth that is slightlyweaker than CBO's baseline assumes. Specifically,the rule illustrates the effects of growth rates for realgross domestic product (GDP) that are lower by 0.1percentage point every year from January 2002through 2012. Those effects differ from the effects of a cycli- cal change, such as a recession, which are muchshorter-term in nature. (For scenarios involving cy-clical economic changes, see Chapter 5.) Moreover,CBO's rule for GDP uses 0.1 percentage point\u2014rather than the full percenta ge point used in the inter- est rate and inflation rules\u2014because projected realgrowth is unlikely to differ from actual growth bysuch a large amount over the next 10 years. A differ-ence as large as 1 percentage point might occur for afew years, however, as a result of a cyclical change. The baseline projects that real GDP will grow by an average of about 3.1 percent a year. Subtract-ing 0.1 percentage point from that rate each yearmeans that the level of GDP would lie roughly 1 per-cent below CBO's baseline assumption by 2012. A lower rate of growth for GDP would have a number of budgetary implications. For example, itwould suggest slower grow th of taxable income, leading to shortfalls in revenues that would mountfrom $1 billion in 2002 to $42 billion in 2012 (seeTable A-1). Cumulatively, revenues would be $196billion lower over the 2003-2 012 period than CBO now projects. Lower gr owth of GDP would also mean that the government borrowed more and in-curred greater interest costs on its debt. Those debt-service costs would be minimally affected during thefirst few years of the projection period, but in lateryears, those costs would gradually rise, by as much as$11 billion in 2012. Altogether, those changes (alongwith small effects on the earned income tax creditand Medicare) would reduce the projected surplus for2012 by $53 billi on. In sum, if growth of real GDP was 0.1 percentage point a year lower than the rateassumed in CBO's baseline, surpluses would be atotal of $51 billion smaller over the 2003-2007 periodand $234 billion smaller over the 2003-2012 period.Higher Interest Rates CBO's second rule of thumb illustrates the sensitivityof the budget to changes in interest rates, which af-fect the flow of interest to and from the federal gov-ernment. When the budget is in surplus, the Treasuryuses some of its income to reduce debt held by thepublic, but it also refinances some debt at market in-terest rates. When the budget is in deficit, the Trea-sury must borrow additional funds from the public tocover any shortfall. If interest rates were 1 percentage point higher than in the baseline for all maturities of debt eachyear and all other economic variables were un-changed, interest costs would be approximately $6billion higher in 2002 (see Table A-1). That initialboost in interest costs would be fueled largely by theextra costs of refinancing the government's short-term Treasury bills (those with maturities of one yearor less), which make up about 25 percent of the mar-ketable debt. More than $730 billion of Treasurybills are currently outstanding, all of which maturewithin the next year. The bulk of marketable debt, however, consists of medium-term notes a nd long-term bonds, which were issued with maturities of two to 30 years. Asthose longer-term securities mature, they will be re-placed with new issues (the Treasury has stoppedissuing 30-year bonds, but it continues to issue two-,five-, and 10-year notes). Thus, the budgetary effects of a change in interest rates would mount; the effectof interest rates that were 1 percentage point highereach year than in the baseline would peak at $22 bil-lion in 2006 and 2007. After 2007, however, the effect of higher inter- est rates would diminish. As projected baseline sur-pluses continued to rise, the stock of debt held by thepublic would be reduced, so fewer securities wouldbe expected to roll over each year. By 2012, the ef-fect of higher interest rates would drop to $11 billion, but the effect of increased debt over the 10-year pe- riod would add another $16 billion to interest costs inthat year. In sum, the interest rate rule of thumbwould cause the cumulative surplus to decline by$117 billion from 2003 through 2007 and by $267billion from 2003 through 2012.APPENDIX A HOW CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT BUDGET PROJECTIONS 127 Table A-1.

NOTE: * = between -$500 million and $500 million. Higher Inflation The third rule of thumb shows the budgetary impact of inflation that is 1 percentage point higher eachyear than the baseline projects. The effects of infla-tion on federal revenues and outlays partly offseteach other. On the one hand, higher inflation and itsassumed effects on wages and other income lead to greater revenues. On the other hand, higher inflationincreases spending for many benefit programs (al-though with a lag), as well as baseline projections ofdiscretionary spending. In deriving this rule ofthumb, CBO also assumes that nominal interest ratesrise in step with inflation, thus increasing the cost of financing the government's debt.128 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 An increase of 1 percentage point per year in projected inflation from 2002 through 2012 wouldboost revenues by $405 billion and outlays by $238billion in 2012 (see Table A-1). The combined effectof those changes would be to increase the surplus in2012 by $167 billion. Over the 2003-2007 period,the projected surplus would grow by $68 billion; overthe 2003-2012 period, it would increase by $546 bil-lion. Higher Discretionary Budget Authority Discretionary spending is not directly related to eco- nomic conditions but rather to the level of appropria-tions provided by the Congress and the rate at whichsuch appropriations are spent. CBO's baseline pro-jections assume that appropriations for the currentyear\u2014in this case, 2002\u2014grow at the specified ratesof inflation in the years to follow (as specified by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Actof 1985). Nevertheless, it may be useful to estimatethe sensitivity of discretionary outlays (and thus thesurplus or deficit) to changes in discretionary budgetauthority that are unrelated to changes in economicassumptions.Budget authority is the legal authority to incur financial obligations that will result in immediate orfuture outlays of federal government funds. TheCongress appropriates such budget authority for dis-cretionary programs annually in appropriation acts;outlays from that authority may occur in the year that the authority is granted or in subsequent years. Fast-spending activities (such as meeting payrolls or di-rectly providing services) generally expend most oftheir budget authority in the year that it is granted;slow-spending activities (such as procuring weaponsor building roads and other infrastructure) spend their authority over a longer period of time. As a result, changes in budget authority for dif- ferent activities do not immediately translate intoequal changes in outlays. CBO estimates that, onaverage, approximately 60 percent of budget author- ity for discretionary spending is spent in the year thatit is granted. Therefore, an additional $10 billion inbudget authority in 2002 would lead to $6 billionmore in outlays that year. The remaining $4 billionwould be spent over the next few years. Under the rules that govern CBO's baseline, providing $10 billion more in budget authority in2002 would lead to an increase of $13 billion in pro-jected budget authority in 2012 (see Table A-2).Spending that additional budget authority would lead to $51 billion more in outlays between 2003 and2007 and $111 billion more over the 2003-2012period.

NOTE: CBO assumes that budget authority grows at the rates of inflation specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit C ontrol Act of 1985 (the GDP deflator and employment cost index for wages and salaries).APPENDIX A HOW CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT BUDGET PROJECTIONS 129 Increase in the Surplus or Decrease in the Deficit CBO's projections of net interest costs are consistent with its projections of future interest rates and debtheld by the public. Changes from year to year in debtheld by the public depend mostly on the size of thesurplus or deficit. If su rpluses or deficits differed from those projected in the baseline\u2014for whateverreason\u2014interest costs would also change. A one-time decrease of $10 billion in the deficit in 2002 would enable the Treasury to redeem an ad-ditional $10 billion in debt that year, compared with the assumption in CBO's baseline. Removing thatdebt from the outstanding stock would save $0.1 bil-lion in net interest in 2002 and nearly $1 billion ayear by 2012 (see Table A-3). (Savings in later yearswould stem from the compo unding effect of debt re- duction in 2002.) Interest savings would be even greater if the $10 billion decrease in borrowing was sustained in everyyear through 2012. In that case, savings from addi-tional debt reduction and the compounding effect of such savings would increase the projected surplus in2012 by $7.4 billion. Table A-3. Estimated Savings in Net Interest from Borrowing $10 Billion Less (I n billions of dollars) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Total, 2003- 2007Total, 2003- 2012 Savings from Borrowing B Changes in CBO's Baseline Since August 2001 Since January 2001, the cumulative budget sur- plus that the Congre ssional Budget Office (CBO) is projecting for the 2002-2011 period, under current policies, has dropped by $4 trillion.Nearly $1.8 trillion of that decline stems fromchanges made to CBO's baseline projections sincethe previous baseline was published in August 2001(see Table B-1). 1 In the current baseline, the sur- pluses projected last summe r have diminished or, for some years, disappeared. The reasons for those re-ductions are fairly evenly divided among legislative,economic, and technical factors. Budget Totals in 2001 In August, CBO estimated that the surplus for fiscalyear 2001 would total $153 billion; the actual surplusturned out to be $26 billion less. About two-thirds ofthat difference stemmed from lower-than-expectedrevenues, primarily in the category of individual in-come tax receipts. 2 On the outlay side, two events produced notable differences from the August baseline. First, in Sep-tember, the Treasury recorded outlays of $12 billionto reverse most of the downward credit reestimate ithad recorded in July for loans made by the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) related to theauction of spectrum licenses. That reversal reflecteda change in the Administration's assessment of thelikely outcome of litigation involving borrowers thathad filed for bankruptcy. Second, enactment of theAir Transportation Safety and System StabilizationAct in September increased outlays in 2001. Thatlaw provided $5 billion in grants to U.S. airlines inthe aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.About $2.3 billion of the grants were disbursed be-fore the end of the fiscal year. Changes in Projections for the 2002-2011 Period CBO's baseline projections are intended to be a neu- tral benchmark against which policymakers can mea-sure the effects of possible changes in tax and spend-ing policies. Thus, rather than predicting future bud-getary outcomes, the baseline projects what federalrevenues and spending would look like over five or10 years if current policies remained the same. At least twice each year, CBO updates its base- line to reflect new legislation (which alters the defini-tion of current policies), changes in the outlook for1. Those projections appeared in Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update (August 2001). 2. Actual revenues in 2001 fell short of CBO's published estimate by more than $20 billion. However, CBO recorded $3.6 billion inadvance refunds (included as part of last June's tax-cut law) as out-lays in its baseline because those refunds were projected to exceedtaxpayers' 2001 tax liabilities. The Treasury, by contrast, recordedall advance refunds as reductions in revenues, although that actionwas not consistent with normal budgetary practices; had CBO donethe same, the revenue difference would have been $17 billion ratherthan $20 billion. 132 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table B-1.

The rest of this appendix outlines the revisions that CBO hasmade to the baseline since last August, when its pre-vious projections were published. Legislative Changes Since August Laws enacted in the past six months are projected toreduce the cumulative surplus over the 2002-2011period by $649 billion. Most of that change stemsfrom higher discretionary spending and the costs ofservicing the larger federal debt that will result from that spending.Revenues . Legislation enacted since August is ex- pected to decrease revenues only modestly over thenext 10 years\u2014by a total of about $19 billion (seeTable B-2). The largest decline comes from the In-vestor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act, whichlowers fees charged by the Securities and ExchangeCommission. Discretionary Spending. In its August baseline, CBO extrapolated discre tionary budget authority from the appropriations enacted for 2001 and calcu-lated the outlays that w ould flow from such budget authority. In that baseline, budget authority for 2002totaled $670 billion. However, the appropriation actsAPPENDIX B CHANGES IN CBO'S BASELINE SINCE AUGUST 2001 133 Table B-1.

That additional $41 billion in budgetauthority for 2002 is extrapolated throughout the pro-jection period in CBO's new baseline. An earlier $20 billion in emergency supplemen- tal funding, provided in Se ptember, also contributes to the increase in projected discretionary outlays forthe next few years. That budget authority was en-acted in fiscal year 2001, so it was not carried for-ward into the baseline projections for future years.But because it was provided so late in the fiscal year,most of the outlays from that budget authority will occur in 2002 and beyond\u2014an estimated $14 billionin 2002, $4 billion in 2003, and $1 b illion in both 2004 and 2005. Overall, projected outlays for discretionary pro- grams during the 2002-2 011 period are $467 billion higher than they were in the August baseline becauseof new legislation.

That law aids U.S. passenger and cargo air- lines through a combination of grants, federal creditassistance, and reimbursements for some increases intheir insurance premiums. It also establishes com-pensation for families of the victims of the September11 plane crashes and limits the liability of the air car-riers involved in those crashes to the amount of insur- ance they had for such events. In addition, the lawallows air carriers to buy insurance coverage from thefederal government and, for a limited time, relievesthem of liability for furthe r terrorist acts. CBO esti- mates that the law will add about $10 billion to out-lays over the 2002-2011 period. APPENDIX B CHANGES IN CBO'S BASELINE SINCE AUGUST 2001 135 Enactment of the Railroad Retirement and Survi- vors' Improvement Act has increased projected man-datory outlays by about $4 billion over 10 years.Moreover, that law\u2014for the first time\u2014allows someof the holdings of federal trust funds (the RailroadRetirement trust funds) to be invested in corporatestocks and bonds. (For details of how those invest-ments would be treated in the federal budget, see Box4-3 in Chapter 4.) The additional $467 billion in discretionary out- lays and $14 billion in mandatory outlays over 10years that are caused by laws enacted since Augustdecrease projected surpluses\u2014and thus increase theamount of federal debt that will remain outstanding.As a result, those changes (plus the relatively smalladjustments to revenues) are projected to raise thecost of servicing the debt by $149 billion between2002 and 2011. All told, enacted laws increasedmandatory spending by $163 billion relative to theAugust baseline. Economic Changes Since August CBO recently revised its economic outlook to reflectboth the current recession and slightly smaller aver-age rates of growth projected through 2012. Com-pared with its August forecast, CBO now expects thegrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) to dropmore sharply this year and then rebound in 2003 and2004. CBO is also projecting lower interest rates andsignificantly higher unemployment for the next twoyears than it did last summer. Those changes in the economic forecast reduce the cumulative surplus projected for the 2002-2011period by $645 billion. The bulk of that decline,$609 billion, comes from lower projections of reve-nues. The other $37 billion reflects higher projec-tions of outlays (the net result of increases and de-creases in those projections). Revenues. CBO now estimates that nominal GDP will grow by only 1.6 percent in fiscal year 2002 be-fore rebounding to 5.6 percent in 2003 and 6.1 per-cent in 2004. Slower growth of GDP (combined with a smaller share of GDP generated by corporate prof-its) leads to lower revenues. The short-term effectsof the economic recession are reflected in drops inrevenue projections since August\u2014declines of $105 billion for 2002 and $80 billion for 2003. The antici-pated recovery from recession translates into smallerprojected revenue losses for 2004 and 2005. Afterthat, however, the fact that CBO now expects real(inflation-adjusted) growth to be 0.1 percent slower per year, on average, than it did last August meansthat annual revenue projections continue to be $45billion to $67 billi on lower through 2011 than they were in August. In all, revenue projections for the 2002-2011 period have dropped by roughly $610 billion becauseof changes in the economic outlook. More than $400billion of that total is attributable to lower projectionsof individual income tax receipts. Nearly $200 bil-lion reflects reduced projections of revenues fromsocial insurance (payroll) taxes. Those reductionsare both directly related to CBO's lower projectionsfor wages and salaries, on which those taxes are im-posed. Relatively small changes in other sources ofrevenue because of economic revisions roughly offseteach other. Outlays. Recent changes to CBO's ec onomic out- look have a much smaller impact on projected out-lays\u2014a net increase of $37 billion over 10 years\u2014than on revenues. But the result is the same: thechanges reduce projected surpluses. Over the 2002-2011 period, the increased costs of debt service at-tributable to economic chan ges since August outstrip the short-term savings from lower inflation and inter-est rates. CBO now expects the unemployment rate in 2002 and 2003 to be higher than it forecast in August(6.0 percent in both years, compared with the 5.1 per-cent and 5.2 percent forecast last summer). As a re-sult, CBO has increased its projections of unemploy-ment insurance payments\u2014by $9 billion for 2002,$10 billion for 2003, and smaller amounts for 2004and 2005\u2014and made smaller adjustments to pro-jected spending for other programs, such as FoodStamps and Medicaid. Most of the other effects of the economic changes (excluding the increase in debt-service costs)reduce projected spending. Projections of Medicareoutlays are lower by $4 billion to $5 billion a yearbeginning in 2004 because of lower expected infla-136 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 tion and real (inflation-adju sted) GDP in the next few years. (Medicare's payment rates for most servicesare automatically adjusted each year to reflect move-ment in the prices of inputs; payment rates for ser-vices paid under the physician fee schedule are alsoadjusted to reflect changes in real GDP.) Ten-year projections of Social Security spend- ing are also lower that they were in August, by a totalof $69 billion. Because inflation was lower than ex-pected in 2001, the cost-of-living adjustment effec-tive in January 2002 turned out to be lower than CBOhad anticipated. As a result, the base for benefitsthroughout the projection period has been reduced.(The projected January 2003 cost-of-living adjust-ment is significantly smaller as well.) In addition,since Social Security benefits are calculated fromwages, CBO's projection of lower real wage growthmeans smaller initial benefits for new beneficiaries inthe future. The government's net interest costs are princi- pally determined by two factors: the stock of out-standing debt and prevailing interest rates. CBO'sforecast for interest rates has fallen since August,reducing the projected cost of issuing new debt. Net interest savings from that change are expected to be$15 billion in 2 002, $13 billion in 2003, and smaller amounts thereafter, totaling $43 billion over the2002-2011 period. Because the recent economic revisions reduce projected surpluses (mainly because of the substan-tial drop in revenues described above), the stock offederal debt held by the public will no longer declineas quickly as CBO estimated in August. That slow-down adds an estimated $165 billion to debt-servicecosts through 2011, with most of the expense comingin the later years of that period. Technical Changes Since August Technical revisions are defined as any reestimatesthat are not ascribed to new legislation or to changesin the components of CBO's economic forecast.Overall, technical changes reduce the projected sur-plus for the 2002-2011 period by $501 billion.Revenues . Since August, CBO has decreased its rev- enue projections for the 2002-2011 period by $388billion because of various technical adjustments tothe method for calculating how much revenue theprojected level of economic activity will generate.More than $200 billion of that decrease reflects lowerprojections of individual income tax receipts. Thetechnical factors involved are closely related to therevised economic outlook\u2014most important, revisionsto projections of capital gains realizations and adjust-ments for unexplained shortfalls in tax collectionssince July, as well as some minor changes to CBO'sestimating methods. Another $127 billion of the technical change affects projections of corpor ate income taxes. Again, that drop results from lower estimates of corporatecapital gains realizations and from tax collections in2001 that were smaller than CBO would have ex-pected given the economic conditions. By contrast, technical changes increased the projections for social insurance taxes by $42 billionfrom 2002 through 2011. That increase is based on information that current collections of Social Secu-rity and Medicare taxes are higher, given the level ofeconomic activity, than models had projected. Suchextra revenue is expected to persist. It does not raisetotal projected revenues, however, because it islinked to an offsetting decrease in individual incometax receipts. Technical changes since August have lowered the 10-year projection for estate and gift tax receiptsby $24 billion. That decline largely results from re-ductions in projected levels of wealth, which helpdetermine how much money is subject to those taxes.However, the decline also reflects a new interpreta-tion of how taxpayers will respond to the changes intax law scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Under the pro-visions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Rec-onciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), calendar year2010 will be a particularly good year to make taxablegifts, because the tax rates will rise substantially in2011. The taxes on those gifts would be paid in fis-cal year 2011. The additional receipts expected inthat year partially offset the decline caused by lowerprojections of wealth.APPENDIX B CHANGES IN CBO'S BASELINE SINCE AUGUST 2001 137 Box B-1. Uncertainty About Credit Reestimates for Spectrum Loans Radio frequencies are a scarce and valuable resource for wireless and broadcast services. Consequently, federal auctions of licenses to use parts of the electro- magnetic spectrum have generated billions of dollarsfor government coffers. In most cases, auction win-ners pay cash for their licenses, and those paymentsare recorded in the budget as offsetting receipts. Inthe mid-1990s, however, some auction winners bor-rowed money from the Federal Communications Com-mission (FCC) to pay for their spectrum licenses.Because those loans are subject to credit reform pro-cedures, the budget records only the net subsidy asso- ciated with them, measured on a net-present-valuebasis over the life of the loans. Estimates of that sub-sidy have fluctuated dramatically over the past fewyears because of ongoing litigation and other marketfactors. The most widely reported\u2014and perhaps mis- understood\u2014source of uncerta inty about those sub- sidy estimates involves the licenses that were awardedin 1997 to NextWave. That company borrowed $4.9billion from the FCC to acquire spectrum licenses butlater filed for bankruptcy. The FCC reclaimed Next-Wave's licenses and reauctioned them in 2001 for atotal of about $16 billion. NextWave has disputed theFCC's authority to reclaim the licenses, and the issueremains in litigation. For estimating purposes, the Congressional Bud- get Office (CBO) has assumed that the amount thegovernment will recover on its loans to NextWave willbe midway between what it would collect if it lost itscourt case (which CBO estim ates at about $6 billion because of accrued interest) and what it would collectif it won (the $16 billion bid at the reauction). Hence, the credit reestimates included in CBO's baseline re-flect an expected value of $11 billion. At the end of the most recent session of Con- gress, the Administration proposed a legislative settle-ment that would allow the federal government to keepthe $16 billion from the reauction and require that$9.55 billion be appropriated for a payment to Next-Wave. 1 The government would retain the difference, or a total of $6.45 billion.2 That amount would be $4.5 billion less than the $11 b illion that CBO esti- mated under current law. Thus, CBO estimated thatthe settlement would add $4.5 billion to subsidy costsover the 2002-2004 period. No legislative action was taken on the proposed settlement agreement in 2001. The Supreme Court isexpected to decide this spring whether to reviewlower-court rulings related to NextWave's spectrumlicenses. Until those issues are resolved by the courts or the Congress, estimates of the credit subsidies forFCC loans will remain uncertain. 1. Key provisions of the Administration's proposal were included in the Prompt Utilization of Wireless Spectrum Act of 2001(H.R. 3484), introduced on December 13, 2001. 2. Some media reports suggested that the settlement would yield a total of about $10 billion to the government rather than the $6.45 billion estimated by CBO, because the bill would haverequired NextWave to pay $3 billion in taxes on its receiptsfrom the settlement. However, taxes paid on government pay-ments or benefits are not included in budgetary calculations forlegislative proposals. Among other revenue sources, projections of excise tax receipts have declined since August, partlyfor technical reasons. Those reasons include lowerprojections for aviation-related taxes in the wake ofthe September 11 terrorist attacks and some as-yet-unexplained reductions in ot her excise tax collections this year that are assumed to continue. Together, technical adjustments have a fairly consistent effect on revenue projections for 2002through 2010, reducing them by $32 b illion to $51 billion per year. The picture reverses in 2011, how-ever, when technical adju stments increase projected revenues by $4 billion because of the new interpreta-tion of how the expiration of EGTRRA will affectestate and gift taxes. Outlays . Technical changes since August have added $113 billion to CBO's 10-year projections ofspending. Other than an increase of $139 billion indebt-service costs (largely the result of CBO's newrevenue estimates), net technical changes lower pro-jected outlays for the 10-year period by $26 billion.That amount represents a $27 billion increase in dis-138 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 cretionary outlays outweighed by a $54 billion de- cline in mandatory spending. Among mandatory programs, technical reesti- mates have lowered projected spending for someprograms and raised it for others. Medicare saw thelargest technical revision to projected outlays\u2014a to-tal reduction of $96 billion for the 2002-2011 period.About one-third of that change reflects the fact thatspending in 2001 was higher than anticipated for rel-atively slow-growing categories of Medicare services(such as hospital inpatient services) and lower thanexpected for relatively fast-growing categories (suchas services furnished by hospitals' outpatient depart-ments and other facilities). The other two-thirds ofthe change results from an ongoing review of CBO'sprojections of Medicare enrollment. CBO reducedthose projections to make them more consistent withits projections of the population eligible for SocialSecurity and with the Medicare trustees' projectionsof total enrollment in the program. Projected spending for Medicaid was also sub- ject to technical revisions, which increased 10-yearoutlays by $30 billi on. A shift of eligible Medicaid recipients to the State Children's Health InsuranceProgram is expected to lower Medicaid costs duringthe 2002-2011 period. But that reduction is projectedto be more than offset by significant growth in the cost of prescription drugs. Since August, CBO has also made technical re- estimates of Social Security expenditures over thenext 10 years, raising them by a total of $38 billion.Virtually all of that increase occurs in the second halfof the projection period. It reflects changes in pro-jected enrollment (in part because of new populationprojections) as well as changes in the calculation ofaverage benefits that are unrelated to changes in theeconomic forecast. Outlays for unemployment insurance are pro- jected to be $21 billion higher during the 2002-2011period than in CBO's August baseline because of re-estimates of two factors: the number of unem-ployed people who will qualify and file for unem- ployment benefits and the length of time that theywill receive benefits. CBO has changed its projections for the Univer- sal Service Fund account\u2014which subsidizes telecom-munications service in underserved or high-cost areas\u2014to reflect new estimates for state universal servicefunds. In contrast to its previous assumptions, CBOnow expects that the activities of state funds will notbe reflected in the federal budget because those activ-ities are not likely to be the result of existing federallaw. That change lowers projected outlays over the10-year period by $60 billion. However, b ecause it also reduces projected revenues by roughly the sameamount, the effect on the surplus is negligible. Since the previous baseline, CBO has also low- ered its projection of credit subsidies for FCC loansrelated to recent auctions of spectrum licenses. Al- though CBO's estimate of th e amount of receipts that the FCC will collect from those auctions has notchanged since August, the Administration recorded achange (credit reestimate) of about $12 billion in out-lays in September to reflect its judgment about thepossible outcome of legal proceedings (see Box B-1).To maintain its previous es timate of the total subsidy cost that will eventually be realized, CBO had to ad-just its projection of future subsidy reestimates down-ward by about $13 billion. The year-to-year differ-ences shown in Table B-1 also reflect changes in theexpected timing of future auctions of spectrum li- censes. Technical adjustments to projections of net in- terest spending largely reflect new Treasury data onthe stock of outstanding federal debt and revisions toCBO's assumptions about the future composition andgrowth of debt. Those adjustments increase pro-jected net interest outlays over 10 years by $64 bil-lion relative to the August baseline. In addition, in-terest payments on the debt resulting from CBO'svarious technical reestimates since August total $139billion over the 2002-2011 period. Appendix C Budget Resolution Targets and Actual Outcomes Budget resolution targets, adopted by both Houses of Congress in most years, specifyproposed levels of revenues and spending for the upcoming fiscal year. Those targets in the 2001concurrent budget resolution, adopted in April 2000,yielded a proposed budget surplus of $170 b illion. However, the actual surplu s for fiscal year 2001 turned out to be significantly lower than the budgetresolution anticipated. This document analyzes the differences between the resolution's targets and the actual outcomes forthe year. In 2001, actual revenues were $1,991 bil-lion, almost $14 billion lower than expected for theyear. The effects of legislation reduced revenues forthat year by substantially more than anticipated; how-ever, some of that reduction was offset by the effects of economic and technical factors. Total outlays, at$1,864 billi on, ended up higher than anticipated by $29 billion\u2014primarily because of legislation that wasnot included in the Congress's original plans. Theactual surplus, then, for fiscal year 2001 was $127billion, almost $43 billion less than the budget reso-lution anticipated. Elements of the Analysis The budget resolution is a concurrent resolutionadopted by both Houses of Congress that sets forththe Congressional budget plan over five or more fis-cal years. The resolution consists of targets for reve-nues, spending, the surplus or deficit, and debt heldby the public. The budget resolution does not be- come law; instead, it is implemented through subse-quent legislation, includi ng appropriation acts and changes in the laws that affect revenues and spend-ing, which are sometimes in response to reconcilia-tion instructions that are included in the resolution.The targets established in the budget resolution aregenerally enforced through procedural mechanismsset out in the Congressional Budget and Impound-ment Control Act of 1974. For this analysis, the differences between the levels specified in the budget resolution and the ac-tual outcomes are allocated among three categories:policy, economic, and techni cal. Although those cat- egories help explain the discrepancies, the divisionsare inexact and necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Differences attributed to policy derive from en- acted legislation not antic ipated in the resolution (such as legislation providing aid to victims of natu-ral disasters) or legislation that cost more (or less)than the resolution assumed. Differences attributedto policy may also reflect lawmakers' failure to enactlegislation that the budget resolution assumed wouldpass. To identify such diffe rences arising from Congressional B udget Office (CBO) nor- mally uses the cost estimates it made at the time thelegislation was enacted. (To the extent that the actualbudgetary impact differs from what CBO estimated,that difference is implicitly characterized as a techni-cal change.) A key element in preparing the budget resolu- tion is forecasting how the economy will perform in140 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 the upcoming fiscal year. Usually, for its resolution, the Congress adopts the most recent economic as-sumptions published by CBO. In 1982, and in mostyears between 1988 and 1992, it chose to use a differ-ent forecast (generally, the Administration's, pub-lished by the Office of Management and Budget). The forecast for the budget resolution is usually made more than nine months before the fiscal yearbegins. Forecasting the economy is always an uncer-tain business, and almost invariably, the economy'sactual performance differs from the forecast. Never-theless, every resolution is based on the forecast'sassumptions about numerous economic variables\u2014mainly, gross domestic product (GDP), taxable in-come, unemployment, inflation, and interest rates.Those assumptions are used to estimate revenues,spending for benefit programs, and net interest. InCBO's analysis, differences that can be directlylinked to its economic forecast are labeled economic.Other differences that might be tied to economic per-formance, such as changes to estimates of capitalgains realizations or distributions from retirementplans, are categorized as technical.In analyzing the deviation between budget reso- lution targets and outcomes, CBO cumulates differ-ences that arise from changes in its economic forecastsince the time that the resolution was completed. ButCBO does not subsequently adjust that calculation,even though revisions to data about GDP and taxableincome continue to trickle in over a number of years. Technical differences between the budget reso- lution targets and outcomes are those variations thatdo not arise directly from legislative or economicsources as initially categorized. The largest dollarimpacts of technical differe nces are concentrated in two areas: on the revenue side of the budget, andamong the government's open-ended commitments,such as entitlement programs. In the case of reve-nues, technical differences stem from various factors, including changes in administrative tax rules, differ-ences in sources of taxable income that are not cap-tured by the economic forecast, and changes in therelative amounts of income taxed at the various in-come tax rates. In the case of entitlement programs,factors such as changes in the number of beneficia-ries, unforeseen utilization of health care services,changes in farm prices, or new regulations can pro-duce technical differences.

Includes offsetting receipts. Comparing the Budget Resolution and ActualOutcomes for Fiscal Year 2001 The budget resolution adopted the economic assump- tions that CBO published in January 2000. Usingthose assumptions and incorporating policy changes,the resolution established the following targets forthe year: total revenues of $2,005 b illion, outlays of $1,835 billion, and a surplus of $170 billion (seeTable C-1). Ultimately, revenues were lower by $14billion, and outlays were higher by $29 billion, re-sulting in a surplus that was $43 billion lower than was anticipated in the resolution. Policy changesdiminished the surplus by an estimated $95 billion,but that amount was partially offset by differencesarising from economic and technical factors, whichadded a total of $52 billion to the surplus (see TableC-2).Differences Arising from Policy Changes The major policy change that affected the surplus in 2001 was the tax cut signed by the President in June2001 (which was actually provided for in the 2002budget resolution). 1 The budget resolution for 2001 incorporated a tax cut that would reduce revenues byabout $12 billion that year. The Joint Committee onTaxation estimated that the total cost of the Eco-nomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of2001 (Public Law 107-16) would be much larger\u2014roughly $74 billion for 2001. Of that am ount, the major components were the advance refund checksmailed to all taxpayers who filed returns for tax year2000, which totaled about $40 billion, and the shift of 1. The 2002 budget resolution, adopted on May 10, 2001, revised the targets for fiscal year 2001. It increased the targets for revenues to$2,135 billion and for outlays to $1,948 billion; thus, the expectedsurplus climbed to $186 billion\u2014$15 billion higher than was antic-ipated in the 2001 resolution. 142 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 corporate tax receipts\u2014about $33 billion in pay- ments\u2014from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002. Discretionary outlays were $20 billion higher than anticipated in the resolution, mostly because appropriations for 2001 were more than $40 billiongreater than specified in the resolution. Mandatoryspending was also higher than the original estimate,primarily as a result of aid to farmers. Differences Arising from Economic Factors Overall, the economic assumptions underlying the 2001 budget resolution proved to be pessimistic. Inparticular, because of economic factors, revenuesturned out to be $25 billion higher than presumed.Much of that difference can be traced to estimates ofnominal GDP in 2000, which had implications forrevenues in 2001. The resolution assumed that GDPwould grow by 5.1 percent in 2000, but its actual rateof growth was 6.7 percent. Despite the recession thatbegan in March 2001, the level of nominal GDP infiscal year 2001 remained above what was antici-pated by the resolution. Cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) accounted for most of the $8 billion in additional mandatoryspending that was attributable to economic factors.The budget resolution assumed a COLA of 2.4 per-cent for January 2001; the act ual COLA turned out to be 3.5 percent. As a result, Social Security and otherbenefit payments that are pegged to inflation werehigher than originally estimated. In addition, the un-employment rate rose beyond what was expected,particularly in the latter part of the year, increasingclaims for unemployment benefits by nearly $2 bil-lion. Discretionary spending differed only slightlyfrom the expected amount because of economic fac-tors. Reflecting another difference linked to the eco- nomic forecast, net interest was $12 b illion lower than the budget resolution anticipated, mostly be-cause of lower interest ra tes. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates several times in 2001, whichled to lower interest costs on the federal debt. Thebudget resolution assumed that the average rates in2001 on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Trea-sury notes would be 5.6 percent and 6.4 percent, re- spectively. Those rates actually averaged 4.4 percentand 5.2 percent, respectively. Differences Arising from Technical Factors Differences arising from technical factors\u2014that is, differences between budget resolution targets andactual outcomes that cannot be traced to legislationor CBO's economic forecast\u2014are mostly found onthe revenue side of the budget. Technical factorsaccounted for about $26 billion in additional reve-nues but only a minimal amount of the increase inoutlays. Much of the additional revenues was attrib-utable to unexpectedly high individual income taxreceipts stemming from growth in realizations of cap-ital gains and unforeseen increases in effective taxrates. Comparing Budget Resolutions and ActualOutcomes for Fiscal Years1980 Through 2001 Actual outcomes always differ to varying degrees from budget resolution targets. Over the 1980-1992period, the deficit consistently exceeded the target inthe resolution by amounts ranging from $4 billion in1984 to $119 billion in 1990 (see Table C-3). Thatpattern changed in 1993, in part because spending fordeposit insurance was substa ntially lower than ex- pected. From 1994 through 2000, actual outcomescontinued to be more favorable than the targets (withthe exception of 1999, when there was no conferenceagreement on a budget resolution). However, in2001, lower-than-expected revenues and higher-than-anticipated outlays combined to reduce the surplus to less than was envisioned in the resolution. Over theentire 1980-2001 period, the differences netted out;that is, the total of the actual surpluses and deficitsalmost exactly matched the total of the surpluses anddeficits in the budget resolutions.APPENDIX C BUDGET RESOLUTION TARGETS AND ACTUAL OUTCOMES 143 Differences Arising from Policy Changes From 1980 through 2001, policy action or inaction (for example, the failure to achieve savings called forin a budget resolution) decreased the surplus or in-creased the deficit by an average of $16 billion a yearcompared with the target. In only four of those yearsdid policymakers trim the deficit by more, or add to itby less, than the resolution provided. The largestdifferences attributable to policy changes occurred in 2000 and 2001, when they decreased the surplus by$61 billion and $95 billion, respectively, in compari-son to the targets. From 1980 through 1998, the dif-ferences ascribed to policy averaged less than $10billion a year. Most of the impact stemming from legislation over the period was on the outlay side of the budget.On average, policy decisions added about $14 billiona year to the spending totals. In fact, 1988 and 1991were the only years in which legislative action re-duced outlays below the resolution's targets. By farthe biggest difference was in 2000, when the effectsof legislation increased outlays by about $65 billion.On the revenue side of the budget, the largest differ-ence arising from a policy change occurred in 2001,when legislation reduced taxes by $65 billion morethan was anticipated by the resolution. Differences Arising from Economic Factors Overall, inaccuracies in the economic forecast over the 1980-2001 period have had a negligible net effecton the variations between targets and actual out-comes for surpluses or deficits. But the average,however, masks large differences in many years\u2014deviations that were mostly negative before 1994 andpositive more recently. Until 1993, budget resolu-tions tended to use short-term economic assumptionsthat proved optimistic. The largest overestimates inthe 1980s and early 1990s, not surprisingly, were inyears marked by recession or the early stages ofrecovery\u2014namely, in 1982 and 1983 and in the1990-1992 period. Since 1993, that pattern haslargely been reversed. Short-term economic assump-tions in 1993 through 2001 for the most part turned out to be pessimistic. In absolute terms (disre garding whether the er- rors were positive or negative), the typical differencein the surplus or deficit a ttributable to incorrect eco- nomic assumptions was about $29 billion a year overthe 1980-2001 period. Regardless of the direction ofthe error in the forecast, di fferences between the reso- lution's assumptions and what actually happened inthe economy primarily affected revenues and net in-terest. Differences Arising from Technical Factors Technical factors accounted for differences between budget resolution targets and actual surpluses or defi-cits that averaged $16 billion a year during the pasttwo decades. In absolute terms, however, such dif-ferences caused the targets to be off by $35 billion,on average. Overall, about two-thirds of those mis-estimates have been on the outlay side of the budget. The magnitude and causes of the differences ascribed to technical factors have varied over theyears. On the revenue side, technical misestimateswere generally not very great through 1990, but thebudget resolutions significantly overestimated reve-nues in 1991 and 1992, when tax collections wereweaker than economic data had predicted. Over thepast few years, revenues have been much higher thanthe budget resolution targets. The individual incometax has been the source of most of the technical dis-crepancies, primarily because of higher realizationsof capital gains, unexpected increases in the effective tax rate, and higher reported incomes. Greater real-izations of capital gains most likely stemmed fromupturns in the prices of stocks and in the volume ofstock transactions. The unexpected rise in the effec-tive tax rate was largely due to a disproportionateincrease in income among taxpayers taxed at thehighest marginal rates. Al so contributing to the inac- curacy in estimating individual income tax receiptswere underestimates of reported incomes that wererevised too late for CBO to incorporate in its fore-casts.144 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table C-3.

Through the mid-1980s, discrepanciesin estimating receipts from offshore oil leases andspending on farm price supports, defense, and entitle-ment programs constituted the dominant technicaldifferences. In addition, in the early 1990s, duringthe savings and loan crisis, outlays for deposit insur-ance were a major source of discrepancies attribut-able to technical factors. In recent years, technicaldifferences between estimates of outlays and actualoutlays have been spread among a variety of pro-grams. In addition, those differences were quitesmall in 2000 and 2001 (within $10 b illion and near zero, respectively). Differences as a Percentage of Actual Revenues or Outlays Because the fede ral budget ha s grown considerably since 1980, differences between the revenue andspending levels in the budget resolutions and actualoutcomes over the 1980-2001 period may be bestcompared as a percentage of total revenues or out-lays. The total difference for revenues for 2001 waswell below the absolute average of 3.8 percent; theamount anticipated in the budget resolution camewithin 0.7 percent of actual revenues. By contrast, revenues exceeded the budget resolution target bymore than 7 percent in 2000. Outlays in 2001 were1.6 percent above the budget resolution target but be-low the 3.2 percent absolute average difference forthe 1980-2001 period. Differences between outlaytargets and actual outcomes ranged from a high of 8.1percent in 1980 to a low of 0.4 percent in 1995. The size of the total difference between actual surpluses or deficits and the surpluses or deficits an-ticipated in budget resolutions depends in large parton whether the differences for revenues and outlaysoffset each other. For years in which the discrepan-cies for revenues and outlays affected the surplus ordeficit in opposite ways, the total difference droppedto as little as 0.5 percent of actual outlays. But inother years in which the discrepancies for both reve-nues and outlays affected the surplus or deficit in thesame way, the total difference was as much as 11.4percent of outlays. Indeed, from 1980 to 2001, the differences between estimates of revenues and out-lays in the budget resolutions and the actual amountswent in the same direction relative to the surplus ordeficit in 12 years. In 2001, the actual surplus wasbelow the resolution target by an amount equal to 2.3percent of actual outlays\u2014lower than the absoluteaverage difference of 4.8 percent over the 21-yearperiod.Appendix D The Federal Sector of the National Income and Product Accounts The federal budget is not the only mechanism available for gauging the effect on the econ-omy of the federal government's revenues and spending. That effect is al so measured in the official national income and product accounts (NIPAs) pro-duced by the Department of Commerce's Bureau ofEconomic Analysis (BEA). The NIPAs provide apicture of government activity in terms of production,distribution, and use of out put. They recast the gov- ernment's transactions into categories that affectgross domestic product (GDP), income, and othermacroeconomic totals, thereby helping to trace therelationship between the federal sector and other ar-eas of the economy. Relationship Between the Budget and the NIPAs A number of major differences distinguish how fed- eral receipts and expenditures are treated in theNIPAs from how they are acc ounted for in the total (or unified) budget. For example, the NIPAs shiftcertain items from the spending to the receipts side ofthe ledger to reflect intrabudgetary or voluntary pay-ments that the budget records as negative outlays.Such shifts are referred to as netting and grossing adjustments and do not affect the surplus or deficit (see Table D-1). In contrast, other differences between the two accounting methodologies do affect the surplus ordeficit that each reports. The NIPAs' totals (but not the budget's) exclude government transactions thattransfer existing assets and liabilities and that there-fore do not add to or subtract from current incomeand production. Prominent among such lending and financial adjustments, as they are termed in Table D-1, are those for deposit insurance outlays, cashflows from direct loans made by the government be-fore credit reform, and sales of government assets.Other factors that separate the NIPAs' accountingfrom that of the budget include geographic adjust- ments (the NIPAs exclude Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and a few other areas) and timing adjust- ments (the NIPAs correct for such things as irregular numbers of benefit checks in a year or shifts in thetiming of corporate tax payments). In the national economic accounts, contribu- tions for government employee retirement are consid- ered the personal income of federal workers coveredby the retirement funds. Therefore, in the NIPAs,outlays from the funds are treated as transactions out-side the government sector of the economy. In thebudget, those contributions ar e classified as govern- ment receipts. Intragovernmental transfers are an adjustment made to the NIPA totals to account for payments thatthe government makes to federal entities whose ac-tivities are not counted as part of the budget. Nearlyall such transfers involve the financing of credit pro-grams. The government's capital transfers \u2014which in- clude grants to state and local governments for high-148 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table D-1.

Those transactions are linked to,or are conditional on, acquiring or disposing of anasset. Because such trans actions shift existing assets from one party to another, they do not affect dispos-able income or production in the current period.Therefore, they are not counted in the NIPAs. The NIPAs and the budget also differ in their treatment of investm ent and depreciation . The bud- get reflects all expenditures that the federal govern-ment makes, including its investment purchases ofitems such as buildings and aircraft carriers. TheNIPAs show the current, or operating, account for thefederal government; thus, they exclude government investment and include the government's consump- tion of fixed capital, or depreciation. (Government investment, although include d in the NIPAs' calcula- tion of GDP, is not part of its measure of federal ex-penditures.) The Universal Service Fund , which is adminis- tered by a nonprofit entity, receives funds from pro-viders of telecommunications service and disbursesthose funds to providers that serve high-cost areas,low-income households, libraries, and schools, aswell as to rural health care pr oviders. As a result, the fund's receipts and payments are classified in the NIPAs as intracorporate tr ansfers and do not show up in the national economic statistics.150 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 The Government's Receipts and Expenditures asMeasured by the NIPAs The federal sector of the NIPAs generally classifies receipts according to their source (see Table D-2).Taxes and fees paid by individuals are the leadingsource of the government's receipts in the 2002-2012period. The next category in terms of size is contri-butions (including premiums) for social insuranceprograms such as Social Security, Medicare, unem-ployment insurance, and federal employees' retire-ment. The remaining categories of receipts are accru-als of taxes on corporate profits, including the earn- ings of the Federal Reserve System, and indirectbusiness tax and nontax accruals. (Examples of in-direct business taxes are customs duties and excisetaxes. Nontax accruals include deposit insurancepremiums.) The government's expenditures are classified according to their purpose and destination. Defenseand nondefense consumption of goods and servicesrepresents purchases made by the government forimmediate use. The largest share of current defenseand nondefense consumption is the compensation offederal employees. The consumption of fixed capitalis the use that the government receives from its fixedassets, such as buildings or equipment; as noted ear-lier, that consumption appears in the accounts as de-preciation. Transfer payments are cash payments made di- rectly to individuals, private entities, or foreign na-tions. Grants-in-aid are payments that the federalgovernment makes to state or local governments,which generally use them for transfers (such as pay-ing Medicaid benefits) or consumption (such as hir-ing additional police officers).Although both the total budget and the NIPAs contain a category labeled \"net interest,\" the NIPAs'figure is larger. Various differences cause the twomeasures to diverge. The biggest difference is thecontrasting treatment of the interest received by theCivil Service and Military Retirement Trust Funds.In the total budget, such receipts offset the paymentsmade to those funds by the Treasury. In the NIPAs,however, those receipts are reclassified as contribu- tions to personal income and do not appear on theledger detailing the government's transactions. The category in the NIPAs labeled \"subsidies less current surplus of government enterprises\" con-tains two components, as its name suggests. Thefirst\u2014subsidies\u2014is defined as grants paid by the fed-eral government to businesses, including state andlocal government enterprises. Subsidies are domi-nated by housing assistance. The second part of the category is the current surplus of government enterprises, which are certainbusiness-type operations of the government, such asthe Postal Service. The operating costs of a govern-ment enterprise are mostly covered by the sale ofgoods and services to the public rather than by tax re-ceipts. The difference between sales and current op-erating expenses is the ente rprise's surplus or deficit. (Government enterprises should not be confused with government-sponsored enterprises , or GSEs, which are private entities established and chartered by thefederal government to perform specific financialfunctions, usually under the supervision of a govern-ment agency. Examples of GSEs include Fannie Mae and the Farm Credit System. As privately owned,though publicly chartered, corporations, GSEs are notincluded in the budget or in the federal sector of theNIPAs.)APPENDIX D THE FEDERAL SECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS 151 Table D-2.

Datafor 2001 come from the Department of the Treasury,Final Monthly Trea sury Statement (October 2001) and from the Office of Management and Budget. Federal revenues, outlays, the surplus or deficit, and debt held by the public are shown in Tables F-1and F-2. Revenues, outlays, and the surplus or deficithave both on-budget and off-budget components.Social Security's receipts and outlays were placedoff-budget by the Balanced Budget and EmergencyDeficit Control Act of 1985; the Postal Service was moved off-budget four years later by the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1989. The major sources of federal revenues (includ- ing off-budget revenues) are presented in Tables F-3and F-4. Social insurance taxes include payments byemployers and employees for Social Security, Medi-care, Railroad Retirement, and unemployment insur-ance, as well as pension contributions by federalworkers. Excise taxes are levied on certain productsand services, such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages,and air travel. Miscellaneous receipts consist of de-posits of earnings by the Federal Reserve System andnumerous fees and charges. Total outlays for major spending categories are shown in Tables F-5 and F-6. (Those totals includeon- and off-budget outlays.) To compare historicaloutlays with the projections in Chapters 1, 3, and 4,historical data have been divided into the same cate-gories of spending as the projections. Spending con- trolled by the appropriation process is classified asdiscretionary. Tables F-7 and F-8 divide discretion- ary spending into its defense, international, and do-mestic components. Entitlements and other manda-tory spending include programs whose spending isgoverned by laws that set requirements for eligibility.Additional detail on entitlement programs is shownin Tables F-9 and F-10. Net interest is identical tothe budget function of the same name (function 900).Offsetting receipts include the federal government'scontributions to retirement programs for its employ-ees, various fees, charges such as Medicare premi-ums, and receipts from the use of federally controlledland and offshore territory. Estimates of the standardized-budget surplus or deficit and its revenue and outlay components forfiscal years 1960 through 2001 are reported in TablesF-11 through F-13, along with estimates of potentialand actual GDP and the nonaccelerating inflation rateof unemployment (NAIRU). The standardized-bud-get measure and its components are also shown as apercentage of potential GDP. The change in the standardized-budget surplus or deficit is a commonly used measure of the short-term impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand.The standardized-budget deficit (also called the struc-tural deficit) excludes the effects that cyclical fluctu-ations in output and unemployment have on revenuesand outlays; it also includes other adjustments. His-torical estimates for standardized-budget revenues,outlays, and the surplus or deficit have been revised. Finally, for additional historical perspective, Figure F-1 shows how debt held by the public hasbeen affected by wars and recessions since 1790.158 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Table F-1.

Federal Debt Held by the Public as a Percentage of Gross National Product, 1790-2000 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTE: This figure compares debt with gross national product rather than the more familiar gross domestic product because GNP is the measure used in the historical data. GNP measures the total income of all U.S. residents (including net payments for capital and labor income earned in other countries) . GDP measures the income produced on U.S. soil. The difference between the two was about $10 billion in 1999.Appendix G Major Contributors to the Revenue and Spending Projections The following Congressional Budget Office analysts prepared the revenue and spending projections in this report: Revenue Projections Mark Booth Revenue forecasting Paul Burnham PensionsBarbara Edwards Individual income taxesPam Greene Estate and gift taxesEd Harris Social insurance taxesCarolyn Lynch Corporate income taxes, Federal Reserve System earningsLarry Ozanne Capital gains realizationsAndrew Shaw Excise taxesDavid Weiner Revenue modelingErin Whitaker Customs duties, miscellaneous receipts Spending Projections Defense, International Affairs, and Veterans' AffairsJo Ann Vines Unit Chief Kent Christensen DefenseSunita D'Monte International affairs (conduct of foreign affairs and information exchange activities), veterans' housing Raymond Hall Defense (Navy weapons, missile defenses, atomic energy defense)Sarah Jennings Military retirement, veterans' educationSam Papenfuss Veterans' health care, military health careMichelle Patterson Defense (military personnel), veterans' compensation and pensionsMatthew Schmit Intelligence programs, energy employees' compensation, radiation exposure compensation Joseph Whitehill International affairs (devel opment, security, international financial institutions)174 THE BUDGET AND EC ONOMIC OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 2003-2012 January 2002 Health Thomas Bradley Unit Chief Alexis Ahlstrom Medicare, Public Health Service, Federal Employees Health Benefits programCharles Betley Medicare, Federal Em ployees Health Benefits program Niall Brennan Medicare, Public Health ServiceJulia Christensen Medicare, Public Health ServiceJeanne De Sa Medicaid, State Child ren's Health Insurance Program Eric Rollins Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance ProgramChristopher Topoleski Medicare, Public Health Service Human ResourcesPaul Cullinan Unit Chief Michael Carson Computer and research support Chad Chirico Housing assistanceSheila Dacey Child Support Enforcement, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Social Services Block Grant Geoff Gerhardt Federal civilian retirement, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Supplemental Security Income Deborah Kalcevic EducationKathy Ruffing Social SecurityChristina Hawley Sadoti Unemployment insurance, training programs, administration on aging, foster care Valerie Baxter Womer Food Stamps, child nutrition, child care, low-income home energy assistance Donna Wong Elementary and secondary education, Pell grants, child and family services, arts and humanities Natural and Physical ResourcesKim Cawley Unit Chief Megan Carroll Conservation and land managementLisa Cash Driskill Energy, Outer Continental Shelf receiptsMark Grabowicz Justice, Postal ServiceKathleen Gramp Spectrum auction receipts, energy, science, and spaceMark Hadley Deposit insurance, credit unions, air transportationGreg Hitz AgricultureDavid Hull AgricultureKen Johnson Commerce, Small Business Ad ministration, Universal Service Fund James Langley AgricultureSusanne Mehlman Pollution control and abatem ent, Federal Housing Administration and other housing credit programs Julie Middleton Water resources, Fede ral Emergency Management Agency Rachel Milberg Highways, Amtrak, mass transitMatthew Pickford General governmentDeborah Reis Recreation, water transportati on, community development, other natural resources, legislative branch Lanette Keith Walker Justice, regional deve lopment, Bureau of Indian AffairsAPPENDIX G MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE REVENUE AND SPENDING PROJECTIONS 175 Other Janet Airis Unit Chief, Scorekeeping Jeffrey Holland Unit Chief, ProjectionsDavid Sanders Unit Chief, Computer SupportEdward Blau Authorization billsBarry Blom National income and pr oduct accounts, monthly Treasury data Joanna Capps Appropriation bills (Agriculture, Interior)Sandy Davis Budget processAdaeze Enekwechi budget Hays Federal Appropriati on bills (VA- HUD, Treasury) Felix LoStracco Other interest, discretionary spendingVirginia Myers Appropriation bills (Commerce-Justice-State, foreign operations)Robert Sempsey Appropriation bills (Labor- HHS, Transportation, military construction) Amy Wendholt Appropriation bills (Defense, energy and water)Jina Yoon Net interest on the public debtThis paper and other CBO publications are "}
