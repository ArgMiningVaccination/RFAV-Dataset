Praise For... \"Traditional African Spirituality in itself is inherently rebellious--- a delicious roux, an okra gumbo for the beautiful black soul. Stephanie Rose Bird's emotionally liberating text champions the syncretism of diasporic healing motifs while enhancing the potency of eclectic African- centered folklore. As you travel the pages of this book you will begin to conjure change in your own life by any herb/bath/ root or oil at your disposal. You will triumphantly follow the cowrie shells back to the crossroads lined with deities happy to be both nappy and above all sun kissed.\" \u2014 Mawiyah Kai EL-Jamah Bomani, author of the plays Spring Chickens and Crows Feet \"The Healing Power of African American Spirituality by the illustrious Stephanie Rose Bird is a timely and much needed inclusive contribution to humanity's spiritual awakening and evolution at this time. Ms. Bird gives us richly textured, detailed descriptions and powerful histories about numerous, authentic African, African-American, and Caribbean spiritual traditions and holistic health cures for the mind, body and soul.

If you want to deepen and diversify your spiritual practice, you must add this book and Bird's other titles to your collection.\" \u2014 Ifeanyi C.
