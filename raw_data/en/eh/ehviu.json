Sunrise alarm clocks simulate a natural and gradual sunrise with a range of soft orange and yellow LED lights for a gentler wake-up. \"Sudden awakenings can lead to sudden changes in cortisol and other neurotransmitters that could cause problems,\" [W. Chris Winter](http://www.cvilleneuroandsleep.com), MD, of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine, said. \"Waking up with a gradual increase in wake-promoting light makes a lot of sense.\" Sunrise alarm clocks can reduce the effects of sleep inertia, that drowsy, disorienting feeling that many of us experience after abruptly waking up. In addition to consulting experts, I utilized my own experience in sleep science for this guide. I tested eight sunrise alarm clocks, using each for three consecutive days and nights to evaluate how effective, easy to use, and durable they are.

Best budget: Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light - [See at Amazon](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=df6b84e9ac6e44b586485337f65f2497994613c3ab142dc65c36b4d179347600&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0093162RM&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) The Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light has a unique spherical design that creates a beautiful sunrise simulation and features many of the same premium settings as the more expensive Philips SmartSleep Connected. Best for personalization: Hatch Restore 2 - [See at Hatch](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=38e7c732376ef2e8758e7e55aa506de54f0a022ed462671d16cb7f5c8e4f5206&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hatch.co%2Frestore-2%23shop&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) The Hatch Restore 2 has the most light options and sleep sounds of any model we tried, and they're all fully controlled through its multifunctional Hatch Sleep app. Best portable: Casper Glow Light - [See at Amazon](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=182b37f928c4086b7c8cbe05b07b324fd107d227e438f8edc18a365766c7c117&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCasper-Sleep-Glow-Light-Single%2Fdp%2FB0BB4PRNF3&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) The Casper Glow Light is uniquely designed as a wireless, portable night light and uses intuitive gestures and a streamlined design to create a beautiful and simple experience. Pros: Smartphone connected; allows you to customize duration, color, sound, and intensity of wake-up and wind-down programs; makes recommendations for improving sleep environment; can set up to 16 alarms Cons: Large, does not play music via Bluetooth, not a good option for those who prefer manual controls The [Philips SmartSleep Connected](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=1dfafa5e1e9667b53f26a7ad43168aa25c56c61c436f5ebca0358af39f864fac&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07GXWDXBD&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) is a relatively large sunrise lamp that resembles a glowing donut. It's controlled almost entirely from an app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleepmapper/id1258577276) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.src.hss&hl=en_US&gl=US)) that allows you to customize \"wind-down\" and \"wake-up\" profiles with your preferred sound, light intensity, and duration. I found it intuitive to use. The stunning sunset simulation was my favorite feature: The brightness gradually decreases from beautiful hues of bright yellows to soft reds over the course of five to 60 minutes. This is accompanied by your choice of four natural relaxing sounds (or FM radio) that fade away with the sunset. I've used the Philips SmartSleep Connected for months and love waking up to \"summer birds\" and an \"island red\" sunrise with warm red and orange lights distributed nicely throughout the bedroom. The combination made me feel like I was on vacation. The device tracks your sleep habits and lets you know if your bedroom is too hot, humid, bright, or loud for optimal sleep. Other features include guided meditations, a night light, backup battery, USB charging dock, an AUX cord to play music from your phone, and a reading light. Unfortunately, you can't connect via Bluetooth. All this customizability comes at around $200. Pros: Creates the best sunrise simulation, very user-friendly and simple, fully manual Cons: Very limited sound options, doesn't have an app if you're someone who prefers a connected device A less expensive option from Philips, the [SmartSleep Wake-Up Light](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=df6b84e9ac6e44b586485337f65f2497994613c3ab142dc65c36b4d179347600&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0093162RM&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) has fewer customizable options and features than the [Philips SmartSleep Connected](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=43e7e2e26d9d69c79395c100265e87277ddfed48e97424d70dbd351fd31fbe49&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07GXWDXBD&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) and is completely manual; no app needed. I recommend this one if you're looking for something simple but still high-quality and efficient. Its offers impressive colored sunrise simulations and relaxing sunsets for about half the price of our top pick. I had no problem setting the time and alarms with the easy-to-follow instructions. Falling asleep to this lamp was very relaxing; the sunset simulation therapy works just as well as the Philips SmartSleep Connected. The display automatically dims as the room gets darker, great for cocooning yourself in total darkness. Waking up with this lamp was such a pleasant experience. The gradual and natural sunrise simulation increased over the span of 30 minutes until it completely flooded my bedroom with beautiful, rich, orange-and-yellow lights and the gentle sounds of \"Nepal bowls.\" You can choose from five natural wake-up sounds, including \"birds\" and \"ocean waves,\" or your preferred FM radio station. The snooze feature is unique: A single slight tap anywhere on the device snoozes the lamp for nine minutes. It did a great job at waking me up and feeling refreshed in the morning. I prefer this Philips model's smooth, spherical shape and smaller size over the Philips SmartSleep Connected, although I wish it connected to the app for more customization. I missed the extra features in the [Philips SleepMapper app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleepmapper/id1258577276) when I used this model, like the sleep-environment monitoring and extended customization. I hope Philips comes out with a new sunrise alarm clock that features all of the Philips SmartSleep Connected options but is shaped like this model to simulate that beautiful, natural sunrise. [Read our full review of the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/philips-smart-sleep-wake-up-light-review). Pros: Many customization options, large buttons, sleep and rise options, bright display, can set multiple alarms Cons: Most functionality is through the app, doesn't play music, guided meditations only available with subscription, must be connected to WiFi to use, no clock dimming buttons on the device The Hatch Restore 2 is the latest version of the popular, customizable sunrise alarm clock. We liked the original [Hatch Restore](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/hatch-restore-sunrise-alarm-clock-review) because of the many light and sound options it offered. The latest model has some small improvements. It usually retails for around $200, about $70 more than the older model. The most noticeable difference is the \"sleep\" and \"rise\" buttons. You can tap either to start the programs you set up in the app ( [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hatch-sleep/id1158048301) and [ Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hatchbaby.rest&hl=en_US&gl=US)). Do a short press of either button to snooze. Hold down the button, and it shuts the routine off. The older model had a single button that was much smaller, which I had to fumble around for some mornings to turn the alarm off. While the original Restore had a single speaker, the newest one has three, helping fill out the sleep and wake sounds. The entire front is covered in a linen fabric, available in three colors (brown, cream, and gray). This gives the Restore 2 a more refined look and also helps diffuse the light a bit more than the original's plastic front. The half-oval shape is similar and mimics a sun rising over the horizon. In the app, you'll find sleep sounds ranging from pink noise to owl calls. You can set the duration and volume or have it run until you tap the clock's button. If you prefer to fall asleep to waves but want constant white noise while you sleep, you can set that up, too. For mornings, you can choose from 13 wake-up sounds and pick a lighting color and brightness level. You can select the duration of the alarm and when you want to set the device to start gradually brightening. You can get a fair amount of functionality from the clock without the subscription ($49.99 a year or $4.99 a month). But the unwind programs, which include meditations, music, and stories, aren't available unless you subscribe. Pros: Beautiful warm lights, portable, pairs with multiple Glow Lights for a bedroom light show, intuitive and easy to operate with simple gestures Cons: Lacks sound, requires smartphone app for expanded features like setting sleep and wake times [Casper Glow Light](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=776f697299d81a5ed12c67503a73409041052aaf85d0fca066015e796acc41a8&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fglow-light&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) is a small, portable cylinder that you control with just a few gestures: flip to turn on, rotate to adjust the light intensity, and wiggle to turn on the night light. The device is softly lit and smartly designed with gentle, warm hues for a better sleep experience. The light charges wirelessly and pairs with an intuitive app (available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1398999798) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.casper.nova)). While you can operate the light without it, the app is a must if you want to set wake-up and wind-down times, which cue a sunset or sunrise that can last from 15 to 90 minutes. One of the unique features of the [Glow Light](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=776f697299d81a5ed12c67503a73409041052aaf85d0fca066015e796acc41a8&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fglow-light&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) is that it synchronizes with other Glow Lights to make pretty light shows. Once you have more than one, you can name each and group or ungroup them through the app. I used two lights together and found they set a tranquil ambiance. This alarm clock can also be used as a portable night-light. This feature is useful when you want to find your way in the night without bright lights. It was fun to carry around when I needed a glass of water in the dark. It's made with polycarbonate to resist bumps and endure falls, so it's great for kids to use as well. Falling asleep with the Glow Lights was a treat. The soft, warm lights create a peaceful sleep environment, gradually dim to slowly relax you, and then turn completely off for total darkness. The [Casper Glow Lights](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=776f697299d81a5ed12c67503a73409041052aaf85d0fca066015e796acc41a8&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fglow-light&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) are made with high-quality warm LEDs that were effective in waking me up gently. However, the device focuses solely on effective light therapy, and, unlike other models we tested, there are no sound options. It might not be ideal for heavy sleepers who need noise to wake up; you'll still need to set a separate, audible alarm. A single light costs about $130. When looking for a sunrise alarm clock, there are certain features that might impact which model you choose to buy. Setup and ease of use: Setting up an alarm clock should be quick and intuitive. You should also be able to change the clock easily and adjust the volume and brightness without pulling out your phone. The snooze button should be large and easy to find. Also, most people don't want to have to remember to turn on their alarm clock every day, which is why we don't recommend the [Lumie Bodyclock Shine 300](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_072618_best-wake-up-light-alarm-clocks-20&h=4e1e4ce99a24dce5d135eb739c68ae404402349e2409654724ee199b88958095&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f41d04&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-wake-up-light-alarm-clock&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB082VB97H9&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false). Size: Since most people keep alarm clocks on their bedside tables, they shouldn't be overly large. But the display should still be clear and large. Light and sound options: Sunrise alarm clocks often use a combination of light and sound to help wake you up. There should be multiple options for sound and brightness that you can select on the device. If you use a [sound machine](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/best-sound-machine) to fall asleep, you might want to consider an alarm with fall-asleep routines that incorporate sleep sounds. Alarms: You should be able to set multiple alarms. Turning off the alarm should be simple so you don't need to hunt around for a button or switch first thing in the morning. If you don't want to disturb your partner, a [silent alarm clock](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/silent-alarm-clocks-2018-10) might be the best option for you. Battery backup: If your power goes out in the middle of the night, an alarm with a backup battery or the ability to stay on for a few hours without power can save you from being late. Smart features: Accompanying apps should enhance the use of the alarm, but the alarm should not have to rely on WiFi connectivity to work. Durability: Most people probably need an alarm clock that can withstand the occasional knock off the nightstand. In addition to interviewing sleep experts [Dr. Alex Dimitriu](https://siliconpsych.com/team/), founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry and Sleep Medicine, and [Dr. William Winter](http://www.cvilleneuroandsleep.com) of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine, I did hands-on testing with seven different sunrise alarm clocks. I previously managed a sleep laboratory for two years and continue to contribute to sleep research. I've presented some of my research at [Eastern Psychological Association](https://www.easternpsychological.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1) and have tested products for [SleepScore Labs](https://www.sleepscore.com). Part of my research involved investigating strategies to reduce sleep inertia (like using sunrise alarm clocks), so I also relied on my background in sleep research and product testing to evaluate each product over several nights. I evaluated each device based on ease of setup, performance, durability, special features, and usability over the course of several weeks or months. These clocks may help regulate cortisol and melatonin production, two important hormones for controlling sleep/wake cycles. The lights' \"wake-up\" cycles encourage the production of cortisol in the morning by simulating a natural and gradual sunrise. Sunrise alarms are pricey compared to traditional alarm clocks and phone apps. However, if you find yourself groggy most mornings, it might help you wake up more gradually. This depends on your needs. Sleep-mask wearers may not respond to light cues, while others have trained themselves to ignore the sounds of their alarm. Many sunrise alarms use both to \"help better prepare the body to wake up more gently with less startle,\" Dimitriu said. Light-based alarms may not work for everyone, said [Kelly Waters](https://findadoctor.spectrumhealth.org/physician/profile/3217), MD, a sleep specialist at Spectrum Health. \"If someone is sleep deprived or catching up on sleep or a deep sleeper, this may not be sufficient to wake them,\" she said. The key difference is that sunrise alarm clocks use gentle light and sound to help you wake up before resorting to the louder noises that are typical of a standard alarm clock. Sleep inertia is that drowsy feeling that occurs after you wake up. \"Gradual alarms (sound or light) are excellent solutions to wake people gradually,\" said Dimitriu, since these softer alarms offer a gentler, more natural wake-up experience.
