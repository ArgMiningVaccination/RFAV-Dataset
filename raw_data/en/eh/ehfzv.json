It highlights how countries differ in terms of the health status and health-seeking behaviour of their citizens; access to and quality of health care; and the resources available for health. Analysis is based on the latest comparable data across 80 indicators, with data coming from official national statistics, unless otherwise stated. Alongside indicator-by-indicator analysis, an overview chapter summarises the comparative performance of countries and major trends, including how much health spending is associated with staffing, access, quality and health outcomes. This edition also includes a special focus on patient-reported outcomes and experiences, with a thematic chapter on measuring what matters for people-centred health systems. [Clinical Handbook of This book examines in detail the clinical implications of those diseases that either are primarily triggered by air pollution or represent direct consequences of air pollutants. The aim is to provide medical practitioners with practical solutions to issues in diagnosis and treatment while simultaneously furnishing other interested parties with crucial information on the field. The book introduces the concept that air pollution-related diseases constitute a new class of pathologies. A wide range of conditions mainly attributable to air pollution are discussed, covering different body systems and pollution impacts in subsets of the population. In addition to presenting state of the art overviews of clinical aspects, the book carefully examines the implications of current knowledge for social and public health strategies aimed at disease prevention and prophylaxis. The Clinical Handbook of Air Pollution-Related Diseases will greatly assist doctors and healthcare workers when dealing with the consequences of air pollution in their everyday practice and will provide researchers, industry, and policymakers with valuable facts and insights. [Economics and Management in the Biopharmaceutical Industry in the USA by Rachel Kim](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/europarl.europa.eu?url=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Feuroparl%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D5607522) ISBN: 9781138500273 Publication Date: 2018-12-03 From a managerial biopharmaceutical industry represents a competitive, fast-changing, intellectually-powered, innovation-driven sector. Many management scholars have studied this discontinuous era to make sense of strategic behavior and the cognition of firms and top managers. A past look at the biopharmaceutical industry provides answers to questions that most managers have. For example, what options do you have and what actions do you take when new firms enter your industry? In the 1970s, new biotechnology firms, funded by venture capitalists, appeared in the pharmaceutical industry with new knowledge. Successful pharmaceutical firms decided to collaborate with the new entrants and forge relationships to develop and create new, biotechnology engineered drugs. Thus, the addition of new biotechnology firms ushered in a new business model based on strategic alliances. Strategic alliances have now become an industrial norm called open innovation. The author looks at the historical path of the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly in the United States. While the pharmaceutical industry's main contributions to society are substantial, there are pressing challenges the industry must face, such as an increase in infectious disease outbreaks or the global aging population, which require new types of care, additionally, mental health care and prescription painkiller addiction are persistent issues with economic repercussions to both federal and local governments. This book presents a holistic view of the biopharmaceutical industry, putting it in a historical context. It will best serve those who are eager to learn about this dynamic, fast-evolving industry and who would like to tackle current biopharmaceutical industry issues in the United States and be prepared for future industry challenges.

Americans pay lots of money in hopes of maintaining their health. So why are Americans so unhealthy? The reason is simple: as a country, the United States overinvests in medical care at the expense of the social, economic, and cultural forces that produce health. The rise of medicine as a cornerstone of American life and culture has coincided with a social and political devaluation of factors demonstrated to mean more to our vitality than anything else -- influences like where we live, work, and play; livable wages that create opportunity for healthy living; and gender and racial equity. In Pained, physicians Michael Stein and Sandro Galea push the conversation around American health where it belongs: toward matters of class, money, and culture. Across more than 50 essays and data illustrations, Pained casts a light on how the structural components of everyday life -- like school, housing, police, even cell phones -- ultimately determine who gets to be healthy in today's America. In doing so, it makes a case for reframing our political discourse in less myopic, more effectual terms. Accessible and surprising, political but not partisan, Pained is the urgent, uncomfortable conversation that American needs in this challenging moment. It will delight and infuriate readers of all political stripes.

From the Author: \"As a clinical nutritionist, I have been involved in the use of cannabis since 1981 while researching diabetes in India. Ayurvedic medicine listed cannabis as a beneficial herb with curing properties. In 1983, a Chinese medicine doctor in the Peoples Republic of China gave me a cannabis herbal supplement for sleep that he claimed Chairman Mao took regularly. Upon returning to the United States, no one would even talk to me about cannabis because of its Schedule I status. During an Antioxidants class taught for Everglades University, I included information on cannabis, but was restricted from including it in the course description. Cannabis: A Clinician\u00bfs Guide unveils deceit on this herbal medicine used for thousands of years providing insight into the science behind its use and how to incorporate cannabis into daily life, especially for those suffering from neurological disorders, cancer, and "}
