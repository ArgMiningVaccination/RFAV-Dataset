Yet, by the late 1940s, interest in homeopathy had waned. Today there is a resurgence of homeopathy as more and more Americans turn to alternative and complementary therapies for their health care needs. \"Many people would rather go with alternative approaches to stay healthy, and when they get sick use something that is more compatible with the way the body works. That is how people think about homeopathy, and that is the philosophy behind it. It works with the body's natural defense mechanism,\" says Cindy Griffin, DIHom, FBIH, a homeopath in Houston. To cure an illness, a person is given a homeopathic remedy that mirrors the symptoms of that illness. For example, someone with the flu who is experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, chills, and clammy sweats would be given a homeopathic arsenic preparation because it produces the exact same symptoms in a healthy person. The quantity of a substance, such as arsenic, in a homeopathic medicine is so small that any toxic effects are rendered harmless. Homeopathic medicines are made from plants such as dandelion, minerals such as arsenic oxide, animal products such as snake venom, and chemical drugs such as penicillin. They are produced by homeopathic pharmacies in accordance with guidelines from the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which is recognized by the FDA. A medicine is homeopathic only when it is taken based upon the similar nature of the medicine to the symptoms. If these two don't match, the remedy won't work. Therefore, treatment is very individualistic. \"If two people come to me with the same diagnosis from a doctor, I may treat them totally different because of the way the disease manifests. That's the way homeopathy works,\" says Griffin. People who use homeopathy must understand that it is important for a homeopathic practitioner to learn as much about their condition as possible. During the first visit, the client undergoes a two-hour interview. Learning to complete a proper assessment is part of the training homeopaths are given. They learn to examine a case in detail so they are able to treat the whole person, not just the disease. Information such as food cravings or aversions can prove relevant, says Griffin. With chronic problems, Griffin gives her clients homework. She asks them to write a time line of past traumas, because a trauma may cause a weakness either in an area of the body or emotionally. For example, someone who has had a lot of grief may suffer from depression. Reassessment is important throughout the treatment process. \"A remedy may work for a while, and then because the client is in the healing process their symptom picture changes, so you would need to go with a different remedy,\" explains Griffin. A remedy may be off the mark as well, especially when people use homeopathy for self-care. Most health food stores sell homeopathic remedies, but if the symptoms and remedy don't match accurately, the medicine won't work. Over-the-counter remedies often are a combination of things, but if the one remedy needed to heal the body is not present, it won't work. \"The idea is matching the symptoms to the remedies, and if you can't do that you are using a shotgun approach and it may not work. It is very safe, but if it doesn't work, call someone who has studied homeopathy and get some guidelines,\" advises Griffin. Anyone interested in using homeopathy for self-care should get involved in a study group. Such groups are taught by skilled homeopaths and are available throughout the United States. The National Center for Homeopathy in Alexandria, VA, can provide information on groups from beginner to advanced. This organization also has helpful booklets with basic information on self-care, says Griffin. (For contact information, see source box, above.) Just as a layperson needs to gain a little knowledge in order for self-care to be effective, the practitioner must be skilled as well. Unfortunately, many states haven't established a licensing process for homeopaths. The best way to know whether a homeopath is well-trained is to check his or her credentials. To make sure the practitioner has trained at a reputable school of homeopathy, check with the National Center for Homeopathy, advises Griffin. It is often difficult to offer scientific proof that homeopathy works because most of the treatments are very individualized, even for the same disease. However, there have been double-blind studies done on first aid-type remedies because they are very effective with a large number of people, such as remedies for swelling of tissue. (For examples of how to match a remedy with a condition, see box, above left.) \"When you get into the more complex health picture, it becomes far more individualized and you have to find more specific remedies,\" says Griffin.
