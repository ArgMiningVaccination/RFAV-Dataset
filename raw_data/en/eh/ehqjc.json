Pursuant to Section 1 of 2015 Senate Bill 2049, I am here to report interim study of statutory references to mental health professionals to determine whether changes in the law may help to more fully utilize these professionals within their scope of practice, as it relates to the responsibilities of the Department of Human Services to provide services or license facilities. In addition to the Department of Health and Department of Human Services , stakeholders included numerous professional boards and associations, including Counseling, Addiction Counseling, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Medicine, Nursing, Psycholo gy, Hospitals, Long Term Care, Health Insurance, Advocacy, and Higher Education. It should be noted, that there was significant cross - discipline licensure and training and majority approval of recommendations among participants. We met frequently by telec onference, reviewed each Administrative and Century Code reference to qualified mental health professional , mental health professional and mental health personnel . We categorized those areas and assigned stakeholder workgroups to review and give feedback and recommendations to the group at large. The specific statutes and language reviewed are listed, but for the purposes of brevity, I will simply highlight main areas, review points of discussion and recommended changes. One of the challenges in defining mental health professionals is determining core elements as function and delivering that service within scope of practice. Definition of the term is necessary, but not sufficient in specifying roles pertaining to each statutory function . Advanced Degree s (and, at times, certifications), clinical experience , the above scope, and independent clinical decision -making are all important elements. As such, there was debate among the stakeholders as to whether the primary focus should be on training, education as per a matrix (attached), or whether the focus should be on scope of practice and responsibility re garding impact on the individual , in the form of a tier description of the roles of mental health professionals : Tier 1 -Ultimate responsibility: greatest degree of broad -based, comprehensive training in multiple (all biopsychosocial) dimensions of psychiatric illness, with associated capacity to practice autonomously across those dimensions. Tier 1 manages highest level of responsibility and risk, though there are delineations specific to behavioral health (a+b) Tier 2 - Ability to direct care independently . Delineation between broad-based, comprehensive training in diagnosis and modalities of treatment for behavioral health conditions (a) vs. specific a rea of expertise (b). Breadth of training allows for oversight of care delivery within those fields. Tier 3 - Behavioral health therapy: clinical direction under supervision, or; enacting treatment plan with comprehensive training in specific dimensions of behavioral health. Within traditional non -mental health disciplines, certain behavioral health training allows for independent practice of care delivery in those dimensions, as well as execution of treatment plan. Tier 4 - Supporting clinical services: paraprofessional (direct care) service workers with some level of behavioral health training, but without formal licensing. Tier 4 to carry out treatment under the guidance of licensed professionals. **Tier 1 -3 behavioral health professionals ha ve independent licensing boards that identify and direct scope of work, ethics, discipline, etc. Clearly there are limits to a tier type model, as by design it is hierarchical. However, by utili zing such a model, all professionals who provide mental heal th services can be recognized as such within statute (a frequent concern of many groups.) Yet, at the same time a tier description allows for clarity of role and function. Despite the concerns of some stakeholders regarding the perception of a tier definition as \"rank of importance,\" the majority felt that within statute, the greater the risk to the individual (whether it be infringement on rights, clinical risk, etc .) the greater the scrutiny of scope and expertise of the mental health professional , particular to the statutory function . The following is a model: Tier 1) 1a: Psychiatrists/Psychologist (MD/DO, LP) 1b: Primary Care Providers (MD/DO/APRN/PA ) 2) Independent Clinicians a.) LICSW/LPCC Tier 3) LAPC, LCSW, LPC, LAMFT, OT, VR C, School Psychologists, Human Relation Counselors Tier 4) Direct Care Associates/Technicians MD=Medical Doctor, DO=Osteopathic physician, LP= Doctoral level Licensed Psychologist, APRN=Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, PA=P hysician Assistant, LICSW=Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker, LPCC=Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor , LMFT=Licensed Marriage and Family Counselor, LAC=Licensed Addiction Counselor, RN=Registered Nurse, LACP=Licensed Associate Professional C ounselor, LCSW= Licensed C ertified Social Worker , LPC=Licensed Professional Counselor, LAMFT= Licensed Associate Marriage and Family Therapist, OT=Occupational Therapist, VR C=Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor Mental Health Professional statute language is noted throughout in italicized bold The Chapters/Codes Reviewed: Stakeholder w orkgroup 1 focused on Mental Health Professional Definition related to Psychiatric Residential Treatment Centers for Children: CHAPTER 25 -03.2 RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTERS FOR CHILDREN Senate Bill No. 2047 eliminated the term \"Qualified Mental Health Professional\" from this chapter. Within, there is no longer a definition of Mental Health Professional. It held forth AN ACT to amend and reenact sections 25-03.2-01, 25-03.2-03, 25 -03.2-07, and 25 -03.2-10 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to psychiatric residential treatment facilities for children and rulemaking authority of the department of human services. The last legislative session required the Department of Human Services to adopt rules defining which professions may provide clinical supervision and review, and may develop, update, and sign an individual treatment plan within a psychiatric residential treatment facility for children. NDCC \u00a7 25-03.2-01. Definitions. In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: \"Individual treatment plan\" means a written plan of intervention, treatment, and services for a mentally ill person that is developed under the clinical supervision of a mental health professional on the basis of a diagnostic assessment. NDCC \u00a7 25-03.2-07. Method of providing service. A psychiatric residential treatment facility for children shall provide for the development of an individual treatment plan, based upon a co mprehensive interdisciplinary diagnostic assessment, which includes the role of the family, identifies the goals and objectives of the therapeutic activities and treatment, provides a schedule for accomplishing the therapeutic activities and treatment goals and objectives, and identifies the individuals responsible for providing services, consistent with the individual treatment plan, to children. Clinical supervision of the individual treatment plan must be accomplished as set forth by the department in ru les. Clinical supervision must be documented in individual treatment plans and by entries in the child's record regarding supervisory activity. NDCC \u00a7 25-03.2-10. Department may adopt rules. The department may adopt rules for the conduct of psychiatric re sidential treatment facilities for children and shall adopt rules defining which professionals may provide clinical supervision and review, and may develop, update, and sign an individual treatment plan within a psychiatric residential treatment facility for children. PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN NDAC CHAPTER 75 -03-17 \"Mental Health Professional\" has been removed, and the rule now reads \"Clinical supervision of the individual person -centered treatment plan must be accomp anied by full time or part -time employment of or contracts with a licensed physician who is a psychiatrist, a licensed psychologist, a licensed independent clinical social worker, or a nurse who holds advanced licensure in psychiatric nursing.\" This chapter had significant debate, with some individuals relating that LMFTs should be included in being allowed to direct treatment planning due to their broad individual and family systems training. Others countered that the training is more specific to tr eatment of couples and families within those systems, and not individual children and adolescents. As noted, our system places them in Tier 2 (b).

Again, the mission of our task was specific to how evaluating the term \"mental health professional\" might assist the Department of Human Services in its utilization of such professionals within service and licensure. We hope that with our stakeholder partners, we have accomplished this. Thank you, and I am available for any questions. "}
