No charges for COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccination for inpatients in secondary care Overseas visitors who are admitted and receiving secondary care in England, including anyone living in the UK without permission, will not be charged for: - testing for COVID-19 (even if the test shows they do not have COVID-19) - treatment for COVID-19, including for a related problem called multisystem inflammatory syndrome that affects some children - vaccination against COVID-19, including boosters No immigration checks are needed for overseas visitors if they are only tested, treated or vaccinated for COVID-19. Overseas visitors are still expected to pay for certain charges that the resident population pay (for example, dental or prescription charges), unless exempt from those charges. Charges for hospital treatment of secondary and subsequent illness While COVID-19 testing and treatment is exempt from charges for those admitted to secondary care in England, this exemption is not intended to cover hospital treatment of any secondary or subsequent illness. Secondary or subsequent illness refers to: - conditions or complications which arise from the initial COVID-19 infection, including long COVID - any co-existing conditions a patient may have These conditions remain chargeable, unless the individual is exempt. Under the charging regulations, the duty is on NHS trusts to assess, based on the views of clinicians, what treatment for COVID-19 is exempt or chargeable. Accessing COVID-19 vaccination without an NHS number Individuals do not require an NHS number or GP registration to receive the COVID-19 vaccination and should not be denied vaccination on this basis. Individuals who do not have an NHS number or are not registered with a GP are still entitled to free COVID-19 vaccinations. While [registration with a GP is encouraged to access the vaccine](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide), individuals can access walk-in vaccinations or request to book COVID-19 vaccination appointments as an unregistered patient through a local GP practice. Local outreach services are available in some areas to [provide COVID-19 vaccination to those who are eligible](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/who-can-get-the-vaccine/) but have difficulties accessing vaccination. If an individual has an NHS number, [they can find it through this online tool](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/find-nhs-number/).
