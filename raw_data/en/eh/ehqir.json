IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AT OCTOBER TERM, 2011 MARTINEZ v. RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART\u00ad MENT OF CORRECTIONS certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1001. Argued October 4, 2011\u2014Decided March 20, 2012 Arizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review. In petitioner Martinez's rst state collateral proceeding, his counsel did not raise such a claim. On federal habeas review with new counsel, Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial and in his rst state collateral proceeding. He also claimed that he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding because it was the rst place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial. The District Court denied the petition, nding that Arizona's preclusion rule was an adequate and independent state-law ground barring federal review, and that under Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, the attor\u00ad ney's errors in the postconviction proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afrmed. Held: 1. Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a proce\u00addural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. Pp. 8-17. 1 2 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Syllabus (a) Given that the precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on an ineffective- assistance-at-trial claim may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding, this is not the case to resolve the question left open in Coleman: whether a prisoner has a constitutional right to effective counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings. However, to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate ineffective-assistance claims, it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to Coleman's unqualied statement that an attorney's ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a pro\u00adcedural default, namely, that inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause. Pp. 8-9. (b) A federal court can hear Martinez's ineffective-assistance claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default and preju\u00addice from a violation of federal law. Coleman held that a postconviction attorney's negligence \"does not qualify as 'cause,' attor\u00adney is the prisoner's agent,\" and \"the principal bears the risk of\" his agent's negligent conduct, Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. 266, 280-281. However, in Coleman, counsel's alleged error was on appeal from an initial-review collateral proceeding. Thus, his claims had been ad\u00addressed by the state habeas trial court. This marks a key difference between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collateral pro\u00adceedings. Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding is the rst designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffective-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a prison\u00ader's direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas court decides the claim's merits, no other court has addressed the claim, and defend\u00adants \"are generally ill equipped to represent themselves\" where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion addressing their claim. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617. An attorney's errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the State's procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claim. Without adequate representation in an initial-review collat\u00aderal proceeding, a prisoner will have similar difculties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim. The same would be true if the State did not appoint an attorney for the initial-review col\u00adlateral proceeding. A prisoner's inability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular concern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle in this Nation's justice system. Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assist\u00ad ance at trial when an attorney's errors (or an attorney's absence) caused Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 3 Syllabus a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding acknowl\u00ad edges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been sufcient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim. It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such claim in two circum\u00adstances: where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been raised, was ineffective under Strick\u00ad land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-at\u00adtrial claim is substantial. Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance claims. It is likely that such attorneys are qualied to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional norms. And where that is so, States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings. Pp. 9-15. (c) This limited qualication to Coleman does not implicate stare decisis concerns. Coleman's holding remains true except as to initial- review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at trial. The holding in this case should not put a signicant strain on state resources. A State facing the question of cause for an apparent default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is in\u00adsubstantial. The limited circumstances recognized here also reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial. Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adversary system. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does not bar Mar\u00adtinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default. Pp. 15-17. 2. Whether Martinez's attorney in his rst collateral proceeding was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is sub\u00adstantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that remain open for a decision on remand. Pp. 17-18. 623 F. 3d 731, reversed and remanded. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

The State of Arizona does not permit a convicted person alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel to raise that claim on direct review. Instead, the prisoner must bring the claim in state collateral proceedings. In the instant case, *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were led for the American Bar Association by William T.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 5 Opinion of the Court however, petitioner's postconviction counsel did not raise the ineffective-assistance claim in the rst collateral proceeding, and, indeed, led a statement that, after reviewing the case, she found no meritorious claims helpful to petitioner. On federal habeas review, and with new counsel, petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and in the rst phase of his state collateral proceeding. Because the state collateral proceeding was the rst place to challenge his conviction on grounds of ineffec\u00adtive assistance, petitioner maintained he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding. While petitioner frames the question in this case as a consti\u00adtutional one, a more narrow, but still dispositive, formulation is whether a federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of an ineffective-assistance claim when the claim was not properly presented in state court due to an attorney's errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding. I A jury convicted petitioner, Luis Mariano Martinez, of two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the age of 15. The prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic interview with the victim, Martinez's 11-year-old stepdaughter. It also put in evidence the victim's nightgown, with traces of Martinez's DNA. As part of his defense, Martinez in\u00adtroduced evidence of the victim's recantations, including testimony from the victim's grandmother and mother and a second videotaped interview in which the victim denied any abuse. The victim also denied any abuse when she tes\u00adtied at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a-39a. To explain the inconsistencies, a prosecution expert testied that recan\u00adtations of child-abuse accusations are caused often by reluc\u00adtance on the part of the victim's mother to lend support to the child's claims. Pet. for Cert. 3. After considering the conflicting evidence, the jury convicted Martinez. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment 6 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court with no possibility of parole for 35 years. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The State appointed a new attorney to represent Martinez in his direct appeal. Ibid.; Pet. for Cert. 4. She made nu\u00ad merous arguments on Martinez's behalf, including a claim that the evidence was insufcient and that newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. Arizona law, however, did not permit her to argue on direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective. State v. Spreitz, 202 Ariz. 1, 3, 39 P. 3d 525, 527 (2002). Arizona instead re\u00adquires claims of ineffective assistance at trial to be reserved for state collateral proceedings. While Martinez's direct appeal was pending, the attorney began a state collateral proceeding by ling a \"Notice of Post-Conviction Relief.\" Martinez Crim. Proc. 32.4(a) (2011). Despite initiating this proceeding, counsel made no claim trial counsel was ineffective and later led a statement as\u00adserting she could nd no colorable claims at all. 623 F. 3d, at 734. Cf. State v. Smith, 184 Ariz. 456, 459, 910 P. 2d 1, 4 (1996). The state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding gave Martinez 45 days to le a pro se petition in support of postconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed his counsel overlooked. 623 F. 3d, at 734; see Smith, supra, at 459, 910 P. 2d, at 4. Martinez did not respond. He later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing collateral pro\u00adceedings and that counsel failed to advise him of the need to le a pro se petition to preserve his rights. The state trial court dismissed the action for postconviction relief, in effect afrming counsel's determination that Martinez had no meritorious claims. 623 F. 3d, at 734. The Arizona Court of Appeals afrmed Martinez's conviction, and the Ari\u00adzona Supreme Court denied review. Id., at 733. About a year and a half later, Martinez, now represented by new counsel, led a second notice of postconviction relief Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 7 Opinion of the Court in the Arizona trial court. Id., at 734. Martinez claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to challenge the prosecution's evidence. He argued, for example, that his trial counsel should have objected to the expert testimony explaining the victim's recantations or should have called an expert witness in rebuttal. Martinez also faulted trial coun\u00adsel for not pursuing an exculpatory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown. App. to Brief in Opposition B-6 to B-12. Martinez's petition was dismissed, in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring relief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous collateral proceeding. Id., at B-27; see Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3). Martinez, the theory went, should have asserted the claims of ineffective assist\u00adance of trial counsel in his rst notice for postconviction relief. The Arizona Court of Appeals agreed. It denied Martinez relief because he failed to raise his claims in the rst collateral proceeding. 623 F. 3d, at 734. The Arizona Supreme Court declined to review Martinez's appeal. Martinez then sought relief in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, where he led a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, again raising the ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claims. Martinez acknowledged the state courts denied his claims by relying on a well-established state procedural rule, which, under the doctrine of procedural default, would prohibit a federal court from reaching the merits of the claims. See, e. g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84-85, 90-91 (1977). He could overcome this hurdle to federal review, Martinez argued, because he had cause for the default: His rst postconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise any claims in the rst notice of postconviction relief and in failing to notify Martinez of her actions. See id., at 84-85. On the Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court denied the petition, ruling that Arizona's preclusion rule was an adequate and independent state-law ground to bar federal review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. Martinez 8 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court had not shown cause to excuse the procedural default, the District Court reasoned, because under Coleman v. Thomp\u00ad son, 501 U. S. 722, 753-754 (1991), an attorney's errors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as cause for a de\u00adfault. See id., at 754-755. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afrmed. The Court of Appeals relied on general statements in Coleman that, absent a right to counsel in a collateral proceeding, an attorney's errors in the proceeding do not establish cause for a procedural default. Expanding on the District Court's opinion, the Court of Appeals, citing Coleman, noted the general rule that there is no constitutional right to coun\u00adsel in collateral proceedings. 623 F. 3d, at 736. The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman reserved ruling on whether there is \"an exception\" to this rule in those cases \"where 'state collateral review is the rst place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.' \" 623 F. 3d, at 736 (quoting Coleman, supra, at 755). It concluded, neverthe\u00ad less, that the controlling cases established no basis for the exception. Certiorari was granted. 563 U. S. 1032 (2011). II Coleman v. Thompson, supra, left open, and the Court of Appeals in this case addressed, a question of constitutional law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings which provide the rst occasion to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These pro\u00adceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion, \"initial\u00adreview collateral proceedings.\" Coleman had suggested, though without holding, that the Constitution may require States to provide counsel in initial-review collateral proceed\u00adings because \"in [these] cases . . . state collateral review is the rst place a prisoner can present a challenge to his con\u00adviction.\" Id., at 755. As Coleman noted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a prisoner's \"one and only appeal\" as to an ineffective-assistance claim, id., at 756 (em\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 9 Opinion of the Court phasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted), and this may justify an exception to the constitutional rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings, see id., at 755; Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963) (holding States must appoint counsel on a prisoner's rst appeal). This is not the case, however, to resolve whether that exception exists as a constitutional matter. The precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective assist\u00adance at trial may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding. To protect prisoners with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, it is necessary to modify the unqualied statement in Coleman that an attorney's ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to ex\u00adcuse a procedural default. This opinion qualies Coleman by recognizing a narrow exception: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner's procedural default of a claim of ineffec\u00adtive assistance at trial. A Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of a state prisoner's conviction and sentence are guided by rules designed to ensure that state-court judgments are accorded the nality and respect necessary to preserve the integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federalism. These rules include the doctrine of procedural default, under which a federal court will not review the merits of claims, including constitutional claims, that a state court declined to hear be\u00adcause the prisoner failed to abide by a state procedural rule. See, e. g., Coleman, supra, at 747-748; Sykes, supra, at 84- 85. A state court's invocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner's claims precludes federal review of the claims if, among other requisites, the state procedural rule is a nonfed\u00aderal ground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is rmly established and consistently followed. See, e. g., 10 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court Walker v. Martin, 562 U. S. 307, 316 (2011); Beard v. Kindler , 558 U. S. 53, 60-61 (2009). The doctrine barring procedur\u00ad ally defaulted claims from being heard is not without excep\u00adtions. A prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law. See Coleman, supra, at 750. There is no dispute that Arizona's procedural bar on succes\u00adsive petitions is an independent and adequate state ground. Thus, a federal court can hear Martinez's ineffective-assistance claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default. Coleman held that \"[n]egligence on the part of a prisoner's postconviction attorney does not qualify as 'cause.' \" Ma\u00ad ples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. 266, 280 (2012). Coleman rea\u00ad soned that the . under 'well-settled principles of agency law,' the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent.\" Maples, supra, at 280-281. Coleman, however, did not present the occasion to apply this principle to determine whether attorney errors in initial-review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause for a procedural default. The alleged failure of counsel in Cole\u00ad man was on appeal from an initial-review collateral proceed\u00ad ing, and in that proceeding the prisoner's claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court. See 501 U. S., at 755. As Coleman recognized, this marks a key difference be\u00ad tween initial-review collateral proceedings and other kinds of collateral proceedings. When an attorney errs in initial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no state court at any level will hear the prisoner's claim. This Court on direct review of the state proceeding could not consider or adjudicate the claim. See, e. g., Fox Film Corp. v. Muller , 296 U. S. 207 (1935); Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875); cf. Coleman, supra, at 730-731. And if counsel's errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding do not estab\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 11 Opinion of the Court lish cause to excuse the procedural default in a federal ha\u00ad beas proceeding, no court will review the prisoner's claims. The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of postconviction proceedings. While counsel's errors in these proceedings preclude any further review of the prisoner's claim, the claim will have been addressed by one court, whether it be the trial court, the appellate court on direct review, or the trial court in an initial-review collateral pro\u00adceeding. See, e. g., Coleman, supra, at 756. Where, as here, the initial-review collateral proceeding is the rst designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner's direct appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim. This is because the state habeas court \"looks to the merits of the clai[m]\" of ineffective assistance, no other court has addressed the claim, and \"de\u00adfendants pursuing rst-tier review . . . are generally ill equipped to represent themselves\" because they do not have a brief from counsel or an opinion of the court addressing their claim of error. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617 (2005); see Douglas, supra, at 357-358. As Coleman recognized, an attorney's errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a proce\u00addural default; for if the attorney appointed by the State to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the State's procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claims. See 501 U. S., at 754; Evitts v. Lucey , 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985); Douglas, supra, at 357-358. Without the help of an adequate attorney, a prisoner will have similar difculties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance\u00adof-trial-counsel claim. Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative work and an understand\u00ading of trial strategy. When the issue cannot be raised on direct review, moreover, a prisoner asserting an ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claim in an initial-review collateral 12 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court proceeding cannot rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an attorney addressing that claim. Halbert, 545 U. S., at 619. To present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in accordance with the State's procedures, then, a prisoner likely needs an effective attorney. The same would be true if the State did not appoint an attorney to assist the prisoner in the initial-review collateral proceeding. The prisoner, unlearned in the law, may not comply with the State's procedural rules or may misappre\u00adhend the substantive details of federal constitutional law. Cf., e. g., id., at 620-621 (describing the educational back\u00ad ground of the prison population). While conned to prison, the prisoner is in no position to develop the evidentiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, which often turns on evidence outside the trial record. A prisoner's inability to present a claim of trial error is of particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective assist\u00adance of counsel. The right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system. It is deemed as an \"obvious truth\" the idea that \"any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.\" Gid\u00ad eon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963). Indeed, the right to counsel is the foundation for our adversary system. Defense counsel tests the prosecution's case to ensure that the proceedings serve the function of adjudicating guilt or innocence, while protecting the rights of the person charged. See, e. g., Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68-69 (1932) (\"[The defendant] requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence\"). Effective trial counsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal, see, e. g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), and in federal habeas proceedings, Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U. S. 446 (2000). Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 13 Opinion of the Court This is not to imply the State acted with any impropriety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a collat\u00ad eral proceeding. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, 505 (2003). Ineffective-assistance claims often depend on evidence outside the trial record. Direct appeals, with\u00adout evidentiary hearings, may not be as effective as other proceedings for developing the factual basis for the claim. Ibid. Abbreviated deadlines to expand the record on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for an attorney to inves\u00adtigate the ineffective-assistance claim. See Primus, Struc\u00adtural Reform in Criminal Defense, 92 Cornell L. Rev. 679, 689-690, and n. 57 (2004) (most rules give between 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to le a request to expand the record on appeal). Thus, there are sound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective-assistance-of-trial\u00adcounsel claims until the collateral-review stage, but this deci\u00adsion is not without consequences for the State's ability to assert a procedural default in later proceedings. By delib\u00aderately choosing to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State significantly diminishes prisoners' ability to le such claims. It is within the context of this state procedural framework that counsel's ineffectiveness in an initial-review collateral proceeding qualies as cause for a procedural default. The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to ex\u00ad cuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise of the Court's discretion. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 490 (1991); see also Coleman, supra, at 730-731; Sykes, 433 U. S., at 83; Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984); Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963), overruled in part by Sykes, supra. These rules reflect an equitable judgment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed in complying with the State's established procedures will a federal habeas court ex\u00adcuse the prisoner from the usual sanction of default. See, e. g., Strickler v. Greene , 527 U. S. 263, 289 (1999); Reed, 14 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court supra, at 16. Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel when an attorney's errors (or the absence of an attorney) caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that the initial-review collateral proceeding, if undertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel, may not have been sufcient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim. From this it follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a collateral proceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a default of an ineffective-assistance claim in two circum\u00adstances. The rst is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. The second is where ap\u00adpointed counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where the claim should have been raised, was ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of\u00adtrial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003) (de\u00ad scribing standards for certicates of appealability to issue). Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance claims. Some States, including Arizona, appoint counsel in every rst collateral proceeding. See, e. g., Alaska Stat. \u00a718.85.100(c) (2010); Ariz. Rule N. J. 1997); Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-14-205 (2011). Some States appoint counsel if the claims require an evidentiary hearing, as claims of ineffective assistance often do. See, e. g., Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 11.42(5) (2011); La. Code Crim. Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 15 Opinion of the Court Proc. Ann., Art. 930.7(C) (West 2008); Mich. Rule Civ. Proc. 71.1(d) (2011). Other States appoint counsel if the claims have some merit to them or the state habeas trial court deems the record worthy of further development. See, e. g., Ark. Rule Crim. Proc. 37.3(b) P. 3d 668, 669-670 (2009); Hardin v. Arkansas, 350 Ark. 299, 301, 86 S. W. 3d 384, 385 (2002) (per curiam); Jensen v. State , 2004 ND 200, \u00b613, 688 N. W. 2d A. 2d 1083, 1089 (D. C. 2002); 167 Colo. 317, 447 P. 2d 536 (1968). It is likely that most of the attor\u00ad neys appointed by the courts are qualied to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional norms; and, where that is so, the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings. B This limited qualication to Coleman does not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests protected by stare decisis principles. Cf., e. g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792-793 (2009). Coleman held that an attorney's negligence in a postconviction proceeding does not establish cause, and this remains true except as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Coleman itself did not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an initial-review col\u00adlateral proceeding with respect to a claim of ineffective trial counsel; and in the 20 years since Coleman was decided, we have not held Coleman applies in circumstances like this one. The holding here ought not to put a signicant strain on state resources. When faced with the question whether there is cause for an apparent default, a State may answer 16 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Opinion of the Court that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is insub\u00ad stantial, i. e., it does not have any merit or that it is wholly without factual support, or that the attorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding did not perform below constitu\u00adtional standards. This is but one of the differences between a constitutional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case. A constitutional ruling would provide defendants a freestanding constitu\u00adtional claim to raise; it would require the appointment of counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings; it would impose the same system of appointing counsel in every State; and it would require a reversal in all state collateral cases on direct review from state courts if the States' system of appointing counsel did not conform to the constitutional rule. An equitable ruling, by contrast, permits States a variety of systems for appointing counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings. And it permits a State to elect between ap\u00adpointing counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural default and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas proceedings. In addition, state collateral cases on direct review from state courts are unaf\u00adfected by the ruling in this case. The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circum\u00ad stances recognized here. The holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings, in\u00adcluding appeals from initial-review collateral proceedings, second or successive collateral proceedings, and petitions for discretionary review in a State's appellate courts. See 501 U. S., at 754; Carrier , 477 U. S., at 488. It does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the rst occa\u00adsion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that initial-review collateral proceeding may be decient for other reasons. In addition, the limited nature of the qualication to Cole\u00ad man adopted here reflects the importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona's decision to Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 17 Opinion of the Court bar defendants from raising ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here addresses only the constitu\u00adtional claims presented in this case, where the State barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal. Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, bars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a proce\u00addural default. AEDPA refers to attorney error in collateral proceedings, but it does not speak to the question presented in this case. Section 2254(i) provides that \"the ineffective\u00adness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief.\" \"Cause,\" however, is not synonymous with \"a ground for relief.\" A nding of cause and prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief. It merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of a claim that otherwise would have been procedurally defaulted. In this case, for example, Martinez's \"ground for relief\" is his ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claim, a claim that AEDPA does not bar. Martinez relies on the ineffectiveness of his post-conviction attorney to excuse his failure to comply with Arizona's procedural rules, not as an independent basis for overturning his conviction. In short, while \u00a7 2254(i) pre\u00adcludes Martinez from relying on the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a \"ground for relief,\" it does not stop Martinez from using it to establish \"cause.\" Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631, 650-651 (2010). III Where, under state law, claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assist\u00adance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. 18 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting In this case Martinez's attorney in the initial-review collat\u00ad eral proceeding led a notice akin to an Anders brief, in effect conceding that Martinez lacked any meritorious claim, including his claim of ineffective assistance at trial. See An\u00ad ders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967). Martinez argued before the federal habeas court that ling the Anders brief constituted ineffective assistance. The Court of Appeals did not decide whether that was so. Rather, it held that because Martinez did not have a right to an attorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding, the attorney's errors in the initial-review collateral proceeding could not establish cause for the failure to comply with the State's rules. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not determine whether Martinez's attorney in his rst collateral proceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial. And the court did not address the question of prejudice. These issues remain open for a decision on remand. * * * The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting. I A Let me get this straight: Out of concern for the values of federalism; to preserve the ability of our States to provide prompt justice; and in light of our longstanding jurispru\u00addence holding that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state collateral review; the Court, in what it portrays as an admirable exercise of judicial restraint, abstains from holding that there is a constitutional right to counsel in initial-review state habeas. After all, that would have Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 19 Scalia, J., dissenting meant, in a case such as the one before us, that failing to provide assistance of counsel, or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard, would con\u00ad stitute cause for excusing procedural default. See Strick\u00ad land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Instead of taking that radical step, the Court holds that, for equitable reasons, in a case such as the one before us, failing to provide assist\u00adance of counsel, or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland standard, constitutes cause for excus\u00ad ing procedural default. The result, of course, is precisely the same. Ah, but perhaps the explanation of why the Court's action today amounts to praiseworthy self-restraint is this: It pro\u00adnounces this excuse from the usual rule of procedural default only in initial-review state habeas raising an ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claim. But it could have limited its invention of a new constitutional right to collateral-review counsel in precisely the same fashion\u2014and with pre\u00adcisely the same consequences. Moreover, no one really be\u00adlieves that the newly announced \"equitable\" rule will remain limited to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel cases. There is not a dime's worth of difference in principle between those cases and many other cases in which initial state ha\u00adbeas will be the rst opportunity for a particular claim to be raised: claims of \"newly discovered\" prosecutorial miscon\u00adduct, for example, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), claims based on \"newly discovered\" exculpatory evi\u00addence or \"newly discovered\" impeachment of prosecutorial witnesses, and claims asserting ineffective assistance of ap\u00adpellate counsel. The Court's soothing assertion, ante , at 17, that its holding \"addresses only the constitutional claims pre\u00adsented in this case,\" insults the reader's intelligence. 1 1 The Court also seeks to restrict its holding to cases in which the State has \"deliberately cho[sen]\" to move the asserted claim \"outside of the direct-appeal process,\" ante , at 13. That line lacks any principled basis, and will not last. Is there any relevant difference between cases in which 20 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting Moreover, even if today's holding could (against all logic) be restricted to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims, it would have essentially the same practical consequences as a holding that collateral-review counsel is constitutionally required. Despite the Court's suggestion to the contrary, see ante , at 16, the rule it adopts calls into question the com\u00ad mon state practice of not appointing counsel in all rst collat\u00aderal proceedings, see ante , at 14-15. It does not, to be sure, call into question the lawfulness of that practice; only its sanity . For if the prisoner goes through state collateral proceedings without counsel, and fails to raise an ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claim which is, because of that fail\u00adure, defaulted, the default will not preclude federal habeas review of the merits of that claim. And since ineffective assistance of trial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal habeas (has a duly convicted defendant ever been effectively represented?), whoever advises the State would himself be guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not coun\u00adsel the appointment of state-collateral-review counsel in all cases\u2014lest the failure to raise that claim in the state pro\u00adceedings be excused and the State be propelled into federal habeas review of the adequacy of trial-court representation the State says that certain claims can only be brought on collateral review and cases in which those claims by their nature can only be brought on collateral review, since they do not manifest themselves until the appellate process is complete? Our cases establish that to constitute cause for fail\u00adure to raise an issue on direct review, the excuse must be \"an objective factor external to the defense.\" See infra, at 24. That the factual basis for a claim was not available until the collateral-review stage is no less such a factor than a State's requiring that a claim be brought on collateral review. See Murray v. Carrier , 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). The Court's asserted limitation makes sense only if the opinion means that a State has \"deliberately cho[sen]\" to move newly-arisen claims \"outside of the direct-appeal process\" if it fails to reopen the direct-appeal process in order to entertain such claims. Such a radical change in what we require of the States surely ought to be prescribed by language clearer than what today's opinion contains. Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 21 Scalia, J., dissenting that occurred many years ago.2 Which is to say that the Court's pretended avoidance of requiring States to appoint collateral-review counsel is a sham.3 Of course even the appointment of state-collateral-review counsel will not guarantee that the State's criminal proceed\u00ading can be concluded without years-long federal retrial. Ap\u00adpointment of counsel may, as I have said, avoid federal re\u00adview of the adequacy of representation that occurred years ago, at the original trial. But since, under today's opinion, the condition for exclusion of federal habeas is the very same condition that would apply if appointment of state-collateral\u00adreview counsel were constitutionally required, it will remain to be determined in federal habeas review whether the state- appointed counsel was effective. Thus, as a consequence of today's decision the States will always be forced to litigate in federal habeas, for all defaulted ineffective-assistance\u00ad 2 The Court says that to establish cause a prisoner must demonstrate that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is \"substantial,\" which apparently means the claim has at least some merit. See ante , at 14. The Court does not explain where this substantiality standard comes from, and how it differs from the normal rule that a prisoner must demonstrate actual prejudice to avoid the enforcement of a procedural default, see Cole\u00ad man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991). But whatever the standard, examination of the adequacy of years-ago representation has been substi\u00adtuted for summary dismissal by reason of procedural default. 3 The Court also claims, ante , at 16, that its \"equitable\" ruling, unlike a constitutional ruling, will not require \"a reversal in all state collateral cases on direct review from state courts\" where counsel has not been appointed. Surely the Court does not mean to suggest that an unconstitu\u00adtional failure to appoint counsel on collateral review, like an unconstitu\u00adtional failure to appoint counsel at trial, would require the entire convic\u00adtion to be set aside. That is inconceivable. So either one of two things would happen: Either the reviewing state court would be able to inquire into prejudice (which is an improvement over having the federal habeas court make that inquiry, as the Court's \"equitable\" solution requires); or else the appellate state court will remand for a collateral proceeding with counsel (which is, as we have said, just what the Court's \"equitable\" ruling effectively requires anyway). So the Court's \"equitable\" ruling is no boon to the States. 22 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting of-trial-counsel claims (and who knows what other claims), either (1) the validity of the defaulted claim (where collateral-review counsel was not appointed), or (2) the effec\u00adtiveness of collateral-review counsel (where collateral-review counsel was appointed). The Court notes that many States already provide for the appointment of counsel in rst col\u00adlateral challenges\u2014as though this proves that what the Court forces the States to do today is eminently reasonable. But what the Court fails to point out is that currently, when state-appointed counsel does not raise an ineffective\u00adassistance-of-trial-counsel claim, that is the end of the mat\u00adter: The issue has been procedurally defaulted. By virtue of today's opinion, however, all those cases can (and where capital punishment is at issue assuredly will) proceed to fed\u00ad eral habeas on the issue of whether state-appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the ineffective-assistance\u00adof-trial-counsel issue. That is the meaning of the Court's (supposedly comforting) statement: \"It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualied to perform, and do perform, ac\u00adcording to prevailing professional norms; and, where that is so , the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.\" Ante , at 15 (emphasis added). To be more precise, the Court should have said \"where that is so, and where federal habeas courts have nally rejected claims that it is not so, the States may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.\" I cannot possibly imagine the basis for the Court's con\u00ad dence, ante, at 15-16, that all this will not put a signicant strain on state resources. The principal escape route from federal habeas\u2014existence of an \"adequate and independ\u00adent state ground\"\u2014has been closed. 4 Whether counsel ap\u00ad 4 See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B. Ostrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U. S. District Courts 45-49 (2007) (documenting the percentage of habeas petitions that included claims dismissed for various Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 23 Scalia, J., dissenting pointed for state collateral review raises the ineffective\u00ad assistance-of-trial-counsel claim or not, federal habeas re\u00ad view will proceed. In practical effect, that may not make much difference in noncapital cases (except for the squander\u00ading of state taxpayers' money): The defendant will stay in prison, continuing to serve his sentence, while federal habeas review grinds on. But in capital cases, it will effectively reduce the sentence, giving the defendant as many more years to live, beyond the lives of the innocent victims whose life he snuffed out, as the process of federal habeas may con\u00adsume. I guarantee that an assertion of ineffective assist\u00ad ance of trial counsel will be made in all capital cases from this date on, causing (because of today's holding) execution of the sentence to be deferred until either that claim, or the claim that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to make that claim, has worked its way through the federal system. B The Court would have us believe that today's holding is no more than a \"limited qualication\" to Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Ante, at 15. It is much more than that: a repudiation of the longstanding principle governing procedural default, which Coleman and other cases consist\u00ad ently applied. Coleman itself involved a habeas petitioner's contention that his attorney's failure to le a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceeding, which resulted in procedural default of the claims raised in that proceeding, was cause to excuse that default in federal habeas. 501 U. S., at 752. The petitioner in that case contended that whether a violation of his constitutional right to effective procedural reasons); Administrative Ofce of the United States Courts, Habeas Corpus Petitions Disposed of Procedurally During the 12-Month Period Ending September 30, 2011 (reporting that for appeals in noncapi\u00adtal state-prisoner habeas cases, procedural default accounted for the largest percentage of procedural dispositions, with the exception of the denial of a certicate of appealability) (available in Clerk of Court's case le). 24 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting counsel had occurred was of no consequence, so long as the attorney's conduct fell short of the effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland. See 501 U. S., at 753. Whereas Cole\u00ad man flatly repudiated that claim as being inconsistent with our precedent, see ibid., today's majority wholeheartedly embraces it, ante , at 14. Rejection of the argument in Coleman was compelled by our jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing proce\u00addural default, and in particular Murray v. Carrier , 477 U. S. 478 (1986). See Coleman, supra, at 752-753. Carrier in\u00ad volved the failure of a defendant's attorney to raise a claim on direct appeal. 477 U. S., at 482. This failure did not con\u00adstitute cause, we explained, because it was not an \"objective factor external to the defense.\" Id., at 488 (emphasis added). This external-factor requirement reflects the judg\u00adment that States should not be forced to undergo federal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor not attrib\u00adutable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance with state procedures. See id., at 487-488. Although this externality requirement has been the North Star of our excuse-for-cause jurisprudence, today's opinion does not whisper its name\u2014no doubt because it is impossible to say that Martinez's procedural default was caused by a factor external to his defense. Coleman and Carrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney error constitutes an external factor: Attorney error by itself does not, because when an attorney acts (or fails to act) in furtherance of the litigation, he is acting as the petitioner's agent. Coleman, supra, at 753; Carrier , supra, at 492. Any other rule would be inconsistent with our system of representative litigation, under which \"each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\" Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). But when attorney error amounts to constitutionally inef\u00ad fective assistance of counsel, that error is imputed to the State (for the State has failed to comply with the constitu\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 25 Scalia, J., dissenting tional requirement to provide effective counsel), rendering the error external to the petitioner. Coleman, supra, at 754; Carrier , supra, at 488. Accordingly, as Martinez him\u00ad self appears to recognize, see Brief for Petitioner 22, our cases require that absent a determination that Arizona violated the Constitution by failing to provide effective coun\u00adsel, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse his proce\u00addural default. Rather than apply that rule here, the Court adopts the very approach Coleman explicitly addressed and rejected. The Court essentially disclaims any need to give full con\u00ad sideration to the principle of stare decisis because Coleman did not involve an initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See ante , at 15. That is rather like saying that Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), does not establish our authority to review the constitutionality of a new federal statute because it in\u00advolved a different enactment. Just as the reasoning of Mar- bury was categorical, so was the reasoning of Coleman and Carrier: Attorney error is not an external factor constituting cause for excusing default unless the State has a constitu\u00adtional obligation to provide effective counsel. Had the ma\u00adjority seriously considered the relevant stare decisis factors, see, e. g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792-793 (2009), it would have had difculty justifying today's decision. Nor can it escape the demands of stare decisis by saying that our rules regarding the excuse of procedural default reflect an \"equitable judgment\" that is \"elaborated in the exercise of the Court's discretion.\" Ante , at 13. Equity is not lawless\u00ad ness, and discretion is not license to cast aside established jurisprudence reafrmed this very Term. See Maples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. 266, 280 (2012) (\"Negligence on the part of a prisoner's postconviction attorney does not qualify as 'cause' \" (quoting Coleman, supra, at 753)). \" '[C]ourts of equity must be governed by rules and precedents no less than courts of law.' \" Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 26 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting (1996) (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring)). Noticeably absent from the Court's equitable analysis, moreover, is any consideration of the very reason for a procedural-default rule: the comity and respect that federal courts must accord state-court judgments. See Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U. S. 446, 451 (2000). The procedural-default doctrine reflects the understanding that federal review of defaulted claims may \"circumvent the jurisdictional limits of direct review and 'undermine the State's interest in enforc\u00ading its laws.' \" Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S. 362, 388 (2002) (Kennedy , J., dissenting) (quoting Coleman, 501 U. S., at 731). Unlike today's decision, Carrier and Coleman took ac\u00ad count of the signicant costs federal habeas review imposes on States, including the \"reduction in the nality of litigation and the frustration of 'both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor con\u00adstitutional rights.' \" Carrier , supra, at 487 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982)). Criminal conviction ought to be nal before society has forgotten the crime that justies it. When a case arrives at federal habeas, the state conviction and sentence at issue (never mind the underlying crime) are already a dim memory, on average more than six years old (seven years for capital cases). 5 I would adhere to the precedents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse. II We granted certiorari on, and the parties addressed their arguments to, the following question: \"Whether a defendant in a state criminal case who is prohibited by state law from raising on direct appeal any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but who 5 See King, Cheesman, & Ostrom, Final Technical Report, at 21-22 (re\u00ad porting the average interval between state judgment and federal habeas ling for a sample of federal habeas cases led in the early-to-mid 2000's). Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 27 Scalia, J., dissenting has a state-law right to raise such a claim in a rst post- conviction proceeding, has a federal constitutional right to effective assistance of rst post-conviction counsel specically with respect to his ineffective-assistance-of\u00adtrial-counsel claim.\" Pet. for Cert. i. While the Court's decision not to answer the question did not avoid the costs a constitutional holding would have im\u00adposed on States, it did avoid the Court's need to confront the established rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings. To avoid his procedural default, Martinez ad\u00advocates in favor of an exception to this rule where the pris\u00adoner seeks the right to counsel in an initial-review collateral proceeding\u2014an argument we have previously declined to ad\u00address. See Coleman, supra, at 755. The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our precedent. In Pennsylvania v. Finley , 481 U. S. 551 (1987), and Murray v. Giarratano , 492 U. S. 1 (1989), we stated unequivocally that prisoners do not \"have a constitutional right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon their convictions.\" Finley , supra, at 555. See also Giarratano , 492 U. S., at 10 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he rule of Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently in capital cases than in noncapital cases\"); id., at 14 (Kennedy , J., concurring in judgment) (in\u00ad dicating that the Constitution does not categorically require States to provide counsel to death-row inmates seeking state habeas review). Though Finley may have involved only claims that could have been raised on direct review, see 481 U. S., at 553; Giarratano , supra, at 24 (Stevens, J., dissent\u00ad ing), the Court was no doubt aware that States often limit \"the collateral review process [to] issues that have not pre\u00adviously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal.\" Brief for Respondent in Finley , O. T. 1986, No. 85-2099, p. 11, n. 5. And Giarratano , which involved a class action led under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, addressed the general assertion that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel for col\u00adlateral attacks on capital convictions. See 492 U. S., at 3-4 28 MAR TINEZ v. RYAN Scalia, J., dissenting (plurality opinion). The Court rejected that assertion with\u00ad out qualication. The dissenting opinion, moreover, made the precise argument Martinez now asserts: Under state law \"some claims [including ineffective assistance of trial coun\u00adsel] ordinarily heard on direct review will be relegated to postconviction proceedings.\" Id., at 24 (Stevens, J., dissent\u00ad ing). See also Brief for Respondents in Giarratano , O. T. 1988, No. 88-411, p. 29, n. 8 (\"In [Virginia capital habeas] proceedings, Death Row inmates seek to assert claims that have not been, and could not have been, addressed on direct appeal . . . \"). Thus, in announcing a categorical rule in Finley , see Giarratano , supra, at 12 (plurality opinion), and then reafrming it in Giarratano , the Court knew full well that a collateral proceeding may present the rst opportu\u00adnity for a prisoner to raise a constitutional claim. I would follow that rule in this case and reject Martinez's argument that there is a constitutional right to counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings. * * * Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional hold\u00ad ing would have imposed on the States, today's holding as a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings\u2014and, to boot, eliminates the pre-existing assurance of escaping federal habeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to present. Despite the Court's protestations to the contrary, the decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurisprudence that will impose con\u00adsiderable economic costs on the States and further impair their ability to provide justice in a timely fashion. The bal\u00adance it strikes between the nality of criminal judgments and the need to provide for review of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such claims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue (since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise such Cite as: 566 U. S. 1 (2012) 29 Scalia, J., dissenting claims. The balance might have been close (though it would disregard our established jurisprudence) if the Court merely held that uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel would not constitute default. But in adding to that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also provide an excuse, the Court creates a monstrosity. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. 30 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit No. 10-1016. Argued January 11, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2012 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) entitles an employee to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave per year for (A) the care of a newborn son or daughter; (B) the adoption or foster-care placement of a child; (C) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious medical condition; and (D) the employee's own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee's ability to perform at work. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1). The FMLA also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages \"against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court.\" \u00a7 2617(a)(2). For present purposes, subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and subparagraph (D) as the self-care provision. In Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 730732, this Court held that Congress could subject States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C) based on evidence of family-leave policies that discriminated on the basis of sex. Petitioner led suit, alleging that his employer, the Maryland Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the State, violated the FMLA by de\u00adnying him self-care leave. The Federal District Court dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity grounds. The Fourth Circuit afrmed, holding that unlike the family-care provision in Hibbs, the self-care pro\u00ad vision was not directed at an identied pattern of gender-based discrimi\u00adnation and was not congruent and proportional to any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States. Held: The judgment is afrmed. 626 F. 3d 187, afrmed. Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice , Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito , concluded that suits against States under the self- care provision are barred by sovereign immunity. Pp. 3544. (a) Under the federal system, States, as sovereigns, are immune from damages suits, unless they waive that defense. See, e. g., Kimel v. Flor\u00ad ida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 7273. Congress may also abrogate the States' immunity pursuant to its powers under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but it must make that intention \"unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,\" Hibbs, supra, at 726. It did so in the FMLA. Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 31 Syllabus Congress also \"must tailor\" legislation enacted under \u00a7 5 to \" \" Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639. \"There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520. Pp. 3537. (b) The sex-based discrimination that supported allowing subpara\u00ad graph (C) suits against States is absent with respect to the self-care provision. Petitioner's three arguments to the contrary are unpersua\u00adsive. Pp. 37-43. (1) Petitioner maintains that the self-care provision addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping. But the provision, standing alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States' immunity from suit. At the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such discrimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies. Congress was concerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss on employees and their families and about discrimination based on illness, not sex. Although the self-care provision offers some women a benet by allow\u00ading them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional to any identied constitu\u00adtional violations. When the FMLA was enacted, Congress had no evi\u00addence that States were excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from their leave policies. Pp. 37-39. (2) Petitioner also argues that the self-care provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs. But his claim\u2014that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availabil\u00adity of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their different leave-usage patterns\u2014is unconvincing and does not comply with the re\u00adquirements of City of Boerne . Also, there are no congressional ndings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer discrimination against women. Pp. 39-42. (3) Finally, petitioner contends that the self-care provision helps single parents keep their jobs when they get ill. The fact that most single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women. However, \"[a]lthough disparate im\u00adpact may be relevant evidence of . . . . insufcient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.\" Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 372-373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave policies affected by 32 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Syllabus the self-care provision are unconstitutional, the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 4243. Justice Scalia adhered to his view that the Court should abandon the \"congruence and proportionality\" approach in favor of one that is properly tied to the text of \u00a7 5, which grants Congress the power \"to enforce, by appropriate legislation,\" the other provisions of the Four\u00adteenth Amendment. Outside the context of racial discrimination, Con\u00adgress's \u00a7 5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not reach a State's failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.

S. 30 (2012) 33 Opinion of Kennedy, J. Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice , Jus\u00ad tice Thomas, and Justice Alito joined. The question in this case is whether a state employee is allowed to recover damages from the state entity that em\u00ad ploys him by invoking one of the provisions of a federal statute that, in express terms, seeks to abrogate the States' immunity from suits for damages. The statute in question is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2601 et seq . The provision at issue requires em\u00ad ployers, including state employers, to grant unpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition, provided other stat\u00adutory requisites are met, particularly requirements that the total amount of annual leave taken under all the Act's provi\u00adsions does not exceed a stated maximum. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). In agreement with every Court of Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now holds that suits against States under this provision are barred by the States' immunity as sovereigns in our federal system.

McGraw, Jr., of West Virginia, J. B. Van Hollen of Wisconsin, and Gregory A. Phillips of Wyoming. 34 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Opinion of Kennedy, J. I A The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave per year. An employee may take leave under the FMLA for: (A) \"the birth of a son or daughter . . . in order to care for such son or daughter,\" (B) the adop\u00adtion or foster-care placement of a child with the employee, (C) the care of a \"spouse, . . . son, daughter, or parent\" with \"a serious health condition,\" or (D) the employee's own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee's ability to perform at work. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1). The Act creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages \"against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.\" \u00a7 2617(a)(2). As noted, subparagraph (D) is at issue here. This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003). Subpar\u00ad agraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for reasons related to family care, and those three provisions are referred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held that Con\u00ad gress could subject the States to suit for violations of subpar\u00adagraph (C), \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C). That holding rested on evidence that States had family-leave policies that differentiated on the basis of sex and that States administered even neutral family-leave policies in ways that discriminated on the basis of sex. See id., at 730-732. Subparagraph (D), the self-care provision, was not at issue in Hibbs. B Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman re\u00adquested sick leave, he was informed he would be terminated if he did not resign. Coleman then sued the state court in the United States District Court for the District of Mary\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 35 Opinion of Kennedy, J. land, alleging, inter alia, that his employer violated the FMLA by failing to provide him with self-care leave. The District Court dismissed the suit on the basis that the Maryland Court of Appeals, as an entity of a sovereign State, was immune from the suit for damages. The parties do not dispute the District Court's ruling that the Maryland Court of Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of the State for purposes of sovereign immunity. The District Court con\u00adcluded the FMLA's self-care provision did not validly abro\u00adgate the State's immunity from suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15-20. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit af\u00adrmed, reasoning that, unlike the family-care provision at issue in Hibbs, the self-care provision was not directed at an identied pattern of gender-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States. 626 F. 3d 187. Certio\u00adrari was granted. 564 U. S. 1035 (2011). II A A foundational premise of the federal system is that States, as sovereigns, are immune from suits for damages, save as they elect to waive that defense. See Kimel v. Flor\u00ad ida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72-73 (2000); Alden v. Maine , 527 U. S. 706 (1999). As an exception to this princi\u00ad ple, Congress may abrogate the States' immunity from suit pursuant to its powers under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amend\u00adment. See, e. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer , 427 U. S. 445 (1976). Congress must \"mak[e] its intention to abrogate unmistak\u00ad ably clear in the language of the statute.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the clear purpose to abrogate the States' immunity. Ibid. (\"The clarity of Congress' intent\" to abrogate the States' immunity from suits for damages under the FMLA \"is not fairly debatable\"). Congress subjected any \"public agency\" to suit under the FMLA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2617(a)(2), and a \"public agency\" is de\u00ad36 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Opinion of Kennedy, J. ned to include both \"the government of a State or political subdivision thereof\" and \"any agency of . . . a State, a political subdivision of a State,\" \u00a7\u00a7 203(x), 2611(4)(A)(iii). The question then becomes whether the self-care provision and its attempt to abrogate the States' immunity are a valid exercise of congressional power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 grants Congress the power \"to en\u00adforce\" the substantive guarantees of \u00a7 1 of the Amendment by \"appropriate legislation.\" The power to enforce \" 'in\u00adcludes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation[s] of rights guaranteed' \" by \u00a7 1. See Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365 (2001) (quot\u00ad ing Kimel, supra, at 81). To ensure Congress' enforcement powers under \u00a7 5 remain enforcement powers, as envisioned by the ratiers of the Amendment, rather than powers to redene the substantive scope of \u00a7 1, Congress \"must tailor\" legislation enacted under \u00a7 5 to \" 'remedy prevent' \" \"con\u00adduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive provisions.\" Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999). Whether a congressional Act passed under \u00a7 5 can impose monetary liability upon States requires an assessment of both the \" 'evil' or 'wrong' that Congress intended to rem\u00adedy,\" ibid., and the means Congress adopted to address that evil, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997). Legislation enacted under \u00a7 5 must be targeted at \"conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive pro\u00advisions.\" City , 521 U. S., at 525. And \"[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Id., at 520. Under this analysis Hibbs permitted employees to recover damages from States for violations of subparagraph (C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence of a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination in family\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 37 Opinion of Kennedy, J. leave policies. States had facially discriminatory leave pol\u00ad icies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men. 538 U. S., at 730-731. States also administered facially neutral family-leave policies in gender-biased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what Congress found to be a \"pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work,\" id., at 731, a stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in earlier times, id., at 729. Faced with \"the States' record of unconstitutional partici\u00adpation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benets,\" Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to give all employees the opportu\u00adnity to take family-care leave was \"narrowly targeted at the faultline between work and family\u2014precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.\" Id., at 735, 738. B The same cannot be said for requiring the States to give all employees the opportunity to take self-care leave. Peti\u00adtioner advances three arguments for allowing employees to recover damages from States that violate the FMLA's self-care provision: The self-care provision standing alone ad\u00addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping; the pro\u00advision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the burden on single parents. But what the family-care provisions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks, namely, evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to address or prevent those violations. 1 Standing alone, the self-care provision is not a valid abro\u00ad gation of the States' immunity from suit. When the FMLA was enacted, \"ninety-ve percent of full-time state- and local-government employees were covered by paid sick leave 38 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Opinion of Kennedy, J. plans and ninety-six percent of such employees likewise en\u00ad joyed short-term disability protection.\" Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 13-14 (hereinafter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S. Dept. of Labor, Em\u00adployee Benets in State and Local Governments 17-26 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The evidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory self-care leave policies or that they administered neutral self-care leave policies in a discriminatory way. And there is scant evidence in the leg\u00adislative history of a purported stereotype harbored by em\u00adployers that women take self-care leave more often than men. Congress considered evidence that \"men and women are out on medical leave approximately equally.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-28, pt. 1, p. 15 (1989) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record shows employers formulated self-care leave policies based on a contrary view. Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is appar\u00adent that the congressional purpose in enacting the self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs. The legis\u00adlative history of the self-care provision reveals a concern for the economic burdens on the employee and the employee's family resulting from illness-related job loss and a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not sex. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 11-12 (1993); H. R. Rep., at 23. In the ndings pertinent to the self-care provision, the statute makes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2601(a)(4) (\"[T]here is inadequate job secu\u00adrity for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods\"). By contrast, with regard to family care Congress invoked concerns related to gender. See \u00a7 2601(a)(5) (\"[D]ue to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 39 Opinion of Kennedy, J. It is true the self-care provision offers some women a ben\u00ad et by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not congruent and proportional to any identied constitutional violations. At the time of the FMLA's enactment, \"ninety-ve percent\" of state employees had paid sick-leave plans at work, and \"ninety-six percent\" had short-term disability Texas Brief 13-14 (citing BLS Rept. 17-26). State employ\u00adees presumably could take leave for pregnancy-related ill\u00adnesses under these policies, and Congress did not document any pattern of States excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from sick-leave or disability-leave policies. \"Congress . . . said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state reme\u00addies.\" Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 644. It follows that abrogating the States' immunity from suits for damages for failure to give self-care leave is not a congruent and pro\u00adportional remedy if the existing state leave policies would have sufced. 2 As an alternative justication for the self-care provision, it has been suggested that the provision is a necessary ad\u00adjunct to the family-care provisions. Petitioner argues that employers may assume women are more likely to take family-care leave than men and that the FMLA therefore offers up to 12 weeks of leave for family care and self care combined. According to petitioner, when the self-care pro\u00advision is coupled with the family-care provisions, the self-care provision could reduce the difference in the expected number of weeks of FMLA leave that different employees take for different reasons. The fact that self-care leave could have this effect does not mean that it would. If, for example, women are expected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and men to take 10, and women and men are each expected to take 5 days of self-care leave per year, the difference in the expected num\u00adber of days of leave and cost to the employer remains the 40 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Opinion of Kennedy, J. same regardless of the availability of self-care leave. Con\u00ad gress made no ndings, and received no specic testimony, to suggest the availability of self-care leave equalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and women will take. Even if women take family-care leave more often than men, men do not take self-care leave more often than women; and there is little evidence that employers assume they do. See H. R. Rep., at 15. Petitioner suggests that some women will be expected to take all 12 weeks of leave under the FMLA for family-care purposes, and therefore that any amount of self-care leave taken by men will diminish the difference in the amount of FMLA leave taken by men and women. But there is little evidence to support petitioner's assumption about the magnitude of women's expected FMLA leave for family-care purposes. And men are only expected to take ve days of sick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision diminishes the difference in expected leave time by a maximum of ve days. And that is only to the extent women use all their available FMLA leave for family-care reasons. Petitioner's overly complicated argument about how the self-care provision works in tandem with the family-care provisions is unconvincing and in the end does not com\u00adply with the clear requirements of City of Boerne . In addition petitioner's rst defense of the self-care provi\u00ad sion contradicts his second defense of the provision. In the rst defense, the Court is told employers assume women take more self-care leave than men. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-12. In the second defense, the Court is told the self-care provision provides an incentive to hire women that will counteract the incentives created by the family-care provi\u00adsions because employers assume women take more family-care leave than men. But if the rst defense is correct, the second defense is wrong. In other words, if employers assume women take self-care leave more often than men (the rst defense), a self-care provision will not provide an incentive to hire women. To the contrary, the self-care pro\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 41 Opinion of Kennedy, J. vision would provide an incentive to discriminate against women. There is \"little support in the record for the concerns that supposedly animated\" the self-care provision. Florida Pre\u00ad paid, supra, at 639. Only supposition and conjecture sup\u00ad port the contention that the self-care provision is necessary to make the family-care provisions effective. The evidence documented in support of the self-care provision is, to a large degree, unrelated to sex discrimination, or to the administra\u00adtion of the family-care provisions. See supra, at 38. Con\u00ad gress made no ndings and did not cite specic or detailed evidence to show how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces an employer's incentives to discriminate against women. And \"Congress . . . said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state\" sick-leave policies. Florida Prepaid, supra, at 644; see Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373. Under this Court's precedents, more is required to subject unconsenting States to suits for damages, particularly where, as here, it is for violations of a provision (the self-care provision) that is a supposedly preventive step in aid of already preventive provisions (the family-care provisions). See Florida Prepaid, supra, at 642 (\"[T]he legislative record still provides little support for the proposition that Congress sought to remedy a Fourteenth Amendment violation in enacting the Patent Remedy Act\"); Kimel, 528 U. S., at 88 (\"One means by which we have made such a determination . . . is by examining the legislative rec\u00adord containing the reasons for Congress' action\"). The \"few fleeting to how self-care leave is in\u00ad separable from family-care leave fall short of what is re\u00adquired for a valid abrogation of States' immunity from suits for damages. Florida Prepaid , supra , at 644. These \"isolated sentences clipped from floor debates\" and testi\u00admony, Kimel, supra, at 89, are stated as conclusions, unsup\u00ad ported by evidence or ndings about how the self-care provi\u00adsion interrelates to the family-care provisions to counteract 42 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Opinion of Kennedy, J. employers' incentives to discriminate against women. Con\u00ad gress must rely on more than abstract generalities to subject the States to suits for damages. Otherwise, Congress could choose to combat the purported effects of the family-care provisions by allowing employees to sue States that do not permit employees to take vacation time under the FMLA. There is nothing in particular about self-care leave, as op\u00adposed to leave for any personal reason, that connects it to gender discrimination. And when the issue, as here, is whether subparagraph (D) can abrogate a State's immunity from damages, there is no sufcient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated nexus, between self-care leave and gender dis\u00adcrimination by state employers. Documented discrimina\u00adtion against women in the general workplace is a persistent, unfortunate reality, and, we must assume, a still prevalent wrong. An explicit purpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to improve workplace conditions for women. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601(b)(4), (5). But States may not be sub\u00adject to suits for damages based on violations of a comprehen\u00adsive statute unless Congress has identied a specic pattern of constitutional violations by state employers. See City of Boerne , 521 U. S., at 532. 3 Petitioner's last defense of the self-care provision is that the provision helps single parents retain their jobs when they become ill. This, however, does not explain how the provision remedies or prevents constitutional violations. The fact that most single parents happen to be women, see, e. g., S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 7, demonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying employers' neutral leave restrictions which have a disparate effect on women. \"Although disparate impact may be relevant evi\u00addence of . . insuf\u00adcient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scru\u00adtiny.\" Garrett, supra, at 372-373; see Tuan Anh Nguyen Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 43 Opinion of Kennedy, J. v. INS, 533 U. S. 53, 82-83 (2001) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239 (1976). To the ex\u00ad tent, then, that the self-care provision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate impact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional violations. Because, moreover, it is \"unlikely that many of the [neutral leave policies] scope of the [self-care provision is] out of pro\u00adportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.\" 82; see City of Boerne , supra, at 519. Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh Amend\u00ad ment immunity from suits for damages. See, e. g., Sossa\u00ad mon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277, 284 (2011) (\"A State . . . may choose to waive its immunity in federal court at its pleas\u00adure\"). Discrimination against women is contrary to the pub\u00adlic policy of the State of Maryland, see, e. g., Maryland's Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. State Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7 20- 606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has conceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35. If the State agrees with petitioner that damages liability for violations of the self-care provision is necessary to combat discrimination against women, the State may waive its immunity or create a parallel state-law cause of action. * * * As a consequence of our constitutional design, money dam\u00ad ages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants. See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder\u00ad man, 451 U. S. 1, 29 (1981). Subjecting States to suits for damages pursuant to \u00a7 5 requires more than a theory for why abrogating the States' immunity aids in, or advances, a stated congressional purpose. To abrogate the States' immunity from suits for damages under \u00a7 5, Congress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations and tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the documented viola\u00adtions. It failed to do so when it allowed employees to sue 44 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Scalia, J., concurring in judgment States for violations of the FMLA's self-care provision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is afrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, concurring. I join the plurality's opinion holding that Congress did not validly abrogate the States' immunity from suit for money damages for violations of the self-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). As the plurality explains, this case is distin\u00adguishable from Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003), which held that Congress validly abro\u00adgated the States' immunity from suit for violations of the FMLA's family-care provision, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C). Ante, at 37. I write separately only to reiterate my view that Hibbs was wrongly decided because the family-care provision is not suf\u00adciently linked to a demonstrated pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the States. See 538 U. S., at 745-754 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., dissenting); Tennessee v. Lane , 541 U. S. 509, 565-566 (2004) (Thomas, J., dissenting). The self-care provision at issue in this case is even further removed from any such pattern. Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment. The plurality's opinion seems to me a faithful application of our \"congruence and proportionality\" jurisprudence. So does the opinion of the dissent. That is because the varying outcomes we have arrived at under the \"congruence and pro\u00adportionality\" test make no sense. Which in turn is because that flabby test is \"a standing invitation to judicial arbitrari\u00adness and policy-driven decisionmaking,\" Tennessee v. Lane , 541 U. S. 509, 557-558 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting). More\u00adover, in the process of applying (or seeming to apply) the test, we must scour the legislative record in search of evi\u00addence that supports the congressional action. See ante , at 37-43; post, at 59-64 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). This grad\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 45 Ginsburg, J., dissenting ing of Congress's homework is a task we are ill suited to perform and ill advised to undertake. I adhere to my view that we should instead adopt an ap\u00ad proach that is properly tied to the text of \u00a7 5, which grants Congress the power \"to enforce , by appropriate legislation,\" the other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Em\u00adphasis added.) As I have explained in greater detail else\u00adwhere, see Lane , supra, at 558-560, outside of the context of racial discrimination (which is different for stare decisis reasons), I would limit Congress's \u00a7 5 power to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Failing to grant state employees leave for the purpose of self-care\u2014or any other purpose, for that matter\u2014does not come close. Accordingly, I would afrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Justice Ginsburg , with whom Justice Breyer joins, and with whom Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan join as to all but footnote 1, dissenting. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Section 5 grants Congress the \"power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the pro\u00advisions of this article.\" Congress' \u00a7 5 enforcement power includes the authority to remedy and deter violations of \u00a7 1's substantive guarantees by prohibiting conduct \"not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\" Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000). \"In other words, Con\u00adgress may enact so-called prophylactic legislation that pro\u00adscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.\" Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 727-728 (2003). The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or Act) entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of job-secured leave during any 12-month period: (A) to care for a newborn son 46 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting or daughter; (B) to care for a newly adopted son or daughter; (C) to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or (D) because the employee has a serious health condition that makes her unable to perform the functions of her position. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1). Even accepting this Court's view of the scope of Congress' power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, I would hold that the self-care provision, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D), validly en\u00adforces the right to be free from gender discrimination in the workplace. 1 I Section 5 legislation \"must be targeted at conduct trans\u00ad gressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive pro\u00ad visions,\" ante, at 36 (internal quotation marks omitted), \"[a]nd '[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.' \" Ibid. (quoting City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997)). The rst step of the now-familiar Boerne inquiry calls for identication of the constitutional right Congress sought to enforce. See, e. g., Tennessee v. Lane , 541 U. S. 509, 522 (2004). The FMLA's self-care provision, Maryland asserts, trains not on the right to be free from gender discrimination, but on an \"equal pro\u00adtection right to be free from irrational state employment discrimination based on a medical condition.\" Brief for Re\u00adspondents 14. The plurality agrees, concluding that the self\u00ad 1 I remain of the view that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immu\u00ad nity pursuant to its Article I Commerce Clause power. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 100 (1996) (Souter, J., dissenting). Beyond debate, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D) is valid Commerce Clause legis\u00ad lation. See infra, at 64-65. I also share the view that Congress can abrogate state immunity pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment where Congress could reasonably conclude that legislation \"constitutes an appropriate way to enforce [a] basic equal protection requirement.\" Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 377 (2001) (Breyer , J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 47 Ginsburg, J., dissenting care provision reveals \"a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not sex.\" Ante , at 38. In so declaring, the plurality undervalues the language, purpose, and history of the FMLA, and the self-care provision's important role in the statutory scheme. As well, the plurality underplays the main theme of our decision in Hibbs: \"The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\" 538 U. S., at 728. I begin with the text of the statute, which repeatedly em\u00ad phasizes gender discrimination. One of the FMLA's stated purposes is to \"entitle employees to take reasonable leave,\" 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2601(b)(2), \"in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family reasons, on a gender-neutral basis,\" \u00a7 2601(b)(4). Another identied aim is \"to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal Protection Clause].\" \u00a7 2601(b)(5). \"[E]mployment standards that apply to one gender only,\" Congress expressly found, \"have serious po\u00adtential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.\" \u00a7 2601(a)(6). The FMLA's purpose and legislative history reinforce the conclusion that the FMLA, in its entirety, is directed at sex discrimination. Indeed, the FMLA was originally en\u00advisioned as a way to guarantee\u2014without singling out women or pregnancy\u2014that pregnant women would not lose their jobs when they gave birth. The self-care provision achieves that aim. A brief history is in order. In his 1982 congressional cam\u00ad paign, then-candidate Howard Berman pledged to introduce legislation similar to the California law challenged in Cali\u00ad fornia Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272 48 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting (1987). S. Wisensale, Family Leave Policy: The Political Economy of Work and Family in America 134 (2001) (herein\u00adafter Wisensale). California's law, enacted in 1978, made it unlawful for an employer to refuse to grant female employ\u00adees disabled by pregnancy or childbirth up to four months' unpaid, job-protected leave. See 1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, \u00a7 1, now codied at Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7 12945(a)(1) (West Supp. 2012). The California law sharply divided women's rights ad\u00ad vocates. \"Equal-treatment\" feminists asserted it violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's (PDA) commitment to treating pregnancy the same as other disabilities. 2 It did so by requiring leave only for disability caused by pregnancy and childbirth, thereby treating pregnancy as sui generis. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae in California Fed., O. T. 1985, No. 85-494, pp. 5-10. \"Equal-opportunity\" feminists disagreed, urging that the California law was consistent with the PDA because it remedied the discriminatory burden that inadequate leave policies placed on a woman's right to procreate. See Brief for Coalition for Reproductive Equality in the Workplace et al. as Amici Curiae in id., at 2-6. See also Williams, Equality's Riddle: Pregnancy and the Equal Treatment/ Special Treatment Debate, 13 N. Y . U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 325, 326-328 (1984-1985) (hereinafter Williams) (discussing disagreement). While California Fed. moved through the lower federal courts, equal-treatment feminists began work on a gender\u00ad 2 Enacted as an addition to the section dening terms used in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) provides: \"The terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' in\u00adclude, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by preg\u00adnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benets under fringe benet programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work . . . .\" 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U.

See Ross, Legal Aspects of Parental Leave, in Parental Leave and Child Care 97 (J. Hyde & M. Essex eds. 1991) (hereinafter Ross). Then-Congressman Berman met with the Women's Legal Defense Fund's Donna Lenhoff, a drafter of the rst FMLA bill. Id., at 114-115, n. 27; Wisensale 136. 3 They agreed that any national bill would focus not only on pregnancy, but on equal treatment for all workers. Ross 114-115, n. 27. See also Kazmier v. Widmann, 225 F. 3d 519, 547 (CA5 2000) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\"Perceiving that enacting the PDA had not achieved the intended result of preventing discrimination against either women or men in the granting of leave time in that the States felt it necessary to afrmatively grant pregnancy leave to women and not men, in 1985 Congress began considering the issue of family and medical leave.\"). Though this Court, in California Fed., eventually upheld California's pregnancy-only leave policy as not preempted by the PDA, equal-treatment feminists continued to believe that viewing pregnancy as sui generis perpetuated widespread discrimination against women. 4 They therefore maintained 3 Lenhoff advanced The Parental and Disability Act of 1985, introduced by Rep. Patricia Schroeder. See S. Wisensale, Family Leave Policy: The Political Economy of Work and Family in America 136-138 (2001). She was later named Vice Chair of the Commission on Leave, created by the FMLA to study family and medical leave policies. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2631- 2632; U. S. Commission on Family and Medical Leave, A Workable Bal\u00adance: Report to Congress on Family and Medical Leave Policies 210 (Apr. 30, 1996). 4 For example, in addition to mandating pregnancy leave, the California statute allowed employers to discriminate against pregnant workers. Employers could refuse to select a pregnant woman for a training program if she would not nish the program at least three months before giving birth. See 1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, \u00a7 1. The law limited pregnancy-disability leave to six weeks, \u00a7 1, and provided that women were to receive paid disability benets for only three weeks after childbirth, \u00a7 2, even if a particular woman remained disabled beyond the three-week period, and even if a man received paid disability benets throughout his disabil\u00ad50 COLEMAN v.

This gives fodder to those who seek to discriminate against women in employment. . . . In the [California Fed.] case, I would have preferred the interpretation urged by the [equal-treatment feminists].\"). Congress agreed. See in fra , at 58-59. Adhering to equal-treatment feminists' aim, the self-care provision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D), prescribes comprehensive leave for women disabled during pregnancy or while recuperating from childbirth\u2014without singling out pregnancy or child\u00adbirth. See S. Rep. No. 101-77, p. 32 (1989) (A \"signicant benet of the temporary medical leave provided by this leg\u00adislation is the form of protection it offers women workers who bear children. Because the bill treats all employees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious health conditions in the same fashion, it does not create the risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed by legislation which provides job protection only for pregnancy-related dis\u00adability. Legislation solely protecting pregnant women gives ity. Finally, although it prohibited employers from refusing to promote a woman because of pregnancy, it did not forbid refusing to hire a woman on that basis. See \u00a7 1. See also Brief for National Organization for Women et al. as Amici Curiae in California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, O. T. 1985, No. 85-494, pp. 14-15. These provisions were all ex\u00adpressly made inapplicable to employers covered by Title VII, \"[i]n the event Congress enacts legislation amending Title VII . . . to prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,\" namely, the PDA. See 1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, \u00a7 4. Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 51 Ginsburg, J., dissenting employers an economic incentive to discriminate against women in hiring policies; legislation helping all workers equally does not have this effect.\"). In view of this history, it is impossible to conclude that \"nothing in particular about self-care leave . . . connects it to gender discrimination.\" Ante, at 42. II A Boerne next asks \"whether Congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 729. See also Boerne , 521 U. S., at 530-532. Beyond question, Congress had evidence of a well-documented pattern of workplace discrimination against pregnant women. Section 2612(a)(1)(D) can therefore \"be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, uncon\u00adstitutional behavior.\" Id., at 532. Although the PDA proscribed blatant discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e(k), 2000e-2, supra, at 48, n. 2, the Act is fairly described as a necessary, but not a sufcient, measure. FMLA hearings conducted between 1986 and 1993 included illustrative testimony from women red after becoming pregnant or giving birth. For example, Beverly Wilkenson was granted seven weeks of leave upon the birth of her child. On the eve of her return to work, a superior informed her that her job had been elimi\u00adnated. He stated: \"Beverly, the best thing for you to do is stay home and take care of your baby and collect your unemployment.\" Hearing on H. R. 770 before the Subcom\u00admittee on Labor-Management Relations of the House Com\u00admittee on Education and Labor, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing) (statement of Bev\u00aderly Wilkenson). See also S. Rep. No. 102-68, p. 27 (1991) (hereinafter 1991 Senate Report) (describing Ms. Wilken\u00adson's testimony). Similarly, Linda Pillsbury was notied that she no longer had a job three weeks after her daughter 52 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting was born.5 Three secretaries at the same workplace were also forced out of their jobs when they returned to work within weeks of giving birth. See Hearings on S. 249 before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcohol\u00adism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Re\u00adsources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 16, 23 (1987) (herein\u00adafter 1987 Senate Hearings) (statement of Linda Pillsbury). These women's experiences, Congress learned, were hardly isolated incidents. A spokeswoman for the Mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs in Chicago testied: \"The lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the workplace has created an environment where discrimination is rampant. Very often we are contacted by women work\u00aders who are at risk of losing their jobs or have lost them because they are pregnant, [or have] given birth.\" Id., at 170 (statement of Peggy Montes). See also Joint Hearing on The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Sub\u00adcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 110, n. 18 (1986) (hereinafter 1986 House Hearing) (statement of Women's Legal Defense Fund) (\"[W]omen who are temporarily unable to work due to pregnancy, child-birth, and related medical conditions such as morning sickness, threatened miscarriage, or complications arising from childbirth, often lose their jobs because of the inadequacy of their employers' leave poli\u00adcies.\"); 1991 Senate Report 28 (recording that an Atlanta-based job counseling hotline received approximately 100 calls each year from women who were red, harassed, or forced out of their jobs due to pregnancy or maternity-disability leave); 139 Cong.

S. 30 (2012) 53 Ginsburg, J., dissenting against as a general rule in our society and have difculty retaining their jobs.\"). As summarized by the American Bar Association: \"Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employ\u00adment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers rst, and workers second. This prevailing ideology about women's roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to\u00adbe.\" 1989 House Hearing 248 (American Bar Associa\u00adtion Background Report). See also Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736 (quoting same language). \"Many pregnant women have been red when their em\u00ad ployer refused to provide an adequate leave of absence,\" Congress had ample cause to conclude. See H. R. Rep. No. 99-699, pt. 2, p. 22 (1986). Pregnancy, Congress also found, has a marked impact on women's earnings. One year after childbirth, mothers' earnings fell to $1.40 per hour less than those of women who had not given birth. See 1991 Senate Report 28. See also 1989 House Hearing 356-357 (Report of 9to5, National Association of Working Women (citing same study)). Congress heard evidence tying this pattern of discrimina\u00ad tion to the States. A 50-state survey by the Yale Bush Cen\u00adter Infant Care Leave Project concluded that \"[t]he propor\u00adtion and construction of leave policies available to public sector employees differs little from those offered private sec\u00adtor employees.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 730, n. 3 (quoting 1986 House Hearing 33 (statement of Meryl Frank)). Roughly 28% of women employed in the public sector did not receive eight weeks of job-protected medical leave to recover from childbirth. See 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 1, pp. 31, 35, 39 (statement of James T. Bond, National Council of Jewish Women). A South Carolina state legislator testied: \"[I]n 54 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting South Carolina, as well as in other states . . . no unemploy\u00ad ment compensation is paid to a woman who is necessarily absent from her place of employment because of pregnancy or maternity.\" See id., pt. 2, p. 361 (statement of Rep. Irene Rudnick). According to an employee of the State of Geor\u00adgia, if state employees took leave, it was held against them when they were considered for promotions: \"It is common practice for my Department to compare the balance sheets of workers who have and have not used [leave] benets in determining who should and should not be promoted.\" Hearing on H. R. 2 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the House Committee on Educa\u00adtion and Labor, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1991) (statement of Robert E. Dawkins). See also id., at 33 (One type of leave for Georgia state employees \"boils down to whether your supervisor wants you to come back or not.\"). In short, Con\u00adgress had every reason to believe that a pattern of workplace discrimination against pregnant women existed in public-sector employment, just as it did in the private sector. B \"[A] state's refusal to provide pregnancy leave to its em\u00ad ployees,\" Maryland responds, is \"not unconstitutional.\" Brief for Respondents 23 (citing Geduldig v. Aiello , 417 U. S. 484, 495 (1974)). Aiello's footnote 20 proclaimed that dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex. In my view, this case is a t occasion to revisit that conclusion. Footnote 20 reads: \"The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is . . . a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677 (1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as such. The California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition\u2014 pregnancy\u2014from the list of compensable disabilities. Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 55 Ginsburg, J., dissenting While it is true that only women can become pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative classication concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classication . . . . \"The lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups\u2014 pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the rst group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The scal and actuarial bene\u00adts of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.\" 417 U. S., at 496-497, n. 20. First, \"[a]s an abstract statement,\" it is \"simply false\" that \"a classication based on pregnancy is gender neutral.\" Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 327 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Rather, discriminating on the basis of pregnancy \"[b]y denition . . . discriminates on account of sex; for it is the capacity to become pregnant which primarily differentiates the female from the male.\" General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, 161-162 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Issacharoff & Rosenblum, Women and the Workplace: Accommodating the Demands of Pregnancy, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 2154, 2180 (1994) (\"[I]t is pre\u00adcisely because pregnancy is a condition unique to women that the exclusion of pregnancy from disability coverage is a sex-based classication . . . .\"). This reality is well illustrated by the facts of Aiello . The California disability-insurance program at issue granted dis\u00adability benets for virtually any conceivable work disability, including those arising from cosmetic surgery, skiing ac\u00adcidents, and alcoholism. See Brief for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as Amicus Curiae in Aiello , O. T. 1973, No. 73-640, p. 7. It also compensated men for disabili\u00adties caused by ailments and procedures that affected men alone: for example, vasectomies, circumcision, and prostatec\u00adtomies. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. 56 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting as Amici Curiae in id., at 17-18. Only pregnancy was ex\u00ad cluded from the denition of disability. See Cal. Un. Ins. Code Ann. \u00a7 2626 (West 1972); Aiello , 417 U. S., at As Justice Brennan insightfully concluded in dissent, \"a limita\u00adtion is imposed upon the disabilities for which women work\u00aders may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered . . . . Such dissimilar treatment of men and women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextrica\u00adbly linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimina\u00adtion.\" Id., at 501. Second, pregnancy provided a central justication for the historic discrimination against women this Court chronicled in Hibbs. See 538 U. S., at 729 (\"[A] proper discharge of [a woman's] maternal functions\u2014having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race\u2014justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the pas\u00adsion of man.\" (quoting Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 422 (1908); 2d and 3d alterations in Hibbs)). See also Siegel, Employment Equality Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 94 Yale L. J. 929, 942 (1985) (Pregnancy is \"a biological difference central to the denition of gender roles, one traditionally believed to render women unt for employ\u00adment.\"). Relatedly, discrimination against pregnant em\u00ad ployees was often \"based not on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning the future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child was born or on views about what her behavior should be.\" Williams 355. See also S. Rep. No. 95-331, p. 3 (1977) (\"[T]he assumption that women will become pregnant and leave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyping resulting in unfavorable disparate treatment of women in the workplace.\"). In sum, childbearing is not only a biological function unique to women. It is also inextricably intertwined with employers' \"stereotypical views about women's commitment to work and their value as employees.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736. Because pregnancy discrimination is inevitably sex discrimination, and because discrimination against women is Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 57 Ginsburg, J., dissenting tightly interwoven with society's beliefs about pregnancy and motherhood, I would hold that Aiello was egregiously wrong to declare that discrimination on the basis of preg\u00adnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex. C Boerne' s third step requires \" 'a congruence and propor\u00ad tionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.' \" Ante, at 36 (quoting 521 U. S., at 520). Section 2612(a)(1)(D), I would conclude, is an appropriate response to pervasive discriminatory treat\u00adment of pregnant women. In separating self-care leave for the physical disability following childbirth, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D), which affects only women, from family-care leave for parent\u00ading a newborn baby, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(A), for which men and women are equally suited, Congress could attack gender dis\u00adcrimination and challenge stereotypes of women as lone childrearers. Cf. Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 731 (States' extended leaves, far exceeding a woman's following childbirth, were attributable \"to the perva\u00adsive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work.\"). It would make scant sense to provide job-protected leave for a woman to care for a newborn, but not for her recovery from delivery, a miscarriage, or the birth of a stillborn baby. And allowing States to provide no pregnancy-disability leave at all, given that only women can become pregnant, would obviously \"exclude far more women than men from the work\u00adplace.\" Id., at 738. The plurality's statement that Congress lacked \"wide\u00ad spread evidence of sex discrimination . . . in the administra\u00adtion of sick leave,\" ante, at 38, misses the point. So too does the plurality's observation that state employees likely \"could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses\"\u2014presumably se\u00advere morning sickness, toxemia, etc.\u2014under paid sick-leave plans, ante, at 39. Congress heard evidence that existing sick-leave plans were inadequate to ensure that women were 58 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting not red when they needed to take time out to recover their strength and stamina after childbirth. The self-care provi\u00adsion responds to that evidence by requiring employers to allow leave for \"ongoing pregnancy, miscarriages, . . . the need for prenatal care, childbirth, and recovery from child\u00adbirth.\" S. Rep. No. 103-3, p. 29 (1993). That \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D) entitles all employees to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for a serious health condition, rather than singling out pregnancy or childbirth, does not mean that the provision lacks the requisite congru\u00adence and proportionality to the identied constitutional vio\u00adlations. As earlier noted, supra, at 50-51, Congress made plain its rationale for the prescription's broader compass: Congress sought to ward off the unconstitutional discrim\u00adination it believed would attend a pregnancy-only leave re\u00adquirement. Under caption \"Equal protection and non\u00addiscrimination,\" Congress explained: \"The FMLA addresses basic leave needs of all employees. . . . This is an important principle reflected in the bill. \"A law providing special protection to women . . . , in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment. Employers might be less inclined to hire women . . . . For example, legislation addressing the needs of pregnant women only might en\u00adcourage discriminatory hiring practices against women of child bearing age. Legislation addressing the needs of all workers equally does not have this effect. By ad\u00addressing the serious leave needs of all employees, the FMLA avoids providing employers the temptation not only on the Com\u00admerce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal pro\u00adtection . . . embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 59 Ginsburg, J., dissenting H. R. Rep. No. 102-135, pt. 1, pp. 27-28 (1991) (herein\u00ad after 1991 House Report). Congress' concern was solidly grounded in workplace real\u00ad ities. After this Court upheld California's pregnancy-only leave policy in California Fed., Don Butler, President of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, one of the plain\u00adtiffs in that case, told National Public Radio reporter Nina Totenberg that, as a result of the decision, \"many employers will be prone to discriminate against women in hiring and hire males instead.\" 1987 House Hearing 36. Totenberg replied, \"But that is illegal, too\"\u2014to which Butler responded, \"Well, that is illegal, but try to prove it.\" Ibid. Finally, as in Hibbs, it is important to note the moderate cast of the FMLA, in particular, the considerable limitations Congress placed on \u00a7\u00a7 2612(a)(1)(A)-(D)'s leave requirement. See 538 U. S., at 738-739. FMLA leave is unpaid. It is lim\u00adited to employees who have worked at least one year for the employer and at least 1,250 hours during the past year. \u00a7\u00a7 2611(2)(A), 2612(d)(1). High-ranking employees, includ\u00ading state elected ofcials and are not within the Act's compass. \u00a7\u00a7 203(e)(2)(C), 2611(3). Employees must provide advance notice of foreseeable leaves. \u00a7 2612(e). Employers may require a doctor's certication of a serious health condition. \u00a7 2613(a). And, if an employer violates the FMLA, the employees' recoverable damages are \"strictly dened and measured by actual monetary losses.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 740 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii)). The self-care provision, I would therefore hold, is congruent and pro\u00adportional to the injury to be prevented. III But even if Aiello senselessly holds sway, and impedes the conclusion that \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D) is an appropriate response to the States' unconstitutional discrimination against pregnant 60 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting women,6 I would nevertheless conclude that the FMLA is valid \u00a7 5 legislation. For it is a meet response to \"the States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and foster\u00ading of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of [parental and family-care] leave benets.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 735. See also id., at 729-731, and n. 5 (Congress adduced evidence \"of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States\" in granting parental and family-care leave). Requiring States to provide gender-neutral parental and family-care leave alone, Congress was warned, would pro\u00admote precisely the type of workplace discrimination Con\u00adgress sought to reduce. The \"pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work,\" id., at 731, Congress heard, led employers to regard required parental and family-care leave as a woman's benet. Carol Ball, 6 Notably, the plurality does not cite or discuss Geduldig v. Aiello , 417 U. S. 484 (1974), perhaps embarrassed by that opinion's widely criticized conclusion that discrimination based on pregnancy does not involve \"dis\u00ad crimination based upon gender as such,\" id., at 496, n. 20. See supra, at 54-57; E. Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law 759 (3d ed. 2006) (\"It is hard to imagine a clearer sex-based distinction\" than the one at issue in Aiello); Kay, Equality and Difference: The Case of Pregnancy, 1 Berkeley Women's L.

These decisions are textbook examples of the effects of underrepresentation on \"legisla\u00adtive\" insensitivity. Imagine what the presence of even one woman Justice would have meant to the Court's conferences.\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 61 Ginsburg, J., dissenting speaking on behalf of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, testi\u00ad ed that she did not think \"there are going to be many men that take up . . . parental leave.\" See Hearing on S. 345 before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs, and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 39 (1989). She frankly ad\u00admitted that she herself would choose to hire a man over an equally qualied woman if parental leave was required by law. Id., at 30. Others similarly testied that mandating gender-neutral parental leave would lead to discrimination against women. A representative of the National Federation of Independent Business stated: \"Requiring employers to provide parental leave benets creates clear pressures for subtle discrimina\u00adtion based on . . . sex. When choosing between two equally qualied candidates, an employer may be more likely to hire the candidate least likely to take the leave. It is the wage levels and jobs of women of childbearing years which are most at risk in such a situation.\" Hearing on H. R. 1 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 95 (1993). See also 1989 House Hearing 169 (state\u00adment of Cynthia Simpler, American Society for Personnel Administration) (\"Since working women will be viewed as the most likely candidates for parental leave, hidden discrim\u00adination will occur if this bill becomes law. Women of child\u00adbearing age will be viewed as risks, potentially disrupting operations through an untimely leave.\"). Conversely\u2014unlike perceptions surrounding who takes parental and family-care leave\u2014Congress was told that men and women take medical leave approximately equally. Ac\u00adcording to one study, male workers missed an average of 4.9 days of work per year due to illness or injury; female work\u00aders missed 5.1 days. See 1991 House Report, pt. 1, p. 28. \"[T]he incidence of serious medical conditions that would be covered by medical leave under the bill,\" Congress deter\u00ad62 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting mined, \"is virtually the same for men and women. Employ\u00ad ers will nd that women and men will take medical leave with equal frequency.\" Ibid. \"[P]arental and medical leave,\" Congress was thus alerted, \"are inseparable\": \"In the words of the old cal leave would . . . encourage discrimination against women of child-bearing age, who constitute approxi\u00admately 73 percent of all the women in the labor force. \"Employers would tend to hire men, who are much less likely to claim [the parental leave] benet. . . . \"Parental leave without medical leave would be the modern version of protective labor laws.\" 1986 House Hearing 33-34 (statement of Irene Natividad, National Women's Political Caucus). Congress therefore had good reason to conclude that the self-care provision\u2014which men no doubt would use\u2014would counter employers' impressions that the FMLA would other\u00adwise install female leave. Providing for self-care would thus reduce employers' corresponding incentive to discriminate against women in hiring and promotion. In other words, \"[t]he availability of self-care leave to men serves to blunt the force of stereotypes of women as primary caregivers by increasing the odds that men and women will invoke the FMLA's leave provisions in near-equal numbers.\" See Brief for National Partnership for Women & Families et al. as Amici Curiae 26. As Judge Lipez explained: \"If Congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for other family members, there is greater likelihood that the FMLA would have been perceived as further reason to avoid granting employment opportunities to women. Heretofore, women have provided most of the child and elder care, and legislation that focused on these duties Cite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 63 Ginsburg, J., dissenting could have had a deleterious impact because of the prev\u00ad alent notion that women take more advantage of such leave policies. The inclusion of personal medical leave in the scheme, unrelated to any need to care for another person, undermines the assumption that women are the only ones taking leave because men, presumably, are as likely as women to get sick.\" Laro v. New Hampshire , 259 F. 3d 1, 21 (CA1 2001) (dissenting opinion). Senator Barbara Boxer advanced a similar point. Re\u00ad sponding to assertions that the FMLA would lead employers to discriminate against women, Senator Boxer stated: \"[T]o say that women will not be hired by business is a specious argument . . . . Men also get sick. They get cancer. They get heart disease. They have ailments. And this bill ap\u00adplies to men and women.\" 139 Cong. Rec. 1697 (1993). See also 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 2, p. 536 (statement of Prof. Susan Deller Ross, Georgetown University Law Center) (\"I just think it's wrong that there will be a perception that this is something that only women will take and they are, there\u00adfore, more expensive. Both men and women have medical conditions . . . .\"). The plurality therefore gets it wrong in concluding that \"[o]nly supposition and conjecture support the contention that the self-care provision is necessary to make the family-care provisions effective.\" Ante, at 41. Self-care leave, I would hold, is a key part of Congress' endeavor to make it feasible for women to work and have families. See 1991 Senate Report 25-26 (\"This legislation is essential if the na\u00adtion is to address the dramatic changes that have occurred in the American workforce in recent years. . . . The once-typical American family, where the father worked for pay and the mother stayed at home with the children, is vanish\u00ading. . . . Today, more than one-half of all mothers with infants under one year of age work outside the home. That gure has doubled since 1970 . . . . By the year 2000, about three out of every four American children will have mothers in the 64 COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting workforce.\"). By reducing an employer's perceived incen\u00ad tive to avoid hiring women, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D) lessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise to the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart. The plurality of\u00adfers no legitimate ground to dilute the force of the Act. IV Two additional points. First, this Court reached a differ\u00ad ent conclusion than the one I reach here in Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001), and Kimel, 528 U. S. 62. In those cases, as we observed in Hibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age discrimina\u00adtion, respectively. Neither disability nor age is a suspect classication under this Court's Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the basis of dis\u00ad ability or age as long as the classication is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366- 367; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 83-84. Therefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress needed to rely on a pattern of irra\u00adtional state discrimination on the basis of disability or age. See Garrett, 531 U. S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89. Here, however, Congress homed in on gender discrimination, which triggers heightened review. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 531 (1996) (\"Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justication for that action.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). \"[I]t was [therefore] easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.\" Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736. Finally, the plurality's opinion does not authorize state em\u00ad ployers to violate the FMLA, although it does block injured employees from suing for monetary relief. The self-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legislation, Mary\u00adland concedes, and consequently binds the States, as well as the private sector. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25; Brief for Respond\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 30 (2012) 65 Ginsburg, J., dissenting ents 32-33. An employee wrongly denied self-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursuant to Ex parte Young , 209 U. S. 123 (1908), seek injunctive relief against the responsible state ofcial. See Brief for Respondents 33. Moreover, the U. S. Department of Labor may bring an ac\u00adtion against a State for violating the self-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an employee's behalf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2617(b)(2)-(3), (d). V The plurality pays scant attention to the overarching aim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work while sustaining family life. Over the course of eight years, Con\u00adgress considered the problem of workplace discrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to reduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs. Essential to its design, Con\u00adgress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared to women only. Congress thereby reduced employers' incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women's economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more egalitarian relationship at home and at work. The self-care provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my view, a valid exercise of congressional power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 66 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES, dba MAYO MEDICAL LABORATORIES, et al. v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit No. 10-1150. Argued December 7, 2011\u2014Decided March 20, 2012 Although \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\" are not patentable subject matter under \u00a7 101 of the Patent Act, Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U. S. 175, 185, \"an application of a law of nature . . . to a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection,\" id., at 187. But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent- eligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words \"apply it.\" See, e. g., Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 71-72. It must limit its reach to a particular, inventive application of the law. Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. When ingested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the bloodstream. Because patients metabolize these drugs differently, doctors have found it difcult to determine whether a particular patient's dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective. The patent claims here set forth processes embodying researchers' ndings that identify correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision. Each claim recites (1) an \"administer\u00ading\" step\u2014instructing a doctor to administer the drug to his patient\u2014 (2) a \"determining\" step\u2014telling the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patient's blood\u2014and (3) a \"wherein\" step\u2014 describing the metabolite concentrations above which there is a likeli\u00ad hood of harmful side effects and below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and informing the doctor that metabolite concen\u00adtrations above or below these thresholds \"indicate a need\" to decrease or increase (respectively) the drug dosage. Petitioners Mayo Collaborative Services and Mayo Clinic Rochester (Mayo) bought and used diagnostic tests based on Prometheus' patents. But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and market its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus sued Mayo contend\u00ading that Mayo's test infringed its patents. The District Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary judgment to Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 67 Syllabus Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena\u2014namely, the correlations be\u00adtween thiopurine metabolite levels and the efcacy of thio\u00adpurine drugs\u2014and therefore are not patentable. The Federal Circuit reversed, nding the processes to be patent eligible under the Circuit's \"machine-or-transformation test.\" On remand from this Court for re\u00adconsideration light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, which claried that \"machine-or-transformation test\" is not a denitive test of pat\u00adent eligibility, id., at 603-604, the Federal Circuit reafrmed its earlier conclusion. Held: Prometheus' process is not patent eligible. Pp. 77-92. (a) Because the laws of nature recited by Prometheus' patent claims\u2014the relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a thiopurine drug dosage will prove ineffective or cause harm\u2014are not themselves patentable, the claimed processes are not patentable unless they have additional features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to monopolize the correlations. The three additional steps in the claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufcient to trans\u00adform the nature of the claims. The \"administering\" step simply identi\u00ades a group of people who will be interested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Doctors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these patents existed. And a \"prohibition against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.' \" Bil- ski, supra, at 610-611. The \"wherein\" clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test results when making their treatment decisions. The \"determining\" step tells a doctor to measure patients' metabolite levels, through whatever process the doctor wishes to use. Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, con\u00ad ventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the eld. Such activity is normally not sufcient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 590. Finally, considering the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already pres\u00adent when the steps are considered separately. Pp. 77-80. (b) A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents rein\u00ad forces this conclusion. Pp. 80-87. 68 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Syllabus (1) Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both ad\u00ad dressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of nature, are not themselves patentable. In Diehr the overall process was pat\u00ad ent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process inte\u00ad grated the equation into the process as a whole. 450 U. S., at 187. These additional steps transformed the process into an inventive appli\u00adcation of the formula. But in Flook the additional steps of the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and the particular chemical processes at issue were all \"well known,\" to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no \"inventive concept\" in the claimed application of the formula. 437 U. S., at 594. Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is weaker than Diehr 's patent- eligible claim and no stronger than Flook 's unpatentable one. The three steps add nothing specic to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the eld. Pp. 80-82. (2) Further support for the view that simply appending conven\u00ad tional steps, specied at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenom\u00adena, and ideas patentable is provided in O'Reilly v. Morse , 15 How. 62, 114-115; Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67. Pp. 82-85. (3) This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent law not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of laws of nature and the like. See, e. g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 67, 68. Rewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might encourage their discovery. But because those laws and principles are \"the basic tools of scientic and technological work,\" id., at 67, there is a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process is no more than a general instruction to \"apply the natural law,\" or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify. The patent claims at issue implicate this concern. In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correlations they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision regardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the inference he draws using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit the development of more rened treatment recommendations that combine Prometheus' correlations with later dis\u00adcoveries. This reinforces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent. Pp. 85-87. Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 69 Syllabus (c) Additional arguments supporting Prometheus' position\u2014that the process is patent eligible because it passes the \"machine-or\u00ad transformation test\"; that, because the particular laws of nature that the claims embody are narrow and specic, the patents should be upheld; that the Court should not invalidate these patents under \u00a7 101 because the Patent Act's other validity requirements will screen out overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnostic laws of nature\u2014do not lead to a different conclusion.

Morse , How. 62, 112-120 Webster's Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841) (English case discussing same). Thus, the Court has written that \"a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter. Likewise, Ein\u00adstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc 2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity. Such dis\u00adcoveries are 'manifestations of . . . nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.' \" Chakrabarty , supra, at 309 (quoting Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948)). \"Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patent\u00adable, as they are the basic tools of scientic and technological work.\" Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972). And monopolization of those tools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it. The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an in\u00ad terpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscerate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenom\u00adena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court pointed out that \" 'a process is not unpatentable simply because it con\u00adtains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm.' \" 450 U. S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that \"an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection.\" Diehr , supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice Stone's similar observa\u00adtion in Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939): \" 'While a scientic truth, or the mathematical expres\u00ad sion of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel and use\u00adful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scien\u00ad72 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court tic truth may be.' \" 450 U. S., at 188 (quoting Mackay Radio , supra, at 94). See also Funk Brothers, supra, at 130 (\"If there is to be invention from [a discovery of a law of nature], it must come from the application of the law of nature to a new and use\u00adful end\"). Still, as the Court has also made clear, to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law, one must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words \"apply it.\" See, e. g., Ben\u00ad son, supra, at 71-72. The case before us lies at the intersection of these basic principles. It concerns patent claims covering processes that help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat patients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a given dos\u00adage level is too low or too high. The claims purport to apply natural laws describing the relationships between the con\u00adcentration in the blood of certain thiopurine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage will be ineffective or in\u00adduce harmful side effects. We must determine whether the claimed processes have transformed these unpatentable nat\u00adural laws into patent-eligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they have not done so and that therefore the processes are not patentable. Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the particular claims before us in light of the Court's precedents. Those cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes in ways that make patent eligibility \"depend simply on the drafts\u00adman's art\" without reference to the \"principles underlying the prohibition against patents for [natural laws].\" Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against upholding patents that claim processes that too broadly pre-empt the use of a natu\u00adral law. Morse , supra, at 112-120; Benson, supra, at 71-72. And they insist that a process that focuses upon the use of a natural law also contain other elements or a combination of elements, sometimes referred to as an \"inventive concept,\" Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 73 Opinion of the Court sufcient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to signicantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself. Flook, supra, at 594; see also Bilski, 561 U. (\"[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the for\u00admula to a particular technological environment' or adding at 191-192)). We nd that the process claims at issue here do not satisfy these conditions. In particular, the steps in the claimed processes (apart from the natural laws themselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the eld. At the same time, upholding the patents would risk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further discoveries. I A The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient ingests a thi\u00adopurine compound, his body metabolizes the drug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream. Because the way in which people metabolize thiopurine compounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug affects different people differently, and it has been difcult for doctors to deter\u00admine whether for a particular patient a given dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective. At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents were made, scientists already understood that the levels in a patient's blood of certain metabolites, including, in particular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6-TG) and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6-MMP), were correlated with the likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine drug 74 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U. S. Patent No. 6,355,623, col. 8, ll. 37-40, 2 App. 10 (\"Previous studies suggested that measurement of [6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)] metabolite levels can be used to predict clinical efcacy and tolerance to azathioprine or 6-MP\" (citing Cuffari, Th\u00e9or\u00eat, Latour, & Seidman, 6-Mercaptopurine Metabolism in Crohn's Disease: Correlation With Efcacy and Toxicity, 39 Gut 401 (1996))). But those in the eld did not know the precise cor\u00adrelations between metabolite levels and likely harm or inef\u00adfectiveness. The patent claims at issue here set forth proc\u00adesses embodying researchers' ndings that identied these correlations with some More specically, the patents\u2014U. S. Patent No. 6,355,623 ('623 patent) and U. S. Patent No. 6,680,302 ('302 patent)\u2014 embody ndings that concentrations in a patient's blood of 6-TG or of 6-MMP metabolite beyond a certain level (400 and 7,000 picomoles (pmol) per 8\u00d710 8 red blood cells, respec\u00ad tively) indicate that the dosage is likely too high for the pa\u00adtient, while concentrations in the blood of 6-TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230 pmol per 8\u00d710 8 red blood cells) indicate that the dosage is likely too low to be effective. The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set of processes. Like the Federal Circuit we take as typical claim 1 of the '623 patent, which describes one of the claimed proc\u00adesses as follows: \"A method of optimizing therapeutic of an immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, comprising: \"(a) administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine a subject having said immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder; and \"(b) determining the level sub\u00ad ject having said immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 75 Opinion of the Court \"wherein the level of 6-thioguanine less than about 230 pmol per 8\u00d7108 red blood cells indicates a need to in\u00ad crease the amount of said drug subsequently adminis\u00adtered to said subject and \"wherein the level of 6-thioguanine greater than about 400 pmol per 8\u00d710 8 red blood cells indicates a need to decrease the amount of said drug subsequently adminis\u00adtered to said subject.\" '623 patent, col. 20, ll. 10-25, 2 App. 16. For present purposes we may assume that the other claims in the patents do not differ signicantly from claim 1. B Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the '623 and '302 patents. It sells diagnostic tests that embody the processes the patents describe. For some time petitioners, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Collaborative Services (collectively Mayo), bought and used those tests. But in 2004 Mayo an\u00adnounced that it intended to begin using and selling its own test\u2014a test using somewhat higher metabolite levels to de\u00adtermine toxicity (450 pmol per 8\u00d710 8 6-TG and 5,700 pmol for 6-MMP). Prometheus then brought this ac\u00ad tion claiming patent infringement. The District Court found that Mayo's test infringed claim 7 of the '623 patent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a-115a. In interpreting the claim, the court accepted Prometheus' view that the toxicity-risk-level numbers in Mayo's test and the claim were too similar to render the tests signicantly differ\u00adent. The number Mayo used (450) was too close to the num\u00adber the claim used (400) to matter given appropriate margins of error. Id., at 98a-107a. The District Court also ac\u00ad cepted Prometheus' view that a doctor using Mayo's test could violate the patent even if he did not actually alter his treatment decision in the light of the test. In doing so, the court construed the claim's language, \"indicates a need to 76 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court decrease\" (or \"to increase\"), as not limited to instances in which the doctor actually decreases (or increases) the dosage level where the test results suggest that such an adjustment is advisable. Id., at 107a-109a; see also Brief for Respond\u00ad ent i (describing claimed processes as of . . . (emphasis added)). Nonetheless the District Court ultimately granted sum\u00ad mary judgment in Mayo's favor. The court reasoned that the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenom\u00adena\u2014namely, the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity and efcacy of thiopurine drug dos\u00adages\u2014and so are not patentable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-83a. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed. It pointed out that in addition to these natural correlations, the claimed processes specify the steps of (1) \"administering a [thiopu\u00adrine] drug\" to a patient and (2) \"determining the [resulting metabolite] level.\" These steps, it explained, involve the transformation of the human body or of blood taken from the body. Thus, the patents satised the Circuit's \"machine or transformation test,\" which the court thought sufcient to \"confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds,\" thereby bringing the claims into compliance with \u00a7 101. Prometheus Labs., Inc. v. F. 3d 1336, 1345, 1346-1347 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mayo led a petition for certiorari. We granted the peti\u00ad tion, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for recon\u00adsideration in light of Bilski, 561 U. S. 593, which claried that the \"machine-or-transformation test\" is not a denitive test of patent eligibility, but only an important and useful clue, id., at 603-604. On remand the Federal Circuit reaf\u00ad rmed its earlier conclusion. It thought that the \"machine\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 77 Opinion of the Court or-transformation test,\" understood merely as an important and useful clue, nonetheless led to the \"clear and compelling conclusion . . do not encompass laws of nature or preempt natural correlations.\" 628 F. 3d 1347, 1355 (2010). Mayo again led a petition for certiorari, which we granted. II Prometheus' patents set forth laws of nature\u2014namely, re\u00ad lationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm. Claim 1, for ex\u00adample, states that if the levels of 6-TG in the blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopurine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8\u00d710 8 red blood cells, then the adminis\u00ad tered dose is likely to produce toxic side effects. While it takes a human action (the administration of a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this relation in a particu\u00adlar person, the relation itself exists in principle apart from any human action. The relation is a consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds are metabolized by the body\u2014entirely natural processes. And so a patent that sim\u00adply describes that relation sets forth a natural law. The question before us is whether the claims do signi\u00ad cantly more than simply describe these natural relations. To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible proc\u00adesses that apply natural laws? We believe that the answer to this question is no. A If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a proc\u00ad ess reciting a law of nature, unless that process has addi\u00adtional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example, could not 78 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court simply recite a law of nature and then add the instruction \"apply the law.\" Einstein, we assume, could not have pat\u00adented his famous law by claiming a process consisting of sim\u00adply telling linear accelerator operators to refer to the law to determine how much energy an amount of mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archimedes have se\u00adcured a patent for his famous principle of flotation by claim\u00ading a process consisting of simply telling boat builders to refer to that principle in order to determine whether an ob\u00adject will float. What else is there in the claims before us? The process that each claim recites tells doctors interested in the subject about the correlations that the researchers discovered. In doing so, it recites an \"administering\" step, a \"determining\" step, and a \"wherein\" step. These additional steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufcient to transform the nature of the claim. First, the \"administering\" step simply refers to the rele\u00ad vant audience, namely, doctors who treat patients with cer\u00adtain diseases with thiopurine drugs. That audience is a pre\u00adexisting audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long before anyone asserted these claims. In any event, the \"prohibi\u00adtion against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circum\u00advented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.' \" Bilski, supra, at 610-611 (quoting Diehr , 450 U. S., at 191-192). Second, the \"wherein\" clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion that he should take those laws into account when treating his patient. That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant audi\u00adence about the laws while trusting them to use those laws appropriately where they are relevant to their decision-making (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator opera\u00adtors about his basic law and then trusting them to use it where relevant). Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 79 Opinion of the Court Third, the \"determining\" step tells the doctor to deter\u00ad mine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood, through whatever process the doctor or the laboratory wishes to use. As the patents state, methods for determin\u00ading metabolite levels were well known in the art. '623 pat\u00adent, col. 9, ll. 12-65, 2 App. 11. Indeed, scientists routinely measured metabolites as part of their investigations into the relationships between metabolite levels and efcacy and tox\u00adicity of thiopurine compounds. '623 patent, col. 8, ll. 37-40, id., at 10. Thus, this step tells doctors to engage in well- understood, routine, conventional activity previously en\u00ad gaged in by scientists who work in the eld. Purely \"con\u00adventional or obvious\" \"[pre]-solution activity\" is normally not sufcient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Flook, 437 U. S., at 590; see also Bilski, S., 450 U. S., at 191-192)). Fourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combina\u00ad tion adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately. See id., at 188 (\"[A] new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combina\u00adtion were well known and in common use before the combina\u00adtion was made\"). Anyone who wants to make use of these laws must rst administer a thiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite concentrations, and so the combina\u00adtion amounts to nothing signicantly more than an instruc\u00adtion to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients. The upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to gather data from which they may draw an inference in light of the correlations. To put the matter more succinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about certain laws of na\u00adture; any additional steps consist of well-understood, routine, 80 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court conventional activity already engaged in by the scientic community; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing signicant beyond the sum of their parts taken sepa\u00adrately. For these reasons we believe that the steps are not sufcient to transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications of those regularities. B 1 A more detailed consideration of the controlling prece\u00ad dents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly on point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court reached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of processes that embodied the equivalent of natural laws. The Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method for molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, molded products. The process used a known mathematical equa\u00adtion, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when (depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the time the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of the rubber) to open the press. It consisted in effect of the steps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on the inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers into a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation to continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3) conguring the computer so that at the appropriate moment it would signal \"a device\" to open the press. Diehr , 450 U. S., at 177-179. The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical equa\u00ad tion, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But it found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole. Those steps included \"installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly determining the temperature of the mold, constantly recalculating the ap\u00adpropriate cure time through the use of the formula and a digital computer, and automatically opening the press at the Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 81 Opinion of the Court proper time.\" Id., at 187. It nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional. And so the patentees did not \"seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,\" but sought \"only to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process.\" Ibid. These other steps appar\u00ad ently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law's objectives had signicance\u2014they transformed the proc\u00adess into an inventive application of the formula. The process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a method for adjusting \"alarm limits\" in the catalytic con\u00ad version of hydrocarbons. Certain operating conditions (such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are continuously monitored during the conversion process, signal inefciency or danger when they exceed certain \"alarm lim\u00adits.\" The claimed process amounted to an improved system for updating those alarm limits through the steps of: (1) mea\u00adsuring the current level of the variable, e. g., the tempera\u00ad ture; (2) using an apparently novel mathematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits; and (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit values. 437 U. S., at 585-587. The Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic mathe\u00ad matical equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But it characterized the claimed process as doing nothing other than \"provid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula for com\u00adputing an updated alarm limit.\" at 586. Un\u00ad like the process in , it did not \"explain how the vari\u00ad ables used in the formula were to be selected, nor did the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical processes at work or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting the alarm limit.\" Diehr , supra, at 192, n. 14; see also Flook, 437 U. S., at 586. And so the other steps in the process did not limit the claim to a particular application. Moreover, \"[t]he chemical processes involved in catalytic conversion of 82 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court hydrocarbons[,] . . . the practice of monitoring the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits to trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must be recomputed and readjusted, and the use of computers for 'automatic monitoring-alarming' \" were all \"well known,\" to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no \"inven\u00adtive concept\" in the claimed application of the formula. Id., at 594. \"[P]ost-solution activity\" that is purely \"conven\u00adtional or obvious,\" the Court wrote, \"can[not] transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\" Id., at 589, 590. The claim before us presents a case for patentability that is weaker than the (patent-eligible) claim in Diehr and no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook. Beyond picking out the relevant audience, namely, those who admin\u00adister doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim simply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level of the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatentable) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate the current toxicity/ inefcacy limits, and (3) reconsider the drug dosage in light of the law. These instructions add nothing specic to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the eld. And since they are steps that must be taken in order to apply the laws in question, the effect is simply to tell doc\u00adtors to apply the law somehow when treating their patients. The process in Diehr was not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized in roughly this way. 2 Other cases offer further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specied at a high level of gen\u00aderality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patent\u00adable. This Court has previously discussed in detail an Eng\u00adlish case, Neilson, which involved a patent claim that posed Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 83 Opinion of the Court a legal problem very similar to the problem now before us. The patent applicant there asserted a claim \"for the improved application of air to produce heat in res, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus is required. [The invention] was to be applied as follows: The blast or current of air produced by the blowing ap\u00adparatus was to be passed from it into an air-vessel or receptacle made sufciently strong to endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into the re, the recept\u00adacle be kept articially heated to a considerable tempera\u00adture by heat externally applied.\" Morse , 15 How., at 114-115. The English court concluded that the claimed process did more than simply instruct users to use the principle that hot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it explained how the principle could be implemented in an inventive way. Baron Parke wrote (for the court): \"It is very difcult to distinguish [Neilson's claim] from the specication of a patent for a principle, and this at rst created in the minds of some of the court much difculty; but after full consideration, we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine embodying a principle, and a very valuable one. We think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had rst invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this\u2014by interposing a receptacle for heated air between the blowing apparatus and the furnace. In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes the object of apply\u00ading the blast, which was before of cold air, in a heated state to the furnace.\" Neilson v. Harford, Webster's Patent Cases, at 371. 84 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court Thus, the claimed process included not only a law of nature but also several unconventional steps (such as inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that conned the claims to a particular, useful application of the principle. In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process for hedging risks of price changes by, for example, contract\u00ading to purchase commodities from sellers at a xed price, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a drop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a xed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge against a price increase. One claim described the process; another reduced the process to a mathematical formula. 561 U. S., at 599. The Court held that the described \"concept of hedging\" was \"an unpatentable abstract idea.\" Id., at 611. The fact that some of the claims limited hedging to use in commodities and energy markets and specied that \"well\u00adknown random analysis techniques [could be used] to help establish some of the inputs into the equation\" did not under\u00admine this conclusion, for \"Flook established that limiting an abstract idea to one eld of use or adding token postsolu\u00adtion components did not make the concept patentable.\" Id., at 612. Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentability of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded deci\u00admal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general purpose digital computer. The claims \"purported to cover any use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of any type.\" 409 U. S., at 64, 65. The Court recognized that \" 'a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientic truth' \" might be patentable. Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio , 306 U. S., at 94). But it held that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely, a computer, was not a patentable applica\u00adtion of that principle. For the mathematical formula had \"no substantial practical application except in connection Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 85 Opinion of the Court with a digital computer.\" Benson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims before us) was overly broad; it did not differ signicantly from a claim that just said \"apply the algorithm.\" 3 The Court has repeatedly emphasized this last mentioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit further discov\u00adery by improperly tying up the future use of laws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as unpatentable Samuel Morse's general claim for \" 'the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . . however developed, for making or printing intelligible characters, letters, or signs, at any distances,' \" 15 How., at 86 (history of the case). The Court explained: \"For aught that we now know some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or galvanic current, without using any part of the proc\u00adess or combination set forth in the plaintiff's specica\u00adtion. His invention may be less complicated\u2014less liable to get out of order\u2014less expensive in construction, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benet of it without the permission of this patentee.\" Id., at 113. Similarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims before it were \"so abstract and sweeping as to cover both known and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula].\" 409 U. S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that to allow \"petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all elds.\" 561 U. S., at 612. And in Flook the Court expressed concern that the claimed process was simply \"a formula for computing an updated alarm limit,\" which might \"cover a broad range of potential uses.\" 437 U. S., at 586. 86 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court These statements reflect the fact that, even though re\u00ad warding with patents those who discover new laws of nature and the like might well encourage their discovery, those laws and principles, considered generally, are \"the basic tools of scientic and technological work.\" Benson, supra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of patents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation premised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process amounts to no more than an instruction to \"apply the natural law,\" or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify. See gener\u00adally Lemley, Risch, Sichelman, & Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 L. Rev. 1315 (2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that \u00a7 101 reflects this kind of concern); see also C. Bohan\u00adnan & H. Hovenkamp, Creation Without Restraint: Pro\u00admoting Liberty and Rivalry in Innovation 112 (2012) (\"One problem with [process] patents is that the more abstractly their claims are stated, the more difcult it is to determine precisely what they cover. They risk being applied to a wide range of situations that were not anticipated by the patentee\"); W. Landes & R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 305-306 (2003) (The exclusion from patent law of basic truths reflects \"both . . . the enor\u00admous potential for rent seeking that would be created if property rights could be obtained in them and . . . the enor\u00admous transaction costs that would be imposed on would-be users [of those truths]\"). The laws of nature at issue here are narrow laws that may have limited applications, but the patent claims that embody them nonetheless implicate this concern. They tell a treat\u00ading doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the statistical relation\u00adships they describe. In doing so, they tie up the doctor's subsequent treatment decision whether that treatment does, or does not, change in light of the inference he has drawn Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 87 Opinion of the Court using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit the de\u00ad velopment of more rened treatment recommendations (like that embodied in Mayo's test) that combine Prometheus' correlations with later discovered features of metabolites, human physiology, or individual patient characteristics. The \"determining\" step too is set forth in highly general language covering all processes that make use of the correla\u00adtions after measuring metabolites, including later discovered processes that measure metabolite levels in new ways. We need not, and do not, now decide whether were the steps at issue here less conventional, these features of the claims would prove sufcient to invalidate them. For here, as we have said, the steps add nothing of signicance to the natural laws themselves. Unlike, say, a typical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an existing drug, the patent claims do not conne their reach to particular applications of those laws. The presence here of the basic underlying con\u00adcern that these patents tie up too much future use of laws of nature simply reinforces our conclusion that the processes described in the patents are not patent eligible, while elimi\u00adnating any temptation to depart from case law precedent. III We have considered several further arguments in support of Prometheus' position. But they do not lead us to adopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in uphold\u00ad ing the patent eligibility of the claims before us, relied on this Court's determination that \"[t]ransformation and reduc\u00adtion of an article 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\" Benson, supra, at 70-71 9; 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877). It reasoned that the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible, since they involve transforming the 88 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court human body by administering a thiopurine drug and trans\u00ad forming the blood by analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F. 3d, at 1356-1357. The rst of these transformations, however, is irrelevant. As we have pointed out, the \"administering\" step simply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are likely in\u00adterested in applying the law of nature. See supra, at 78. And the second step could be satised without transforming the blood, should science develop a totally different system for determining metabolite levels that did not involve such a transformation. See supra, at 87. Regardless, in stating that the \"machine-or-transformation\" test is an \" important and useful clue\" to patentability, we have neither said nor implied that the test trumps the \"la[w] of nature\" exclusion. Bilski, 561 U. S., at 603 (emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here. Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular laws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow and specic, the patents should be upheld. Thus, it encour\u00adages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature based on whether or not they will interfere signicantly with inno\u00advation in other elds now or in the future. Brief for Re\u00adspondent 42-46; see also Lemley 1342-1344 (making similar argument). But the underlying functional concern here is a relative one: how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor. See supra, at 86. A patent upon a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future research as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein's law of relativ\u00adity, but the creative value of the discovery is also consider\u00adably smaller. And, as we have previously pointed out, even a narrow law of nature (such as the one before us) can inhibit future research. See supra, at 86-87. In any event, our cases have not distinguished among dif\u00ad ferent laws of nature according to whether or not the princi\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 89 Opinion of the Court ples they embody are sufciently narrow. See, e. g., Flook, 437 U. S. 584 (holding narrow mathematical formula unpat\u00ad entable). And this is understandable. Courts and judges are not institutionally well suited to making the kinds of judgments needed to distinguish among different laws of na\u00adture. And so the cases have endorsed a bright-line prohibi\u00adtion against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas, and the like, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying \"building-block\" concern. Third, the Government argues that virtually any step be\u00ad yond a statement of a law of nature itself should transform an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially patentable application sufcient to satisfy \u00a7 101's demands. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae . The Government does not necessarily believe that claims that (like the claims be\u00adfore us) extend just minimally beyond a law of nature should receive patents. But in its view, other statutory provi\u00adsions\u2014those that insist that a claimed process be novel, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 102, that it not be obvious in light of prior art, \u00a7 103, and that it be \"full[y], clear[ly], concise[ly], and exact[ly]\" described, \u00a7 112\u2014can perform this screening function. In particular, it argues that these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under \u00a7 102. This approach, however, would make the \"law of nature\" exception to \u00a7 101 patentability a dead letter. The approach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The relevant cases rest their holdings upon \u00a7101, not later sections. Bil- ski, supra; Diehr , supra; Flook, supra; Benson, 409 U. S. 63. See also H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1952) (\"A person may have 'invented' a machine or a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not necessarily patentable under section 101 unless the conditions of the title are fullled\" (emphasis added)). 90 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court We recognize that, in evaluating the signicance of addi\u00ad tional steps, the \u00a7 101 patent-eligibility inquiry and, say, the \u00a7 102 novelty inquiry might sometimes overlap. But that need not always be so. And to shift the patent-eligibility inquiry entirely to these later sections risks creating sig\u00adnicantly greater legal uncertainty, while assuming that those sections can do work that they are not equipped to do. What role would laws of nature, including newly discov\u00ad ered (and \"novel\") laws of nature, play in the Government's suggested \"novelty\" inquiry? Intuitively, one would sup\u00adpose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel. The Government, however, suggests in effect that the novelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded when evaluat\u00ading the novelty of the whole. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. But \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 say nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were part of the prior art when applying those sections. Cf. Diehr, 450 U. S., at 188 (patent claims \"must be considered as a whole\"). And studiously ignoring all laws of nature when evaluating a patent application under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 would \"make all inventions unpatentable because all inventions can be re\u00adduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their implementation obvious.\" Id., at 189, n. 12. See also Eisenberg, Wisdom of the Ages or Dead-Hand Con\u00adtrol? Patentable Subject Matter for Diagnostic Methods After In re Bilski, 3 Case W. Res. J. L. Tech. & Internet 1, 54-55 (2012); 2 D. Chisum, Patents \u00a7 5.03[3] (2005). Section 112 requires only description of the in\u00ad vention . . . in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art . . . to make and use the same.\" It does not focus on the possibility that a law of nature (or its equivalent) that meets these conditions will nonetheless create the kind of risk that underlies the law of nature exception, namely, the risk that a patent on the law Cite as: 566 U. S. 66 (2012) 91 Opinion of the Court would signicantly impede future innovation. See Lemley 1329-1332 (outlining differences between \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 59-61 (similar). Compare Ev\u00ad Patentable, 75 Tenn. L. Rev. 591 (2008) (defend\u00ading a minimalist approach to \u00a7 101), with Lemley (reflecting Risch's change of mind). These considerations lead us to decline the Government's invitation to substitute \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103, and 112 inquiries for the better established inquiry under \u00a7 101. Fourth, Prometheus, supported by several amici, argues that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will interfere signicantly with the ability of medical researchers to make valuable discoveries, particularly in the area of diag\u00adnostic research. That research, which includes research leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is expensive; it \"ha[s] made the United States the world leader in this eld\"; and it requires protection. Brief for Respondent 52. Other medical experts, however, argue strongly against a legal rule that would make the present claims patent eligible, invoking policy considerations that point in the opposite di\u00adrection. The American Medical Association, the American College of Medical Genetics, the American Hospital Associa\u00adtion, the American Society of Human Genetics, the Associa\u00adtion of American Medical Colleges, the Association for Mo\u00adlecular Pathology, and other medical organizations tell us that if \"claims to exclusive rights over the body's natural responses to illness and medical treatment are permitted to stand, the result will be a vast thicket of exclusive rights over the use of critical scientic data that must remain widely available if physicians are to provide sound medical care.\" Brief for American College of Medical Genetics et al. as Amici Curiae 7; see also App. to Brief for Association Internationale pour la Protection de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellect\u00aduelle et al. as Amici Curiae A6, A16 (methods of medical treatment are not patentable in most of Western Europe). 92 MA YO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS LABORATORIES, INC. Opinion of the Court We do not nd this kind of difference of opinion surprising. Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides monetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery. On the other hand, that very exclusivity can impede the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using the patented ideas once created, requiring potential users to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing patents and pending patent applications, and requiring the negotiation of complex licensing arrangements. At the same time, patent law's general rules must govern inventive activity in many differ\u00adent elds of human endeavor, with the result that the practi\u00adcal effects of rules that reflect a general effort to balance these considerations may differ from one eld to another. See Bohannan & Hovenkamp, Creation Without Restraint, at 98-100. In consequence, we must hesitate before departing from established general legal rules lest a new protective rule that seems to suit the needs of one eld produce unforeseen results in another. And we must recognize the role of Con\u00adgress in crafting more nely tailored rules where necessary. Cf. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 161-164 (special rules for plant patents). We need not determine here whether, from a policy perspec\u00adtive, increased protection for discoveries of diagnostic laws of nature is desirable. * * * For these reasons, we conclude that the patent claims at issue here effectively claim the underlying laws of nature themselves. The claims are consequently invalid. And the Federal Circuit's judgment is reversed. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 93 Syllabus ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC., et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1399. Argued January 11, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2012 The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) creates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible employee's disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States. Benets for most types of disabilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an injured employee is \"newly awarded compensation.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 906(c). The LHWCA requires employers to pay benets vol\u00ad untarily, without formal administrative proceedings. Typically, em\u00adployers pay benets without contesting liability, so no compensation orders are issued. However, if an employer controverts liability, or an employee contests his employer's actions with respect to his benets, the dispute proceeds to the Department of Labor's Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be resolved, if possible, through informal procedures. An informal disposition may result in a compen\u00adsation order. If not resolved informally, the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order. In scal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska ma\u00ad rine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services, Inc. Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts bene\u00adts until scal year 2005. Roberts then led an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land controverted. In scal year 2007, an ALJ awarded Rob\u00aderts benets at the scal year 2002 statutory maximum rate. Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for scal year 2007, when, he argued, he was \"newly awarded compensation\" by order of the ALJ. The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of Labor's Bene\u00adts Review Board afrmed, concluding that the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences. The Ninth Cir\u00adcuit afrmed. Held: An employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" when he rst becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benets, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf. Pp. 100113. 94 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Syllabus (a) Roberts contends that the statutory term \"awarded compensa\u00ad tion\" means \"awarded compensation in a formal order,\" while Sea-Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means \"statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.\" Although \u00a7 906 can be interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director's interpretation makes \u00a7 906 a working part of the statutory scheme. Under Roberts' interpreta\u00adtion, no employee receiving voluntary payments has been \"awarded compensation,\" so none is subject to an identiable maximum rate of compensation. That result is incompatible with the LHWCA's design. Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the applicable national av\u00aderage weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to determine that wage before each scal year begins, at which time it becomes the \"applicable national average weekly wage\" for the coming scal year. And \u00a7 906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary's determination shall apply to those \"newly awarded compensation\" during such scal year. Through a se\u00adries of cross-references, the three provisions work together to cap dis\u00adability benets. By its terms, and subject to one express exception, \u00a7 906(b)(1) species that the cap applies globally, to all disability claims. Because all three provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if \u00a7 906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. Roberts' interpretation would give \u00a7 906(c) no application in the many cases in which no formal orders issue. Using the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA's administra\u00adtive structure. An employer must be able to calculate the cap in order to pay benets within 14 days of notice of an employee's disability, see \u00a7 914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid. Similarly, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the applicable cap. It is difcult to see how an employer or claims examiner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an em\u00adployee becomes disabled. Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA's purpose to compensate disability, dened as \"in\u00adcapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\" \u00a7 902(10). It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees; Roberts' reading would per\u00admit two employees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to receive different maximum compensation rates based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different scal years. Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 95 Syllabus Finally, applying the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process. If the scal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with inflation would be unduly signicant. Roberts' rule would reward em\u00ad ployees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate, while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments. Pp. 100107. (b) Roberts' counterarguments are unconvincing. First, although the LHWCA sometimes uses \"award\" to mean \"award in a formal order,\" the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning readily yields whenever, as here, the variation in the word's use in the LHWCA reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different parts of the Act with different intent. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline , 540 U. S. 581, 595. Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to read the statutory phrase \"person entitled to compensation\" in \u00a7 933(g) to mean \"person awarded compensation,\" Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477, the converse must also be true: \"[A]warded compensation\" mean \"entitled to But Cowart's reasoning does not work in reverse. Cowart did not construe \u00a7 906(c) or \"award,\" see id., at 478-479, and it did not hold that the groups of \"employees entitled to compensation\" and \"employees awarded compensation\" were mutually exclusive, see id., at 477. Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the LHWCA's purpose of providing employees with prompt compensa\u00adtion by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite adminis\u00adtrative proceedings. But his remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benets at the proper rate from the time of their employees' injuries, because they would owe benets under the higher cap applicable in any future scal year when their employees chose to le claims. The more measured deterrent to employer delay is interest that accrues from the date an unpaid benet came due. Pp. 107-112. 625 F. 3d 1204, afrmed.

The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), ch. 509, 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 901 et seq., caps benets for most types of disability at twice the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an injured employee is \"newly awarded compen\u00adsation.\" \u00a7 906(c). We hold that an employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" when he rst becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benets, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf. I A The LHWCA \"is a comprehensive scheme to provide com\u00ad pensation 'in respect of disability or death of an employee . . . if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.' \" Metro\u00ad politan Stevedore Co. v.

For most types of disability, the \"applicable\" national average weekly wage is the gure for the scal year in which a beneciary is \"newly awarded compensation,\" and the cap remains con\u00adstant as long as benets continue. \u00a7 906(c). 2 1 Section 906 provides, in pertinent part: \"(b) Maximum rate of compensation \"(1) Compensation for disability or death (other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid in a lump sum) shall not exceed an amount equal to 200 per centum of the applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3). . . . . . \"(3) As soon as practicable after June 30 of each year, and in any event prior to October 1 of such year, the Secretary shall determine the national average weekly wage for the three consecutive calendar quarters ending June 30.

Opinion of the Court Consistent with the central bargain of workers' compen\u00ad sation regimes\u2014limited liability for employers; certain, prompt recovery for employees\u2014the LHWCA requires that employers pay benets voluntarily, without formal adminis\u00adtrative proceedings. Once an employee provides notice of a disabling injury, his employer must pay compensation \"pe\u00adriodically, promptly, and directly . . . without an award, ex\u00adcept where liability to pay compensation is controverted.\" \u00a7 914(a). In general, employers pay benets without con\u00adtesting liability. See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983). In the mine run of cases, therefore, no compensation orders issue. If an employer controverts, or if an employee contests his employer's actions with respect to his benets, the dispute advances to the Department of Labor's Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs ered to amicably and promptly resolve such problems by informal procedures.\" \u00a7 702.301. A district director's informal disposition may result in a compensation order. \u00a7 702.315(a). In practice, however, \"many pending claims are amicably settled through voluntary payments without the necessity of a formal order.\" Intercounty Constr. Corp. v. Walter , 422 U. S. 1, 4, n. 4 (1975). If informal resolution fails, the district director refers the dispute to an administra\u00adtive law judge (ALJ). See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 702.316, 702.331- 702.351.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 99 Opinion of the Court B In scal year 2002, petitioner Dana Roberts slipped and fell on a patch of ice while employed at respondent Sea-Land Services' marine terminal in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Rob\u00aderts injured his neck and shoulder and did not return to work. On receiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land (except for a 6-week period in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts benets absent a compensation order until scal year 2005. When Sea-Land discontinued voluntary payments, Roberts led an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land controverted. In s\u00adcal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ awarded Roberts ben\u00adets at the statutory maximum rate of $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average weekly wage for scal year 2002, the scal year when Roberts became disabled. Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the \"ap\u00ad plicable\" national average weekly wage was the gure for scal year 2007, the scal year when he was \"newly awarded compensation\" by the ALJ's order. The latter gure would have entitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week. The ALJ denied reconsideration, and the Department of Labor's Bene\u00adts Review Board (or BRB) afrmed, concluding that \"the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date the dis\u00adability commences.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20. The Ninth Circuit afrmed in relevant part, holding that an employee \"is 'newly awarded compensation' within the meaning of [\u00a7 906(c)] when he rst becomes entitled to compensation.\" Roberts v. Director, OWCP , 625 F. 3d 1204, 1208 (2010) (per curiam). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1066 (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits with respect to the time when a beneciary is \"newly awarded compensation,\" and now afrm. 4 4 Compare 625 F. 3d 1204 (time of entitlement) with Wilkerson v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 125 F. 3d 904 (CA5 1997) (time of order), and Boroski v. DynCorp Int'l, F. 100 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court II Roberts contends that \"awarded compensation\" means \"awarded compensation in a formal order.\" Sea-Land, supported by the Director, OWCP, responds that \"awarded compensation\" means \"statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.\" The text of \u00a7 906(c), standing alone, admits of either interpretation. But \"our task is to t, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\" FTC v. Man\u00ad del Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only the inter\u00adpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director makes \u00a7 906 a working part of the statutory scheme; supplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment of simi\u00adlarly situated beneciaries; and avoids gamesmanship in the claims process. In light of these contextual and structural considerations, we hold that an employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" when he rst becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benets under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf. A We rst consider \"whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particu\u00adlar dispute in the case.\" Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not dene \"awarded,\" but in construing the Act, as with any statute, \" 'we look rst to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.' \" Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248, 255 (1997) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990)). At rst blush, Roberts' position is appealing. In ordinary usage, \"award\" most often means \"give by judicial decree\" or \"assign after careful judgment.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002); see also, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (\"grant by formal process or by judicial decree\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 101 Opinion of the Court But \"award\" can also mean \"grant,\" or \"confer or bestow upon.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA \"grants\" benets to disabled employees, and so can be said to \"award\" compensation by force of its entitlement-creating provisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes \"award\" enti\u00adtlements. See, e. g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S. 586, 591 (2010) (referring to \"statutes that award attorney's fees to a prevailing party\"); Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 493 (2010) (appendix to majority opinion) (statute \"awards\" good-time credits to federal prisoners); New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 271 (1988) (Ohio statute \"awards a tax credit\"); Pacic Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Acci\u00ad dent Comm'n, 306 U. S. 493, 500 (1939) (California workers' compensation statute \"award[s] compensation for injuries to an employee\"); see also, e. g., Connecticut v. Doehr , 501 U. S. 1, 28 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and concur\u00adring in judgment) (\"Materialman's and mechanic's lien stat\u00adutes award an interest in real property to workers\"). Sim\u00adilarly, this Court has described an employee's survivors as \"having been 'newly awarded' death benets\" by virtue of the employee's death, without any reference to a for\u00admal order. Director, Ofce of Workers' Compensation Pro\u00ad grams v. Rasmussen, 440 U. S. 29, 44, n. 16 (1979) (quoting \u00a7 906(c)'s predecessor provision, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 906(d) (1976 ed.)). In short, the text of \u00a7 906(c), in isolation, is indeterminate. B Statutory language, however, \"cannot be construed in a vacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construc\u00adtion that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). In the context of the LHWCA's comprehen\u00adsive, reticulated regime for worker benets\u2014in which \u00a7 906 102 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court plays a pivotal role\u2014\"awarded compensation\" is much more sensibly interpreted to mean \"statutorily entitled to compen\u00adsation because of disability.\" 5 1 Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA cases. As explained above, see supra, at 98, the LHWCA requires employers to pay benets voluntarily, and in the vast majority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts' interpretation of \u00a7 906(c), no employee receiving voluntary payments has been \"awarded compensation,\" so none is sub\u00adject to an identiable maximum rate of compensation. That 5 Justice Ginsburg 's view, not advanced by any party, is that an em\u00ad ployee is \"awarded compensation\" when his employer \"voluntarily pays compensation or is ofcially ordered to do so.\" Post, at 115 (opinion con\u00ad curring in part and dissenting in part). But reading \"awarded compensa\u00adtion\" as synonymous with \"receiving compensation\" is further from the ordinary meaning of \"award\" than the Court's approach: A person who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk would not say that she had been \"awarded money damages\" if the business responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills. Cf. post, at 115-116. Moreover, if Congress had intended \"awarded compensation\" to mean \"receiving compensation,\" it could have said so\u2014as, in fact, it did in \u00a7 906(c)'s parallel clause, which pertains to beneciaries \"currently receiv\u00ading compensation for permanent total disability or death.\" See nn. 1-2, supra. Justice Ginsburg 's reading denies effect to Congress' textual shift, and therefore \"runs afoul of the usual rule that 'when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended.' \" Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Nor is Justice Ginsburg 's reliance on a single sentence of legislative history persuasive. See post, at 116-117. True, a Senate Committee Re\u00ad port described those \"newly awarded compensation\" as those \"who begin receiving compensation.\" S. Rep. No. 92-1125, p. 18 (1972). But a sub\u00adsequent House Committee Report did not. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 92-1441, p. 15 (1972) (statute provides a \"method for determining maximum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to persons currently receiving compensation as well as those newly awarded compensation)\"). The leg\u00adislative materials are a wash. Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 103 Opinion of the Court result is incompatible with the Act's design. Section 906(b)(1) caps \"[c]ompensation for disability or death (other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid in a lump sum)\" at twice \"the applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3).\" Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to \"deter\u00admine\" the national average weekly wage before each scal year begins on October 1 and provides that \"[s]uch determi\u00adnation shall be the applicable national average weekly wage\" for the coming scal year. And \u00a7 906(c), in those newly awarded compensation during such\" scal year. Through a series of cross-references, the three provisions work together to cap disability benets. By its terms, and subject to one express exception, \u00a7 906(b)(1) species that the cap applies globally, to all dis\u00adability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the cap functions as Congress intended only if \u00a7 906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. See, e. g., FDA v. Brown & Wil\u00ad liamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (\"A court must . . . interpret the statute 'as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme' \" (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts' interpretation were cor\u00ad rect, \u00a7 906(c) would have no application at all in the many cases in which no formal orders issue, because employers make voluntary payments or the parties reach informal set\u00adtlements. We will not construe \u00a7 906(c) in a manner that renders it \"entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual cir\u00adcumstances.\" TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). Recognizing this deciency in his reading of \u00a7 906(c), Roberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that employers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their employees become disabled. This is a solution in search of a problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are rare. Roberts' interpretation would set needless administrative 104 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court machinery in motion and would disrupt the congressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation and informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Roberts' proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a vehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case. Section 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an employee has led a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR \u00a7 702.315(a) applies only in the case of a claim or an employer's notice of controversion. See \u00a7 702.301. We doubt that an employee will le a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his employer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read \u00a7 906(c) to compel an employer to le a baseless notice of controversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 928(a), (d) (providing for assessment of attorney's fees and costs against employers who controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that employers could threaten to terminate benets in order to induce their employees to le claims, and thus initiate the administrative process. Construing any workers' compensation regime to encourage gratuitous con\u00adfrontation between employers and employees strikes us as unsound. 2 Using the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA's administrative structure. Section 914(b) re\u00adquires an employer to pay benets within 14 days of notice of an employee's disability. To do so, an employer must be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also notify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by ling a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the \"maximum rate is being paid.\" Dept. of Labor, Form LS-206, Payment of Compensation Without Award (rev. Aug. 2011), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc / ls-206.pdf. On receipt of this form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the rate of compensation in light of the applicable cap. See Dept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \u00a7 2- n201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Manual), on\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 105 Opinion of the Court line at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2-201.htm. It is difcult to see how an employer can apply or certify a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled. An employer is powerless to predict when an employee might le a claim, when a compensation order might issue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at that later time. Likewise for a claims examiner. 6 Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which an employee becomes disabled ad\u00advances the LHWCA's purpose to compensate disability, de\u00adned as \"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury .\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the LHWCA takes \"the average weekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury\" as the \"basis upon which to compute compensation,\" \u00a7 910, it is logical to apply the national aver\u00adage weekly wage for the same point in time. Administrative practice has long treated the time of injury as the relevant date. See, e. g., Dept. of Labor, Longshore Act Coverage and Benets, Pamphlet LS-560 (rev. Dec. 2003) (\"Com\u00adpensation payable under the Act may not exceed 200% of 6 Justice Ginsburg 's approach is either easily circumvented or un\u00ad workable. For example, Justice Ginsburg determines that Roberts is entitled to the scal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to July 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments during that time. Post, at 118. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts $933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts was entitled to receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at 107, Order \u00b61. If any voluntary payment sufces, regardless of an employee's actual enti\u00adtlement, then an employer can hedge against a later nding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act might entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remainder. See, e. g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assoc., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730 (2007). An employer who con\u00adtroverts is not subject to the Act's delinquency penalty. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 914(e). Perhaps Justice Ginsburg gives Sea-Land the benet of the doubt because its voluntary payments were close to Roberts' actual enti\u00adtlement. But if that is so, then how close is close enough? 106 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court the national average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury\"), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ LS-560pam.htm; Dept. of Labor, Workers' Compensation Under the Longshoremen's Act, Pamphlet LS-560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same); see also, e. g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11-01, p. 2 (2010) (national average weekly wage for par\u00adticular scal year applies to \"disability incurred during\" that scal year). 7 Applying the national average weekly wage at the time of onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees. Under Roberts' reading, two employ\u00adees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day could be entitled to different rates of compen\u00adsation based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different scal years. We can imagine no reason why Congress would have intended, by choosing the words \"newly awarded compensation,\" to differentiate between em\u00adployees based on such an arbitrary criterion. 7 Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and the time of onset of disability differ. We have observed that \"the LHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the disability produced by that injury.\" Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo , 515 U. S. 291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly concluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the latter is the rele\u00advant date for determining the applicable national average weekly wage. See, e. g., Service Employees Int'l, Inc. v. Director, OWCP , Inc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per curiam). Likewise, in a small group of cases\u2014those in which disability lasts more than 3 but less than 15 days\u2014the time of onset of disability and the time of entitlement will differ. See \u00a7 906(a) (\"No compensation shall be allowed for the rst three days of the disability . . . Provided, however, That in case the injury results in disability of more than fourteen days the com\u00adpensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability\"). In these cases, the relevant date is that on which disability and entitlement coin\u00adcide: the fourth day after the onset of disability. Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 107 Opinion of the Court 3 Finally, using the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which disability commences discourages games\u00ad manship in the claims process. If the scal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national average weekly wage typically rises every year with inflation, see n. 2, supra, would become unduly signi\u00ad cant. Every employee affected by the cap would seek the entry of a compensation order in a later scal year. Even an employee who has been receiving compensation at the proper rate for years would be well advised to le a claim for greater benets in order to obtain an order at a later time. Likewise, an employee might delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of an order. And even in an adju\u00ad dicated case where an employer is found to have paid benets at the proper rate, an ALJ would adopt the later scal year's national average weekly wage, making the increased cap ret\u00adroactively applicable to all of the employer's payments. Roberts candidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such perverse incentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58-59. We decline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceed\u00adings, while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations. III We nd Roberts' counterarguments unconvincing. A First, Roberts observes that some provisions of the LHWCA clearly use \"award\" to mean \"award in a formal order,\" and contends that the same must be true of \"awarded compensation\" in \u00a7 906(c). We agree that the Act sometimes uses \"award\" as Roberts urges. Section 914(a), for example, refers to the payment of compensation \"to the person enti\u00ad108 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. of the Court tled thereto, without an award,\" foreclosing the equation of \"entitlement\" and \"award\" that we adopt with respect to \u00a7 906(c) today. 8 But the presumption that \"identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were em\u00adployed in different parts of the act with different intent.\" General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline , 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e. g., United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001). Here, we nd the presumption over\u00ad come because several provisions of the Act would make no sense if \"award\" were read as Roberts proposes. Those pro\u00advisions conrm today's holding because they too, in context, use \"award\" to denote a statutory entitlement to compensa\u00adtion because of disability. For example, \u00a7 908(c)(20) provides that \"[p]roper and equi\u00ad table compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be awarded for serious disgurement.\" Roberts argues that \u00a7 908(c)(20) \"necessarily contemplates administrative action to x the amount of the liability and direct its payment.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts' view, no disgured employee may receive benets without invoking the administrative claims process. That argument, however, runs counter to \u00a7 908's preface, which directs that \"[c]ompensation for dis\u00adability shall be paid to the employee,\" and to \u00a7 914(a), which 8 Other LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean \"award in a formal order.\" For example, \u00a7\u00a7 913(a) and 928(b), like \u00a7 914(a), refer to the payment of compensation \"without an award.\" And the LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due under an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency. Compare \u00a7 914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of \"compensation payable without an award\") with \u00a7 914(f) (20 percent penalty for late payment of \"compensation, payable under the terms of an award\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 109 Opinion of the Court requires the payment of compensation \"without an award.\" It is also belied by employers' practice of paying \u00a7 908(c)(20) benets voluntarily. See, e. g., Williams-McDowell v. New\u00ad port News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99-0627 etc., 2000 WL 35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v. Bergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98-1641, 1999 WL 35135283, *1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the LHWCA's interest in prompt payment and settled prac\u00ad tice, \"awarded\" in \u00a7 908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in \u00a7 906(c), to refer to a disgured employee's entitlement to benets. Likewise, \u00a7 908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is receiving compensation for a scheduled disability 9 dies be\u00ad fore receiving the full amount of compensation to which the schedule entitles him, \"the total amount of the award unpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the benet of his survivors.\" See also \u00a7 908(d)(2). Roberts' interpreta\u00adtion of \"award\" would introduce an odd gap: Only survivors of those employees who were receiving schedule benets pursuant to orders\u2014not survivors of employees who were receiving voluntary payments\u2014would be entitled to the un\u00adpaid balances due their decedents. There is no reason why Congress would have chosen to distinguish between survi\u00advors in this manner. And the Benets Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted \u00a7 908(d) to mean that \"an employ\u00adee has a vested interest in benets which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he dies, his estate is entitled to those benets, regardless of when an award is made.\" Wood v. 9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a \"schedule\" of particular injuries that entitle an employee \"to receive two-thirds of his average weekly wages for a specic number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning capacity has actually been impaired.\" Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Direc\u00ad tor, Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269 (1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two-thirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. \u00a7 908(c)(1). 110 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 28 BRBS 27, 36 (1994) (per curiam).10 Finally, \u00a7 933(b) provides: the purpose of this subsec\u00ad tion, the term 'award' with respect to a compensation order means a formal order issued by the deputy commissioner, an administrative law judge, or Board.\" Unless award may mean something other than \"award in a compensation order,\" this specic denition would be unnecessary. Rob\u00aderts contends that this provision, enacted in 1984, \"was indeed 'unnecessary' \" in light of Pallas Shipping . Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U. at (\"The term 'compensation order' in the LHWCA refers specically to an administrative 10 Roberts' interpretation also would afford unwarranted signicance to the entry of an order in other circumstances, resulting in arbitrary distinc\u00ad tions within other classes of beneciaries. For example, \u00a7 908(c)(22) pro\u00advides that if an employee suffers from more than one scheduled disability, the \"awards\" for each \"shall run consecutively.\" Under Roberts' inter\u00adpretation, \u00a7 908(c)(22) would require consecutive payments only for em\u00adployees who were receiving scheduled disability benets pursuant to or\u00adders; those receiving voluntary payments presumably would be entitled to concurrent payments. See \u00a7\u00a7 914(a)-(b). That result would conflict with \u00a7 908(c)(22)'s text, which states that consecutive payments must be made \"[i]n any case\" involving multiple scheduled disabilities. See, e. g., Thorn\u00ad ton v. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per curiam). Similarly, \u00a7 910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benets for pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress provided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments. The rst applies to those receiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the second applies to those \"awarded compensation . . . at less than the maximum rate.\" See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10-73, Adjustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death Prior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp. 2-4 (1973). Roberts' interpretation would make the second for\u00admula applicable only to beneciaries receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all such beneciaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. See ibid. (prescribing a \"uniform\" method for computing the increase in all \"[c]ases being compensated at less than the maximum rate,\" with no reference to the existence of an order). Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 111 Opinion of the Court award of compensation following proceedings with respect to the claim\"). Roberts' argument offends the canon against superfluity and neglects that \u00a7 933(b) defines the term of \"award,\" which preferred interpretation, was carefully limited to \u00a7 933(b). Had Congress intended to adopt a univer\u00adsal denition of \"award,\" it could have done so in \u00a7 902, the LHWCA's glossary. Read in light of the \"duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,\" Duncan v. Walker , 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u00a7 933(b) debunks Roberts' argument that the Act al\u00adways uses \"award\" to mean \"award in a formal order\" and con\u00adrms that \"award\" has other meanings. B Next, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read the statutory phrase \"person entitled to compensation\" in \u00a7 933(g) to mean \"person awarded compensation.\" See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477 (1992) (\"[A] person entitled to compensation need not be receiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his favor\"). In Roberts' view, the mean \"entitled to But Cowart's reasoning does not work in reverse. Cowart did not construe \u00a7 906(c) or the term \"award,\" but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase \"person entitled to compensation\" in the LHWCA. See id., at 478-479. As just explained, the LHWCA contains no uniform meaning of the term \"award.\" Moreover, Cowart did not hold that the groups of \"employees entitled to com\u00adpensation\" and \"employees awarded compensation\" were mutually exclusive. The former group includes the latter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufcient but not nec\u00adessary condition for membership in the former. See id., at 477. 112 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court C Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the LHWCA's purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Roberts' remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benets at the proper rate from the time of their employees' injuries. These employers would owe benets under the higher cap applicable in any future scal year when their employees chose to le claims. And Roberts' remedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneciaries entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate. The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is interest that \"accrues from the date a benet came due, rather than from the date of the ALJ's award.\" Matulic v. Director, OWCP , 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The Director has long taken the position that \"interest is a neces\u00adsary and inherent component of 'compensation' because it ensures that the delay in payment of compensation does not diminish the amount of compensation to which the employee is entitled.\" Sproull v. Director, OWCP , 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e. g., Strachan Shipping Co. meyer , 1229 (CA5 1971). Moreover, \"[t]imely [c]ontroversion does not relieve the responsible party from paying interest on unpaid compensation.\" Longshore Pro\u00adcedure Manual \u00a7 ALJ awarded Rob\u00aderts interest \"on each unpaid installment of compensation from the date the compensation became due.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 108, Order \u00b65. 11 11 Thus, as under Justice Ginsburg 's approach, an employer who controverts still \"runs the risk\" of greater liability if an ALJ awards an employee compensation at some point subsequent to the onset of disability. See post, at 117. Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 113 Opinion of Ginsburg, J. * * * We hold that an employee is \"newly awarded compensa\u00ad tion\" when he rst becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benets, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf. 12 The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is afrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Ginsburg , concurring in part and dissenting in part. Section 6 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compen\u00ad sation Act (LHWCA or Act) denes the maximum disability benet an injured worker may receive under the Act. Spe\u00adcically, \u00a7 6 states that an injured employee may receive, at most, twice the national average weekly wage for the scal year in which the employee is \"newly awarded compensa\u00adtion.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 906(c). The Court granted review in this case to answer the following question: When is an em\u00adployee \"newly awarded compensation\"? Petitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" in the year she receives a formal compensation award. For the reasons cogently ex\u00adplained by the majority, that argument is untenable. See ante, at 100-111. Unlike the Court, however, I do not regard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services' view that an employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" in the year she becomes \"statutorily entitled to compensation.\" Ante, at 100 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying the com\u00admon meaning of the verb \"award\" and recognizing the Act's distinction between benets paid voluntarily, and those paid 12 Because \"newly awarded compensation,\" read in context, is unambigu\u00ad ous, we do not reach respondents' argument that the Director's interpreta\u00ad tion of \u00a7 906(c) is entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\u00ad ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). 114 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of Ginsburg, J. pursuant to a compensation order, see ante, at 97-98, I would hold that an injured worker is \"newly awarded compensa\u00ad tion\" when (1) the employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benets to the employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the Benets Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders the employer to pay such benets. I In determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, \"we look rst to its language, giving the words used their ordi\u00adnary meaning.\" Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 100, the verb \"award\" ordi\u00ad narily means \"to give \"[to] assign after careful judgment.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002). See also Black's Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (dening the verb \"award\" as \"[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree\"). Giving \"award\" this usual meaning, an employee is \"newly awarded compen\u00adsation,\" if not voluntarily paid, in the scal year in which payment is directed by administrative order or judicial decree. Under the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee is provided compensation voluntarily or in contested proceed\u00adings. See ante, at 98. Most commonly, an employer pays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employee's notice of disabling injury. See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 912 (de\u00ad scribing the form, content, and timing of the necessary notice and requiring employers to designate a representative to receive the notice); \u00a7 914(b). If an employer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an injured employee can le a claim with the Department of Labor's Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). For employees with valid claims, OWCP proceedings culminate with an admin\u00ad istrative or court decision ordering the employer to pay Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 115 Opinion of Ginsburg, J. benets. \u00a7 919(c). Thus, an injured worker is given\u2014or \"awarded\"\u2014compensation through one of two means con\u00adtemplated by the Act: either the employer voluntarily pays compensation or is ofcially ordered to do so. Logically, then, the worker is \"newly awarded compensation\" when one of those two events occurs. The Court does not take this approach. After acknowl\u00ad edging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the word \"award,\" see ante, at 100, the Court adopts Sea-Land's view that \"awarded compensation\" is synonymous with \"[became] statutorily entitled to benets,\" ante, at 113. As a result, a person is \"newly awarded compensation\" in the year in which she becomes entitled to benets\u2014i. e., in the year the employee \"rst becomes disabled.\" Ibid. Such a reading is plausible, the Court asserts, because \"this Court has often said that statutes 'award' entitlements.\" Ante, at 101 (citing cases). I do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as \"awarding\" relief to persons falling within their com\u00adpass. But \"a statute must be read in [its] context.\" Ibid. (quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989)). Section 906 does not address whether the LHWCA, as a general matter, \"awards\" disability benets to injured longshore workers. Rather, it concerns a more specic question: When has a particular employee been \"newly awarded compensation.\" In that context, equating \"awarded compensation\" with \"statutorily entitled to com\u00adpensation\" is not plausible. A person covered by the Act would not likely say he was \"awarded compensation\" the mo\u00adment he became disabled, if, in fact, his employer contests liability. Only after some entity\u2014the employer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court\u2014recognizes the employee's right to compensation would he comprehend that he had been \"awarded compensation.\" To borrow The Chief Justice' s example: No person who slips and injures herself on a negli\u00adgently maintained sidewalk would tell her friends the next 116 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of Ginsburg, J. day, \"Guess what, I was newly awarded money damages yesterday.\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. The inconsistency between the Court's interpretation of \"newly awarded compensation\" and my reading of the phrase is best illustrated by contextual example. Assume an em\u00adployee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses to pay compensation voluntarily. Then, ve years later, an ALJ nds in favor of the employee and orders the employer to pay benets to the employee. Under the Court's view, the employee was \"newly awarded compensation\" in 2002, even though the employee did not receive a penny\u2014and the employer was not obligated to pay a penny\u2014until 2007. Only the most strained interpretation of \"newly awarded\" could demand that result. 1 The Court's view, moreover, does not t the Act's design. As explained supra, at 114-115, the Act envisions that an eligible employee will begin receiving benets in either of two ways. The Court's interpretation disregards this design, as\u00adsuming instead that all employees are awarded benets in the same way: by the Act at the time they become disabled. Section 906(c)'s legislative history further conrms that Congress intended \"newly awarded compensation\" to have its commonsense meaning. In describing \u00a7 906, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare reported: \"[Section 906(c)] states that determinations of national average weekly wage made with respect to a [scal year] 1 As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given scal year applies to two groups of injured workers: those who are \"newly awarded compen\u00ad sation during such [year],\" and those who are \"currently receiving com\u00adpensation for permanent total disability or death benets during such [year].\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 906(c). Ante, at 102, n. 5. Contrary to the Court's charge, I do not read \"newly awarded compensation\" as synonymous with \"currently receiving compensation.\" See ibid. An injured worker who is \"currently receiving compensation\" in a given scal year was \"newly awarded compensation\" in a previous year. My interpretation therefore gives \"effect to Congress' textual shift,\" ibid.: It identies two distinct groups of workers who are entitled to a given year's maximum rate. Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 117 Opinion of Ginsburg, J. apply to employees or survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benets, as well as those who begin receiving compensa\u00ad tion for the rst time during the [scal year].\" S. Rep. No. 92-1125, p. 18 (1972) (emphasis added). Congress therefore believed an injured worker is \"newly awarded compensation\" in the year in which she \"begin[s] receiving compensation for the rst time.\" Ibid. Again, an employee begins receiving compensation either when an employer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benets or when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer to do so. See supra, at 114-115. When the employer resists payment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving compensation in the year in which she becomes disabled. Finally, interpreting \"newly awarded compensation\" to mean awarded through an employer's voluntary decision or an ofcial order is consistent with the Act's goal of encourag\u00ading employers to pay legitimate claims promptly. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 914(a) (requiring employers to pay compensation \"periodically, promptly, and directly\"); Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 498 (1992) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he Act presumes that employers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA obligations and com\u00admence payments immediately.\"). Under my interpretation, an employer who chooses to contest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim voluntarily, runs the risk that it may ulti\u00admately have to pay the injured employee a higher maximum benet. For example, if an employer refuses to pay benets to a worker injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding compensation to the employee in 2015, the scal year 2015 maximum rate would apply to the employee's claim. Had the employer voluntarily begun paying benets in 2012, on the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply. Under the Court's reading, by contrast, an employer pays the prevailing rate for the year the employee became 118 ROBER TS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC. Opinion of Ginsburg, J. disabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays benets immediately or years down the road.2 II In this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002, and stopped working two weeks later. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4. Sea-Land and its insurer paid benets to Roberts from March 11, 2002, until July 15, 2003. Id., at 101. Sea-Land then resumed paying benets on September 1, 2003, and con\u00adtinued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17, 2005, when it ceased making payments for good. Ibid. After Roberts led a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ, in Octo\u00adber 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to compensa\u00adtion from March 11, 2002, onwards. Id., at 107-108. Applying my interpretation of \u00a7 906, Roberts was newly awarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when Sea-Land voluntarily began paying benets; in September 2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it had stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an ALJ or\u00addered Sea-Land to pay benets to Roberts for the uncompen\u00adsated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 onwards. Roberts was therefore entitled to the scal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, until July 15, 2003; the scal year 2003 maximum rate from September 1, 2003, until May 17, 2005; and the scal year 2007 rate 3 going forward and for all uncompensated weeks covered by the ALJ's order.4 2 Employers may have a particularly strong nancial incentive to post\u00ad pone paying claims that implicate \u00a7 906. That section applies only to in\u00ad jured workers who qualify for the maximum rate of compensation under the Act\u2014i. e., to those claimants who are owed the largest possible benet. 3 For \u00a7 906 purposes, a year runs from October 1 to September 30. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 906(b)(3). The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all employees \"newly awarded compensation\" between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2007. 4 The Court asserts that an employer could \"easily circumven[t]\" my approach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are substantially below the employee's \"actual entitlement.\" Ante, at 105, Cite as: 566 U. S. 93 (2012) 119 Opinion of Ginsburg, J. * * * For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Ninth Cir\u00ad cuit's judgment and hold that an employee is \"newly awarded compensation\" when her employer either voluntarily agrees to pay compensation to her or is ofcially ordered to do so. n. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or would even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who make volun\u00ad tary payments to employees are required to le a report with the Depart\u00adment of Labor describing the nature of the employee's injury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 104; 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 930(a). The employer must also submit the results of a medical evaluation of the employee's condition. Dept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \u00a7 2-201(2)(b) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar. 14, 2012, and in Clerk of Court's case le). Upon receiving the employer's report, a Department of Labor claims examiner veries \"the compensation rate for accuracy\" and must follow up with the employer \"[i]f the compen\u00adsation rate appears low.\" Id., \u00a7 2-201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a claims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employ\u00aders who underpay benets, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 914(e); Long-shore Procedure Manual \u00a7 8-202(3)(c) (\"If partial [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference amount owed and the amount paid.\"), http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ lspm/lspm8-202.htm. Employers would thus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to \"circumven[t]\" my approach by deliberately un\u00addercompensating injured workers. And while it is true that an employer who controverts an employee's right to compensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 105, n. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes and controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 914(a) (requiring employers either to pay benets in full or to controvert \"liability to pay compensation\" at all). 120 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus SACKETT et vir v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1062. Argued January 9, 2012\u2014Decided March 21, 2012 The Clean Water Act prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person,\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311, without a permit, into \"navigable waters,\" \u00a7 1344. Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Environ\u00admental Protection Agency (EPA) may either issue a compliance order or initiate a civil enforcement action. \u00a7 1319(a)(3). The resulting civil penalty may not \"exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.\" \u00a7 1319(d). The Government contends that the amount doubles to $75,000 when the EPA prevails against a person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply. The Sacketts, petitioners here, received a compliance order from the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable waters and that their construction project violated the Act. The Sacketts sought declarative and injunctive relief in the Federal District Court, contending that the compliance order was \"arbitrary [and] capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit afrmed, concluding that the Clean Water Act precluded preenforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such preclusion did not violate due process. Held: The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge the issuance of the EPA's order. Pp. 125-131. (a) The APA provides for judicial review of \"nal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. The compliance order here has all the hallmarks of APA nality. Through it, the EPA \"determined\" \"rights or obligations,\" Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 178, requiring the Sacketts to restore their prop\u00ad erty according to an Agency-approved plan and to give the EPA access. Also, \"legal consequences . . . flow\" from to the Government's litigating position, exposes the Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings. The order also se\u00adverely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their ll from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344; 33 CFR \u00a7 326.3(e)(1)(iv). Further, the the \"consummation\" of the Agency's Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 121 Syllabus decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178, for the EPA's ndings in the compliance order were not subject to further Agency review. The Sacketts also had \"no other adequate remedy in a court,\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. A civil action brought by the EPA under 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process. And each day they wait, they accrue additional potential liability. Applying to the Corps of Engineers for a permit and then ling suit under the APA if that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for the EPA's action. Pp. 125-128. (b) The Clean Water Act is not a statute that \"preclude[s] judicial review\" under the APA, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 701(a)(1). The APA creates a \"pre\u00adsumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.\" Block v. Community Nutrition Institute , 467 U. S. 340, 349. While this pre\u00ad sumption \"may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole,\" ibid., the Government's arguments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Act's statutory scheme precludes APA review.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 123 Opinion of the Court denes as \"the waters of the United States,\" \u00a7 1362(7). If the EPA determines that any person is in violation of this restriction, the Act directs the Agency either to issue a compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action. \u00a7 1319(a)(3). When the EPA prevails in a civil action, the Act provides for \"a civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.\" 1 \u00a7 1319(d). And according to the Government, when the EPA prevails against any person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply, that amount is increased to $75,000\u2014up to $37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional $37,500 for violat\u00ading the compliance order. The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about the scope of \"the navigable waters\" subject to this enforcement regime. Today we consider only whether the dispute may be brought to court by challenging the compliance order\u2014 we do not resolve the dispute on the merits. The reader will be curious, however, to know what all the fuss is about. In United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we upheld a regulation that construed \"the navi\u00adgable waters\" to include \"freshwater wetlands,\" id., at 124, themselves not actually navigable, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters. Later, in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 (2001), we held that an abandoned sand and gravel pit, which \"seasonally ponded\" but which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was not part of the navigable waters. Then most recently, in Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), we considered whether a wetland not adjacent 1 The original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per day. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 890, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2461, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, \u00a7 3720E, 110 Stat. 1321-373, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2461, p. 1314 (Amendment), authorizes the EPA to adjust that maximum penalty for inflation. On the basis of that authority, the Agency has raised the cap to $37,500. See 74 Fed. Reg. 626, 627 (2009). 124 SACKETT v. EPA Opinion of the Court to navigable-in-fact waters fell within the scope of the Act. Our answer was no, but no one rationale commanded a ma\u00adjority of the Court. In his separate opinion, The Chief Justice expressed the concern that interested parties would lack guidance \"on precisely how to read Congress' limits on the reach of the Clean Water Act\" and would be left \"to feel their way on a case-by-case basis.\" Id., at 758 (concurring opinion). The Sacketts are interested parties feeling their way. They own a 23-acre residential lot in Bonner County, Idaho. Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is sepa\u00ad rated from the lake by several lots containing permanent structures. In preparation for constructing a house, the Sacketts lled in part of their lot with dirt and rock. Some months later, they received from the EPA a compliance order. The order contained a number of \"Findings and Con\u00adclusions,\" including the following: \"1.4 [The Sacketts' property] contains wetlands within the meaning of 33 C. F. R. \u00a7 328.4(8)(b); the wetlands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in the 1987 'Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Juris\u00addictional Wetlands.' \"1.5 The Site's wetlands are adjacent to Priest Lake within the meaning of 33 C. F. R. \u00a7 328.4(8)(c). Priest Lake is a 'navigable water' within the meaning of sec\u00adtion 502(7) of the Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1362(7), and 'waters of the United States' within the meaning of 40 C. F. R. \u00a7 232.2. \"1.6 In April and May, 2007, at times more fully known to [the Sacketts, they] and/or persons acting on their be\u00adhalf discharged ll material into wetlands at the Site. [They] lled approximately one half acre. . . . . . \"1.9 By causing such ll material to enter waters of the United States, [the Sacketts] have engaged, and are con\u00adtinuing to engage, in the 'discharge of pollutants' from a Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 125 Opinion of the Court point source within the meaning of sections 301 and 502(12) of the Act, 33 U. S. pollutants into waters of the United States at the Site without [a] permit con\u00adstitutes a violation of section 301 of the Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311.\" App. 19-20. On the basis of these ndings and conclusions, the order di\u00adrects the Sacketts, among other things, \"immediately [to] un\u00addertake activities to restore the Site, in accordance with [an EPA-created] Restoration Work Plan\" and to \"provide and/ access to the Site . . . [and] access to all records and documentation related to the conditions at the Site . . . to EPA employees and/or their designated representatives.\" Id., at 21-22, \u00b6\u00b62.1, 2.7. The Sacketts, who do not believe that their property is subject to the Act, asked the EPA for a hearing, but that request was denied. They then brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, seek\u00ading declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint con\u00adtended that the EPA's issuance of the compliance order was \"arbitrary [and] capricious\" under the Administrative Proce\u00addure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\" in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject-matter juris\u00addiction, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afrmed, 622 F. 3d 1139 (2010). It concluded that the Act \"preclude[s] pre-enforcement judicial review of compliance orders,\" id., at 1144, and that such preclusion does not violate the Fifth Amendment's due process guaran\u00adtee, id., at 1147. We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. 1052 (2011). II The Sacketts brought suit under Chapter 7 of the APA, which provides for judicial review of \"nal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\" 5 126 SACKETT v. EPA Opinion of the Court U. S. C. \u00a7 704. We consider rst whether the compliance order is nal agency action. There is no doubt it is agency action, which the APA denes as including even a \"failure to act.\" \u00a7\u00a7 551(13), 701(b)(2). But is it nal? It has all of the hallmarks of APA nality that our opinions establish. Through the order, the EPA \" 'determined' \" \" 'rights or obli\u00adgations.' \" Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997) (quot\u00ad ing Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebo\u00ad laget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970)). By reason of the order, the Sacketts have the legal obligation to \"restore\" their property according to an Agency-approved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA access to their property and to \"records and documentation related to the conditions at the Site.\" App. 22, \u00b62.7. Also, \" 'legal consequences . . . flow' \" from issuance of the order. Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Marine Terminal, supra, at 71). For one, accord\u00ad ing to the Government's current litigating position, the order exposes the Sacketts to double penalties in a future enforce\u00adment proceeding. 2 It also severely limits the Sacketts' abil\u00ad ity to obtain a permit for their ll from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344. The Corps' regulations provide that, once the EPA has issued a compliance order with respect to certain property, the Corps will not process a permit application for that property unless doing so \"is clearly appropriate.\" 33 CFR \u00a7 326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). 3 2 We do not decide today that the Government's position is correct, but assume the consequences of the order to be what the Government asserts. 3 The regulation provides this consequence for \"enforcement litigation that has been initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.\" 33 CFR \u00a7 326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The Government acknowledges, however, that the EPA's issuance of a compliance order is considered by the Corps to fall within the provision. Brief for Respondents 31. Here again, we take the Government at its word without afrming that it represents a proper interpretation of the regulation. Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 127 Opinion of the Court The issuance of the compliance order also marks the \" 'con\u00ad summation' \" of the Agency's decisionmaking process. Ben\u00ad nett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113 (1948)). As the Sacketts learned when they unsuccessfully sought a hearing, the \"Findings and Conclusions\" that the compliance order contained were not subject to further Agency review. The Government resists this conclusion, pointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts to \"engage in infor\u00admal discussion of the terms and requirements\" of the order with the EPA and to inform the Agency of \"any allega\u00ad tions 22-23, \u00b62.11. But that confers no entitlement to further Agency review. The mere possibility that an agency might reconsider in light of \"informal discussion\" and invited con\u00adtentions of inaccuracy does not sufce to make an otherwise nal agency action nonnal. The APA's judicial review provision also requires that the person seeking APA review of nal agency action have \"no other adequate remedy in a court,\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. In Clean Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordi\u00adnarily comes by way of a civil action brought by the EPA under 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1319. But the Sacketts cannot initiate that process, and each day they wait for the Agency to drop the hammer, they accrue, by the Government's telling, an additional $75,000 in potential liability. The other possible route to judicial review\u2014applying to the Corps of Engineers for a permit and then ling suit under the APA if a permit is denied\u2014will not serve either. The remedy for denial of action that might be sought from one agency does not ordi\u00adnarily provide an \"adequate remedy\" for action already taken by another agency. The Government, to its credit, does not seriously contend that other available remedies alone foreclose review under \u00a7 704. Instead, the Govern\u00adment relies on \u00a7 701(a)(1) of the APA, which excludes APA 128 SACKETT v. EPA Opinion of the Court review \"to the extent that [other] statutes preclude judicial review.\" The Clean Water Act, it says, is such a statute. III Nothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes ju\u00ad dicial review under the APA or otherwise. But in deter\u00admining \"[w]hether and to what extent a particular statute precludes judicial review,\" we do not look \"only [to] its ex\u00adpress language.\" Block v. Community Nutrition Institute , 467 U. S. 340, 345 (1984). The APA, we have said, creates a \"presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action,\" but as with most presumptions, this one \"may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statu\u00adtory scheme as a whole.\" Id., at 349. The Government of\u00ad fers several reasons why the statutory scheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review. The Government rst points to 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1319(a)(3), which provides that, when the EPA \"nds that any person is in violation\" of certain portions of the Act, the Agency \"shall issue an order requiring such person to comply with [the Act], or . . . shall bring a civil action [to enforce the Act].\" The Government argues that, because Congress gave the EPA the choice between a judicial proceeding and an admin\u00adistrative action, it would undermine the Act to allow judi\u00adcial review of the latter. But that argument rests on the question-begging premise that the relevant difference be\u00adtween a compliance order and an enforcement proceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial review. There are eminently sound reasons other than insulation from judicial review why compliance orders are useful. The Government itself suggests that they \"provid[e] a means of notifying re\u00adcipients of potential violations and quickly resolving the is\u00adsues through voluntary compliance.\" Brief for Respondents 39. It is entirely consistent with this function to allow judi\u00ad cial review when the recipient does not choose \"voluntary compliance.\" The Act does not guarantee the EPA that is\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 129 Opinion of the Court suing a compliance order will always be the most effective choice. The Government also notes that compliance orders are not self-executing, but must be enforced by the Agency in a ple\u00adnary judicial action. It suggests that Congress therefore viewed a compliance order \"as a step in the deliberative process[,] . . . rather than as a coercive sanction that itself must be subject to judicial review.\" Id., at 38. But the APA provides for judicial review of all nal agency actions, not just those that impose a self-executing sanction. And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim that the issu\u00ad ance of the compliance order was just \"a step in the delibera\u00adtive process\" when the Agency rejected the Sacketts' at\u00adtempt to obtain a hearing and when the next step will either be taken by the Sacketts (if they comply with the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative, deliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action). As the text (and in\u00addeed the very name) of the compliance order makes clear, the EPA's \"deliberation\" over whether the Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the Agency may still have to deliberate over whether it is condent enough about this conclusion to initiate litigation, but that is a separate subject. The Government further urges us to consider that Con\u00ad gress expressly provided for prompt judicial review, on the administrative record, when the EPA assesses administra\u00adtive penalties after a hearing, see \u00a7 1319(g)(8), but did not expressly provide for review of compliance orders. But if the express provision of judicial review in one section of a long and complicated statute were alone enough to overcome the APA's presumption of reviewability for all nal agency action, it would not be much of a presumption at all. The cases on which the Government relies simply are not analogous. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute , supra, we held that the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, which expressly allowed milk handlers to obtain judicial review of milk market orders, precluded review of 130 SACKETT v. EPA Opinion of the Court milk market orders in suits brought by milk consumers. 467 U. S., at 345-348. Where a statute provides that partic\u00ad ular agency action is reviewable at the instance of one party, who must rst exhaust administrative remedies, the infer\u00adence that it is not reviewable at the instance of other parties, who are not subject to the administrative process, is strong. In United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S. 201 (1982), we held that the Medicare statute, which expressly provided for judi\u00adcial review of awards under Part A, precluded review of awards under Part B. Id., at 206-208. The strong parallel between the award provisions in Part A and Part B of the Medicare statute does not exist between the issuance of a compliance order and the assessment of administrative pen\u00adalties under the Clean Water Act. And in United States v. Fausto , 484 U. S. 439 (1988), we held that the Civil Service Reform Act, which expressly excluded certain \"nonprefer\u00adence\" employees from the statute's review scheme, precluded review at the instance of those employees in a separate Claims Court action. Id., at 448-449. Here, there is no suggestion that Congress has sought to exclude compliance-order recipients from the Act's review scheme; quite to the contrary, the Government's case is premised on the notion that the Act's primary review mechanisms are open to the Sacketts. Finally, the Government notes that Congress passed the Clean Water Act in large part to respond to the inefciency of then-existing remedies for water pollution. Compliance orders, as noted above, can obtain quick remediation through voluntary compliance. The Government warns that the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are subject to judicial review. That may be true\u2014but it will be true for all agency actions subjected to judicial review. The APA's presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the princi\u00adple that efciency of regulation conquers all. And there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act was uniquely Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 131 Ginsburg, J., concurring designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties into \"voluntary compliance\" without the opportunity for judi\u00adcial review\u2014even judicial review of the question whether the regulated party is within the EPA's jurisdiction. Com\u00adpliance orders will remain an effective means of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those many cases where there is no substantial basis to question their validity. * * * We conclude that the compliance order in this case is nal agency action for which there is no adequate remedy other than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does not preclude that review. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further pro\u00adceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Ginsburg , concurring. Faced with an EPA administrative compliance order threatening tens of thousands of dollars in civil penalties per day, the Sacketts sued \"to contest the jurisdictional bases for the order.\" Brief for Petitioners 9. \"As a logical prerequi\u00adsite to the issuance of the challenged compliance order,\" the Sacketts contend, \"EPA had to determine that it has regula\u00adtory authority over [our] property.\" Id., at 54-55. The Court holds that the Sacketts may immediately litigate their jurisdictional challenge in federal court. I agree, for the Agency has ruled denitively on that question. Whether the Sacketts could challenge not only the EPA's authority to regulate their land under the Clean Water Act, but also, at this preenforcement stage, the terms and conditions of the compliance order, is a question today's opinion does not reach out to resolve. Not raised by the Sacketts here, the ques\u00adtion remains open for another day and case. On that under\u00adstanding, I join the Court's opinion. 132 SACKETT v. EPA Alito, J., concurring Justice Alito , concurring. The position taken in this case by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment\u2014a position that the Court now squarely rejects\u2014 would have put the property rights of ordinary Americans entirely at the mercy of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees. The reach of the Clean Water Act is notoriously unclear. Any piece of land that is wet at least part of the year is in danger of being classied by EPA employees as wetlands covered by the Act, and according to the Federal Govern\u00adment, if property owners begin to construct a home on a lot that the Agency thinks possesses the requisite wetness, the property owners are at the Agency's mercy. The EPA may issue a compliance order demanding that the owners cease construction, engage in expensive remedial measures, and abandon any use of the property. If the owners do not do the EPA's bidding, they may be ned up to $75,000 per day ($37,500 for violating the Act and another $37,500 for violat\u00ading the compliance order). And if the owners want their day in court to show that their lot does not include covered wetlands, well, as a practical matter, that is just too bad. Until the EPA sues them, they are blocked from access to the courts, and the EPA may wait as long as it wants before deciding to sue. By that time, the potential nes may easily have reached the millions. In a Nation that values due process, not to mention private property, such treatment is unthinkable. The Court's decision provides a modest measure of relief. At least, property owners like petitioners will have the right to challenge the EPA's jurisdictional determination under the Administrative Procedure Act. But the combination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act and the draco\u00adnian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners with little practi\u00adcal alternative but to dance to the EPA's tune. Cite as: 566 U. S. 120 (2012) 133 Alito, J., concurring Real relief requires Congress to do what it should have done in the rst place: provide a reasonably clear rule re\u00ad garding the reach of the Clean Water Act. When Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it provided that the Act covers \"the waters of the United States.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1362(7). But Congress did not dene what it meant by \"the waters of the United States\"; the phrase was not a term of art with a known meaning; and the words themselves are hopelessly indeterminate. Unsurprisingly, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers interpreted the phrase as an essentially limitless grant of authority. We rejected that boundless view, see Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 732-739 (2006) (plurality opinion); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167-174 (2001), but the precise reach of the Act remains unclear. For 40 years, Congress has done nothing to resolve this critical ambiguity, and the EPA has not seen t to pro\u00admulgate a rule providing a clear and sufciently limited denition of the phrase. Instead, the Agency has relied on informal guidance. But far from providing clarity and pre\u00addictability, the Agency's latest informal guidance advises property owners that many jurisdictional determinations concerning wetlands can only be made on a case-by-case basis by EPA eld staff. See Brief for Competitive Enter\u00adprise Institute as Amicus Curiae 7-13. Allowing aggrieved property owners to sue under the Ad\u00ad ministrative Procedure Act is better than nothing, but only clarication of the reach of the Clean Water Act can rectify the underlying problem. 134 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus MISSOURI v. FRYE certiorari to the court of appeals of missouri, west\u00ad ern district No. 10-444. Argued October 31, 2011\u2014Decided March 21, 2012 Respondent Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license. Be\u00ad cause he had been convicted of the same offense three times before, he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maximum 4-year prison term. The prosecutor sent Frye's counsel a letter, offer\u00ading two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90-day sentence. Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they expired. Less than a week before Frye's preliminary hearing, he was again arrested for driving with a revoked license. He subsequently pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced to three years in prison. Seeking postconviction relief in state court, he alleged his counsel's fail\u00adure to inform him of the earlier plea offers denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testied that he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of the offer. The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. Specically, the court found that defense counsel had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and concluded that Frye had shown that counsel's decient performance caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor. Held: 1. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel ex\u00ad tends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. That right applies to \"all 'critical' stages of the criminal proceedings.\" Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786. Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, established that Strickland's two-part test governs ineffective- assistance claims in the plea bargain context. There, the defendant had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about his plea, but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial had he received the proper advice. 474 U. S., at 60. In Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, where a plea offer was set aside because counsel had mis\u00adinformed the defendant of its immigration consequences, this Court made clear that \"the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical\" stage for ineffective-assistance purposes, id., at 373, and rejected the argument Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 135 Syllabus made by the State in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea super\u00ad sedes defense counsel's errors. The State attempts to distinguish Hill and Padilla from the instant case. It notes that Hill and Padilla con\u00ad cerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present, while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected; and it insists that there is no right to receive a plea offer in any event. Thus, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel's inadequacies when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved. While these contentions are neither illogical nor without some persua\u00adsive force, they do not sufce to overcome the simple reality that 97 percent of federal convictions and 94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas. Plea bargains have become so central to today's criminal justice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth Amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal process. Pp. 140-144. 2. As a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to this rule need not be addressed here, for the offer was a formal one with a xed expiration date. Standards for prompt communication and consultation recom\u00admended by the American Bar Association and adopted by numerous state and federal courts, though not determinative, serve as important guides. The prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims. First, a formal of\u00adfer's terms and processing can be documented. Second, States may re\u00adquire that all offers be in writing. Third, formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before the later proceed\u00adings commence. Here, as the result of counsel's decient performance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland, the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the breach of duty. Pp. 144-147. 3. To show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of counsel's decient performance, defendants must demon\u00adstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted the more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without the prosecu\u00adtion's canceling it or the trial court's refusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law. This appli\u00adcation of Strickland to uncommunicated, lapsed pleas does not alter 136 MISSOURI v. FRYE Syllabus Hill's standard, which requires a defendant complaining that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of going to trial to show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" 474 U. S., at 59. Hill correctly applies in the context in which it arose, but it does not provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from counsel's decient performance during plea negotiations. Because Frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to entering an open plea, Strickland's in\u00ad quiry into whether \"the result of the proceeding would have been differ\u00adent,\" 466 U. S., at 694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer. He must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented. This further showing is particularly important because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561, nor a federal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262. Missouri, among other States, appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a plea agreement; and the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro\u00adcedure, some state rules, including Missouri's, and this Court's prece\u00addents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements. Pp. 147-149. 4. Applying these standards here, the Missouri court correctly con\u00ad cluded that counsel's failure to inform Frye of the written plea offer before it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard, but it failed to require Frye to show that the plea offer would have been ad\u00adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court. These matters should be addressed by the Missouri appellate court in the rst instance. Given that Frye's new offense for driving without a license occurred a week before his preliminary hearing, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were required by state law to do so.

FRYE Opinion of the Court Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the ac\u00ad cused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). This case arises in the context of claimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a prose\u00adcution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered terms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea entered later. The initial question is whether the constitutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. If there is a right to effec\u00adtive assistance with respect to those offers, a further ques\u00adtion is what a defendant must demonstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from counsel's decient performance. Other questions relating to ineffective assistance with re\u00adspect to plea offers, including the question of proper reme\u00addies, are considered in a second case decided today. See Lafler v. Cooper , post, at 162-175. I In August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license. Frye had been convicted for that offense on three other occasions, so the State of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years. See Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 302.321.2, 558.011.1(4) (2011). On November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye's counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains. App. 50. The prosecutor rst offered to recommend a 3-year sentence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, without a recommendation regarding probation but with a recommen\u00addation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as so-called \"shock\" time. The second offer was to reduce the charge to a misde\u00admeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it, to recommend a Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 139 Opinion of the Court 90-day sentence. The misdemeanor charge of driving with a revoked license carries a maximum term of imprisonment of one year. 311 S. W. 3d 350, 360 (Mo. App. 2010). The letter stated both offers would expire on December 28. Frye's attorney did not advise Frye that the offers had been made. The offers expired. Id., at 356. Frye's preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4, 2008. On December 30, 2007, less than a week before the hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a revoked license. App. 47-48, 311 S. W. 3d, at 352-353. At the Janu\u00adary 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007 arrest. He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraignment but then changed his plea to guilty. There was no underlying plea agreement. App. 5, 13, 16. The state trial court accepted Frye's guilty plea. Id., at 21. The prosecutor recom\u00ad mended a 3-year sentence, made no recommendation regard\u00ading probation, and requested 10 days shock time in jail. Id., at 22. The trial judge sentenced Frye to three years in prison. Id., at 21, 23. Frye led for postconviction relief in state court. Id., at 8, 25-29. He alleged his counsel's failure to inform him of the prosecution's plea offer denied him the effective assist\u00adance of counsel. At an evidentiary hearing, Frye testied he would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor had he known about the offer. Id., at 34. A state court denied the postconviction motion, id., at 52- 57, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed, 311 S. W. 3d 350. It determined that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland. First, the court determined Frye's counsel's performance was decient because the \"record is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.\" 311 S. W. 3d, at 355, 356 (empha\u00adsis deleted). The court next concluded Frye had shown his counsel's decient performance caused him prejudice be\u00ad140 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court cause \"Frye pled guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a maximum sentence of four years instead of one year.\" Id., at 360. To implement a remedy for the violation, the court deemed Frye's guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to allow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty to any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to charge. This Court granted certiorari. 562 U. S. 1128 (2011). II A It is well settled that the right to the effective assistance of counsel applies to certain steps before trial. The \"Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have coun\u00adsel present at all 'critical' stages of the criminal proceed\u00adings.\" Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786 (2009) (quot\u00ad ing United States v. Wade , 388 U. S. 218, 227-228 (1967)). Critical stages include arraignments, postindictment inter\u00adrogations, postindictment lineups, and the entry of a guilty plea. See Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 (1961) (arraign\u00ad ment); Massiah v. United States, 377 U. 407 U. S. 25 (1972) (guilty plea). With respect to the right to effective counsel in plea nego\u00ad tiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two cases from this Court considering the role of counsel in advising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty plea: Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985); and Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356 (2010). Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-part test set forth in Strickland. See Hill, supra, at 57. As noted above, in Frye's case, the Missouri Court of Ap\u00adpeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, determined rst that defense counsel had been ineffective and second that there was resulting prejudice. Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 141 Opinion of the Court In Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the Strickland test. There, a defendant who had entered a guilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of the amount of time he would have to serve before he became eligible for parole. But the defendant had not alleged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had been given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and proceed to trial. Thus, the Court found that no prejudice from the in\u00adadequate advice had been shown or alleged. Hill, supra, at 60. In Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of counsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer that leads to a guilty plea. Padilla held that a guilty plea, based on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel misinformed the defendant of the immigration consequences of the convic\u00adtion. The Court made clear that \"the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\" 559 U. S., at 373. It also rejected the argument made by petitioner in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes errors by defense counsel. Cf. Brief for Re\u00adspondent in Padilla v. Kentucky , O. T. 2009, No. 08-651, p. 27 (arguing Sixth Amendment's assurance of effective assist\u00adance \"does not extend to collateral aspects of the prosecu\u00adtion\" because \"knowledge of the consequences that are col\u00adlateral to the guilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing and intelligent plea\"). In the case now before the Court the State, as petitioner, points out that the legal question presented is different from that in Hill and Padilla. In those cases the claim was that the prisoner's plea of guilty was invalid because counsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the plea. In the in\u00adstant case, by contrast, the guilty plea that was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in court, were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel. The chal\u00adlenge is not to the advice pertaining to the plea that was 142 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court accepted but rather to the course of legal representation that preceded it with respect to other potential pleas and plea offers. To give further support to its contention that the instant case is in a category different from what the Court consid\u00adered in Hill and Padilla, the State urges that there is no right to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event. See Weatherford v. Bursey , 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). It claims Frye therefore was not deprived of any legal benet to which he was entitled. Under this view, any wrongful or mistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea offers is beside the point. The State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present. Before a guilty plea is entered the defendant's understand\u00ading of the plea and its consequences can be established on the record. This affords the State substantial protection against later claims that the plea was the result of inade\u00adquate advice. At the plea entry proceedings the trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to establish on the rec\u00adord that the defendant understands the process that led to any offer, the advantages and disadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing consequences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is entered based upon the plea. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11; Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02 (2004). Hill and Padilla both illustrate that, nevertheless, there may be instances when claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the conviction is entered. Still, the State, and the trial court itself, have had a substantial opportunity to guard against this contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceeding that the defendant has been given proper advice or, if the advice received appears to have been inade\u00adquate, to remedy that deciency before the plea is accepted and the conviction entered. Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 143 Opinion of the Court When a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected, however, no formal court proceedings are involved. This underscores that the plea-bargaining process is often in flux, with no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial supervision of the discussions between prosecution and defense. Indeed, discussions between client and defense counsel are privi\u00adleged. So the prosecution has little or no notice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity to intervene in any event. And, as noted, the State insists there is no right to receive a plea offer. For all these reasons, the State con\u00adtends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel's inadequacies, especially when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or, as here, for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved. The State's contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, yet they do not sufce to overcome a simple reality. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics On\u00adline, Table 5.22.2009, http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/ t5222009.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 1, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court's case le); Dept. of Jus\u00adtice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M. Du-rose, & D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006\u00adStatistical Tables, p. 1 (NCJ226846, rev. Nov. 2010), http:// bjs. ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc06st.pdf; Padilla , 559 U. S., at 372 (recognizing pleas account for nearly 95 percent of all criminal convictions). The reality is that plea bar\u00adgains have become so central to the administration of the criminal justice system that defense counsel have responsi\u00adbilities in the plea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth Amendment requires in the criminal process at critical stages. Because ours \"is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,\" Lafler , post, at 170, it is insuf\u00ad144 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court cient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process. \"To a large extent . . . horse trading [between prosecutor and defense counsel] determines who goes to jail and for how long. That is what plea bargaining is. It is not some ad\u00adjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal justice system.\" Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992). See also Barkow, Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 989, 1034 (2006) (\"[Defendants] who do take their case to trial and lose receive longer sentences than even Congress or the prosecu\u00adtor might think appropriate, because the longer sentences exist on the books largely for bargaining purposes. This often results in individuals who accept a plea bargain receiv\u00ading shorter sentences than other individuals who are less morally culpable but take a chance and go to trial\" (footnote omitted)). In today's criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost always the critical point for a defendant. To note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criti\u00ad cize it. The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial re\u00adsources and for defendants to admit their crimes and receive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a plea agree\u00adment can benet both parties. In order that these benets can be realized, however, criminal defendants require effec\u00adtive counsel during plea negotiations. \"Anything less . . . might deny a defendant 'effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.' \" Massiah, 377 U. S., at 204 (quoting Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959) (Douglas, J., concurring)). B The inquiry then becomes how to dene the duty and re\u00ad sponsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process. This is a difcult question. \"The art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy, and it presents Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 145 Opinion of the Court questions further removed from immediate judicial super\u00ad vision.\" Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. 115, 125 (2011). Bar\u00ad gaining is, by its nature, dened to a substantial degree by personal style. The alternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so individual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to try to elaborate or dene detailed stand\u00adards for the proper discharge of defense counsel's participa\u00adtion in the process. Cf. ibid. This case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to dene the duties of defense counsel in those respects, how\u00adever. Here the question is whether defense counsel has the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a lesser sen\u00adtence, a conviction on lesser charges, or both. This Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense coun\u00ad sel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to that rule need not be explored here, for the offer was a formal one with a xed expiration date. When defense counsel al\u00adlowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the Constitution requires. Though the standard for counsel's performance is not de\u00ad termined solely by reference to codied standards of profes\u00adsional practice, these standards can be important guides. The American Bar Association recommends defense counsel \"promptly communicate and explain to the defendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attorney,\" ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty 14-3.2(a) (3d ed. 1999), and this standard has been adopted by numerous state and federal courts over the last 30 years. See, e. g., Davie v. State , 381 S. C. 601, 608-609, 675 S. E. 2d 416, 420 (2009); Cottle v. State , 733 963, 965-966 (Fla. 1999) (per cu\u00ad riam); Becton v. Hun, 205 W. Va. 139, 144, 516 S. E. 2d 762, 767 (1999); Harris v. State , 875 S. W. 2d 662, 665 (Tenn. 1994); 146 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court Lloyd v. State , 258 Ga. 645, 648, 373 S. E. 2d 1, 3 (1988); United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d 747, 752 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); Pham v. United States, 317 F. 3d 178, 182 (CA2 2003); United States ex rel. Caruso 2d 435, 438 (CA3 1982); Grifn United States, 330 F. 3d 733, 737 (CA6 2003); Johnson v. Duckworth, 793 F. 2d 898, 902 3d 1458, 1466 (CA9 1994); cf. Diaz v. United States, 930 F. 2d 832, 834 (CA11 1991). The standard for prompt communication and consultation is also set out in state bar professional stand\u00adards for attorneys. See, e. g., Fla. Rule Regulating Bar 4- 1.4 (2008); Ill. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011); Kan. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2010); Ky. Sup. Ct. Rule 3.130, Rule Prof. Con\u00adduct 1.4 (2011); Mass. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011-2012); Mich. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011). The prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction with resulting harsh consequences. First, the fact of a formal offer means that its terms and its processing can be documented so that what took place in the negotiation process becomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the conduct of earlier pretrial negotiations. Second, States may elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing, again to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabricated charges. See N. J. Ct. Rule 3:9-1(b) (2012) (\"Any plea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing and forwarded to the defendant's attorney\"). Third, formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or be\u00adfore a trial on the merits, all to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before those further proceedings com\u00admence. At least one State often follows a similar procedure before trial. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 20 (discussing hear\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 147 Opinion of the Court ings in Arizona conducted pursuant to State v. Donald, 198 Ariz. 406, 10 P. 3d 1193 (App. 2000)); see also N. J. Ct.

Here defense counsel did not communicate the formal of\u00ad fers to the defendant. As a result of that decient perform\u00adance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland, the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the breach of duty. C To show prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of counsel's decient performance, defendants must demon\u00adstrate a reasonable probability they would have accepted the earlier plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel. Defendants must also demonstrate a reasonable probability the plea would have been entered without the prosecution canceling it or the trial court refusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law. To establish prejudice in this instance, it is neces\u00adsary to show a reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by rea\u00adson of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time. Cf. Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203 (2001) (\"[A]ny amount of [additional] jail time has Sixth Amend\u00adment signicance\"). 148 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court This application of Strickland to the instances of an un\u00ad communicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill. In cases where a defendant complains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer as op\u00adposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant will have to show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" Hill, 474 U. S., at 59. Hill was correctly decided and applies in the context in which it arose. Hill does not, however, provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from the decient performance of counsel during plea negotiations. Unlike the defendant in Hill, Frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer (limiting his sentence to one year in prison) as opposed to entering an open plea (exposing him to a maximum sentence of four years' imprisonment). In a case, such as this, where a defendant pleads guilty to less favorable terms and claims that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to miss out on a more favorable earlier plea offer, Strickland's inquiry into whether \"the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" 466 U. S., at 694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial absent ineffective assistance but whether he would have accepted the offer to plead pursuant to the terms earlier proposed. In order to complete a showing of Strickland prejudice, defendants who have shown a reasonable probability they would have accepted the earlier plea offer must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel it or if the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being ac\u00adcepted or implemented. This further showing is of particu\u00adlar importance because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford, 429 U. S., at 561, nor a federal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 149 Opinion of the Court 257, 262 (1971). In at least some States, including Missouri, it appears the prosecution has some discretion to cancel a plea agreement to which the defendant has agreed, see, e. g., 311 S. W. 3d, at 359 (case below); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 17.4(b) (Supp. 2011). The Federal Rules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this Court's precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3); see Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4); Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243-244 (1969). It can be assumed that in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences. So in most instances it should not be difcult to make an objective assessment as to whether or not a particular fact or intervening circumstance would sufce, in the normal course, to cause prosecutorial with\u00addrawal or judicial nonapproval of a plea bargain. The de\u00adtermination that there is or is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been differ\u00adent absent counsel's errors can be conducted within that framework. III These standards must be applied to the instant case. As regards the decient performance prong of Strickland, the Court of Appeals found the \"record is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the [formal] Offer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evi\u00addence that Frye's conduct interfered with trial counsel's abil\u00adity to do so.\" 311 S. W. 3d, at 356. On this record, it is evident that Frye's attorney did not make a meaningful at\u00adtempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer before the offer expired. See supra, at 139. The Missouri Court of Appeals was correct that \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Strickland , supra, at 688. The Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the precise standard for prejudice in this context. As noted, a 150 MISSOURI v. FRYE Opinion of the Court defendant in Frye's position must show not only a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed plea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement and that it would have been ac\u00adcepted by the trial court. Frye can show he would have accepted the offer, but there is strong reason to doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have permitted the plea bargain to become nal. There appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would have accepted the prosecutor's original offer of a plea bar\u00adgain if the offer had been communicated to him, because he pleaded guilty to a more serious charge, with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prosecutor. It may be that in some cases defendants must show more than just a guilty plea to a charge or sentence harsher than the orig\u00adinal offer. For example, revelations between plea offers about the strength of the prosecution's case may make a late decision to plead guilty insufcient to demonstrate, without further evidence, that the defendant would have pleaded guilty to an earlier, more generous plea offer if his counsel had reported it to him. Here, however, that is not the case. The Court of Appeals did not err in nding Frye's acceptance of the less favorable plea offer indicated that he would have accepted the earlier (and more favorable) offer had he been apprised of it; and there is no need to address here the show\u00adings that might be required in other cases. The Court of Appeals failed, however, to require Frye to show that the rst plea offer, if accepted by Frye, would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court. Whether the prosecution and trial court are required to do so is a matter of state law, and it is not the place of this Court to settle those matters. The Court has estab\u00adlished the minimum requirements of the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Strickland, and States have the discretion to add procedural protections under state law if they choose. A State may choose to preclude the prosecution from with\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 151 Scalia, J., dissenting drawing a plea offer once it has been accepted or perhaps to preclude a trial court from rejecting a plea bargain. In Missouri, it appears \"a plea offer once accepted by the de\u00adfendant can be withdrawn without recourse\" by the prosecu\u00adtion. 311 S. W. 3d, at 359. The extent of the trial court's discretion in Missouri to reject a plea agreement appears to be in some doubt. Compare id., at 360, with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4). We remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consider these state-law questions, because they bear on the federal question of Strickland prejudice. If, as the Missouri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the prosecutor would have adhered to the agreement, there is no Strickland prejudice. Likewise, if the trial court could have refused to accept the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no Strickland prejudice. In this case, given Frye's new offense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless they were required by state law to do so. It is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals to address this question in the rst instance. The judgment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice , Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, dissenting. This is a companion case to Lafler v. Cooper , post, p. 156. The principal difference between the cases is that the fair\u00adness of the defendant's conviction in Lafler was established by a full trial and jury verdict, whereas Frye's conviction 152 MISSOURI v. FRYE Scalia, J., dissenting here was established by his own admission of guilt, received by the court after the usual colloquy that ensured it was voluntary and truthful. In Lafler all that could be said (and as I discuss there it was quite enough) is that the fairness of the conviction was clear, though a unanimous jury nding beyond a reasonable doubt can sometimes be wrong. Here it can be said not only that the process was fair, but that the defendant acknowledged the correctness of his conviction. Thus, as far as the reasons for my dissent are concerned, this is an a fortiori case. I will not repeat here the constitu\u00ad tional points that I discuss at length in Lafler , but I will briefly apply those points to the facts here and comment upon a few statements in the Court's analysis. * * * Galin Frye's attorney failed to inform him about a plea offer, and Frye ultimately pleaded guilty without the benet of a deal. Counsel's mistake did not deprive Frye of any substantive or procedural right; only of the opportunity to accept a plea bargain to which he had no entitlement in the rst place. So little entitlement that, had he known of and accepted the bargain, the prosecution would have been able to withdraw it right up to the point that his guilty plea pur\u00adsuant to the bargain was accepted. See 311 S. W. 3d 350, 359, and n. 4 (Mo. App. 2010). The Court acknowledges, moreover, that Frye's conviction was untainted by attorney error: \"[T]he guilty plea that was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in court, were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel.\" Ante, at 141. Given the \"ultimate focus\" of our ineffective-assistance cases on \"the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged,\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 696 (1984), that should be the end of the matter. Instead, here, as in Lafler , the Court mechanically applies an outcome-based test for prejudice, and mistakes the possibility of a different result for constitu\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 153 Scalia, J., dissenting tional injustice. As I explain in Lafler, post, p. 175 (dissent\u00ad ing opinion), that approach is contrary to our precedents on the right to effective counsel, and for good reason. The Court announces its holding that \"as a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution\" as though that resolves a disputed point; in reality, however, neither the State nor the Solicitor General argued that counsel's performance here was ade\u00adquate. Ante, at 145. The only issue was whether the inade\u00ad quacy deprived Frye of his constitutional right to a fair trial. In other cases, however, it will not be so clear that counsel's plea-bargaining skills, which must now meet a constitutional minimum, are adequate. \"[H]ow to dene the duty and re\u00adsponsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process,\" the Court acknowledges, \"is a difficult question,\" since \"[b]argaining is, by its nature, dened to a substantial degree by personal style.\" Ante , at 144-145. Indeed. What if an attorney's \"personal style\" is to establish a reputation as a hard bargainer by, for example, advising clients to proceed to trial rather than accept anything but the most favorable plea offers? It seems inconceivable that a lawyer could com\u00adpromise his client's constitutional rights so that he can secure better deals for other clients in the future; does a hard-bargaining \"personal style\" now violate the Sixth Amend\u00adment? The Court ignores such difculties, however, since \"[t]his case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to dene the duties of defense counsel in those respects.\" Ante , at 145. Perhaps not. But it does present the neces\u00ad sity of confronting the serious difculties that will be created by constitutionalization of the plea-bargaining process. It will not do simply to announce that they will be solved in the sweet by-and-by. While the inadequacy of counsel's performance in this case is clear enough, whether it was prejudicial (in the sense that the Court's new version of Strickland requires) is not. The Court's description of how that question is to be answered 154 MISSOURI v. FRYE Scalia, J., dissenting on remand is alone enough to show how unwise it is to consti\u00ad tutionalize the plea-bargaining process. Prejudice is to be determined, the Court tells us, by a process of retrospective crystal-ball gazing posing as legal analysis. First of all, of course, we must estimate whether the defendant would have accepted the earlier plea bargain. Here that seems an easy question, but as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 150, it will not always be. Next, since Missouri, like other States, per\u00admits accepted plea offers to be withdrawn by the prosecution (a reality which alone should sufce, one would think, to demonstrate that Frye had no entitlement to the plea bar\u00ad gain), we must estimate whether the prosecution would have withdrawn the plea offer. And nally, we must estimate whether the trial court would have approved the plea agree\u00ad ment. These last two estimations may seem easy in the present case, since Frye committed a new infraction before the hearing at which the agreement would have been pre\u00adsented; but they assuredly will not be easy in the mine run of cases. The Court says \"[i]t can be assumed that in most jurisdic\u00ad tions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the bound\u00adaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.\" Ante, at 149. Assuredly it can, just as it can be assumed that the sun rises in the west; but I know of no basis for the assumption. Virtually no cases deal with the standards for a prosecutor's withdrawal from a plea agreement beyond stating the gen\u00aderal rule that a prosecutor may withdraw any time prior to, but not after, the entry of a guilty plea or other action constituting detrimental reliance on the defendant's part. See, e. g., United States v. Kuchinski, 469 F. 3d 853, 857-858 (CA9 2006). And cases addressing trial courts' authority to accept or reject plea agreements almost universally observe that a trial court enjoys broad discretion in this regard. See, e. g., State v. Banks, 135 S. W. 3d 497, 500 (Mo. App. 2004) (trial court abuses its discretion in rejecting a plea only if the decision \"is so arbitrary and unreasonable that Cite as: 566 U. S. 134 (2012) 155 Scalia, J., dissenting it shocks the sense of justice and indicates a lack of care\u00ad ful consideration\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Of course after today's opinions there will be cases galore, so the Court's assumption would better be cast as an optimistic prediction of the certainty that will emerge, many years hence, from our newly created constitutional eld of plea-bargaining law. Whatever the \"boundaries\" ultimately de\u00advised (if that were possible), a vast amount of discretion will still remain, and it is extraordinary to make a defendant's constitutional rights depend upon a series of retrospective mind-readings as to how that discretion, in prosecutors and trial judges, would have been exercised. The plea-bargaining process is a subject worthy of regula\u00ad tion, since it is the means by which most criminal convictions are obtained. It happens not to be, however, a subject cov\u00adered by the Sixth Amendment, which is concerned not with the fairness of bargaining but with the fairness of conviction. \"The Constitution . . . is not an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world; and when we ignore its text in order to make it that, we often nd ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack hammer is needed.\" Padilla v. Ken\u00ad tucky , 559 U. S. 356, 388 (2010) (Scalia, J., dissenting). In this case and its companion, the Court's sledge may require the reversal of perfectly valid, eminently just, convictions. A legislature could solve the problems presented by these cases in a much more precise and efcient manner. It might begin, for example, by penalizing the attorneys who made such grievous errors. That type of sub-constitutional rem\u00adedy is not available to the Court, which is limited to penaliz\u00ading (almost) everyone else by reversing valid convictions or sentences. Because that result is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment and decades of our precedent, I respect\u00adfully dissent. 156 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus LAFLER v. COOPER certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit No. 10-209. Argued October 31, 2011\u2014Decided March 21, 2012 Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses. The prosecution offered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence on the other two, in exchange for a guilty plea. In a communication with the court, respondent admitted his guilt and expressed a willingness to ac\u00adcept the offer. But he rejected the offer, allegedly after his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below the waist. At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and received a mandatory mini\u00admum 185-to-360-month sentence. In a subsequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondent's claim that his attorney's advice to re\u00adject the plea constituted ineffective assistance. The Michigan Court of Appeals afrmed, rejecting the ineffective-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial. Respondent renewed his claim in federal habeas. Finding that the state appellate court had unreason\u00adably applied the constitutional effective-assistance standards laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, the District Court granted a conditional writ and ordered specic performance of the original plea offer. The Sixth Circuit afrmed. Applying Strickland, it found that counsel had provided decient per\u00ad formance by advising respondent of an incorrect legal rule, and that respondent suffered prejudice because he lost the opportunity to take the more favorable sentence offered in the plea. Held: 1. Where counsel's ineffective advice led to an offer's rejection, and where the prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice, there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sen\u00adtence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed. Pp. 162-170. (a) Because the parties agree that counsel's performance was de\u00ad cient, the only question is how to apply Strickland's prejudice test Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 157 Syllabus where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial. Pp. 162-163. (b) In that context, the Strickland prejudice test requires a defend\u00ad ant to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice. The Sixth Circuit and other federal appellate courts have agreed with the Strickland prej\u00ad udice test for rejected pleas adopted here by this Court. Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a narrow view\u2014that Strickland prejudice cannot arise from plea bargaining if the defendant is later convicted at a fair trial\u2014but their reasoning is unpersuasive. First, they claim that the Sixth Amendment's sole purpose is to protect the right to a fair trial, but the Amendment actually requires effective assistance at criti\u00adcal stages of a criminal proceeding, including pretrial stages. This is consistent with the right to effective assistance on appeal, see, e. g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, and the right to counsel during sen\u00ad tencing, see, e. g., Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203-204. This Court has not followed a rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular error at issue. See, e. g., Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U. S. 254, 263. Second, this Court has previously rejected petitioner's argument that Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, modied Strickland and does so again here. Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside , 475 U. S. 157, demonstrate that \"it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate 'prejudice,' \" Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S. 362, 391-392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense strategy outside the law. Here, however, respondent seeks relief from counsel's failure to meet a valid legal standard. Third, petitioner seeks to pre\u00adserve the conviction by arguing that the Sixth Amendment's purpose is to ensure a conviction's reliability, but this argument fails to compre\u00adhend the full scope of the Sixth Amendment and is refuted by precedent. Here, the question is the fairness or reliability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which caused respondent to lose benets he would have received but for counsel's ineffective assistance. Further\u00admore, a reliable trial may not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have altered the outcome. See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 379. Petitioner's position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective assistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials. See Missouri v. Frye , ante, at 143-144. Pp. 163-170. 2. Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the re\u00ad jection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the remedy 158 LAFLER v. COOPER Syllabus must \"neutralize the taint\" of a constitutional violation, United States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 365, but must not grant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State properly in\u00ad vested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72. If the sole advantage is that the defendant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court should have an evi\u00addentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant would have ac\u00adcepted the plea. If so, the court may exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something in between. However, resen\u00adtencing based on the conviction at trial may not sufce, e. g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious counts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial, or where a mandatory sentence connes a judge's sentencing discretion. In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea. The judge can then exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and accept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed. In either situation, a court must weigh various factors. Here, it sufces to give two relevant considerations. First, a court may take account of a defendant's earlier expressed willingness, or unwill\u00adingness, to accept responsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary here to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard any information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer was made. Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such claims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed or that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland claims. In addition, the prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims. See Frye , ante, at 146. Pp. 170-172. 3. This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\u00ad alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Appeals' analysis of respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was con\u00adtrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no bar to re\u00adlief. Respondent has satised Strickland's two-part test. The parties concede the fact of decient performance. And respondent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea. In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3\u00bd times greater than he would have received under the plea. As a remedy, the District Court ordered specic per\u00adformance of the plea agreement, but the correct remedy is to order the Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 159 Syllabus State to reoffer the plea. If respondent accepts the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determining whether to vacate respondent's convictions and resentence pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence resulting from the trial undisturbed.

COOPER Opinion of the Court Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. In this case, as in Missouri v. Frye, ante , p. 134, also de\u00ad cided today, a criminal defendant seeks a remedy when inad\u00ad equate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of a plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable outcome. In Frye , defense counsel did not inform the defendant of the plea offer; and after the offer lapsed the defendant still pleaded guilty, but on more severe terms. Here, the favor\u00adable plea offer was reported to the client but, on advice of counsel, was rejected. In Frye , there was a later guilty plea. Here, after the plea offer had been rejected, there was a full and fair trial before a jury. After a guilty verdict, the defendant received a sentence harsher than that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant case comes to the Court with the concession that counsel's advice with respect to the plea offer fell below the standard of adequate assist\u00adance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, appli\u00adcable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. I On the evening of March 25, 2003, respondent pointed a gun toward Kali Mundy's head and red. From the record, it is unclear why respondent did this, and at trial it was sug- Mark L.

Respondent followed in pursuit, ring re\u00adpeatedly. Mundy was shot in her buttock, hip, and abdomen but survived the assault. Respondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent to murder, possession of a rearm by a felon, possession of a rearm in the commission of a felony, misde\u00admeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a habitual of\u00adfender. On two occasions, the prosecution offered to dismiss some of the charges and to recommend a sentence of 51 to 85 months for the remaining charges, in exchange for a guilty plea. In a communication with the court respondent admitted guilt and expressed a willingness to accept the offer. Respondent, however, later rejected the offer on both occasions, allegedly after his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to establish his intent to murder Mundy because she had been shot below the waist. On the rst day of trial the prosecution offered a signicantly less favorable plea deal, which respondent again rejected. After trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and received a mandatory minimum sentence of 185 to 360 months' imprisonment. In a so-called Ginther hearing before the state trial court, see People v. Ginther , 390 Mich. 436, 212 N. W. 2d 922 (1973), respondent argued his attorney's advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assistance. The trial judge rejected the claim, and the Michigan Court of Appeals afrmed. People v. Cooper , No. 250583 (Mar. 15, 2005) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a, 2005 WL 599740. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that respondent knowingly and in\u00adtelligently rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial. The Michigan Supreme Court denied respondent's applica\u00adtion for leave to le an appeal. People v. Cooper , 474 Mich. 905, 705 N. W. 2d 118 (2005) (table). 162 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court Respondent then led a petition for federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, renewing his ineffective-assistance\u00ad of-counsel claim. After nding, as required by the Antiter\u00adrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), that the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably ap\u00adplied the constitutional standards for effective assistance of counsel laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), the District Court granted a conditional writ. No. 06-11068 (ED Mich., Mar. 26, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-42a, 2009 WL 817712, *10. To remedy the violation, the District Court ordered \"specific performance of [respondent's] original plea agreement, for a minimum sentence in the range of fty-one to eighty-ve months.\" Id., at *9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit afrmed, 376 Fed. Appx. 563 (2010), nding \"[e]ven full def\u00aderence under AEDPA cannot salvage the state court's deci\u00adsion,\" id., at 569. Applying Strickland, the Court of Ap\u00ad peals found that respondent's attorney had provided decient performance by informing respondent of \"an incorrect legal rule,\" 376 Fed. Appx., at 570-571, and that respondent suf\u00adfered prejudice because he \"lost out on an opportunity to plead guilty and receive the lower sentence that was offered to him,\" id., at 573. This Court granted certiorari. 562 U. S. 1127 (2011). II A Defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a right that extends to the plea-bargaining process. Frye , ante, at 144; see also Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, 364 (2010); Hill, supra, at 57. During plea negotiations defend\u00ad ants are \"entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel.\" McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771 (1970). In Hill, the Court held \"the two-part Strickland v. Washing\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 163 Opinion of the Court ton test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffec\u00ad tive assistance of counsel.\" 474 U. S., at 58. The perform\u00ad ance prong of Strickland requires a defendant to show \" 'that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.' \" 474 U. S., at 57 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688). In this case all parties agree the performance of respondent's counsel was decient when he advised re\u00adspondent to reject the plea offer on the grounds he could not be convicted at trial. In light of this concession, it is unnecessary for this Court to explore the issue. The question for this Court is how to apply Strickland's prejudice test where ineffective assistance results in a rejec\u00adtion of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial. B To establish Strickland prejudice a defendant must \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id., at 694. In the context of pleas a defendant must show the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice. See Frye , ante, at 148 (noting that Strickland's inquiry, as applied to advice with respect to plea bargains, turns on \"whether 'the re\u00adsult of the proceeding would have been different' \" (quoting Strickland, supra, at 694)); see also Hill, 474 U. on whether counsel's constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process\"). In Hill, when evaluating the petitioner's claim that ineffective assistance led to the improvident acceptance of a guilty plea, the Court required the petitioner to show \"that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" Ibid. In contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to an offer's acceptance but to its rejection. Having to stand 164 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court trial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged. In these circumstances a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court (i. e., that the defendant would have accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of inter\u00advening circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed. Here, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with that test for Strickland prejudice in the context of a rejected plea bargain. This is consistent with the test adopted and applied by other appellate courts without demonstrated dif\u00adculties or systemic disruptions. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571-573; see also, e. g., United States v. Rodriguez Rodri\u00ad guez, 929 F. 2d 747, 753, n. 1 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); United States v. Gordon, 156 F. 3d 376, 380-381 (CA2 1998) (per cu\u00ad riam); United States v. Day, F. 2d 39, 43-45 (CA3 1992); Beckham 1981); Ju\u00ad 571 F. 3d 1094-1095 (CA10 2009) (per curiam); United States v. 3d 1498, 1512-1514 (CADC 1997) (per curiam). Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a different, far more narrow, view of the Sixth Amendment. They con\u00adtend there can be no nding of Strickland prejudice arising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later convicted at a fair trial. The three reasons petitioner and the Solicitor General offer for their approach are unpersuasive. First, petitioner and the Solicitor General claim that the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the right to a fair trial. Errors before trial, they argue, are not cogni\u00adzable under the Sixth Amendment unless they affect the fair\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 165 Opinion of the Court ness of the trial itself. See Brief for Petitioner 12-21; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10-12. The Sixth Amendment, however, is not so narrow in its reach. Cf. Frye , ante, at 148 (holding that a defendant can show preju\u00ad dice under Strickland even absent a showing that the de\u00ad cient performance precluded him from going to trial). The Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of counsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its protections are not designed simply to protect the trial, even though \"coun\u00adsel's absence [in these stages] may derogate from the ac\u00adcused's right to a fair trial.\" United States v. Wade , 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). The constitutional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are part of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a proceeding in which defendants cannot be presumed to make critical decisions without coun\u00adsel's advice. This is consistent, too, with the rule that de\u00adfendants have a right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal, even though that cannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial. See, e. g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605 (2005); Evitts v. Lucey , 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The prece\u00ad dents also establish that there exists a right to counsel dur\u00ading sentencing in both noncapital, see Glover v. United States, U. S. 198, 203-204 (2001); Mempa v. Rhay , 389 U. S. 128 (1967), and capital cases, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 538 (2003). Even though sentencing does not con\u00ad cern the defendant's guilt or innocence, ineffective assistance of counsel during a sentencing hearing can result in Strick\u00ad land prejudice because \"any amount of [additional] jail time has Sixth Amendment signicance.\" Glover , supra, at 203. The Court, moreover, has not followed a rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at the trial itself. It has inquired instead whether the trial cured the particular error at issue. Thus, in Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U. S. 254 (1986), the deliberate exclusion of all African- Americans from a grand jury was prejudicial because a de\u00ad166 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court fendant may have been tried on charges that would not have been brought at all by a properly constituted grand jury. Id., at 263; see Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187, 195 (1946) (dismissing an indictment returned by a grand jury from which women were excluded); see also Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, 218-219 (1960) (reversing a defendant's conviction because the jury may have based its verdict on acts not charged in the indictment). By contrast, in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66 (1986), the complained-of error was a violation of a grand jury rule meant to ensure probable cause existed to believe a defend\u00ad ant was guilty. A subsequent trial, resulting in a verdict of guilt, cured this error. See id., at 72-73. In the instant case respondent went to trial rather than accept a plea deal, and it is conceded this was the result of ineffective assistance during the plea negotiation process. Respondent received a more severe sentence at trial, one 3\u00bd times more severe than he likely would have received by pleading guilty. Far from curing the error, the trial caused the injury from the error. Even if the trial itself is free from constitutional flaw, the defendant who goes to trial instead of taking a more favorable plea may be prejudiced from either a conviction on more serious counts or the imposition of a more severe sentence. Second, petitioner claims this Court rened Strickland's prejudice analysis in Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), to add an additional requirement that the defendant show that ineffective assistance of counsel led to his being denied a substantive or procedural right. Brief for Peti\u00adtioner 12-13. The Court has rejected the argument that Fretwell modied Strickland before and does so again now. See Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000) (\"The Vir\u00ad ginia Supreme Court erred in holding that our decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), modied or in some way supplanted the rule set down in Strickland\"); see also Glover , supra, at 203 (\"The Court explained last Term Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 167 Opinion of the Court [in Williams ] that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant the Strickland analysis\"). Fretwell could not show Strickland prejudice resulting from his attorney's failure to object to the use of a sentencing factor the Eighth Circuit had erroneously (and temporarily) found to be impermissible. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at 373. Be\u00ad cause the objection upon which his ineffective-assistance-of\u00adcounsel claim was premised was meritless, Fretwell could not demonstrate an error entitling him to relief. The case presented the \"unusual circumstance where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry.\" Ibid. (O'Connor, J., concurring). See also ibid. (recognizing \"[t]he determinative question\u2014whether there is a reasonable prob\u00adability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u2014remains un\u00adchanged\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). It is for this same reason a defendant cannot show prejudice based on counsel's refusal to present perjured testimony, even if such testimony might have affected the outcome of the case. See Nix v. Whiteside , 475 U. S. 157, 175 (1986) (holding rst that counsel's refusal to present perjured testi\u00admony breached no professional duty and second that it can\u00adnot establish prejudice under Strickland). Both Fretwell and Nix are instructive in that they demon\u00ad strate \"there are also situations in which it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legiti\u00admate 'prejudice,' \" Williams, supra, at 391-392, because defendants would receive a windfall as a result of the appli\u00adcation of an incorrect legal principle or a defense strategy outside the law. Here, however, the injured client seeks re\u00adlief from counsel's failure to meet a valid legal standard, not from counsel's refusal to violate it. He maintains that, ab\u00adsent ineffective counsel, he would have accepted a plea offer for a sentence the prosecution evidently deemed consistent with the sound administration of criminal justice. The fa\u00ad168 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court vorable sentence that eluded the defendant in the criminal proceeding appears to be the sentence he or others in his position would have received in the ordinary course, absent the failings of counsel. See Bibas, Regulating the Plea-Bargaining Market: From Caveat Emptor to Consumer Pro\u00adtection, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 1117, 1138 (2011) (\"The expected post-trial sentence is imposed in only a few percent of cases. It is like the sticker price for cars: only an ignorant, ill-advised consumer would view full price as the norm and any\u00adthing less as a bargain\"); see also Frye , ante, at 143-144. If a plea bargain has been offered, a defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel in considering whether to ac\u00adcept it. If that right is denied, prejudice can be shown if loss of the plea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a con\u00adviction on more serious charges or the imposition of a more severe sentence. It is, of course, true that defendants have \"no right to be offered a plea . . . nor a federal right that the judge accept it.\" Frye , ante, at 148. In the circumstances here, that is beside the point. If no plea offer is made, or a plea deal is accepted by the defendant but rejected by the judge, the issue raised here simply does not arise. Much the same rea\u00adsoning guides cases that nd criminal defendants have a right to effective assistance of counsel in direct appeals even though the Constitution does not require States to provide a system of appellate review at all. See Evitts, 469 U. S. 387; see also Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963). As in those cases, \"when a State opts to act in a eld where its action has signicant discretionary elements, it must none\u00adtheless act in accord with the dictates of the Constitution.\" Evitts, supra, at 401. Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction obtained by the State by arguing that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to ensure \"the reliability of [a] conviction fol\u00adlowing trial.\" Brief for Petitioner 13. This argument, too, fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth Amendment's protections; and it is refuted by precedent. Strickland rec\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 169 Opinion of the Court ognized \"[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec\u00ad tiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\" 466 U. S., at 686. The goal of a just result is not divorced from the reliability of a conviction, see United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984); but here the question is not the fairness or reliability of the trial but the fairness and regularity of the processes that preceded it, which caused the defendant to lose benets he would have received in the ordinary course but for counsel's ineffective assistance. There are instances, furthermore, where a reliable trial does not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have altered the outcome. In Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), the Court held that an at\u00ad torney's failure to timely move to suppress evidence during trial could be grounds for federal habeas relief. The Court rejected the suggestion that the \"failure to make a timely request for the exclusion of illegally seized evidence\" could not be the basis for a Sixth Amendment violation because the evidence \"is 'typically reliable and often the most probative information bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defend\u00adant.' \" Id., at 379 (quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976)). \"The constitutional rights of criminal defend\u00ad ants,\" the Court observed, \"are granted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequently, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that it attaches only to matters af\u00adfecting the determination of actual guilt.\" 477 U. S., at 380. The same logic applies here. The fact that respondent is guilty does not mean he was not entitled by the Sixth Amendment to effective assistance or that he suffered no prejudice from his attorney's decient performance during plea bargaining. In the end, petitioner's three arguments amount to one general contention: A fair trial wipes clean any decient per\u00adformance by defense counsel during plea bargaining. That 170 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court position ignores the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas. See Frye , ante, at 143-144. As explained in Frye , the right to adequate assistance of counsel cannot be dened or enforced without taking account of the central role plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and determining sentences. Ibid. (\"[I]t is insufcient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process\"). C Even if a defendant shows ineffective assistance of counsel has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a trial and a more severe sentence, there is the question of what consti\u00adtutes an appropriate remedy. That question must now be addressed. Sixth Amendment remedies should be \"tailored to the in\u00ad jury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\" United States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981). Thus, a rem\u00ad edy must \"neutralize the taint\" of a constitutional violation, id., at 365, while at the same time not grant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander the considerable resources the State properly invested in the criminal prosecution, see Mechanik, 475 U. S., at 72 (\"The reversal of a conviction entails substantial social costs: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution, and the defendants to expend fur\u00adther time, energy, and other resources to repeat a trial that has already once taken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturbing experiences\"). The specic injury suffered by defendants who decline a plea offer as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel and then receive a greater sentence as a result of trial can come in at least one of two forms. In some cases, the sole advan\u00adtage a defendant would have received under the plea is a Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 171 Opinion of the Court lesser sentence. This is typically the case when the charges that would have been admitted as part of the plea bargain are the same as the charges the defendant was convicted of after trial. In this situation the court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has shown a reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors he would have accepted the plea. If the showing is made, the court may exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term of imprisonment the government offered in the plea, the sentence he received at trial, or something in between. In some situations it may be that resentencing alone will not be full redress for the constitutional injury. If, for ex\u00ad ample, an offer was for a guilty plea to a count or counts less serious than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial, or if a mandatory sentence connes a judge's sen\u00adtencing discretion after trial, a resentencing based on the conviction at trial may not sufce. See, e. g., Williams, 571 F. 3d, at 1088; Riggs v. Fairman, 399 F. 3d 1179, 1181 (CA9 2005). In these circumstances, the proper exercise of discre\u00adtion to remedy the constitutional injury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea proposal. Once this has occurred, the judge can then exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and accept the plea or leave the conviction undisturbed. In implementing a remedy in both of these situations, the trial court must weigh various factors; and the boundaries of proper discretion need not be dened here. Principles elaborated over time in decisions of state and federal courts, and in statutes and rules, will serve to give more complete guidance as to the factors that should bear upon the exercise of the judge's discretion. At this point, however, it sufces to note two considerations that are of relevance. First, a court may take account of a defendant's earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept responsi\u00adbility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary here 172 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to prescind (that is to say disregard) any information concern\u00ading the crime that was discovered after the plea offer was made. The time continuum makes it difcult to restore the defendant and the prosecution to the precise positions they occupied prior to the rejection of the plea offer, but that baseline can be consulted in nding a remedy that does not require the prosecution to incur the expense of conducting a new trial. Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy here will open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions. See Brief for Petitioner 20. Petitioner's concern is misplaced. Courts have recognized claims of this sort for over 30 years, see supra, at 164, and yet there is no indication that the system is overwhelmed by these types of suits or that defendants are receiving wind\u00adfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland claims. See also Padilla, 559 U. S., at 371 (\"We confronted a similar 'floodgates' concern in Hill,\" but a \"flood did not follow in that decision's wake\"). In addition, the \"prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims after a later, less advanta\u00adgeous plea offer has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction.\" Frye , ante, at 146. See also ante, at 146-147 (listing procedures currently used by various States). This, too, will help ensure against meritless claims. III The standards for ineffective assistance of counsel when a defendant rejects a plea offer and goes to trial must now be applied to this case. Respondent brings a federal collateral challenge to a state-court conviction. Under AEDPA, a fed\u00aderal court may not grant a petition for a writ of habeas cor\u00adpus unless the state court's adjudication on the merits was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Su\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 173 Opinion of the Court preme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A decision is contrary to clearly established law if the state court \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.\" Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S., at 405 (opinion for the Court by O'Connor, J.). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit could not determine whether the Michigan Court of Appeals addressed respond\u00adent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim or, if it did, \"what the court decided, or even whether the correct legal rule was identied.\" 376 Fed. Appx., at 568-569. The state court's decision may not be quite so opaque as the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit thought, yet the federal court was correct to note that AEDPA does not present a bar to granting respondent relief. That is because the Michigan Court of Appeals identified respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim but failed to apply Strickland to assess it. Rather than applying Strickland, the state court simply found that respondent's rejection of the plea was knowing and voluntary. 2005 WL 599740, *1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. An inquiry into whether the re\u00adjection of a plea is knowing and voluntary, however, is not the correct means by which to address a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Hill, 474 U. S., at 57 (applying Strickland to assess a claim of ineffective assistance of coun\u00ad sel arising out of the plea negotiation process). After stat\u00ading the incorrect standard, moreover, the state court then made an irrelevant observation about counsel's performance at trial and mischaracterized respondent's claim as a com\u00adplaint that his attorney did not obtain a more favorable plea bargain. By failing to apply Strickland to assess the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised, the state court's adjudication was contrary to clearly established federal law. And in that circumstance the federal courts in this habeas action can determine the principles necessary to grant relief. See Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 948 (2007). 174 LAFLER v. COOPER Opinion of the Court Respondent has satised Strickland's two-part test. Re\u00ad garding performance, perhaps it could be accepted that it is unclear whether respondent's counsel believed respondent could not be convicted for assault with intent to murder as a matter of law because the shots hit Mundy below the waist, or whether he simply thought this would be a persuasive argument to make to the jury to show lack of specic intent. And, as the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit suggested, an erroneous strategic prediction about the outcome of a trial is not necessarily decient performance. Here, however, the fact of decient performance has been conceded by all parties. The case comes to us on that assumption, so there is no need to address this question. As to prejudice, respondent has shown that but for coun\u00ad sel's decient performance there is a reasonable probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571-572. In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at trial, re\u00adspondent received a minimum sentence 3\u00bd times greater than he would have received under the plea. The standard for ineffective assistance under Strickland has thus been satised. As a remedy, the District Court ordered specic perform\u00ad ance of the original plea agreement. The correct remedy in these circumstances, however, is to order the State to reoffer the plea agreement. Presuming respondent accepts the offer, the state trial court can then exercise its discretion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and resen\u00adtence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions and resentence respondent ac\u00adcordingly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial undisturbed. See Mich. Ct. Rule 6.302(C)(3) (2011) (\"If there is a plea agreement and its terms provide for the de\u00ad fendant's plea to be made in exchange for a specic sentence disposition or a prosecutorial sentence recommendation, the court may . . . reject the agreement\"). Today's decision Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 175 Scalia, J., dissenting leaves open to the trial court how best to exercise that dis\u00ad cretion in all the circumstances of the case. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, and with whom The Chief Justice joins as to all but Part IV , dissenting . \"If a plea bargain has been offered, a defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel in considering whether to accept it. If that right is denied, prejudice can be shown if loss of the plea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on more serious charges or the imposition of a more severe sentence.\" Ante , at 168. \"The inquiry then becomes how to dene the duty and responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process. This is a difcult question. . . . Bargaining is, by its nature, dened to a substantial degree by personal style . . . . This case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to dene the duties of defense counsel in those respects . . . .\" Missouri v. Frye , ante, at 144-145. With those words from this and the companion case, the Court today opens a whole new eld of constitutionalized criminal procedure: plea-bargaining law. The ordinary criminal process has become too long, too expensive, and un\u00adpredictable, in no small part as a consequence of an intricate federal Code of Criminal Procedure imposed on the States by this Court in pursuit of perfect justice. See Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929 (1965). The Court now moves to bring perfec\u00ad tion to the alternative in which prosecutors and defendants have sought relief. Today's opinions deal with only two aspects of counsel's plea-bargaining inadequacy, and leave 176 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting other aspects (who knows what they might be?) to be worked out in further constitutional litigation that will burden the criminal process. And it would be foolish to think that \"con\u00adstitutional\" rules governing counsel's behavior will not be followed by rules governing the prosecution's behavior in the plea-bargaining process that the Court today announces \" 'is the criminal justice system,' \" Frye , ante, at 144 (quoting approvingly from Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Con\u00adtract, 101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992) (hereinafter Scott)). Is it constitutional, for example, for the prosecution to with\u00addraw a plea offer that has already been accepted? Or to withdraw an offer before the defense has had adequate time to consider and accept it? Or to make no plea offer at all, even though its case is weak\u2014thereby excluding the defend\u00adant from \"the criminal justice system\"? Anthony Cooper received a full and fair trial, was found guilty of all charges by a unanimous jury, and was given the sentence that the law prescribed. The Court nonetheless concludes that Cooper is entitled to some sort of habeas cor\u00adpus relief (perhaps) because his attorney's allegedly incompe\u00adtent advice regarding a plea offer caused him to receive a full and fair trial. That conclusion is foreclosed by our prec\u00adedents. Even if it were not foreclosed, the constitutional right to effective plea bargainers that it establishes is at least a new rule of law, which does not undermine the Michi\u00adgan Court of Appeals' decision and therefore cannot serve as the basis for habeas relief. And the remedy the Court announces\u2014namely, whatever the state trial court in its discretion prescribes, down to and including no remedy at all\u2014is unheard of and quite absurd for violation of a constitu\u00ad tional right. I respectfully dissent. I This case and its companion, Missouri v. Frye , ante , p. 134, raise relatively straightforward questions about the scope of the right to effective assistance of counsel. Our case law Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 177 Scalia, J., dissenting originally derived that right from the Due Process Clause, and its guarantee of a fair trial, see United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006), but the seminal case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), lo\u00ad cated the right within the Sixth Amendment. As the Court notes, ante, at 164-165, the right to counsel does not begin at trial. It extends to \"any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial.\" United States v. Wade , 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). Applying that principle, we held that the \"entry of a guilty plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks as a 'critical stage' at which the right to counsel adheres.\" Iowa v. Tovar , 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); see also Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985). And it follows from this that acceptance of a plea offer is a critical stage. That, and nothing more, is the point of the Court's observation in Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, 373 (2010), that \"the negotiation of a plea bar\u00adgain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\" The defendant in Padilla had accepted the plea bargain and pleaded guilty, abandoning his right to a fair trial; he was entitled to advice of competent counsel before he did so. The Court has never held that the rule articulated in Padi\u00ad lla, Tovar , and Hill extends to all aspects of plea negotia\u00ad tions, requiring not just advice of competent counsel before the defendant accepts a plea bargain and pleads guilty, but also the advice of competent counsel before the defendant rejects a plea bargain and stands on his constitutional right to a fair trial. The latter is a vast departure from our past cases, protecting not just the constitutionally prescribed right to a fair adjudication of guilt and punishment, but a judicially invented right to effective plea bargaining. It is also apparent from Strickland that bad plea bargain\u00ad ing has nothing to do with ineffective assistance of counsel in the constitutional sense. Strickland explained that \"[i]n 178 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting giving meaning to the requirement [of effective assistance], . . . we must take its purpose\u2014to ensure a fair trial\u2014as the guide.\" 466 U. S., at 686. Since \"the right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial,\" United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984), the \"benchmark\" inquiry in evaluating any claim of ineffective assistance is whether counsel's performance \"so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial proc\u00adess\" that it failed to produce a reliably \"just result.\" Strick\u00ad land, 466 U. S., at 686. That is what Strickland's require\u00ad ment of \"prejudice\" consists of: Because the right to effective assistance has as its purpose the assurance of a fair trial, the right is not infringed unless counsel's mistakes call into question the basic justice of a defendant's conviction or sentence. That has been, until today, entirely clear. A de\u00adfendant must show \"that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\" Id., at 687. See also Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 147. Impairment of fair trial is how we distinguish between unfortunate attorney error and error of constitu\u00adtional signicance. 1 1 Rather than addressing the constitutional origins of the right to effec\u00ad tive counsel, the Court responds to the broader claim (raised by no one) that \"the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the right to a fair trial.\" Ante, at 164 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10-12 (arguing that the \"purpose of the Sixth Amend\u00ad ment right to counsel is to secure a fair trial\" (emphasis added)); Brief for Petitioner 12-21 (same). To destroy that straw man, the Court cites cases in which violations of rights other than the right to effective counsel\u2014 and, perplexingly, even rights found outside the Sixth Amendment and the Constitution entirely\u2014were not cured by a subsequent trial. Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U. S. 254 (1986) (violation of equal protection in grand jury selection); Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187 (1946) (violation of statu\u00ad tory scheme providing that women serve on juries); Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960) (violation of Fifth Amendment right to indict\u00adment by grand jury). Unlike the right to effective counsel, no showing of prejudice is required to make violations of the rights at issue in Vasquez, Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 179 Scalia, J., dissenting To be sure, Strickland stated a rule of thumb for meas\u00ad uring prejudice which, applied blindly and out of context, could support the Court's holding today: \"The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" 466 U. S., at 694. Strickland itself cautioned, however, that its test was not to be applied in a mechanical fashion, and that courts were not to divert their \"ultimate focus\" from \"the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.\" Id., at 696. And until today we have followed that course. In Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), the decient performance at issue was the failure of counsel for a defend\u00adant who had been sentenced to death to make an objection that would have produced a sentence of life imprisonment instead. The objection was fully supported by then-extant Circuit law, so that the sentencing court would have been compelled to sustain it, producing a life sentence that princi\u00adples of double jeopardy would likely make nal. See id., at 383-385 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981). By the time Fretwell's claim came before us, however, the Circuit law had been overruled in light of one of our cases. We determined that a prejudice analysis \"focusing solely on mere outcome determination, without at\u00adtention to whether the result of the proceeding was funda\u00admentally unfair or unreliable,\" would be defective. Fret- well, 506 U. S., at 369. Because counsel's error did not Ballard, and Stirone complete. See Vasquez, supra, at 263-264 (\"[D]is\u00ad crimination in the grand jury undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself, and is not amenable to harmless-error review\"); Ballard, supra, at 195 (\"[R]eversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an individual case\"); Stirone , supra, at 217 (\"Deprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance and then dismissed as harmless error\"). Those cases are thus irrelevant to the question presented here, which is whether a defendant can establish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), while conceding the fairness of his conviction, sentence, and appeal. 180 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting \"deprive the defendant of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him,\" the defendant's sentenc\u00ading proceeding was fair and its result was reliable, even though counsel's error may have affected its outcome. Id., at 372. In Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S. 362, 391-393 (2000), we explained that even though Fretwell did not mechanically apply an outcome-based test for prejudice, its reasoning was perfectly consistent with Strickland. \"Fretwell's counsel had not deprived him of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitled him.\" 529 U. S., at 392. 2 Those precedents leave no doubt about the answer to the question presented here. As the Court itself observes, a criminal defendant has no right to a plea bargain. Ante, at 168. \"[T]here is no constitutional right to plea bargain; the prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial.\" Weatherford v. Bursey , 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). Counsel's mistakes in this case thus did not \"deprive the defendant of 2 Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), cited by the Court, ante, at 169, does not contradict this principle. That case, which predated Fret- well and Williams, considered whether our holding that Fourth Amend\u00ad ment claims fully litigated in state court cannot be raised in federal habeas \"should be extended to Sixth Amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the principal allegation and manifestation of inadequate representation is counsel's failure to le a timely motion to suppress evi\u00addence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\" 477 U. S., at 368. Our negative answer to that question had nothing to do with the issue here. The parties in Kimmelman had not raised the ques\u00ad tion \"whether the admission of illegally seized but reliable evidence can ever constitute 'prejudice' under Strickland\"\u2014a question similar to the one presented here\u2014and the Court therefore did not address it. Id., at 391 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); see also id., at 380. Kimmelman made clear, however, how the answer to that question is to be determined: \"The essence of an ineffective-assistance claim is that counsel's unprofes\u00adsional errors so upset the adversarial balance between defense and prose\u00adcution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered sus\u00ad pect, \" id., at 374 (emphasis added). \"Only those habeas petitioners who can prove under Strickland that they have been denied a fair trial . . . will be granted the writ,\" id., at 382 (emphasis added). In short, Kimmel\u00ad man's only relevance is to prove the Court's opinion wrong. Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 181 Scalia, J., dissenting a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him,\" Williams, supra, at 393. Far from being \"beside the point,\" ante, at 168, that is critical to correct application of our precedents. Like Fretwell, this case \"concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry,\" 506 U. S., at 373 (O'Connor, J., concurring); he claims \"that he might have been denied 'a right the law simply does not recognize,' \" id., at 375 (same). Strickland, Fretwell, and Williams all instruct that the pure outcome-based test on which the Court relies is an erroneous measure of cognizable prejudice. In ignoring Strickland's \"ultimate focus . . . on the fundamental fairness of the pro\u00adceeding whose result is being challenged,\" 466 U. S., at 696, the Court has lost the forest for the trees, leading it to accept what we have previously rejected, the \"novel argument that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the defendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty,\" Weatherford, supra, at 561. II Novelty alone is the second, independent reason why the Court's decision is wrong. This case arises on federal ha\u00adbeas, and hence is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effec\u00adtive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Since, as the Court acknowledges, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudi\u00adcated Cooper's ineffective-assistance claim on the merits, AEDPA bars federal courts from granting habeas relief un\u00adless that court's decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Yet the Court concludes that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not bar relief here, because \"[b]y failing to apply Strickland to assess the ineffective-assistance-of\u00ad counsel claim respondent raised, the state court's adjudica\u00adtion was contrary to clearly established federal law.\" Ante, at 173. That is not so. 182 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting The relevant portion of the Michigan Court of Appeals de\u00ad cision reads as follows: \"To establish ineffective assistance, the defendant must demonstrate that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel's representation so prejudiced the defendant that he was deprived of a fair trial. With respect to the prejudice aspect of the test, the defendant must demon\u00adstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different, and that the attendant proceedings were fun\u00addamentally unfair and unreliable. \"Defendant challenges the trial court's nding after a Ginther hearing that defense counsel provided effective assistance to defendant during the plea bargaining proc\u00adess. He contends that defense counsel failed to convey the benets of the plea offer to him and ignored his de\u00adsire to plead guilty, and that these failures led him to reject a plea offer that he now wishes to accept. How\u00adever, the record shows that defendant knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial. The record fails to support defendant's conten\u00adtions that defense counsel's representation was ineffec\u00adtive because he rejected a defense based on [a] claim of self-defense and because he did not obtain a more favor\u00adable plea bargain for defendant.\" People v. Cooper , No. 250583 (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, 2005 WL 599740, *1 (per curiam) (footnote and cita\u00ad tions omitted). The rst paragraph above, far from ignoring Strickland, recites its standard with a good deal more accuracy than the Court's opinion. The second paragraph, which is presum\u00adably an application of the standard recited in the rst, says that \"defendant knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial.\" This can be regarded Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 183 Scalia, J., dissenting as a denial that there was anything \"fundamentally unfair\" about Cooper's conviction and sentence, so that no Strick\u00ad land prejudice had been shown. On the other hand, the en\u00ad tire second paragraph can be regarded as a contention that Cooper's claims of inadequate representation were unsup\u00adported by the record. The state court's analysis was admit\u00adtedly not a model of clarity, but federal habeas corpus is a \"guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,\" not a license to penalize a state court for its opinion-writing technique. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U. S. 86, 102 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court's readiness to nd error in the Michigan court's opin\u00adion is \"inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law,\" Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam), a presumption borne out here by the state court's recitation of the correct legal standard. Since it is ambiguous whether the state court's holding was based on a lack of prejudice or rather the court's factual determination that there had been no decient performance, to provide relief under AEDPA this Court must conclude that both holdings would have been unreasonable applica\u00ad tions of clearly established law. See Premo v. Moore , 562 U. S. 115, 121 (2011). The rst is impossible of doing, since this Court has never held that a defendant in Cooper's posi\u00adtion can establish Strickland prejudice. The Sixth Circuit thus violated AEDPA in granting habeas relief, and the Court now does the same. III It is impossible to conclude discussion of today's extraordi\u00ad nary opinion without commenting upon the remedy it pro\u00advides for the unconstitutional conviction. It is a remedy unheard of in American jurisprudence\u2014and, I would be will\u00ading to bet, in the jurisprudence of any other country. The Court requires Michigan to \"reoffer the plea agree\u00ad ment\" that was rejected because of bad advice from counsel. Ante, at 174. That would indeed be a powerful remedy\u2014 184 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting but for the fact that Cooper's acceptance of that reoffered agreement is not conclusive. Astoundingly, \"the state trial court can then exercise its discretion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and resentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions and resentence respondent accordingly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial undisturbed. \" Ibid. (emphasis added). Why, one might ask, require a \"reoffer\" of the plea agree\u00ad ment, and its acceptance by the defendant? If the District Court nds (as a necessary element, supposedly, of Strick\u00ad land prejudice) that Cooper would have accepted the origi\u00ad nal offer, and would thereby have avoided trial and convic\u00ad tion, why not skip the reoffer-and-reacceptance minuet and simply leave it to the discretion of the state trial court what the remedy shall be? The answer, of course, is camouflage. Trial courts, after all, regularly accept or reject plea agree\u00ad ments, so there seems to be nothing extraordinary about their accepting or rejecting the new one mandated by today's decision. But the acceptance or rejection of a plea agree\u00adment that has no status whatever under the United States Constitution is worlds apart from what this is: \"discretion\u00adary\" specication of a remedy for an unconstitutional crimi\u00adnal conviction. To be sure, the Court asserts that there are \"factors\" which bear upon (and presumably limit) exercise of this discretion\u2014factors that it is not prepared to specify in full, much less assign some determinative weight. \"Principles elaborated over time in decisions of state and federal courts, and in statutes and rules\" will (in the Court's rosy view) sort all that out. Ante, at 171. I nd it extraordinary that \"statutes and rules\" can specify the remedy for a criminal defendant's unconstitutional conviction. Or that the remedy for an unconstitutional conviction should ever be subject at all to a trial judge's discretion. Or, nally, that the remedy could ever include no remedy at all. Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 185 Scalia, J., dissenting I suspect that the Court's squeamishness in fashioning a remedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is attributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no real constitutional violation here anyway. The defendant has been fairly tried, lawfully convicted, and properly sen\u00adtenced, and any \"remedy\" provided for this will do nothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial process. IV In many\u2014perhaps most\u2014countries of the world, American-style plea bargaining is forbidden in cases as seri\u00adous as this one, even for the purpose of obtaining testimony that enables conviction of a greater malefactor, much less for the purpose of sparing the expense of trial. See, e. g., World Plea Bargaining 344, 363-366 (S. Thaman ed. 2010). In Europe, many countries adhere to what they aptly call the \"legality principle\" by requiring prosecutors to charge all prosecutable offenses, which is typically incompatible with the practice of charge bargaining. See, e. g., id., at xxii; Langbein, Land Without Plea Bargaining: How the Germans Do It, 78 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 210-211 (1979) (describing the \"Legalit\u00e4tsprinzip,\" or rule of compulsory prosecution, in Germany). Such a system reflects an admirable belief that the law is the law, and those who break it should pay the penalty provided. In the United States, we have plea bargaining aplenty, but until today it has been regarded as a necessary evil. It presents grave risks of prosecutorial overcharging that ef\u00adfectively compels an innocent defendant to avoid massive risk by pleading guilty to a lesser offense; and for guilty defendants it often\u2014perhaps usually\u2014results in a sentence well below what the law prescribes for the actual crime. But even so, we accept plea bargaining because many believe that without it our long and expensive process of criminal trial could not sustain the burden imposed on it, and our system of criminal justice would grind to a halt. See, e. g., 186 LAFLER v. COOPER Scalia, J., dissenting Alschuler, Plea Bargaining and Its History, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 38 (1979). Today, however, the Supreme Court of the United States elevates plea bargaining from a necessary evil to a constitu\u00adtional entitlement. It is no longer a somewhat embarrassing adjunct to our criminal justice system; rather, as the Court announces in the companion case to this one, \" 'it is the crimi\u00ad nal justice system.' \" Frye , ante, at 144 (quoting approv\u00ad ingly from Scott 1912). Thus, even though there is no doubt that the respondent here is guilty of the offense with which he was charged; even though he has received the exorbitant gold standard of American justice\u2014a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable constitutional and statutory limitations upon the evidence that the prosecution can bring forward, and (in Michigan as in most States 3) the requirement of a unanimous guilty verdict by impartial jurors; the Court says that his conviction is invalid because he was deprived of his constitutional entitlement to plea bargain. I am less saddened by the outcome of this case than I am by what it says about this Court's attitude toward criminal justice. The Court today embraces the sporting-chance the\u00adory of criminal law, in which the State functions like a consci\u00adentious casino operator, giving each player a fair chance to beat the house, that is, to serve less time than the law says he deserves. And when a player is excluded from the ta\u00adbles, his constitutional rights have been violated. I do not subscribe to that theory. No one should, least of all the Jus\u00adtices of the Supreme Court. * * * Today's decision upends decades of our cases, violates a federal statute, and opens a whole new boutique of constitu\u00adtional jurisprudence (\"plea-bargaining law\") without even 3 See People v. Cooks, 446 Mich. 503, 510, 521 N. W. 2d 275, 278 (1994); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 22.1(e) (3d ed. 2007 and Supp. 2011-2012). Cite as: 566 U. S. 156 (2012) 187 Alito, J., dissenting specifying the remedies the boutique offers. The result in the present case is the undoing of an adjudicatory process that worked exactly as it is supposed to. Released felon Anthony Cooper, who shot repeatedly and gravely injured a woman named Kali Mundy, was tried and convicted for his crimes by a jury of his peers, and given a punishment that Michigan's elected representatives have deemed appropriate. Nothing about that result is unfair or unconstitutional. To the contrary, it is wonderfully just, and innitely superior to the trial-by-bargain that today's opinion affords constitu\u00adtional status. I respectfully dissent. Justice Alito , dissenting. For the reasons set out in Parts I and II of Justice Scalia' s dissent, the Court's holding in this case misapplies our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel case law and violates the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Respondent received a trial that was free of any identied constitutional error, and, as a result, there is no basis for concluding that respondent suffered prejudice and certainly not for granting habeas relief. The weakness in the Court's analysis is highlighted by its opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate when a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal representation. If a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated when decient legal advice about a favorable plea offer causes the opportunity for that bargain to be lost, the only logical rem\u00adedy is to give the defendant the benet of the favorable deal. But such a remedy would cause serious injustice in many instances, as I believe the Court tacitly recognizes. The Court therefore eschews the only logical remedy and relies on the lower courts to exercise sound discretion in determin\u00ading what is to be done. Time will tell how this works out. The Court, for its part, nds it unnecessary to dene \"the boundaries of proper dis\u00adcretion\" in today's opinion. Ante, at 171. In my view, re\u00ad188 LAFLER v. COOPER Alito, J., dissenting quiring the prosecution to renew an old plea offer would rep\u00ad resent an abuse of discretion in at least two circumstances: rst, when important new information about a defendant's culpability comes to light after the offer is rejected, and, sec\u00adond, when the rejection of the plea offer results in a substan\u00adtial expenditure of scarce prosecutorial or judicial resources. The lower court judges who must implement today's hold\u00ad ing may\u2014and I hope, will\u2014do so in a way that mitigates its potential to produce unjust results. But I would not depend on these judges to come to the rescue. The Court's inter\u00adpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is un\u00adsound, and I therefore respectfully dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 189 Syllabus ZIVOTOFSKY, by his parents and guardians, ZIVOTOFSKY et ux. v. CLINTON, SECRETARY OF STATE certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit No. 10-699. Argued November 7, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012 Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem. His mother requested that Zivotofsky's place of birth be listed as \"Israel\" on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to \u00a7 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003. That provision states: \"For purposes of the registration of birth, certi\u00adcation of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen's legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\" U. S. ofcials refused the request, citing a State Department policy that prohibits recording \"Israel\" as the place of birth for those born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky's parents led a suit on his behalf against the Secretary of State. The District Court dismissed the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question regarding Jerusalem's political status. The D. C. Circuit afrmed, reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that power cannot be reviewed by the courts. Held: The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zivo\u00ad tofsky's claim. Pp. 194-202. (a) This Court has said that a controversy \"involves a political question . . . where there is 'a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.' \" Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228. The lower courts ruled that this case presents such a political question because they misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky's claim would require the Judiciary to dene U. S. policy regarding the status of Jerusalem. In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under \u00a7 214(d) to choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport. Making such determina\u00adtions is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of \u00a7 214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional. There is no \"textually demonstrable constitutional commitment\" of that question to another 190 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Syllabus branch: At least since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is \"emphatically the province and duty\" of the Judiciary to determine the constitutionality of a statute. Nor is there \"a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolv\u00ading\" the question: Both parties offer detailed legal arguments concern\u00ading whether the textual, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that \u00a7 214(d) is constitutional. Pp. 194-201. (b) Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case pre\u00ad sents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivotofsky's claim. This Court is \"a court of nal review and not rst view,\" Ada- rand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110, and ordinarily \"do[es] not decide in the rst instance issues not decided below,\" Na\u00ad tional Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 191 Opinion of the Court Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. Congress enacted a statute providing that Americans born in Jerusalem may elect to have \"Israel\" listed as the place of birth on their passports. The State Department declined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of not taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem. When sued by an American who invoked the statute, the Secretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority to decide the case because it presented a political question. The Court of Ap\u00ad peals so held. We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determining whether this statute may be given effect, or instead must be struck down in light of authority conferred on the Executive by the Constitution. I A In 2002, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Authori\u00ad zation Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. Section 214 of the Act is entitled \"United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.\" Id., at 1365. The rst two subsections express Congress's \"commitment\" to relo\u00adcating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Id., at 1365-1366. The third bars funding for the publication of ofcial Government documents that do not list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Id., at 1366. The fourth and nal provision, \u00a7 214(d), is the only one at stake in this case. Entitled \"Record of Place of Birth as Israel for Passport Pur\u00adposes,\" it provides that \"[f]or purposes of the registration of birth, certication of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secre\u00adtary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen's legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\" Ibid. The State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual states that \"[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located in ter\u00ad192 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of the Court ritory disputed by another country, the city or area of birth may be written in the passport.\" 7 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7 1383.5-2, App. 108. The manual specically directs that passport ofcials should enter \"JERUSALEM\" and should \"not write Israel or Jordan\" when recording the birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a passport. Id., \u00a7 1383, Exh. App. 106, 108-110. Section 214(d) sought to override this instruction by allow\u00ad ing citizens born in Jerusalem to have \"Israel\" recorded on their passports if they wish. In signing the Foreign Rela\u00adtions Authorization Act into law, President George W. Bush stated his belief that \u00a7 214 \"impermissibly interferes with the President's constitutional authority to conduct the Na\u00adtion's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch.\" Statement on Signing the Foreign Relations Au\u00adthorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, Public Papers of the Presi\u00addents, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Sept. 30, 2002, p. 1698 (2005). He added that if the section is \"construed as mandatory,\" then it would \"interfere with the President's constitutional authority to formulate the position of the United States, speak for the Nation in international affairs, and determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states.\" Ibid. He concluded by emphasizing that \"U. S. policy re\u00ad garding Jerusalem has not changed.\" Ibid. The President made no specic reference to the mandate in \u00a7 214(d). Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born on 17, 2002, shortly after \u00a7 214(d) was enacted. Zivotofsky's parents were American citizens and he accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional enact\u00adment. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American citizens ac\u00adquire citizenship at birth through \"congressional gener\u00adosity\").

S. ofcials informed Zivotof\u00adsky's mother that State Department policy prohibits record\u00ading \"Israel\" as Zivotofsky's place of birth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a passport and consular report of birth abroad listing only \"Jerusalem.\" App. 19-20. Zivotofsky's parents led a complaint on his behalf against the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering the Secre\u00adtary to identify his place of birth as \"Jerusalem, Israel,\" in the ofcial documents. Id., at 17-18. The District Court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing and that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political question. The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit reversed, con\u00ad cluding that Zivotofsky did have standing. It then observed that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that \"Jerusalem, Israel,\" be recorded on his passport, \"[b]oth sides agree that the question now is whether \u00a7 214(d) entitles [him] to have just 'Israel' listed as his place of birth.\" 444 F. 3d 614, 619 (2006). The D. C. Circuit determined that additional fac\u00adtual development might be helpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable, as the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implications of listing \"Israel\" alone as a birth\u00adplace on the passport. Id., at 619-620. It therefore re\u00ad manded the case to the District Court. The District Court again found that the case was not jus\u00ad ticiable. It explained that \"[r]esolving [Zivotofsky's] claim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to decide the political status of Jerusalem.\" 511 F. Supp. 2d 97, 103 (2007). Concluding that the claim therefore presented a po\u00adlitical question, the District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The D. C. Circuit afrmed. It reasoned that the Consti\u00ad tution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recog\u00ad194 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of the Court nize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power cannot be reviewed by the courts. Therefore, \"deciding whether the Secretary of State must mark a passport . . . as Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court] into an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to the Ex\u00adecutive alone.\" 571 F. 3d 1227, 1232-1233 (2009). The D. C. Circuit held that the political question doctrine prohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any suggestion that Congress's decision to take \"a position on the status of Jerusalem\" could change the analysis. Id., at 1233. Judge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote sep\u00ad arately to express his view that the political question doc\u00adtrine has no application to this case. He explained that the issue before the court was whether \u00a7 214(d) \"impermissibly intrude[s] on the President's exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns.\" Id., at 1234. That question, he ob\u00ad served, involves \"commonplace issues of statutory and con\u00adstitutional interpretation\" plainly within the constitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at 1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined that designating Is\u00adrael as a place of birth on a passport is a policy \"in further\u00adance of the recognition power.\" Id., at 1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that power exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found \u00a7 214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded that Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and concurred in afrming the dismissal of the complaint. Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted re\u00ad view. 563 U. S. 973 (2011). II The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky's claim pre\u00ad sents a political question and therefore cannot be adjudi\u00adcated. We disagree. In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it, even those it \"would gladly avoid.\" Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 195 Opinion of the Court Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Our prece\u00ad dents have identied a narrow exception to that rule, known as the \"political question\" doctrine. See, e. g., Japan Whal\u00ad ing Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy \"involves a political question . . . where there is 'a textually demonstra\u00adble constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.' \" Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting Baker v. Carr , 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case, we have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the dispute before it. The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political question because deciding Zivotofsky's claim would force the Judicial Branch to interfere with the President's exercise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The District Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to \"decide the political status of Jerusalem.\" 511 F. Supp. 2d, at 103. This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivotofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to determine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under \u00a7 214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport as his place of birth. For its part, the D. C. Circuit treated the two questions as one and the same. That court concluded that \"[o]nly the Executive\u2014not Congress and not the courts\u2014has the power to dene U. S. policy regarding Israel's sovereignty over Je\u00adrusalem,\" and also to \"decide how best to implement that policy.\" 571 F. 3d, at 1232. Because the Department's passport rule was adopted to implement the President's \"ex\u00adclusive and unreviewable constitutional power to keep the United States out of the debate over the status of Jerusa\u00adlem,\" the validity of that rule was itself a \"nonjusticiable political question\" that \"the Constitution leaves to the Exec\u00adutive alone.\" Id., at 1231-1233. Indeed, the D. C. Circuit's opinion does not even mention \u00a7 214(d) until the fth of 196 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of the Court its six paragraphs of analysis, and then only to dismiss it as irrelevant: \"That Congress took a position on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a statutory cause of action . . . is of no moment to whether the judiciary has [the] author\u00adity to resolve this dispute . . . .\" Id., at 1233. The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly relevant to the Judiciary's power to decide Zivotofsky's claim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant a foreign policy decision of the political branches with the courts' own unmoored determination of what United States policy to\u00adward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specic statutory right. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if Zivotofsky's interpre\u00adtation of the statute is correct, and whether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpre\u00ad tation of \u00a7 214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional. At least since Mar- bury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, \"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" Id., at 177. That duty will sometimes involve the \"[r]esolution of litiga\u00adtion challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches,\" but courts cannot avoid their responsibil\u00adity merely \"because the issues have political implications.\" INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 943 (1983). In this case, determining the constitutionality of \u00a7 214(d) involves deciding whether the statute impermissibly in\u00adtrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution. If so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky's case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the other hand, the statute does not trench on the President's powers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivotofsky a passport that complies with \u00a7 214(d). Either way, the politi\u00adcal question doctrine is not implicated. \"No policy underly\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 197 Opinion of the Court ing the political question doctrine suggests that Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitutionality of a stat\u00adute; that is a decision for the courts.\" Id., at 941-942. The Secretary contends that \"there is 'a textually demon\u00ad strable constitutional commitment' \" to the President of the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as a corol\u00adlary, to determine whether an American born in Jerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of birth on his passport. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting Baker , supra, at 217); see Brief for Respondent 49-50. Perhaps. But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment to the Executive of the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately exercises that authority, including in a case such as this, where the question is whether Congress or the Executive is \"aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.\" Freytag v. Com\u00ad missioner , 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); see, e. g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176 (1926) (nding a statute un\u00adconstitutional because it encroached upon the President's power); Bowsher Synar , 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (nding a statute unconstitutional because it \"intruded into the executive function\"); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988) (upholding a statute's constitutionality against a charge that it \"impermissibly interfere[d] with the Presi\u00addent's exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions\"). Our precedents have also found the political question doc\u00ad trine implicated when there is \" 'a lack of judicially discover\u00adable and manageable standards for resolving' \" the question before the court. Nixon, 506 U. S., at 228 (quoting Baker , 369 U. S., at 217). Framing the issue as the lower courts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide the politi\u00adcal status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those concerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is recognized to be the more focused one of the constitutionality of \u00a7 214(d). In\u00addeed, both sides offer detailed legal arguments regarding whether \u00a7 214(d) is constitutional in light of powers com\u00ad198 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of the Court mitted to the Executive, and whether Congress's own powers with respect to passports must be weighed in analyzing this question. For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her argument on the political question issue, claiming that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to formulate recognition policy. She roots her claim in the Constitution's declaration that the President shall \"receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.\" U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 3. According to the Secretary, \"[c]enturies-long Executive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence, and decisions by this Court\" conrm that the \"receive Ambassa\u00addors\" clause confers upon the Executive the exclusive power of recognition. Brief for Respondent 18. The Secretary observes that \"President Washington and his cabinet unanimously decided that the President could re\u00adceive the ambassador from the new government of France without rst consulting Congress.\" Id., at 19 (citing Letter from George Washington to the Cabinet (Apr. 18, 1793), re\u00adprinted in 25 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 568-569 (J. Catan\u00adzariti ed. 1992); Thomas Jefferson, Notes on Washington's Questions on Neutrality and the Alliance with France (May 6, 1793), reprinted in id., at 665-666). She notes, too, that early attempts by the Legislature to affect recognition policy were regularly \"rejected in Congress as inappropriate incursions into the Executive Branch's constitutional author\u00adity.\" Brief for Respondent 21. And she cites precedents from this Court stating that \"[p]olitical recognition is exclu\u00adsively a function of the Executive.\" Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino , 376 U. S. 398, 410 (1964); see Brief for Respondent 24-27 (citing, e. g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203 (1942)). The Secretary further contends that \u00a7 214(d) constitutes an impermissible exercise of the recognition power because \"the decision as to how to describe the place of birth . . . Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 199 Opinion of the Court operates as an ofcial statement of whether the United States recognizes a state's sovereignty over a territorial area.\" Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not \"list[ ] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over the relevant territory the United States does not recog\u00adnize.\" Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, \"listing 'Israel' as the place of birth would constitute an ofcial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city lo\u00adcated within Israel.\" Id., at 38-39 (some internal quotation marks omitted). For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an exercise of the recognition power, \u00a7 214(d) is instead a \"legiti\u00ad mate and permissible\" exercise of Congress's \"authority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.\" Brief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor Louis Hen\u00adkin's observation that \" 'in the competition for power in for\u00adeign relations,' Congress has an 'impressive array of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitution.' \" Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivotofsky suggests that Congress's authority to enact \u00a7 214(d) derives specically from its powers over naturalization, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., \u00a7 8, cl. 3. According to Zivo\u00ad tofsky, Congress has used these powers to pass laws regulat\u00ading the content and issuance of passports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing Act of Aug. 18, 1856, \u00a7 23, 11 Stat. 60). Zivotofsky contends that \u00a7 214(d) ts squarely within this tradition. He notes that the State Department's designated representative stated in her deposition for this litigation that the \"place of birth\" entry is included only as \"an element of identication.\" App. 76 (Deposition of Catherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Overseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10. Moreover, Zivotofsky argues, the \"place of birth\" entry cannot be taken as a means 200 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of the Court for recognizing foreign sovereigns, because the State De\u00ad partment authorizes recording unrecognized territories\u2014 such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank\u2014as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43 (citing 7 Foreign Affairs Man\u00adual \u00a7 1383.5-5, App. 109-110). Further, \u00a7 214(d) does im\u00ad plicate the recognition power, that is not a power the Con\u00adstitution commits exclusively to the Executive. Zivotofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority granted to the President in the \"receive Ambassadors\" clause. He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexan\u00ad der Hamilton described the power conferred by this clause as \"more a matter of dignity than of authority,\" and called it \"a circumstance, which will be without consequence in the administration of the government.\" The Federalist No. 69, p. 468 (J. Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37. Zivo\u00ad tofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such as Congress's power to declare war, that suggest some con\u00adgressional role in recognition. Reply Brief for Petitioner 23 (citing U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 11). He cites, for example, an 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, ac\u00adknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to recognize because it is a power \"no where expressly dele\u00adgated\" in the Constitution, and one that is \"necessarily in\u00advolved in some of the great powers given to Congress.\" Message from the President of the United States Upon the Subject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of Texas, H. R. Doc. No. 35, 24th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; see Reply Brief for argues that language from this Court's prece\u00ad dents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively to the President is inapplicable to his claim, because that language appeared in cases where the Court was asked to alter recognition policy developed by the Executive in the absence of congressional opposition. See Brief for Peti\u00adtioner 44-46; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-19. Finally, Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 201 Opinion of the Court Zivotofsky contends that even if the \"receive Ambassadors\" clause confers some exclusive recognition power on the Pres\u00adident, simply allowing a choice as to the \"place of birth\" entry on a passport does not signicantly intrude on that power. Recitation of these arguments\u2014which sound in familiar principles of constitutional interpretation\u2014is enough to es\u00adtablish that this case does not \"turn on standards that defy judicial application.\" Baker , 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of Zivotofsky's claim demands careful examination of the tex\u00adtual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the parties regarding the nature of the statute and of the pass\u00adport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The political question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of this case. III To say that Zivotofsky's claim presents issues the Judi\u00ad ciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a decision in this case is simple. Because the District Court and the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by the political question doctrine, we are without the benet of thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of the merits. Ours is \"a court of nal review and not rst view.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110 (2001) (per curiam ) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad ted). Ordinarily, \"we do not decide in the rst instance issues not decided below.\" National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In particular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we typically re\u00admand for resolution of any claims the lower courts' error pre\u00advented them from addressing. See, e. g., Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. 211, 214 (2011) (reversing the Court of Ap\u00adpeals' determination on standing and remanding because the \"merits of petitioner's challenge to the statute's validity are to be considered, in the rst instance, by the Court of Ap\u00adpeals\"). We see no reason to depart from this approach in 202 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of Sotomayor, J. this case. Having determined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the lower courts to consider the merits in the rst instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Breyer joins as to Part I, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. As this case illustrates, the proper application of Baker 's six factors has generated substantial confusion in the lower courts. I concur in the Court's conclusion that this case does not present a political question. I write separately, however, because I understand the inquiry required by the political question doctrine to be more demanding than that suggested by the Court. I The political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of circumstances in which courts properly examine whether a particular suit is justiciable\u2014that is, whether the dispute is appropriate for resolution by courts. The doctrine is \"essentially a function of the separation of powers,\" Baker v. Carr , 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), which recognizes the limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords appropriate respect to the other branches' exercise of their own constitu\u00adtional powers. In Baker , this Court identied six circumstances in which an issue might present a political question: (1) \"a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department\"; (2) \"a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it\"; (3) \"the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion\"; (4) \"the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 203 Opinion of Sotomayor, J. resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordi\u00ad nate branches of government\"; (5) \"an unusual need for un\u00adquestioning adherence to a political decision already made\"; or (6) \"the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\" Ibid. Baker established that \"[u]nless one of these formula\u00ad tions is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability.\" Ibid. But Baker left unan\u00ad swered when the presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal, as well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the relative importance of each in determining whether a case is suitable for adjudication. In my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct justi\u00ad cations for withholding judgment on the merits of a dispute. When a case would require a court to decide an issue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordinate political de\u00adpartment, as envisioned by Baker 's rst factor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks authority to resolve that issue. See, e. g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 229 (1993) (holding nonjusticiable the Senate's impeachment pro\u00adcedures in light of Article I's commitment to the Senate of the \" 'sole Power to try all Impeachments' \"); see also Mar- bury v. 165-166 (1803) (\"By the con\u00ad stitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character and to his own conscience\"). In such cases, the Constitution itself requires that another branch resolve the question presented. The second and third Baker factors reflect circumstances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond courts' competence. \" 'The judicial Power' created by Article III, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution is not whatever judges choose to do,\" but rather the power \"to act in the manner traditional for English and American courts.\" Vieth v. Jubelirer , 541 U. S. 267, 278 (2004) (plurality opinion). That traditional role in\u00ad204 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of Sotomayor, J. volves the application of some manageable and cognizable standard within the competence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts of a concrete case. When a court is given no standard by which to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute in the absence of a yet-unmade policy de\u00adtermination charged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is beyond the judicial role envisioned by Article III. See, e. g., Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973) (\"[I]t is difcult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence\" than \"[t]he com\u00ad plex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force\"); Vieth, 541 U. S., at 278 (\"One of the most obvious limitations im\u00adposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be governed by standard . . . \"). This is not to say, of course, that courts are incapable of interpreting or applying somewhat ambigu\u00adous standards using familiar tools of statutory or constitu\u00adtional interpretation. But where an issue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be \"no doubt of [the] validity\" of a court's decision to abstain from judgment. Ibid. The nal three Baker factors address circumstances in which prudence may counsel against a court's resolution of an issue presented. Courts should be particularly cautious before forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that judicial intervention risks \"embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question,\" would express a \"lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,\" or because there exists an \"unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.\" 369 U. S., at 217. We have repeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met whenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitutionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Government. See, e. g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 390-391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate a dispute merely because a decision Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 205 Opinion of Sotomayor, J. \"may have signicant political overtones\" or affect foreign relations,\" Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts decline to resolve a controversy within their traditional competence and proper jurisdiction simply be\u00adcause the question is difcult, the consequences weighty, or the potential real for conflict with the policy preferences of the political branches. The exercise of such authority is among the \"gravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this Court is called on to perform,\" Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is the role assigned to courts by the Constitution. \"Questions may occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot avoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judgment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Rare occasions implicating Baker 's nal factors, however, may present an \" 'unusual case' \" unt for judicial disposition. 369 U. S., at 218 (quoting the argument of Daniel Webster in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 29 (1849)). Because of the respect due to a coequal and independent department, for instance, courts properly resist calls to question the good faith with which another branch attests to the authenticity of its internal acts. See, e. g., Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672-673 (1892) (deeming \"forbidden by the re\u00adspect coordinate branch of the government\" \"[j]udi\u00adcial action\" requiring a belief in a \"deliberate conspiracy\" by the Senate and House of Representatives \"to defeat an expression of the popular will\"); see also Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S., at 409-410 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Mu\u00ad tual regard between the coordinate branches, and the inter\u00adest of certainty, both demand that ofcial representations re\u00adgarding . . . matters of internal process be accepted at face value\"). Likewise, we have long acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited to intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual need for \"attributing nality to the ac\u00ad206 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of Sotomayor, J. tion of the political departments,\" Coleman v. Miller , 307 U. S. 433, 454 (1939), or creating acute \"risk [of] embarrass\u00ad ment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home,\" Baker , 369 U. S., at 226. See, e. g., Luther , 7 How., at 43 (\"After the President has acted and called out the mili\u00adtia, is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to in\u00adquire whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Consti\u00adtution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order\"). 1 Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to stay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions con\u00adcerning the distribution of political authority between coor\u00addinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable, and inca\u00adpable of resolution by the political process. See Goldwater v. Carter , 444 U. S. 996, 997 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Abstention merely reflects that judicial inter\u00advention in such cases is \"legitimate only in the last resort,\" Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892), and is disfavored relative to the prospect of ac\u00adcommodation between the political branches. When such unusual cases arise, abstention accommodates considerations inherent in the separation of powers and the limitations envisioned by Article III, which conferred au\u00adthority to federal courts against a common-law backdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in exceptional cases. New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989); see generally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N. Y . U. L. Rev. 543 (1985) 1 See also Martin v.

Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 260 (1796) (Iredell, J., concurring) (to declare treaty with Great Britain void would turn on \"considerations of policy, considerations of extreme magnitude, [which are] certainly entirely incompetent to the examination and decision of a Court of Justice\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 207 Opinion of Sotomayor, J. (hereinafter Shapiro). The political questions envisioned by Baker 's nal categories nd common ground, therefore, with many longstanding doctrines under which considerations of justiciability or comity lead courts to abstain from deciding questions whose initial resolution is better suited to another time, see, e. g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Depart\u00ad ment of Interior , 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty , 445 U. S. 388, 397 (1980) (mootness); or another forum, see, e. g., Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 507 (1947) (forum non conveniens); Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, 498- 500 (1941); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibo\u00ad daux, 360 U. S. 25, 25-30 (1959); Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315, 333-334 (1943) (abstention in favor of a state forum); United States v. Western Pacic R. Co., 352 U. S. 59, 63-64 (1956) (primary jurisdiction doctrine). See also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno , 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (\"The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate Article III's 'case' or 'controversy' lan\u00adguage\"); Shapiro 550-557, 580-587 (describing practices judicial abstention sounding in justiciability, comity, forum non conveniens, and separation of powers). To be sure, it will be the rare case in which Baker 's nal factors alone render a case nonjusticiable. 2 But our long historical tradition recognizes that such exceptional cases arise, and due regard for the separation of powers and the judicial role envisioned by Article III conrms that absten\u00adtion may be an appropriate response. 2 Often when such factors are implicated in a case presenting a political question, other factors identied in Baker will likewise be apparent. See, e. g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 236 (1993) (\"[i]n addition to the textual commitment argument,\" nding persuasive that \"opening the door of judicial review\" of impeachment procedures would \" 'expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of chaos' \"); Baker v. Carr , 369 U. S. 186, 222 (1962) (explaining that the Court in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), found present features associated with each of the three rationales underlying Baker 's factors). 208 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Opinion of Sotomayor, J. II The court below held that this case presented a political question because it thought petitioner's suit asked the court to decide an issue \"textually committed\" to a coordinate branch\u2014namely, \"to review a policy of the State Department implementing the President's decision\" to keep the United States out of the debate over the status of Jerusalem. 571 F. 3d 1227, 1231-1232 (CADC 2009). Largely for the reasons set out by the Court, I agree that the Court of Appeals mis\u00adapprehended the nature of its task. In two respects, how\u00adever, my understanding of the political question doctrine might require a court to engage in further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court. First, the Court appropriately recognizes that petitioner's claim to a statutory right is \"relevant\" to the justiciability inquiry required in this case. Ante, at 196. In order to evaluate whether a case presents a political question, a court must rst identify with precision the issue it is being asked to decide. Here, petitioner's suit claims that a federal stat\u00adute provides him with a right to have \"Israel\" listed as his place of birth on his passport and other related documents. App. 15-18. To decide that question, a court must deter\u00admine whether the statute is constitutional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to issue petitioner's desired passport, or unconstitutional, in which case his suit is at an end. Resolution of that issue is not one \"textually com\u00admitted\" to another branch; to the contrary, it is committed to this one. In no fashion does the question require a court to review the wisdom of the President's policy toward Jeru\u00adsalem or any other decision committed to the discretion of a coordinate department. For that reason, I agree that the decision below should be reversed. That is not to say, however, that no statute could give rise to a political question. It is not impossible to imagine a case involving the application or even the constitutionality of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable issue. In\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 209 Opinion of Sotomayor, J. deed, this Court refused to determine whether an Ohio state constitutional provision offended the Republican Guarantee Clause, Art. IV , \u00a7 4, holding that \"the question of whether that guarantee of the Constitution has been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.\" Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569 (1916). A similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute, for instance, pur\u00adporting to award nancial relief to those improperly \"tried\" of impeachment offenses. To adjudicate claims under such a statute would require a court to resolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in Nixon. Such examples are atypical, but they sufce to show that the foreclosure altogether of political question analysis in statutory cases is unwarranted. Second, the Court suggests that this case does not impli\u00ad cate the political question doctrine's concern with issues ex\u00adhibiting \" 'a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards,' \" ante , at 197, because the parties' arguments rely on textual, structural, and historical evidence of the kind that courts routinely consider. But that was equally true in Nixon, a case in which we found that \"the use of the word 'try' in the rst sentence of the Impeachment Trial Clause lacks sufcient precision to afford any judicially manageable standard of review of the Senate's actions.\" 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion even though the parties' briefs focused upon the text of the Impeachment Trial Clause, \"the Constitution's drafting history,\" \"contemporane\u00adous commentary,\" \"the unbroken practice of the Senate for 150 years,\" contemporary dictionary meanings, \"Hamilton's Federalist essays,\" and the practice in the House of Lords prior to ratication. Such evidence was no more or less un\u00adfamiliar to courts than that on which the parties rely here. In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which litigants rely is common to judicial consideration that deter\u00admines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable and man\u00adageable standards. Rather, it is whether that evidence in 210 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Alito, J., concurring in judgment fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate meaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The answer will almost always be yes, but if the parties' textual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or wholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more than guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of arguments offered to courts might well still present justiciability concerns. In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority found a political question solely on the basis that this case required resolution of an issue \"textually committed\" to the Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual commitment, I respectfully concur in the Court's decision to reverse the Court of Appeals. Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment. This case presents a narrow question, namely, whether the statutory provision at issue infringes the power of the Presi\u00ad dent to regulate the contents of a passport. This case does not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power to recognize foreign governments and the extent of their terri\u00adtory is conferred exclusively on the President or is shared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the statutory provision in question represents an attempt by Congress to dictate United States policy regarding the status of Jerusa\u00adlem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect that Congress has the power to mandate that an American citizen born abroad be given the option of including in his passport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) what amounts to a statement of personal belief on the status of Jerusalem. Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution cer\u00ad tainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe the contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regulate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270-271 (1876). The Constitution Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 211 Alito, J., concurring in judgment also gives Congress the power to make a \"uniform Rule of Naturalization,\" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4, and pursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws concerning the citizenship of chil\u00addren born abroad to parents who are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow Congress to mandate that identifying information be included in passports and CRBAs. The President also has a measure of authority concerning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President has broad authority in the eld of foreign affairs, see, e. g., Amer\u00ad ican Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414 (2003), and, historically, that authority has included the power to issue passports, even in the absence of any formal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See Haig v. Agee , 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that \"[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject, the common perception was that the issuance of a passport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive and that the Executive would exercise this power in the interests of the national security and foreign policy of the United States\"). We have de\u00adscribed a passport as \"a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.\" Id., at 292. This is apparent from the rst page of petitioner's passport, which reads as follows: \"The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection.\" App. 19. Similarly, a CRBA is a certication made by a consular of\u00adcial that the bearer acquired United States citizenship at birth. See id., at 20. Under our case law, determining the constitutionality of an Act of Congress may present a political question, but I do 212 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Breyer, J., dissenting not think that the narrow question presented here falls within that category. Delineating the precise dividing line between the powers of Congress and the President with re\u00adspect to the contents of a passport is not an easy matter, but I agree with the Court that it does not constitute a political question that the Judiciary is unable to decide. Justice Breyer , dissenting. I join Part I of Justice Sotomayor' s opinion. As she points out, Baker v. Carr , 369 U. S. 186 (1962), set forth several categories of legal questions that the Court had previously held to be \"political questions\" inappropriate for judicial determination. Those categories include (1) in\u00adstances in which the Constitution clearly commits decision-making power to another branch of Government, and (2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for resolution. Id., at 217. They also include (3) issues that courts cannot decide without making \"an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\" (4) issues that a court cannot independently decide \"without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,\" (5) cases in which there is \"an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made,\" and (6) cases in which there is a potential for \"embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\" Ibid. As Justice Sotomayor also points out, these categories (and in my view particularly the last four) embody \"circum\u00adstances in which prudence may counsel against a court's resolution of an issue presented.\" Ante, at 204 (opinion con\u00ad curring in part and concurring in judgment); see Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine \"deriv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the respect we owe the political departments\"); Goldwater v. Carter , 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment) Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 213 Breyer, J., dissenting (\"[T]he political-question doctrine rests in part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect among the three branches of Government\"); see also Jaffe, Standing To Se\u00adcure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesitation where a legal issue is \"felt to be so closely related to a complex of decisions not within the court's jurisdiction that its resolution by the court would either be poor in itself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger complex\"). Justice Sotomayor adds that the circumstances in which these prudential considerations lead the Court not to decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare. Ante, at 207. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have before us such a case. Four sets of prudential considerations, taken to\u00ad gether , lead me to that conclusion. First, the issue before us arises in the eld of foreign affairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a sub\u00adsection of a section that concerns the relation between Jerusalem and the State of Israel. See \u00a7 214 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1365 (\"United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel\").) The Constitution primarily delegates the foreign affairs powers \"to the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative,\" not to the Judi\u00adciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting discretionary for\u00adeign affairs functions of Secretary of State as beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that fact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typically is highly political. It is \"delicate\" and \"complex.\" Chicago & South\u00ad ern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often rests upon infor\u00ad mation readily available to the Executive Branch and to the intelligence committees of Congress, but not readily avail\u00adable to the courts. Ibid. It frequently is highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called \"prophecy.\" Ibid. And 214 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Breyer, J., dissenting the creation of wise foreign policy typically lies well beyond the experience or professional capacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign affairs is at issue, the practi\u00adcal need for the United States to speak \"with one voice and ac[t] as one\" is particularly important. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242 (1942) (F rankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 240 (6th ed. 2009). The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that have signicant foreign policy implications, as reflected in the fact that many of the cases in which the Court has invoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this area, e. g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended upon the partner state's constitutional authority, Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing exist\u00adence, Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285 (1902); cases concerning the existence of foreign states, governments, bel\u00adligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918); United States v. Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Palmer , 3 Wheat. 610, 634-635 (1818); and cases concerning the territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829). See Baker , supra, at 211-213 (citing these cases political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra, at 243-247. Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional ques\u00ad tion before us, they may well have to evaluate the foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The constitu\u00adtional question focuses upon a statutory provision, \u00a7 214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the request of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the request of the citizen's legal guardian), shall \"record\" in the citizen's passport or consular birth report \"the place of birth as Israel.\" 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is whether this statute uncon\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 215 Breyer, J., dissenting stitutionally seeks to limit the President's inherent constitu\u00ad tional authority to make certain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414-415 (2003) (citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 445 (1998) (\"[T]his Court has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena, the President has 'a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone in\u00advolved' \" (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U. S. 579, 637-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The Secretary of State argues that the President's consti\u00ad tutional authority to determine foreign policy includes the power to recognize foreign governments, that this Court has long recognized that the latter power belongs to the Presi\u00addent exclusively, that the power includes the power to deter\u00admine claims over disputed territory as well as the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the statute uncon\u00adstitutionally limits the President's exclusive authority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2; Art. II, \u00a7 3; e. g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38, 50-51 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420 (disputed ter\u00ad ritory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition policy); see also Haig v. Agee , 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (executive passport authority). Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress, points out that the Constitution also grants Congress powers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to declare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate naturalization. See Art. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also American Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may share some of the recognition power and its attendant power of determin\u00ading claims over disputed territory. E. g., Palmer , supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they add that Congress 216 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Breyer, J., dissenting may enact laws concerning travel into this country and con\u00ad cerning the citizenship of children born abroad to U. S. citi\u00adzens. See Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270-271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigration); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include the power to specify the content of a passport (or consular birth report). And when such a specication takes the form of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires the President (through the Secretary of State) to execute that statute. See Art. II, \u00a7 3. Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned only with purely administrative matters (or were its enforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign policy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitutional question might not involve judges in trying to answer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East, administrative matters can have implications that extend far beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions in that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it may well turn out that resolution of the constitutional argument will require a court to decide how far the statute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative, determining not only whether but also the extent to which enforcement will interfere with the Pres\u00adident's ability to make signicant recognition-related foreign policy decisions. Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivotofsky, for example, argues that replacing \"Jerusalem\" on his pass\u00adport with \"Israel\" will have no serious foreign policy signi\u00adcance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46-52; Reply Brief for Petitioner 25-26. And in support he points to (1) a State Department ofcial's statement that birthplace designation serves primarily as \"an element of identication,\" while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the fact that the State Department has recorded births in unrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 217 Breyer, J., dissenting apparently without adverse effect; and (3) the fact that some\u00ad times Jerusalem does (because of what the Government calls \"clerical errors\") carry with it the name of \"Israel\" on certain ofcial documents, again apparently without seriously ad\u00adverse effect. See Brief for Petitioner 7-10, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58-60, 75-76. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the 100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United States recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel Aviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel, while denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans born in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18- 20, 48-49; App. 48. At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing Israel on the passports (and consular birth reports) of Americans born in Jerusalem will have signicantly adverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8, 37-41. She says that doing so would represent \" 'an ofcial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city located within Israel,' \" id., at 38-39, that it \"would be interpreted as an ofcial act of recognizing Jerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,\" App. 56, and that our \"national security interests\" consequently \"would be signicantly harmed,\" id., at 49. Such an action, she says, \" 'would signal, symbolically or concretely, that' \" the United States \" 'recognizes that Jerusalem is a city that is located within the sovereign terri\u00adtory of Israel,' \" and doing so \" 'would critically compromise the ability of the United States to work with Israelis, Pales\u00adtinians and others in the region to further the peace proc\u00adess.' \" Brief for Respondent 2; App. 52-53. She adds that the very enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 produced headlines in the Middle East stating that \"the U. S. now recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\" Id., at 231; Brief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53-55, 227-231. A judge's ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind is minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so risks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy decision\u00ad218 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Breyer, J., dissenting making by the other branches of Government. How, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or the extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication that it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect? Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial resolution of the constitutional determination are not partic\u00adularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the kind of interest, e. g., an interest in property or bodily integrity, which courts have traditionally sought to protect. See, e. g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673-674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of bodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an interest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the Constitution grants to individuals and that courts traditionally have protected from invasion by the other branches of Government. And I emphasize this fact because the need for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign policy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe pointed out many years ago, \"Our courts would not refuse to entertain habeas corpus to test the con\u00adstitutionality of the imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it were clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up with our relations to the Chinese government.\" 74 Harv. L. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Ques\u00adtions/Judicial Answers 63-64 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008). The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to an ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen born in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, does not have the \"option\" to \"specify or suppress the name of a country that accords with his or her ideology\"); see also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens born in Jerusalem \"from identifying their birthplace in a manner that conforms with their convictions\"). And insofar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideological, courts have often refused to consider the matter, leaving the in\u00adjured party to look to the political branches for protection. Cite as: 566 U. S. 189 (2012) 219 Breyer, J., dissenting E. g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66-67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739-740 (1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky's claim is unimportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is purely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering somewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to the political branches for reso\u00adlution of relevant legal issues. Cf. United States v. Richard\u00ad son, 418 U. S. 166, 179 (1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972). Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different for\u00ad eign policy views among the political branches of Govern\u00ad ment, those branches have nonjudicial methods of working out their differences. Cf. Goldwater , 444 U. S., at 1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Ste\u00ad vens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (nding in similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide treaty power ques\u00adtion). The Executive and Legislative Branches frequently work out disagreements through ongoing contacts and rela\u00adtionships, involving, for example, budget authorizations, con\u00adrmation of personnel, committee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which, taken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Congress as well as the President play an important role in the shaping of foreign policy. In\u00addeed, both the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch typically understand the need to work each with the other in order to create effective foreign policy. In that under\u00adstanding, those related contacts, and the continuous foreign-policy-related relationship lie the possibility of working out the kind of disagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of the political-question \"doctrine ultimately turns, as Learned Hand put it, on 'how importunately the occasion demands an answer,' \" Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of Rights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to work out their differences minimizes the need for judicial intervention here. 220 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON Breyer, J., dissenting The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its minimal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious risk that intervention will bring about \"embarrassment,\" show lack of \"respect\" for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For these pru\u00addential reasons, I would hold that the political-question doctrine bars further judicial consideration of this case. And I would afrm the Court of Appeals' similar conclusion. With respect, I dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 221 Syllabus CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC et al. v. SIMMONDS certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1261. Argued November 29, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012 Under \u00a7 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who realize prots from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of the corporation's securities within any 6-month period. The Act provides that such suits must be brought within \"two years after the date such prot was realized.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78p(b). In 2007, respondent Simmonds led numerous \u00a7 16(b) actions, claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the late 1990's and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks' aftermarket prices, allowing them to prot from the aftermarket sales. She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with \u00a7 16(a)'s requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests. That fail\u00adure, according to Simmonds, tolled \u00a7 16(b)'s 2-year time period. The District Court dismissed the complaints as untimely. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing its decision in Whittaker v. Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516, it held that the limitations period is tolled until an insider les the \u00a7 16(a) disclosure statement \"regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.\" Held: Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a question on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in deter\u00admining that it is tolled until a \u00a7 16(a) statement is led. The text of \u00a7 16(b)\u2014which starts the clock from \"the date such prot was realized,\" \u00a7 78p(b)\u2014simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment. Under long-settled equitable-tolling principles, a litigant must establish \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.\" Pace v. DiGuglielmo , 544 U. S. 408, 418. Tolling therefore ceases when fraud\u00ad ulently concealed facts are, or should have been, discovered by the plaintiff. Allowing tolling to continue beyond that point would be ineq\u00ad uitable and inconsistent with the general purpose of statutes of limita\u00ad tions: \"to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.\" John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133. The Whittaker rule's inequity is especially apparent here, where the theory 222 CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS Opinion of the Court of \u00a7 16(b) liability is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they had to le a \u00a7 16(a) statement. Under the Whittaker rule, alleged insiders who disclaim the necessity of ling are compelled either to le or to face the prospect of \u00a7 16(b) litigation in perpetuity. Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it would have said so. Simmonds' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. The lower courts should consider in the rst in\u00adstance how usual equitable-tolling rules apply in this case. Pp. 225-230. 638 F. 3d 1072, vacated and remanded.

S. 221 (2012) 223 Opinion of the Court insider's ling of the disclosure statement required by \u00a7 16(a) of the Act, \u00a7 78p(a). I Under \u00a7 16(b) of the Exchange Act, 48 Stat. 896, as amended, a corporation or security holder of that corporation may bring suit against the ofcers, directors, and certain benecial owners 1 of the corporation who realize any prots from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of the corporation's securities within any 6-month period. \"The statute imposes a form of strict liability\" and requires insiders to disgorge these \"short-swing\" prots \"even if they did not trade on inside information or intend to prot on the basis of such information.\" Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U. S. 115, 122 (1991). Section 16(b) provides that suits must be brought within \"two years after the date such prot was realized.\" 2 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78p(b). 1 Section 16(b) regulates benecial owners of more than 10% of any class of equity securities. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78p(a)(1). 2 Section 16(b) provides in full: \"For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such benecial owner, director, or ofcer by reason of his relationship to the issuer, any prot realized by him from any pur\u00adchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of such issuer (other than an exempted security) or a security-based swap agree\u00adment (as dened in section 206B of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) involving any such equity security within any period of less than six months, unless such security or security-based swap agreement was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any intention on the part of such benecial owner, director, or ofcer in entering into such transaction of holding the security or security-based swap agreement purchased or of not repurchasing the security or security-based swap agreement sold for a period exceeding six months. Suit to recover such prot may be insti\u00adtuted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such prot was realized. This subsection shall not be con\u00ad224 CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS Opinion of the Court In 2007, respondent Vanessa Simmonds led 55 nearly identical actions under \u00a7 16(b) against nancial institutions that had underwritten various initial public offerings (IPOs) in the late 1990's and 2000, including these petitioners. 3 In a representative complaint, she alleged that the underwrit\u00aders and the issuers' insiders employed various mechanisms to inflate the aftermarket price of the stock to a level above the IPO price, allowing them to prot from the aftermarket sale. App. 59. She further alleged that, as a group, the underwriters and the insiders owned in excess of 10% of the outstanding stock during the relevant time period, which subjected them to both disgorgement of prots under \u00a7 16(b) and the reporting requirements of \u00a7 16(a). Id., at 61. See 15 U. S. 78m(d)(3); 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 240.13d- 5(b)(1) and 240.16a-1(a)(1) (2011). The latter requires insiders to dis\u00adclose any changes to their ownership interests on a document known as a Form 4, specied in the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78p(a)(2)(C); 17 CFR \u00a7 240.16a-3(a). Simmonds alleged that the underwriters failed to comply with that requirement, thereby tolling \u00a7 16(b)'s 2-year time period. 4 App. 62. strued to cover any transaction where such benecial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security or security-based swap agreement (as dened in section 206B of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) involved, or any transaction or transactions which the [Securities and Exchange] Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.\" 15 U.

Simmonds con\u00adtends that this exemption does not apply where the underwriters do not act in good faith. Brief for Respondent 49. See \u00a7 240.16a-7(a). We ex\u00adpress no view on this issue. Cite as: 566 U. S. 221 (2012) 225 Opinion of the Court Simmonds' lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial pur\u00ad poses, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington dismissed all of her complaints.5 In re: Section 16(b) Litigation, 602 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (2009). As relevant here, the court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss 24 complaints on the ground that \u00a7 16(b)'s 2-year time period had expired long before Simmonds led the suits. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. 638 F. 3d 1072 (2011). Citing its decision in Whittaker v. Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516 (1981), the court held that \u00a7 16(b)'s limitations period is \"tolled until the insider discloses his transactions in a Sec\u00adtion 16(a) ling, regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.\" 638 F. 3d, at 1095. Judge Milan Smith, Jr., the author of the panel opinion, also specially concurred, expressing his disagree\u00adment with the Whittaker rule, but noting that the court was compelled to follow Circuit precedent. Id., at 1099-1101. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1036 (2011). II Petitioners maintain that these suits were properly dis\u00ad missed because they were led more than two years after the alleged prots were realized. Pointing to dictum in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, (1991), petitioners argue that \u00a7 16(b)'s limita\u00adtions period is a period of repose, which is not to be \"ex\u00adtended to account for a plaintiff 's discovery of the facts underlying a claim.\" Brief for Petitioners 17. See Lampf, of repose\"). We do not reach that contention, because we conclude that, even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in determining that it is tolled until the ling of a \u00a7 16(a) statement. 5 Simmonds voluntarily dismissed one of the complaints. 602 F. Supp. 2d, at 1206, n. 4. 226 CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS Opinion of the Court In adopting its rule in Whittaker , the Ninth Circuit ex\u00ad pressed its concern that \"[i]t would be a simple matter for the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section 16(b) . . . simply by failing to le . . . reports in violation of subdivi\u00adsion (a) and thereby concealing from prospective plaintiffs the information they would need\" to bring a \u00a7 16(b) action. 639 F. 2d, at 528 (internal quotation marks omitted). As\u00adsuming that is correct, it does not follow that the limitations period is tolled until the \u00a7 16(a) statement is led. Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the period in that manner. The 2-year clock starts from \"the date such prot was realized.\" \u00a7 78p(b). Congress could have very easily provided that \"no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the ling of a statement under subsection (a)(2)(C).\" But it did not. The text of \u00a7 16 simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The Whittaker court suggested that the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment 6 operates to toll the limitations period until the \u00a7 16(a) statement is led. See 639 F. 2d, at 527, and n. 9. Even accepting that equita\u00adble tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered by the 6 Relying on our decision in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974), Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule is best under\u00ad stood as applying legal\u2014rather than equitable\u2014tolling. In American Pipe , we held that \"commencement of a class action suspends the applica\u00ad ble statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class ac\u00adtion.\" 414 U. S., at 554. We based our conclusion on \"the efciency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 class actions].\" Id., at 553. Although we did not employ the term \"legal tolling,\" some federal courts have used that term to describe our holding on the ground that the rule \"is derived from a statutory source,\" whereas equitable tolling is \"judicially created.\" nologies, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 2d 164, 176 (Mass. 2009). The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter. As we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles nor the \"statutory source\" of \u00a7 16 sup\u00adports the conclusion that the limitations period is tolled until the ling of a \u00a7 16(a) statement. Cite as: 566 U. S. 221 (2012) 227 Opinion of the Court failure to le a \u00a7 16(a) statement, the Whittaker rule long-settled equitable-tolling princi\u00ad ples. \"Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently , and (2) that some extraordi\u00ad nary circumstance stood in his way.\" Pace v. DiGuglielmo , 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005) (emphasis added). It is well estab\u00adlished, moreover, that when a limitations period is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts, the tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have been, discovered by the plaintiff. 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 9.7.1, pp. 55-57 (1991). Thus, we have explained that the statute does not begin to run until discovery of the fraud \" 'where the party injured by the fraud remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part.' \" Lampf, supra, at 363 (quoting Bailey v. Glover , 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875); emphasis added). Allowing tolling to continue beyond the point at which a \u00a7 16(b) plaintiff is aware, or should have been aware, of the facts underlying the claim would quite certainly be inequitable and inconsistent with the general purpose of statutes of limitations: \"to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.\" John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133 (2008). The inequity of the Whittaker rule is especially apparent in a case such as this, where the theory of \u00a7 16(b) liability of underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they were required to le a \u00a7 16(a) statement. And where they disclaim the necessity of ling, the Whittaker rule compels them either to le or to face the prospect of \u00a7 16(b) litigation in perpetuity. Simmonds has acknowledged that \"under her theory she could buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago and bring claims for short-swing transactions if the underwriters had undervalued a stock.\" 602 F. Supp. 2d, at 1218. The poten\u00adtial for such endless tolling in cases in which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the facts underlying the 228 CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS Opinion of the Court action is out of step with the purpose of limitations periods in general. And it is especially at odds with a provision that imposes strict liability on putative insiders, see Gollust, 501 U. S., at 122. Had Congress intended this result, it most certainly would have said so. Simmonds maintains that failing to apply the Whittaker rule would obstruct Congress's objective of curbing short-swing speculation by corporate insiders. This objective, according to Simmonds, is served by \u00a7 16(a) statements, which \"provide the information necessary to trigger \u00a7 16(b) enforcement.\" Brief for Respondent 24. Simmonds\u2014like the Ninth Circuit in Whittaker\u2014disregards the most glaring indication that Congress did not intend that the limitations period be categorically tolled until the statement is led: The limitations provision does not say so. This fact alone is rea\u00adson enough to reject a departure from settled equitable-tolling principles. Moreover, \u00a7 16's purpose is fully served by the rules outlined above, under which the limitations period would not expire until two years after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have learned the facts underlying a \u00a7 16(b) action. The usual equitable-tolling inquiry will thus take account of the unavailability of sources of information other than the \u00a7 16(a) ling. Cf., e. g., Ruth v. Unifund CCR Partners, 604 F. 3d 908, 911-913 (CA6 2010); Santos ex rel. Beato v. United States, 559 F. 3d 189, 202-203 (CA3 2009). The oddity of Simmonds' position is well demonstrated by the circumstances of this case. Under the Whittaker rule, because petitioners have yet to le \u00a7 16(a) statements (as noted earlier they do not think themselves subject to that requirement), Simmonds still has two years to bring suit, even though she is so well aware of her alleged cause of ac\u00adtion that she has already sued. If \u00a7 16(a) statements were, as Simmonds suggests, indispensable to a party's ability to sue, Simmonds would not be here. Simmonds also asserts that application of established equitable-tolling doctrine in this context would be inconsist\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 221 (2012) 229 Opinion of the Court ent with Congress's intention to establish in \u00a7 16 a clear rule that is capable of \"mechanical application.\" Brief for Re\u00adspondent 57 (internal quotation marks omitted). Equitable tolling, after all, involves fact-intensive disputes \"about what the notice was, where it was disseminated, who received it, when it was received, and whether it provides suf\u00adcient notice of relevant Section 16(a) facts.\" Id., at 56-57. Of course this argument counsels just as much in favor of the \"statute of repose\" rule that petitioners urge (that is, no tolling whatever) as it does in favor of the Whittaker rule. No tolling is certainly an easily administrable bright-line rule. And assuming some form of tolling does apply, it is preferable to apply that form which Congress was cer\u00adtainly aware of, as opposed to the rule the Ninth Circuit has fashioned. 7 See Meyer v. Holley , 537 U. S. 280, 286 (2003) (\"Congress' silence, while permitting an inference that Con\u00adgress intended to apply ordinary background tort principles, cannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modication of those rules\"). * * * Having determined that \u00a7 16(b)'s limitations period is not tolled until the ling of a \u00a7 16(a) statement, we remand for the lower courts to consider how the usual rules of equitable tolling apply to the facts of this case. 8 We are divided 4 to 7 It is for this reason that we also reject the Second Circuit's rule that the 2-year period is tolled until the plaintiff \"gets actual notice that a person subject to Section 16(a) has realized specic short-swing prots that are worth pursuing,\" Litzler v. CC Investments, L. D. C., 362 F. 3d 203, 208 (2004). As that court itself recognized, this actual-notice rule departs from usual equitable-tolling principles. See id., at 207. 8 The District Court said that \"there is no dispute that all of the facts giving rise to Ms. Simmonds' complaints against [petitioners] were known to the shareholders of the Issuer Defendants for at least ve years before these cases were led,\" 602 F. Supp. 2d, at 1217. The Court of Appeals did not consider the accuracy of that statement, which Simmonds disputes, Brief for Respondent 12, since it concluded the period is tolled until a \u00a7 16(a) statement is led. 230 CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS Opinion of the Court 4 concerning, and thus afrm without precedential effect, the Court of Appeals' rejection of petitioners' contention that \u00a7 16(b) establishes a period of repose that is not subject to tolling. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 231 Syllabus SETSER v. UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fth circuit No. 10-7387. Argued November 30, 2011\u2014Decided March 28, 2012 When petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges, the State also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then serving for another drug offense. At about the same time, Setser pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. The Federal District Court imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. While Setser's federal appeal was pending, the state court sentenced him to 5 years for the probation violation and 10 years for the drug charge, but ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. The Fifth Circuit afrmed the federal sen\u00adtence, holding that the District Court had authority to order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and that Setser's sentence was reasonable, even if the state court's decision made it unclear exactly how to administer it. Held: 1. The District Court had discretion to order that Setser's federal sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the pro\u00adbation violation. Pp. 234-243. (a) Judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecu\u00adtively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings, see Ore\u00ad gon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168-169. The statutory text and structure do not foreclose a district court's exercise of this discretion with respect to anticipated state sentences. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 ad\u00addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the situation here, since the District Court did not impose \"multiple terms of impris\u00adonment . . . at and Setser was not \"already subject to\" the state sentences at issue, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3584(a). This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the District Court lacked authority to act as it did and that the Bureau of Prisons is to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision after the federal sentence has been imposed. Section 3621(b), from which the Bureau claims to derive this authority, says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences. And it is more natural to read \u00a7 3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise 232 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Syllabus of judicial discretion in situations not covered than it is to read \u00a7 3621(b) as giving the Bureau what amounts to sentencing authority. Setser's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 234-239. (b) None of the other objections raised by Setser and the Govern\u00ad ment require a different result. Pp. 239-243. 2. The state court's subsequent decision to make the state sentences run concurrently does not establish that the Federal District Court im\u00adposed an unreasonable sentence. The difculty here arises not from the federal-court sentence\u2014which is to run concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively with another\u2014but from the state court's de\u00adcision. Deciding which of the District Court's dispositions should pre\u00advail under these circumstances is a problem, but it does not show the District Court's sentence to be unlawful. The reasonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion, see Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 46, but Setser identies no flaw in the District Court's decisionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing that the court failed to consider. Where late-onset facts make it difcult, or even impossible, to implement the sentence, the Bureau of Prisons may determine, in the rst instance, how long the District Court's sentence authorizes it to continue Setser's connement, subject to the potential for judicial re\u00adview.

We consider whether a district court, in sentencing a de\u00ad fendant for a federal offense, has authority to order that the federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sen\u00adtence that has not yet been imposed. I When ofcers of the Lubbock Police Department arrested petitioner Monroe Setser for possessing methamphetamine, he was already serving a 5-year term of probation imposed by a Texas court for another drug offense. Setser was in\u00addicted in state court for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and the State also moved to revoke his term of probation. As often happens in drug cases, the fed\u00aderal authorities also got involved. A federal grand jury in\u00addicted Setser for possessing with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii), and he pleaded guilty. Before the federal sentencing hearing, a probation ofcer calculated the applicable Sentencing Commission Guidelines range to be 121 to 151 months' imprisonment. Citing prece\u00addent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, United States v. Brown, 920 F. 2d 1212 (1991) (per curiam), he indicated that the District Court had discretion to make Setser's sentence either concurrent with or consecu\u00adtive to any sentence anticipated in the separate state-court proceedings. Setser objected, arguing that the District Court lacked such authority. The court nevertheless made the sentence of 151 months that it imposed consecutive to any state sentence imposed for probation violation, but con\u00adcurrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. Setser appealed. While Setser's appeal was pending, the state court sen\u00ad tenced him to a prison term of 5 years for probation violation and 10 years on the new drug charge. It ordered that these sentences be served concurrently. Setser then made before the Court of Appeals, in addition to the argument that the 234 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court District Court had no authority to order a consecutive sen\u00ad tence, the argument that his federal sentence was unreason\u00adable because it was impossible to implement in light of the concurrent state sentences. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit afrmed. 607 F. 3d 128 (2010). Following its earlier Brown decision, the court held that the District Court did have authority to order a consecutive sentence. 607 F. 3d, at 131-132. It also held that Setser's sentence was reasonable, even if it was \" 'par\u00adtially foiled' \" by the state court's decision. Id., at 132-133. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1004 (2011), and appointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in support of the judgment below, 564 U. S. 1014 (2011). II Before proceeding further, it is important to be clear about what is at issue. Setser does not contend that his federal sentence must run concurrently with both state sentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing. He acknowl\u00adedges that someone must answer \"the consecutive versus concurrent question,\" Brief for Petitioner 27, and decide how the state and federal sentences will t together. The issue here is who will make that decision, which in turn deter\u00ad mines when that decision is made. One possible answer, and the one the Fifth Circuit gave, is that the decision belongs to the Federal District Court at the federal sentencing hearing. The concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision has been ad\u00ad dressed by \u00a7 212(a) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3584, reproduced in full as Appendix A, infra. The rst subsection of that provision, which says when con\u00adcurrent and consecutive sentences may be imposed, and spec\u00adies which of those dispositions will be assumed in absence of indication by the sentencing judge, does not cover the situation here. It addresses only \"multiple terms of im\u00adprisonment . term of imprisonment . . . imposed on a defendant who is Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 235 Opinion of the Court already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.\" \u00a7 3584(a). Here the state sentence is not imposed at the same time as the federal sentence, and the defendant was not already subject to that state sentence. Setser, supported by the Government, argues that, be\u00ad cause \u00a7 3584(a) does not cover this situation, the District Court lacked authority to act as it did; and that the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision is therefore to be made by the Bureau of Prisons at any time after the federal sen\u00adtence has been imposed. The Bureau of Prisons is said to derive this authority from 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3621(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), reproduced in full as Appendix B, infra. On its face, this provision says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences, but the Government explains its position as follows: Section 3621(b) gives the Bureau the au\u00adthority to order that a prisoner serve his federal sentence in any suitable prison facility \"whether maintained by the Fed\u00aderal Government or otherwise.\" The Bureau may therefore order that a prisoner serve his federal sentence in a state prison. Thus, when a person subject to a federal sentence is serving a state sentence, the Bureau may designate the state prison as the place of imprisonment for the federal sen\u00adtence\u2014effectively making the two sentences concurrent\u2014 or decline to do so\u2014effectively making them consecutive. 1 Based on \u00a7\u00a7 3584(a) and 3621(b), Setser and the Government argue that the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, under the circumstances presented here, is committed exclusively to the Bureau of Prisons. It is fundamental that we construe statutes governing the jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of \"the common-law background against which the statutes . . . were enacted,\" New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), and the same approach 1 The Bureau of Prisons sometimes makes this designation while the prisoner is in state custody and sometimes makes a nunc pro tunc designa\u00ad tion once the prisoner enters federal custody. 236 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court is appropriate here, where the issue concerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the Judiciary. Judges have long been understood to have discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they im\u00adpose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, includ\u00ading state proceedings. See Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168- 169 (2009). And a large majority of the federal appellate courts addressing the question have recognized a similar au\u00adthority in the context here, where a federal judge anticipates a state sentence that has not yet been imposed. See Salley v. United States, 786 F. 2d 546, 547 (CA2 1986); Anderson v. United 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam); United States ex rel. Lester v. Parker , 404 F. 2d 40, 41-42 (CA3 1968) (per curiam); States v. 362 F. 2d 178, 179-180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam); but see United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985). 2 We nd noth\u00ad 2 The dissent is incorrect to say, post, at 253-254 (opinion of Breyer, J.), that only the Second Circuit, in Salley , held to that effect. So did the Seventh Circuit in Kanton and the Tenth Circuit in Anderson. The dis\u00ad sent says that Anderson addressed only the question \"whether a federal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of entry into federal custody,\" post, at 253. That is true enough (and it is true of Kanton as well); but answering that question in a manner that upheld the consecutive federal sentence (i. e., it runs from the date of entry into fed\u00aderal custody) necessarily upheld the sentencing court's authority to impose the consecutive federal sentence. In fact, Anderson confronted and spe\u00ad cically rejected the defendant's argument that \" 'no court has the author\u00adity to impose a sentence consecutive to something that does not exist,' \" 405 F. 2d, at 493. And, nally, so did the Third Circuit in Lester. The dissent says that Lester addressed only the question \"whether a sentence was insufciently certain for purposes of due process,\" post, at 253. But that was the defendant's principal reason (as it appears also to be the dissent's principal reason) for asserting that the sentencing court had no authority to impose a consecutive sentence. And the Third Circuit re\u00ad jected not only that reason but \"[o]ther arguments advanced by [the de\u00adfendant]\" attacking the consecutive sentence, 404 F. 2d, at 42. The only contrary federal appellate decision rendered before the Sen\u00ad tencing Reform Act took effect relied upon 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4082 (1982 ed.) Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 237 Opinion of the Court ing in the Sentencing Reform Act, or in any other provision of law, to show that Congress foreclosed the exercise of dis\u00adtrict courts' sentencing discretion in these circumstances. Setser's main contention is that \u00a7 3584(a) has this effect. But that provision cannot sustain the weight that Setser asks it to bear. In essence, he reads the rst sentence in \u00a7 3584(a) to say that \"terms [of imprisonment] may run concurrently or consecutively\" only \"[i]f multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed . . . at the same time, or if a term of imprison\u00adment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.\" Since the District Court was not imposing the state sentence and since it was not already imposed, the sentence could not be ordered to run consecutively. But if the text is exclusive\u2014if the addi\u00adtion of only is correct\u2014the provision forbids not only the imposition of consecutive sentences, but the imposition of concurrent ones as well. And yet, as Setser acknowledges, it must be one or the other; someone must decide the issue. Setser's response is that, read in context, the sentence speaks only to district courts. Under the circumstances at issue here, he says, the federal and state sentences still might run either concurrently or consecutively, but just not at the discretion of the District Court. That is an odd pars\u00ading of the text, which makes no distinction between the dis\u00adtrict court and the Bureau of Prisons. The placement of \u00a7 3584 does indeed suggest that it is directed at district courts\u2014but that is likely because Congress contemplated that only district courts would have the authority to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, not because Con\u00adgress meant to leave the Bureau unfettered. Indeed, the Bureau already follows the other directives in \u00a7 3584(a). See Brief for United States 35. For example, if the district (the predecessor of \u00a7 3621) and \u00a7 3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed by 98 Stat. 1987), which provided that a federal sentence \"shall commence to run from the date on which such person is received\" into federal custody. See United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985). 238 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court court imposes multiple terms of imprisonment at the same time, but fails to address the concurrent-vs.-consecutive issue, the terms \"run concurrently,\" \u00a7 3584(a), and the Bu\u00adreau is not free to use its \"place of imprisonment\" authority to achieve a different result. 3 The Latin maxim on which Setser relies\u2014expressio unius est exclusio alterius\u2014might have application here if the pro\u00advision in question were a conferral of authority on district courts. Giving sentencing authority in only specied cir\u00adcumstances could be said to imply that it is withheld in other circumstances. Section 3584, however, is framed not as a conferral of authority but as a limitation of authority that already exists (and a specication of what will be assumed when the exercise of that authority is ambiguous). It reads not \"District courts shall have authority to impose multiple terms of imprisonment on a defendant at the same time, etc.\" but rather \"If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, [etc.]\"\u2014quite clearly assum\u00ad ing that such authority already exists. (Emphasis added.) The mere acknowledgment of the existence of certain pre\u00adexisting authority (and regulation of that authority) in no way implies a repeal of other pre-existing authority. And that is especially true when there is an obvious reason for selecting the instances of pre-existing authority that are ad\u00addressed\u2014to wit, that they are the examples of sentencing discretion most frequently encountered. Moreover, expressio unius est exclusio alterius is a it suggests that, be\u00adcause \u00a7 3584(a) recognizes judicial discretion in scenario A 3 The Government contends that the Bureau applies the default rules in \u00a7 3584(a) \"[a]s a matter of discretion\" but is not \" 'bound' \" by that subsec\u00ad tion. Reply Brief for United States 15, n. 5. We think it implausible that the effectiveness of those rules\u2014of \u00a7 3584(a)'s prescription, for example, that \"[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concur\u00adrently\"\u2014depends upon the \"discretion\" of the Bureau. Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 239 Opinion of the Court and scenario B, there is no such discretion in scenario C. But the same maxim shows much more convincingly why \u00a7 3621(b) cannot be read to give the Bureau of Prisons ex\u00adclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed to the district court in \u00a7 3584(a). When \u00a7 3584(a) specically addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive sen\u00adtences, and makes no mention of the Bureau's role in the process, the implication is that no such role exists. And that conclusion is reinforced by application of the same maxim (properly, in this instance) to \u00a7 3621(b)\u2014which is a conferral of authority on the Bureau of Prisons, but does not con\u00adfer authority to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences. Put to the choice, we believe it is much more natural to read \u00a7 3584(a) as not containing an implied \"only,\" leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it is to read \u00a7 3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority. III None of the other objections to this approach raised by Setser and the Government require a different result. Our decision today follows the interpretive rule they in\u00ad voke, that we must \"give effect . . . to every clause and word\" of the Act. United States v. Menasche , 348 U. S. 528, 538- 539 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted). The rst sentence in \u00a7 3584(a) addresses the most common situations in which the decision between concurrent and consecutive sentences must be made: where two sentences are imposed at the same time, and where a sentence is imposed subse\u00adquent to a prior sentence that has not yet been fully served. It says that the district court has discretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or consecutive, except that it may not make consecutive a sentence for \"an attempt\" and a sen\u00adtence for an \"offense that was the sole objective of the at\u00adtempt.\" And the last two sentences of \u00a7 3584(a) say what will be assumed in those two common situations if the court 240 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court does not specify that the sentence is concurrent or consecu\u00ad tive. Giving those dispositions full effect does not demand that we regard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other situations. Setser and the Government both suggest that, because \u00a7 3584(b) directs courts to consider the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in making these decisions, and because some of those factors will be difcult to apply with respect to antici\u00adpated sentences, the Act cannot be read to allow judicial dis\u00adcretion in these circumstances. One cannot be sure that the sentence imposed is \"sufcient, but not greater than neces\u00ad sary,\" \u00a7 3553(a), the argument goes, if one does not know how long it will actually be. But the district judge faces the same uncertainty if the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision is left for later resolution by the Bureau of Prisons; he does not know, for example, whether the 5-year sentence he im\u00adposes will be an actual ve years or will be simply swallowed within another sentence. To be sure, the Bureau of Prisons, if it waits to decide the matter until after the state court has imposed its sentence, will know for sure what sentences it is dealing with. But the Bureau is not charged with applying \u00a7 3553(a). The factors that guide the agency's \"place of im\u00adprisonment\" decision do include \"the nature and circum\u00adstances of the offense\" and \"the history characteristics of the prisoner,\" \u00a7 3621(b)(2), (b)(3) (2006 ed.)\u2014factors that are, to be sure, relevant to sentencing but also relevant to selection of the place of connement; but they also include factors that make little, if any, sense in the sentencing con\u00adtext, such as \"the resources of the facility contemplated\" and whether the state facility \"meets minimum standards of health and habitability,\" \u00a7 3621(b), (b)(1). (These factors conrm our view that \u00a7 3621 is not a sentencing provision but a place-of-connement provision.) It is much more natu\u00adral for a judge to apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making all concurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, than it is for some such decisions to be made by a judge applying \u00a7 3553(a) factors Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 241 Opinion of the Court and others by the Bureau of Prisons applying \u00a7 3621(b) factors. The nal objection is that principles of federalism and good policy do not allow a district court to make the concurrent\u00advs.-consecutive decision when it does not have before it all of the information about the anticipated state sentence. As for principles of federalism, it seems to us they cut in pre\u00adcisely the opposite direction. In our American system of dual sovereignty, each sovereign\u2014whether the Federal Gov\u00adernment or a State\u2014is responsible for \"the administration of [its own] criminal justice syste[m].\" Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. If a prisoner like Setser starts in state custody, serves his state sentence, and then moves to federal custody, it will always be the Federal Government\u2014whether the district court or the Bureau of Prisons\u2014that decides whether he will receive credit for the time served in state custody. And if he serves his federal sentence rst, the State will decide whether to give him credit against his state sentences with\u00adout being bound by what the district court or the Bureau said on the matter. Given this framework, it is always more respectful of the State's sovereignty for the district court to make its decision up front rather than for the Bureau of Pris\u00adons to make the decision after the state court has acted. That way, the state court has all of the information before it when it acts. 4 The Government's position does not promote the States' interest\u2014just the interests of the Bureau of Prisons. 4 Setser notes that the text of \u00a7 3584(a) does not distinguish between state and federal sentences. If a district court can enter a consecutive sentencing order in advance of an anticipated state sentence, he asks, what is to stop it from issuing such an order in advance of an anticipated federal sentence? It could be argued that \u00a7 3584(a) impliedly prohibits such an order because it gives that decision to the federal court that sentences the defendant when the other sentence is \"already\" imposed\u2014and does not speak (of course) to what a state court must do when a sentence has al\u00ad ready been imposed. It sufces to say, however, that this question is not before us. 242 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court As for good policy: The basic claim of Setser, the Govern\u00ad ment, and the dissent is that when it comes to sentencing, later is always better because the decisionmaker has more information. See, e. g., post, at 252 (\"[A] sentencing judge typically needs detailed information when constructing a multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline sentence\"). That is undoubtedly true, but when that desideratum is ap\u00adplied to the statutory structure before us here it is over\u00adwhelmed by text, by our tradition of judicial sentencing, 5 and by the accompanying desideratum that sentencing not be left to employees of the same Department of Justice that con\u00adducts the prosecution. 6 Moreover, when the district court's 5 To support its view that Congress authorized the Bureau to make concurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, the dissent relies on the fact that the Executive long had what is effectively sentencing authority in its ability to grant or deny parole. That is a particularly curious power for the dissent to rely upon, inasmuch as most of the dissent discusses (in great detail) the Sentencing Reform Act, whose principal objective was to elimi\u00ad nate the Executive's parole power. Curiouser still is the dissent's invoca\u00ad tion of the Guidelines system, which \"tell[s] the sentencing judge how, through the use of partially concurrent and partially consecutive sen\u00adtences, to build a total sentence that meets the Guidelines' requirements.\" Post, at 249-250. These \"instructions,\" post, at 249 do not cover yet-to-be-imposed sentences, the dissent says, because \"the sentencing judge normally does not yet know enough about the behavior that under\u00adlies (or will underlie)\" such a sentence. Post, at 250. That explains, per\u00ad haps, why the Guidelines' \"instructions\" to judges do not cover them. But why do not the Guidelines \"instruct\" the Bureau of Prisons how to conduct its concurrent/consecutive sentencing? If the reason is (as we suspect) that the Sentencing Commission does not have, or does not be\u00adlieve it has, authority to \"instruct\" the Bureau of Prisons, the dissent's entire argument based upon what it calls \"the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA's sentencing system,\" post, at 252, falls apart. Yet-to-be\u00ad imposed sentences are not within the system at all, and we are simply left with the question whether judges or the Bureau of Prisons is responsible for them. For the reasons we have given, we think it is judges. 6 Of course, a district court should exercise the power to impose anticipa\u00ad tory consecutive (or concurrent) sentences intelligently. In some situa\u00adtions, a district court may have inadequate information and may forbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case. Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 243 Opinion of the Court failure to \"anticipat[e] developments that take place after the rst sentencing,\" Brief for United States 29, produces unfair\u00adness to the defendant, the Act provides a mechanism for re\u00adlief. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) provides that a district court, \"upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, may reduce the term of imprisonment . . . after consider\u00ading the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if it nds that . . . extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction [or that the defendant meets other criteria for relief].\" IV Setser argues that, even if the District Court's consecutive order was consistent with \u00a7 3584(a), it made his sentence im\u00adpossible to implement and therefore unreasonable under the Act, see United States v. Booker , 543 U. S. 220, 261-262 (2005), 7 in light of the State's decision to make his sentences- concurrent. We think not. There is nothing unreason\u00adable\u2014let alone inherently impossible\u2014about the sentence it\u00adself. Setser is ordered to serve a 151-month term in federal custody, and that sentence should run concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively with another. The difculty arises not from the sentence, but from the state court's decision to make both state sentences concur\u00adrent. Which of the District Court's dispositions should pre\u00advail: that his federal sentence run consecutively to the state sentence on the parole revocation charge, or that his federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence on the 7 We have never had occasion to decide whether reasonableness review under Booker applies to a court's decision that a federal sentence should run concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. The Courts of Appeals, however, generally seem to agree that such review applies. See, e. g., United States v. Padilla, 618 F. 3d 643, 647 (CA7 2010) (per curiam); United States v. Matera, 489 F. 3d 115, 123-124 (CA2 2007). For purpose of the present case we assume, without deciding, that it does. 244 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court new drug charge? If the federal sentence is added to the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new drug charge, and if it is merged in the state sentence it will not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge. This is in\u00addeed a problem, but not, we think, one that shows the Dis\u00adtrict Court's sentence to be unlawful. The reasonableness standard we apply in reviewing federal sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion. See Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 46 (2007). Setser identies no flaw in the District Court's decisionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing that the District Court failed to consider. That a sentence is thwarted does not mean that it was unreasonable. If a district court or\u00addered, as a term of supervised release, that a defendant maintain a steady job, but a subsequent disability rendered gainful employment infeasible, we doubt that one would call the original sentence an abuse of discretion. There will often be late-onset facts that materially alter a prisoner's position and that make it difcult, or even impossible, to im\u00adplement his sentence. This is where the Bureau of Prisons comes in\u2014which ulti\u00ad mately has to determine how long the District Court's sen\u00adtence authorizes it to continue Setser's connement. Setser is free to urge the Bureau to credit his time served in state court based on the District Court's judgment that the federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence for the new drug charges. If the Bureau initially declines to do so, he may raise his claim through the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR \u00a7 542.10 et seq . (2011). And if that does not work, he may seek a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2241. We express no view on whether those proceedings would be successful. * * * Because it was within the District Court's discretion to order that Setser's sentence run consecutively to his antici\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 245 Appendix A to opinion of the Court pated state sentence in the probation revocation proceeding; and because the state court's subsequent decision to make that sentence concurrent with its other sentence does not establish that the District Court abused its discretion by im\u00adposing an unreasonable sentence; we afrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. It is so ordered. APPENDIXES A 18 U. S.

The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 seeks to reform fed\u00ad eral sentencing practices by creating a Federal Sentencing Commission instructed to develop and to promulgate Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The provision of the Act here at issue concerns \"[m]ultiple sentences.\" See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3584. It brings into focus a difcult Guidelines-related problem: How should a federal judge sentence an offender where the offender has been convicted of having violated several differ\u00adent statutes? The convictions may have taken place all at the same time. Or, some convictions might have taken place at an earlier time, the offender may already have been sen\u00adtenced to prison, and indeed the offender may still be serving that sentence. The federal judge must decide the extent to which a sentence attached to one conviction should be served concurrently or consecutively with sentences attached to other convictions. An understanding of the nature of this general problem and the Sentencing Commission's statutorily foreseen solu\u00adtions will help the reader understand why, in my view, the better legal answer to the question before us is that a federal sentencing judge does not have the power to order that a \"federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sen\u00adtence that has not yet been imposed.\" Ante, at 233. I The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA or Act) has two overall objectives. See Barber v. Thomas , 560 U. S. 474, 481- 482 (2010); see also United States Sentencing Commission, 248 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1A3, p. 1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (address\u00ad ing statutory objectives). First, it seeks greater honesty in sentencing. Instead of a parole commission and a judge try\u00ading to second-guess each other about the time an offender will actually serve in prison, the SRA tries to create a sen\u00adtencing system that will require the offender actually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes. See Mis\u00ad tretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989) (\"[The SRA] makes all sentences basically determinate\"). Second, the Act seeks greater fairness in sentencing through the creation of Guidelines that will increase the likelihood that two of\u00ad fenders who engage in roughly similar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar sentences. See Barber , supra, at 482 (noting that Congress sought to achieve, in part, \"in\u00adcreased sentencing uniformity\"). To implement these reforms, the SRA instructs the Com\u00ad mission to write Guidelines that inevitably move in the di\u00adrection of increased \"real offense\" sentencing. See USSG \u00a7 1A2, at 1.1 (describing how statute, e. g., by insisting upon categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics, leads to this result). In principle, real offense sentencing would impose the same sentence upon different offenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective of the stat\u00ad utes under which they are charged. Real offense sentenc\u00ad ing, for example, would mean that two individuals, both of whom rob a bank and injure a teller, would receive the same sentence even if the Government charges one of them under a bank robbery statute and the other under an assault stat\u00adute. See, e. g., USSG App. A (listing federal statutory of\u00ad fenses, while keying them to specic individual Guidelines that determine sentence based upon likely actual behavior). In the event, the Guidelines move the sentencing system in this direction while simultaneously recognizing that other factors require considerable modication of the real offense principle. See \u00a7 1A4(a) (\"Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 249 Breyer, J., dissenting Nonetheless the \"real offense\" goal influenced the Act's, and the Commission's, objectives in respect to the sentencing of an offender with multiple convictions. Insofar as several convictions arise out of the same course of behavior, the sen\u00adtencing judge should treat the crimes underlying the convic\u00adtions as if they were all part of a single crime and sentence accordingly. But, insofar as the crimes underlying the con\u00advictions arise out of different courses of behavior, the sen\u00adtencing judge should treat the crimes underlying the convic\u00adtions as if they were not part of a single crime and should see that the ultimate sentence reflects that fact. To achieve these objectives is easier said than done. For one thing, it requires a denition of what counts as the same course of behavior. The Guidelines set forth that denition in \u00a7 1B1.3, at 1.17 (\"Relevant Conduct\"). For another thing, statutes and Guidelines that set forth related instructions must take into account the fact that sentencing-related cir\u00adcumstances can prove highly complex. To take a fairly sim\u00adple example, suppose that a defendant is convicted of both robbery and impersonating a federal ofcial, that he has en\u00adgaged in a single course of behavior, but that neither the robbery nor the impersonation Guidelines take account of the other. Instructions about concurrent/consecutive sentences must give the judge an idea about what to do in such a case. They must also take account of the fact that a maxi\u00admum penalty contained in a statute will trump a greater penalty contained in a Guideline. And they must tell the judge (faced with multiple convictions) what to do where that is so. Reflecting these, and other, complexities, the Guidelines contain complex instructions about how to sentence where the offender is convicted of \"Multiple Counts,\" see USSG \u00a7 3D, or has previously been convicted of a crime for which he is \"subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment,\" see \u00a7 5G1.3. The Guidelines also tell the sentencing judge how, through the use of partially concurrent and partially consec\u00ad250 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting utive sentences, to build a total sentence that meets the Guidelines' requirements. See \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.2(d), 5G1.3. With this background it becomes easier to understand the statutory provisions before us. They reflect the fact that Congress expected sentencing judges, when faced with a de\u00adfendant convicted of multiple crimes, to construct a sentence that would, at least to a degree, reflect the defendant's real underlying behavior. Where two convictions reflect in whole or in part the same behavior, the overall sentences should reflect that fact, say, by running concurrently. Accordingly, the statute says that \"[m]ultiple terms of im\u00ad prisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently un\u00ad less the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3584(a). And that statement reflects the fact that often (but not always) multi\u00adple convictions after a single trial will reflect a single course of behavior (different aspects of which violate different crim\u00adinal statutes). The statute also says that \"[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecu\u00adtively unless the court orders that the terms are to run con\u00adcurrently.\" Ibid. This statement reflects the fact that sev\u00ad eral convictions imposed after different trials are more likely to reflect unrelated behaviors. In the rst instance that the statute addresses, concurrent sentences are more likely to be appropriate; in the second, consecutive sentences are more likely to be appropriate. But that is not always so. Thus the statutory provisions assure sentencing judges that they retain the power to reach a different conclusion. At this point, I would ask the question that this case poses. Why does the statute say nothing about a sentencing judge imposing a sentence that might run consecutively with a sen\u00adtence that a (typically different) judge has not yet imposed? The answer is this: Because the sentencing judge normally does not yet know enough about the behavior that underlies (or will underlie) a sentence that has not yet been imposed. Normally the sentencing judge does not know, for example, Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 251 Breyer, J., dissenting (1) what that sentence will be, (2) whether the behavior un\u00ad derlying that later sentence constitutes part of the same course of behavior that underlies the present sentence or, instead, is totally separate from the behavior underlying the present sentence, or (3) is partly the same and partly differ\u00adent. Even if the judge has an idea about what will happen, he does not know precisely what will happen; and precision in this matter is important. In a word, the sentencing judge normally does not yet know enough about what will happen in the sentencing-proceeding-yet-to-come to be able to construct a sentence that meets the Guidelines' instructions and which, in doing so, helps to ensure that different individuals who engage in the same criminal behavior will typically receive roughly comparable sentences. Of course, the Court is correct when it says that eventually the sentences will run (either wholly or in part) concurrently or consecutively. And someone must decide how they will run. Ante, at 234. But the Court is not correct when it says that this someone should be the rst federal sentencing judge. Rather, the Executive and Judicial Branches have devised a system that can draw upon the intentions of that rst federal judge, while applying them in light of actual knowledge about what later happened. The Bureau of Pris\u00adons (BOP or Bureau) in effect makes the consecutive/concur\u00adrent decision after considering, among other things, \"any statement by the court that imposed the sentence,\" including statements \"concerning the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was determined to be warranted.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3621(b)(4)(A). And its program statement pro\u00ad vides that it will review the \"intent of the federal sentencing court\" when deciding whether in effect to make an earlier federal, and later state, sentence concurrent or consecutive. Dept. of Justice, BOP, Program Statement No. 5160.05: Des\u00adignation of State Institution for Service of Federal Sentence 4 (Jan. 16, 2003). The Bureau exercises this authority by 252 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting designating (or refusing to designate) the state prison where an offender is or will be incarcerated pursuant to his state sentence as the place where he will serve his federal sen\u00adtence. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3621(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). This exercise of authority by the Executive Branch is not constitutionally surprising. After all, \"federal sentencing\" has \"never . . . been thought to be assigned by the Constitu\u00adtion to the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the three Branches of Government.\" Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And, until fairly recently the federal BOP decided (via pa\u00adrole) the far more global question of just how long (within broad limits) each imprisoned offender would serve. See id., at 367. Thus, the present Bureau involvement repre\u00adsents a further practical accommodation to a fact about the world, namely, that the initial sentencing judge typically lacks important sentencing-related information about a sec\u00adond sentence that has not yet been imposed. II Given the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA's sen\u00ad tencing system, just described, the better reading of the \"multiple sentences\" provision is a reading that denies a sen\u00adtencing judge the authority to \"order that the federal sen\u00adtence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed.\" Ante, at 233. For one thing, nothing in the statute explicitly grants the judge that au\u00adthority. The text refers to other circumstances, those that involve earlier or contemporaneous (multiple-count) convic\u00adtions, while it does not refer to later imposed sentences. For another, exercise of any such authority would more likely hinder than advance the basic objectives of the SRA. As I have explained, supra, at 247-250, a sentencing judge typically needs detailed information when constructing a multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline sentence. The fact that the future sentence has not yet been imposed Cite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 253 Breyer, J., dissenting means that information will often be lacking, and that in turn means that the exercise of such authority would risk confu\u00adsion and error. A sentencing judge who believes, for exam\u00adple, that the future conviction will be based upon different relevant conduct (and consequently orders a consecutive sen\u00adtence) could discover that the second conviction rests upon the same relevant conduct (warranting a concurrent sen\u00adtence). Mistakes of this kind increase the risk of sentencing disparity and, insofar as the rst judge guesses wrong, they can mean a less honest sentencing process as well. Further, I can nd no signicant tradition (pre-Guideline or post-Guideline) of federal judges imposing a sentence that runs consecutively with a sentence not yet imposed. The Court refers to four Courts of Appeals cases for the proposi\u00adtion that \"traditionally\" a judge possessed this authority. Ante, at 236. The opinions in three of the cases are each about a page long and do not discuss the matter here at issue. (They assume, without signicant discussion, the existence of the relevant sentencing authority.) See Anderson v. United States, 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam) (address\u00ad ing the question whether a federal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of entry into federal custody); United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178, 179-180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam) (same); United States ex rel. Lester v. Parker , 404 F. 2d 40, 41 (CA3 1968) (per curiam) (address\u00ad ing the question whether a sentence was insufciently cer\u00adtain for purposes of due process). The fourth case, Salley v. United States, 786 F. 2d 546, 548 (CA2 1986), discusses the issue directly and takes the Court's position. But, like the other three cases, it was decided before the Guidelines took effect (i. e., when the reasons for denying the authority were less strong). And, one judge on the panel disagreed in a separate opinion, and in my view has the better of the argu\u00adment. See id., at 548-550 (Newman, J., concurring in re\u00ad sult); see also United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 254 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting (CA9 1985) (holding that a judge lacks the here-relevant sen\u00ad tencing power). In any event, these instances are too few to constitute a \"tradition.\" In fact the Senate Committee Report accompanying the SRA provides strong evidence that there was no such tradi\u00adtion. S. Rep. No. 98-225 (1983). That Report thoroughly surveyed prior law. It says that the SRA is a \"comprehen\u00adsive statement of the Federal law of sentencing,\" that it \"de\u00adscribes in detail the kinds of sentences that may be im\u00adposed,\" and that \u00a7 3584 \"provides the rules for determining the length of a term of imprisonment for a person convicted of more than one offense.\" Id., at 50, 125-126. It further states that \"[e]xisting law permits the imposition of either concurrent or consecutive sentences,\" which practice it then describes as limited to two scenarios: \"[t]erms of imprison\u00ad ment imposed at the same time,\" and those \"imposed on a person already serving a prison term.\" Id., at 126. It says the same when describing how \u00a7 3584 is supposed to work. In neither place does it refer to a practice of, or any authority for, imposing a prison term that runs consecutively with a future term not yet imposed. In addition, a grant of such authority risks at least occa\u00ad sional incoherence. For example, the statute, after setting forth the court's authority to impose a sentence of imprison\u00adment that runs either concurrently or consecutively with other terms imposed in the same or in earlier proceedings, creates an exception that says: \"except that the terms may not run consecutively for an attempt and for another offense that was the sole objective of the attempt.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3584(a) (2006 ed.). Now suppose the Court were right, and a sentencing judge had the authority to run a present term consecutively with a not-yet-imposed future term. Would it not be important to apply this same \"attempt\" exception in such instances as well? Indeed, the exception is phrased in categorical terms, and the legislative history in no way indicates that the exception applies only occasionally. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 126 (\"[C]onsecutive terms of imprison\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 231 (2012) 255 Breyer, J., dissenting ment may not, contrary to current law, be imposed for [at\u00ad tempt] and for an offense that was the sole objective of the attempt\" (emphasis added)). Yet it is difcult, if not impos\u00adsible, to read the statute's language as broadening the excep\u00adtion beyond the statutorily listed scenarios. Or, consider, for example, an offender tried for arguably related crimes in two different federal courts at two differ\u00adent times. The Court's reading would not only allow the second judge to order concurrent service with the rst sen\u00adtence if warranted, as the statute explicitly permits, but it would also allow the rst judge to make an analogous but anticipatory order based upon the sentence he expected the second judge would impose. But where complex forms of criminal behavior are at issue, these different judges may reach different conclusions. The result may well be conflict and confusion. Finally, as I said above, supra, at 250-252, a more practical solution to potential problems presented by a future sentenc\u00ading proceeding lies closer at hand. The BOP has the statu\u00adtory authority to effect concurrent service of federal and state sentences and is well situated to take into account both the intent of the rst sentencing judge and the specic facts developed in the second sentencing. The relevant statute provides that \"[t]he Bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility . . . , whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise . . . .\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3621(b). And in reliance on this authority, the Bureau has concluded that it has the power to \"designat[e] . . . a state institution for concurrent service of a federal sentence.\" Program Statement No. 5160.05, at 1. The Program State\u00adment further provides that exercise of this power will be guided by, in part, \"the intent of the federal sentencing court\" in addition to \"any other pertinent information re\u00adgarding the inmate.\" Id., at 4. The Court's only criticism of this system is that it is less \"natural\" to read the statute \"as giving the Bureau of Pris\u00adons what amounts to sentencing authority.\" Ante, at 239. 256 SETSER v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting But what is unnatural about giving the Bureau that author\u00ad ity? The sentencing process has long involved cooperation among the three branches of Government. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And until the Guidelines the BOP itself de\u00ad cided, within broad limits, precisely how much prison time every typical offender would serve. Even today, it still de\u00adcides that question within certain limits. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3624 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (delegating to the BOP authority to calculate \"good time credit,\" which in effect reduces a prison\u00ader's term of incarceration); see also Barber , 560 U. S., at 476. Although Congress limited the Bureau's authority in this re\u00adspect, there is nothing unnatural about leaving the Bureau with a small portion of that authority\u2014particularly where doing so helps signicantly to alleviate a small, but impor\u00adtant, technical problem in the application of the SRA's sen\u00adtencing system. * * * Because the Court does not ask why the \"multiple sentenc\u00ad ing\" provision leaves out the authority at issue\u2014concerning the not-yet-imposed sentence\u2014it reaches what I believe is the wrong result. Consequently, with respect, I dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 257 Syllabus V ARTELAS v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 10-1211. Argued January 18, 2012\u2014Decided March 28, 2012 Before passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Respon\u00ad sibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable aliens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an \"entry,\" upon their return from \"innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . outside borders.\" 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction be\u00adtween exclusion and deportation procedures, creating a uniform \"re\u00admoval\" proceeding. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229, 1229a. Congress made \"ad\u00admission\" the key word, and dened \"admission\" to mean \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authoriza\u00adtion by an immigration ofcer.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as seeking admission if they have \"committed an offense iden\u00adtied in section 1182(a)(2),\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, crime involving moral turpitude . . . \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence. In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA's passage, Vartelas regu\u00adlarly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In 2003, when Var\u00adtelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration ofcer classied him as an alien seeking \"admission\" based on his 1994 convic\u00adtion. At Vartelas' removal proceedings, his attorneys conceded remov\u00adability and requested discretionary relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA afrmed. In 2008, Vartelas led with the BIA a timely motion to re\u00adopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA's new \"admission\" provision did not reach back to deprive him 258 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Syllabus of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion. The Second Circuit afrmed. Rejecting Vartelas' argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime. Held: The impact of Vartelas' brief travel abroad on his permanent resi\u00ad dent status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction. Pp. 265-276. (a) Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by Var\u00ad telas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263. The presumption against retroactive leg\u00adislation \"embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.\" Id., at 265. Numerous decisions of this Court have invoked Justice Sto\u00adry's formulation for determining when a law's retrospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as relevant here, when such application would \"attac[h] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past,\" Society for Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler , 22 F. Cas. 756, 767. See, e. g., INS v. St. Cyr , 533 U. S. 289, 321; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer , 520 U. S. 939, 947; Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283. Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a \"new disability,\" effectively a ban on travel out\u00adside the United States, \"in respect to\" past events, specically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRA's passage. Congress did not expressly prescribe \u00a7 1101(a)(13)'s temporal reach. The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether ap\u00adplication of IIRIRA's travel restraint to Vartelas \"would have retroac\u00adtive effect\" Congress did not authorize. See id., at 280. Vartelas pre\u00ad sents a rm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle. Beyond genuine doubt \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)'s restraint on lawful perma\u00adnent residents like Vartelas ranks as a \"new disability.\" Once able to journey abroad to, e. g., fulll religious obligations or respond to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe sanction. See, e. g., Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, 365-366, 373-374. The Government suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse con\u00adsequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States. But losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members. This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 559; St. Cyr , 533 U. S., at 321-323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous, Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 259 Syllabus see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280-286; Hughes Aircraft, 520 U. S., at 946- 950. Pp. 265-269. (b) The Court nds disingenuous the Government's argument that no retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant event is the alien's post-IIRIRA return to the United States. Vartelas' return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for his \"new disability\" was his pre-IIRIRA conviction. That past misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Pp. 269-272. (c) In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroac\u00ad tive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words \"committed an offense\" in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). It reasoned that reliance on the prior law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and that Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration laws. This reasoning is doubly flawed. A party is not required to show reli\u00adance on the prior law in structuring his conduct. See, e. g., Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively. St. Cyr is illustrative. There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable. Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal proceeding was commenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct, 533 U. S., at 321. Aliens like St. Cyr \"almost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo\u00ad[ing] their right to a trial,\" id., at 325. Because applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an \"obvious and severe retroactive effect,\" ibid., and Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyr's case. Vartelas' case is at least as clear as St. Cyr's for declining to apply a new law retroactively. St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney General's discretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an ofcial's per\u00ad mission, to make short trips to see and assist his parents in Greece. The Second Circuit compounded its initial misperception of the antiret\u00adroactivity principle by holding otherwise. Fleuti continues to govern Vartelas' short-term travel. Pp. 272-275. 620 F. 3d 108, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

He pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four months for that offense. Vartelas traveled to Greece in 2003 to visit his par\u00adents. On his return to the United States a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible alien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law governing at the time of Var\u00adtelas' plea, an alien in his situation could travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his resident alien status. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosen\u00ad berg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963). In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009- 546. That Act effectively precluded foreign travel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction like Vartelas'. Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from a sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently removed from the United States. See 8 U. S.

S. 257 (2012) 261 Opinion of the Court This case presents a question of retroactivity not ad\u00ad dressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident con\u00ad victed of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA, which regime governs, the one in force at the time of the convic\u00adtion, or IIRIRA? If the former, Vartelas' brief trip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resident status. If the latter, he may be denied reentry. We conclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of reentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas' pre-IIRIRA offense, plea, and conviction). Guided by the deeply rooted presumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas' conviction. The impact of Vartelas' brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is therefore deter\u00admined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction. I A Before IIRIRA's passage, United States immigration law established \"two types of proceedings in which aliens can be denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation hearings and exclusion hearings.\" Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 25 (1982). Exclusion hearings were held for certain aliens seeking entry to the United States, and depor\u00adtation hearings were held for certain aliens who had already entered this country. See ibid. Under this regime, \"entry\" into the United States was de\u00ad ned as \"any coming of an alien into the United States, from a foreign port or place.\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.). The statute, however, provided an exception for lawful per\u00admanent residents; aliens lawfully residing here were not re\u00adgarded as making an \"entry\" if their \"departure to a foreign port or place . . . was not intended or reasonably to be ex\u00ad pected by [them] or [their] presence in a foreign or place . . . was not voluntary.\" Ibid. Interpreting this cryptic 262 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court provision, we held in Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 461-462, that Con\u00ad gress did not intend to exclude aliens long resident in the United States upon their return from \"innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this country's borders.\" In\u00adstead, the Court determined, Congress meant to rank a once-permanent resident as a new entrant only when the Absent such \"disrupti[on]\" of the alien's residency, the alien would not be \"subject . . . to the consequences of an 'entry' into the country on his return.\" Ibid. 1 In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as \"removal.\" See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229, 1229a; Judulang v. Holder , 565 U. S. 42, 46 (2011). Congress made \"admission\" the key word, and dened admission to mean \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration ofcer.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. See In re Collado-Munoz, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1061, 1065-1066 (1998) (en banc). 2 Thus, lawful permanent residents returning post- IIRIRA, like Vartelas, may be required to \" 'see[k] an admis\u00ad 1 The dissent appears driven, in no small measure, by its dim view of the Court's opinion in Fleuti. See post, at 280 (\"same instinct\" operative in Fleuti and this case). 2 The BIA determined that the Fleuti doctrine no longer held sway be\u00ad cause it was rooted in the \"no longer existent denition of 'entry' in the [Immigration and Nationality] Act.\" 21 I. & N. Dec., at 1065. The Board also noted that \"Congress . . . amended the law to expressly preserve some, but not all, of the Fleuti doctrine\" when it provided that a lawful permanent resident absent from the United States for less than 180 days would not be regarded as seeking an admission except in certain enumer\u00adated circumstances, among them, prior commission of a crime of moral turpitude. See ibid. (citing 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)). Vartelas does not challenge the ruling in Collado-Munoz. We therefore assume, but do not decide, that IIRIRA's amendments to \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A) abrogated Fleuti. Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 263 Opinion of the Court sion' into the United States, without regard to whether the alien's departure from the United States might previously have been regarded as 'brief, casual, and innocent' under the Fleuti doctrine.\" Id., at 1066. An alien seeking \"admission\" to the United States is sub\u00ad ject to various requirements, see, e. g., \u00a7 1181(a), and cannot gain entry if she is deemed \"inadmissible\" on any of the nu\u00ad merous grounds set out in the immigration statutes, see \u00a7 1182. Under IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents are re\u00adgarded as seeking admission into the United States if they fall into any of six enumerated categories. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C). Relevant here, the fth of these categories covers aliens who \"ha[ve] committed an offense identied in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Offenses in this category include \"a crime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to com\u00admit such a crime.\" \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). In sum, before IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents who had committed a crime of moral turpitude could, under the Fleuti doctrine, return from brief trips abroad with\u00ad out applying for admission to the United States. Under IIRIRA, such residents are subject to admission procedures, and, potentially, to removal from the United States on grounds of inadmissibility. 3 B Panagis Vartelas, born and raised in Greece, has resided in the United States for over 30 years. Originally admitted 3 Although IIRIRA created a uniform removal procedure for both ex\u00ad cludable and deportable aliens, the list of criminal offenses that subject aliens to exclusion remains separate from the list of offenses that render an alien deportable. These lists are \"sometimes overlapping and some\u00adtimes divergent.\" Judulang v. Holder , 565 U. S. 42, 46 (2011). Pertinent here, although a single crime involving moral turpitude may render an alien inadmissible, it would not render her deportable. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (listing deportable crimes). 264 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court on a student visa issued in 1979, Vartelas became a lawful permanent resident in 1989. He currently lives in the New York area and works as a sales manager for a roong company. In 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens, New York. One of his business partners used the shop's photocopier to make counterfeit travelers' checks. Vartelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive any money from the venture. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to con\u00adspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 371. He was sentenced to four months' incar\u00adceration, followed by two years' supervised release. Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United States from these visits remained uneventful. In January 2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration ofcer classied him as an alien seek\u00ading \"admission.\" The ofcer based this classication on Var\u00adtelas' 1994 conviction. See United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 423 (1933) (counterfeiting ranks as a crime of moral turpitude). At Vartelas' removal proceedings, his initial attorney con\u00ad ceded removability, and requested discretionary relief from removal under the former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996). This attorney twice failed to appear for hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief. Vartelas engaged a new attorney, who continued to concede removability and to request discretionary relief. The Immigration Judge de\u00adnied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's decision. In July 2008, Vartelas led with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 265 Opinion of the Court attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA's new \"admission\" provision, codied at \u00a7 1101(a)(13), did not reach back to de\u00adprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion, declaring that Var\u00adtelas had not been prejudiced by his lawyers' performance, for no legal authority prevented the application of IIRIRA to Vartelas' pre-IIRIRA conduct. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit afrmed the BIA's decision, agreeing that Vartelas had failed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys' allegedly ineffective per\u00adformance. Rejecting Vartelas' argument that IIRIRA oper\u00adated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime. See 620 F. 3d 108, 118-120 (2010). In so ruling, the Second Circuit created a split with two other Circuits. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held that the new \u00a7 1101(a)(13) may not be applied to lawful per\u00admanent residents who committed crimes listed in \u00a7 1182 (among them, crimes of moral turpitude) prior to IIRIRA's enactment. See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F. 3d 383 (CA4 2004); Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F. 3d 872 (CA9 2007). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1066 (2011), to resolve the con\u00adflict among the Circuits. II As earlier explained, see supra, at 261-263, pre-IIRIRA, a resident alien who once committed a crime of moral turpitude could travel abroad for short durations without jeopardizing his status as a lawful permanent resident. Under IIRIRA, on return from foreign travel, such an alien is treated as a new arrival to our shores, and may be removed from the United States. Vartelas does not question Congress' au\u00adthority to restrict reentry in this manner. Nor does he con\u00adtend that Congress could not do so retroactively. Instead, 266 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court he invokes the principle against retroactive legislation, under which courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263 (1994). The presumption against retroactive legislation, the Court recalled in Landgraf, \"embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.\" Id., at 265. Several provisions of the Constitution, the Court noted, embrace the doctrine, among them, the Ex Post Facto Clause, the Contract Clause, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Id., at 266. Numerous decisions of this Court repeat the classic formula\u00adtion Justice Story penned for determining when retrospec\u00adtive application of a law would collide with the doctrine. It would do so, Story stated, when such application would \"tak[e] away or impai[r] vested rights acquired under exist\u00ading laws, or creat[e] a new obligation, impos[e] a new duty, or attac[h] a new disability, in respect to transactions or con\u00adsiderations already past.\" Society for Propagation of Gos\u00ad pel v. Wheeler , 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814). See, e. g., INS v. St. Cyr , 533 U. S. 289, 321 (2001) (invoking Story's formulation); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer , 520 U. S. 939, 947 (1997); Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283. 4 Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him, rather than the law that existed at the time of his conviction, would at\u00adtach a \"new disability,\" effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, \"in respect to [events] . . . already past,\" i. e., his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to the passage of IIRIRA. In evaluating Vartelas' argument, we note rst a matter not disputed by 4 The dissent asserts that Justice Story's opinion \"bear[s] no relation to the presumption against retroactivity.\" Post, at 281. That is a bold state\u00ad ment in view of this Court's many references to Justice Story's formulation in cases involving the presumption that statutes operate only prospec\u00adtively in the absence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary. Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 267 Opinion of the Court the Government: Congress did not expressly prescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in question, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13). See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280 (Court asks rst \"whether Congress has expressly prescribed [new \u00a7 1101(a)(13)'s] proper reach\"); Brief for Respondent 11 (Court's holding in INS v. St. Cyr , 533 U. S., at 317-320, \"compels the conclusion that Congress has not 'expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach' \" (quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280)). 5 Several other provisions of IIRIRA, in contrast to \u00a7 1101(a)(13), expressly direct retroactive applica\u00adtion, before, on, or after\" the statute's enactment date (internal quotation marks omitted)). See St. Cyr , 533 U. S., at 319-320, and n. 43 (setting out further examples). Ac\u00adcordingly, we proceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas maintains, application of IIRIRA's travel restraint to him \"would have retroactive effect\" Congress did not au\u00adthorize. See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280. Vartelas presents a rm case for application of the antiret\u00ad roactivity principle. Neither his sentence, nor the immigra\u00adtion law in effect when he was convicted and sentenced, blocked him from occasional visits to his parents in Greece. Current \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), if applied to him, would thus at\u00adtach \"a new disability\" to conduct over and done well before the provision's enactment. Beyond genuine doubt, we note, the restraint \u00a7 1101(a) (13)(C)(v) places on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a \"new disability.\" Once able to journey abroad to fulll religious obligations, attend funerals and weddings of family members, tend to vital nancial interests, or respond to family emergencies, permanent residents situated as Var\u00adtelas is now face potential banishment. We have several 5 In St. Cyr , 533 U. S., at 317-320, we rejected the Government's conten\u00ad tion that Congress directed retroactive application of IIRIRA in its entirety. 268 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court times recognized the severity of that sanction. See, e. g., Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, 365-366, 373-374 (2010). It is no answer to say, as the Government suggests, that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States, his residence for 24 years prior to his 2003 visit to his parents in Greece. See Brief in Opposition 13 (Vartelas \"could have avoided the application of the statute . . . [by] refrain[ing] from de\u00adparting from the United States (or from returning to the United States).\"); post, at 278. Loss of the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, 6 made all the more devastat\u00ad ing if it means enduring separation from close family mem\u00adbers living abroad. See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae 16-23 (describing illustrative cases). We have rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous. In Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), a pathmarking decision, the Court confronted the \"Chinese Restriction Act,\" which barred Chinese laborers from reen\u00adtering the United States without a certicate issued on their departure. The Court held the reentry bar inapplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the Act's passage and tried to return afterward without a certicate. The Act's text, the Court observed, was not \"so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive application] was the intention of the legislature.\" Id., at 559. In Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment to Title VII's ban on employment discrimination authorizing 6 See Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 126 (1958) (\"Freedom of movement across frontiers . . . may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.\"); Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U. S. 500, 519-520 (1964) (Douglas, J., concurring) (right to travel, \"at home and abroad, . . . commingling which gregarious man enjoys\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 269 Opinion of the Court compensatory and punitive damages applied to preenactment conduct. The Court held it did not. No doubt the com\u00adplaint against the employer charged discrimination that vio\u00adlated the Act at the time it occurred. But compensatory and punitive damages were not then available remedies. The later provision for such damages, the Court determined, op\u00aderated prospectively only, and did not apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the amend\u00adment. See 511 U. S., at 280-286. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provision removing an afrmative de\u00adfense to qui tam suits did not apply to preenactment fraud. As in Landgraf, the provision attached \"a new disability\" to past wrongful conduct and therefore could not apply retro\u00adspectively unless Congress clearly manifested such an inten\u00adtion. Hughes Aircraft, 520 U. S., at 946-950. Most recently, in St. Cyr , the Court took up the case of an alien who had entered a plea to a deportable offense. At the time of the plea, the alien was eligible for discretionary relief from deportation. IIRIRA, enacted after entry of the plea, removed that eligibility. The Court held that the IIRIRA provision in point could not be applied to the alien, for it attached a \"new disability\" to the guilty plea and Congress had not instructed such a result. 533 U. S., at 321-323. III The Government, echoed in part by the dissent, argues that no retroactive effect is involved in this case, for the Leg\u00adislature has not attached any disability to past conduct. Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien's post-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States. See Brief for Respondent 19-20; post, at 278. We nd this argument disingenuous. Vartelas' return to the United States occa\u00adsioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for the \"new disability\" imposed on him was not his lawful foreign travel. It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA, of an of\u00adfense qualifying as one of moral turpitude. That past mis\u00ad270 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court conduct, in other words, not present travel, is the wrongful activity Congress targeted in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). The Government observes that lower courts have upheld Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act prose\u00adcutions that encompassed preenactment conduct. See Brief for Respondent 18 (citing United States v. Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416-417 (CA5 1977), and United 2d 352, 364-365 (CA9 1975) (per curiam)). But those prosecutions depended on criminal activity, i. e., an act of racketeering occurring after the provision's effective date. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in contrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct postdating IIRIRA's enactment. Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30 (2006), fea\u00ad tured by the Government and the dissent, Brief for Respond\u00adent 17, 36-37; post, at 278, is similarly inapposite. That case involved 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addition, which provides that an alien who reenters the United States after having been removed can be removed again under the same removal order. We held that the provision could be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before IIRIRA's enact\u00adment. Explaining the Court's decision, we . . . is the predicate action; the . . . . It is to continue his illegal presence . . . after the effective date of the new la[w] that subjects him to the new . . . legal regime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.\" 548 U. S., at 44 (emphasis added). Vartelas, we have several times stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after IIRIRA's passage. He simply took a brief trip to Greece, anticipating a return without in\u00adcident as in past visits to his parents. No \"indenitely con\u00adtinuing\" crime occurred; instead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a pre-IIRIRA crime he was \"helpless to undo.\" Ibid. The Government further refers to lower court decisions in cases involving 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits the Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 271 Opinion of the Court possession of rearms by convicted felons. Brief for Re\u00ad spondent 18-19 (citing United States v. Pfeifer , 371 F. 3d 430, 436 (CA8 2004), and United States v. Hemmings, 258 F. 3d 587, 594 (CA7 2001)). \"[L]ongstanding prohibitions on the possession of rearms by felons,\" District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008), however, target a present danger, i. e., the danger posed by felons who bear arms. See, e. g., Pfeifer , 371 F. 3d, at 436 (hazardous conduct that statute targets \"occurred after enactment of the statute\"); Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, \u00a7 1201, 82 Stat. 236 (noting hazards involved when felons possess rearms). 7 Nor do recidivism sentencing enhancements support the Government's position. Enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense \" 'is not to be viewed as . . . [an] additional penalty for the earlier crimes,' but instead, as a 'stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an 7 The dissent, see post, at 281, notes two statutes of the same genre: laws prohibiting persons convicted of a sex crime against a victim under 16 years of age from working in jobs involving frequent contact with mi\u00adnors, and laws prohibiting a person \"who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution\" from pos\u00adsessing guns, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). The dissent is correct that these statutes do not operate retroactively. Rather, they address dangers that arise postenactment: sex offenders with a history of child molestation working in close proximity to children, and mentally unstable persons pur\u00adchasing guns. The act of flying to Greece, in contrast, does not render a lawful permanent resident like Vartelas hazardous. Nor is it plausible that Congress' solution to the problem of dangerous lawful permanent res\u00adidents would be to pass a law that would deter such persons from ever leaving the United States. As for student loans, it is unlikely that the provision noted by the dis\u00ad sent, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1091(r), would raise retroactivity questions in the rst place. The statute has a prospective thrust. It concerns \"[s]uspension of eligibility\" when a student receiving a college loan commits a drug crime. The suspension runs \"from the date of th[e] conviction\" for speci\u00aded periods, e. g., two years for a second offense of possession. Moreover, eligibility may be restored before the period of ineligibility ends if the student establishes, under prescribed criteria, his rehabilitation. 272 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive one.' \" Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995) (quoting Gryger v. Burke , 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948)). In Vartelas' case, ever, there is no \"aggravated . . . repetitive\" offense. There is, in contrast, no post-IIRIRA criminal offense at all. Var\u00adtelas' travel abroad and return are \"innocent\" acts, see Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 462, burdened only because of his pre-IIRIRA offense. In sum, Vartelas' brief trip abroad post-IIRIRA involved no criminal infraction. IIRIRA disabled him from leaving the United States and returning as a lawful permanent resi\u00addent. That new disability rested not on any continuing criminal activity, but on a single crime committed years be\u00adfore IIRIRA's enactment. The antiretroactivity principle instructs against application of the new proscription to ren\u00adder Vartelas a rst-time arrival at the country's gateway. IV The Second Circuit homed in on the words \"committed an offense\" in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) in determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect. 620 F. 3d, at 119-121. It matters not that Vartelas may have relied on the prospect of continuing visits to Greece in deciding to plead guilty, the court reasoned. \"[I]t would border on the absurd,\" the court observed, \"to suggest that Vartelas com\u00admitted his counterfeiting crime in reliance on the immigra\u00adtion laws.\" Id., at 120. This reasoning is doubly flawed. As the Government acknowledges, \"th[is] Court has not required a party challenging the application of a statute to show [he relied on prior law] in structuring his conduct.\" Brief for Respondent 25-26. In Landgraf, for example, the issue was the retroactivity of compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for employment discrimination. \"[C]oncerns of . . . upsetting expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimination,\" the Court noted, for such discrimination \"has been unlawful for Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 273 Opinion of the Court more than a generation.\" 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. But \"[e]ven when the conduct in question is morally reprehensi\u00adble or illegal,\" the Court added, \"a degree of unfairness is inherent whenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past.\" Id., at 283, n. 35. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court found that Congress' 1986 removal of a defense to a qui tam action did not apply to pre-1986 conduct in light of the presumption against retroac\u00adtivity. 520 U. S., at 941-942. 8 As in Landgraf, the relevant conduct (submitting a false claim) had been unlawful for dec\u00adades. See 520 U. S., at 947. The operative presumption, after all, is that Congress in\u00ad tends its laws to govern prospectively only. See supra, at 265-266. \"It is a strange 'presumption,' \" the Third Circuit commented, \"that arises only on . . . a showing [of] actual reliance.\" Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F. 3d 480, 491 (2004). The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 269-270, is \"whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\" That is just what occurred here. In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immi\u00ad gration law. While the presumption against retroactive ap\u00adplication of statutes does not require a showing of detrimen\u00adtal reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 389-395, reasonable reliance has been noted among the \"familiar considerations\" animating the presumption, see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270 (presumption reflects \"familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\"). Although not a necessary predicate for invoking the antiretroactivity 8 The deleted defense permitted qui tam defendants to escape liability if the information on which a private plaintiff (relator) relied was already in the Government's possession. Detrimental reliance was hardly appar\u00adent, for the Government, both before and after the statutory change, could bring suit with that information, and \"the monetary liability faced by [a False Claims Act] defendant is the same whether the action is brought by the Government or by a qui tam relator.\" 520 U. S., at 948. 274 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Opinion of the Court principle, the likelihood of reliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively. See Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 393 (discussing St. Cyr). St. Cyr is illustrative. That case involved a lawful perma\u00ad nent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable. Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal proceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA, withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary waivers, the Court recognized, \"attache[d] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\" 533 U. S., at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted). Aliens like St. Cyr, the Court observed, \"almost certainly relied upon th[e] likeli\u00adhood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial.\" Id., at 325. 9 Hence, applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an \"obvious and severe retroactive effect.\" Ibid. Be\u00ad cause Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, we held that the prior law, permitting relief from deportation, governed St. Cyr's case. As to retroactivity, one might think Vartelas' case even easier than St. Cyr's. St. Cyr could seek the Attorney Gen\u00aderal's discretionary dispensation. Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an ofcial's permission, to make trips of short duration to see and assist his parents in 9\"There can be little doubt,\" the Court noted in St. Cyr , \"that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.\" 533 U. S., at 322. Indeed, \"[p]reserving [their] right to re\u00admain in the United States may be more important to [them] than any potential jail sentence.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U. S. 356, 366-369 (2010) (holding that counsel has a duty under the Sixth Amendment to inform a noncitizen defendant that his plea would make him eligible for deportation). Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 275 Opinion of the Court Greece.10 The Second Circuit thought otherwise, compound\u00ad ing its initial misperception (treating reliance as essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle). The deporta\u00adtion provision involved in St. Cyr , 8 U. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), re\u00ad ferred the alien's \"convict[ion]\" of a while the statu\u00ad tory words sub judice in Vartelas' case were \"committed an offense,\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v); see supra, at 272. 11 The practi\u00ad cal difference, so far as retroactivity is concerned, escapes from our grasp. Ordinarily, to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an alien has committed a qualifying crime, the immigration ofcer at the border would check the alien's records for a conviction. He would not call into session a piepowder court 12 to entertain a plea or con\u00ad duct a trial. Satised that Vartelas' case is at least as clear as St. Cyr's for declining to apply a new law retroactively, we hold that Fleuti continues to govern Vartelas' short-term travel. 10 Armed with knowledge that a guilty plea would preclude travel abroad, aliens like Vartelas might endeavor to negotiate a plea to a nonex\u00ad cludable offense\u2014in Vartelas' case, e. g., possession of counterfeit securi\u00ad ties\u2014or exercise a right to trial. 11 After the words \"committed an offense,\" \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)'s next words are \"identied in section 1182(a)(2).\" That section refers to \"any alien convicted of, or who admits having committed,\" inter alia, \"a crime involving moral turpitude.\" entire \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) phrase \"committed an offense identied in section 1182(a)(2),\" on straightforward reading, appears to advert to a lawful per\u00admanent resident who has been convicted of an offense under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (or admits to one). 12 Piepowder (\"dusty feet\") courts were temporary mercantile courts held at trade fairs in Medieval Europe; local merchants and guild members would assemble to hear commercial disputes. These courts provided fast and informal resolution of trade conflicts, settling cases \"while the mer\u00adchants' feet were still dusty.\" Callahan, Medieval Church Norms and Fi\u00adduciary Duties in Partnership, 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 215, 235, and n. 99 (2004) (quoting H. Berman, Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition 347 (1983); internal quotation marks omitted). 276 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Scalia, J., dissenting * * * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap\u00ad peals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is re\u00ad manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas and Jus\u00ad tice Alito join, dissenting. As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Congress required that lawful permanent residents who have committed certain crimes seek formal \"admission\" when they return to the United States from abroad. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). This case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Does that statute apply to lawful permanent residents who, like Vartelas, committed one of the specied offenses before 1996, but traveled abroad after 1996? Under the proper approach to determining a statute's temporal ap\u00adplication, the answer is yes. I The text of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not contain a clear statement answering the question presented here. So the Court is correct that this case is governed by our longstand\u00ading interpretive principle that, in the absence of a contrary indication, a statute will not be construed to have retroactive application. See, e. g., Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280 (1994). The operative provision of this text\u2014 the provision that species the act that it prohibits or prescribes\u2014says that lawful permanent residents convicted of offenses similar to Vartelas's must seek formal \"admis\u00adsion\" before they return to the United States from abroad. Since Vartelas returned to the United States after the stat\u00adute's effective date, the application of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a retroactive effect. Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 277 Scalia, J., dissenting In determining whether a statute applies retroactively, we should concern ourselves with the statute's actual operation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns. It is impos\u00adsible to decide whether a statute's application is retrospec\u00adtive or prospective without rst identifying a reference point\u2014a moment in time to which the statute's effective date is either subsequent or antecedent. (Otherwise, the obvious question\u2014retroactive in reference to what?\u2014remains unan\u00adswered.) In my view, the identity of that reference point turns on the activity a statute is intended to regulate. For any given regulated party, the reference point (or \"retroac\u00adtivity event\") is the moment at which the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do what it requires. See Mar\u00ad tin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 362-363 (1999) (Scalia, J., con\u00ad curring in part and concurring in judgment); Landgraf, supra, at 291 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgments). With an identied reference point, the retroactivity analysis is simple. If a person has engaged in the primary regulated activity before the statute's effective date, then the statute's application would be retroactive. But if a person engages in the primary regulated activity after the statute's effective date, then the statute's application is prospective only. In the latter case, the interpretive presumption against retroac\u00adtivity does not bar the statute's application. Under that commonsense approach, this is a relatively easy case. Although the class of aliens affected by \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is dened with respect to past crimes, the regulated activity is reentry into the United States. By its terms, the statute is all about controlling admission at the border. It species six criteria to identify lawful permanent residents who are subject to formal \"admission\" procedures, most of which relate to the circumstances of departure, the trip itself, or reentry. The titles of the statutory sections containing \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) conrm its focus on admission, rather than crime: The provision is located within Title III 278 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Scalia, J., dissenting of IIRIRA (\"Inspection, Apprehension, Detention, Adjudica\u00ad tion, and Removal of Inadmissible and Deportable Aliens\"), under Subtitle A (\"Revision of Procedures for Removal of Aliens\"), and \u00a7 301 (\"Treating Persons Present in the United States Without Authorization as Not Admitted\"). 110 Stat. 3009-575. And the specic subsection issue (\u00a7 301(a), entitled \" Dened\") is an amendment to the denition of \"entry\" in the general \"Denitions\" section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). See ante, at 261-262. The original provision told border ofcials how to regulate admission\u2014not how to punish crime\u2014and the amendment does as well. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) thus has no retroactive effect on Vartelas because the reference point here\u2014Vartelas's read\u00admission to the United States after a trip abroad\u2014occurred years after the statute's effective date. Although Vartelas cannot change the fact of his prior conviction, he could have avoided entirely the consequences of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) by simply remaining in the United States or, having left, re\u00admaining in Greece. That \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) had no effect on Vartelas until he performed a postenactment activity is a clear indication that the statute's application is purely prospective. See Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30, 45, n. 11, 46 (2006) (no retroactive effect where the stat\u00adute in question did \"not operate on a completed preenact\u00adment act\" and instead turned on \"a failure to take timely action that would have avoided application of the new law altogether\"). II The Court avoids this conclusion by insisting that \"past misconduct, . . . not present travel, is the wrongful activity Congress targeted\" in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Ante, at 269-270. That assertion does not, however, have any basis in the stat\u00adute's text or structure, and the Court does not pretend other\u00adwise. Instead, the Court simply asserts that Vartelas's \"lawful foreign travel\" surely could not be the \"reason for Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 279 Scalia, J., dissenting the 'new disability' imposed on him.\" Ante, at 269. But the reason for a prohibition has nothing to do with whether the prohibition is being applied to a past rather than a future act. It may be relevant to other legal inquiries\u2014for exam\u00adple, to whether a legislative act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article I, see, e. g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 92 (2003), or one of the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see, e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487 (1955), or the Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment, see, e. g., Kelo v. New London, 545 U. S. 469, 477-483 (2005), or the Obli\u00ad gation of Contracts Clause in Article I, see, e. g., United States Trust Co. of N. Y . v. New Jersey , 431 U. S. 1, 29 (1977). But it has no direct bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.* The Court's failure to differentiate between the statutory- interpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a provision would make it retroactive and hence presumptively unintended) and the validity question (whether giving cer\u00adtain effect to a provision is unlawful) is on full display in its attempts to distinguish \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) from similar stat\u00adutes. Take, for example, the Court's discussion of the Rack\u00adeteer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). That Act, which targets \"patterns of racketeering,\" ex\u00ad pressly denes those \"patterns\" to include some preenact\u00ad ment conduct. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1961(5). Courts interpret\u00ading RICO therefore need not consider the presumption against retroactivity; instead, the cases cited by the majority *I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a statute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on pre\u00ad enactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative intent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is postenactment\u2014that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in question is preenactment. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380-381 (2005). That is not an issue here. If the statute had expressly made the new \"admission\" rule appli\u00adcable to those aliens with prior convictions, its constitutionality would not be in doubt. 280 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Scalia, J., dissenting consider whether RICO violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v. Brown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416-417 (CA5 1977); 364-365 (CA9 1975) (per curiam). The Government recognized this distinction and cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto Clause rather than the presumption against ret\u00ad roactivity, Brief for Respondent 17-18; the Court evidently does not. The Court's confident assertion that Congress surely would not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas, whose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United States were innocent events, ante, at 269-270, 272, simply begs the question presented in this case. Ignorance, of course, is no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his return was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did not render it unlawful. Since IIRIRA's effective date in 1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed crimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the United States and return without formally seeking \"admission.\" See \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). As a result, Vartelas's numerous trips abroad and \"uneventful\" reentries into the United States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 264, were lawful only if \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to him\u2014 which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute here. The Court's circular reasoning betrays its underlying con\u00ad cern: Because the Court believes that reentry after a brief trip abroad should be lawful, it will decline to apply a statute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal aliens. (The same instinct likely produced the Court's questionable statutory interpretation in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).) The Court's test for retroactivity\u2014asking whether the statute creates a \"new disability\" in \"respect to past events\"\u2014invites this focus on fairness. Understandably so, since it is derived from a Justice Story opinion interpreting a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that forbade retroactive laws\u2014a provision comparable to the Federal Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 281 Scalia, J., dissenting Constitution's ex post facto prohibition and bearing no rela\u00ad tion to the presumption against retroactivity. What is un\u00ad fair or irrational (and hence should be forbidden) has nothing to do with whether applying a statute to a particular act is prospective (and thus presumptively intended) or retroactive (and thus presumptively unintended). On the latter ques\u00adtion, the \"new disability in respect to past events\" test pro\u00advides no meaningful guidance. I can imagine countless laws that, like \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), impose \"new disabilities\" related to \"past events\" and yet do not operate retroactively. For example, a statute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans. See, e. g., 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1091(r)(1). Or laws prohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in certain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 290.95(c) (West Supp. 2012). Or laws prohibit\u00ading those previously committed for mental instability from purchasing guns. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). The Court concedes that it would not consider the last two laws inapplicable to preenactment convictions or commitments. Ante, at 271, n. 7. The Court does not deny that these stat\u00ad utes impose a \"new disability in respect to past events,\" but it distinguishes them based on the reason for their enactment: These statutes \"address dangers that arise postenactment.\" Ibid. So much for the new-disability\u00ad in-respect-to-past-events test; it has now become a new\u00addisability-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-danger test. But why is guarding against future danger the only reason Congress may wish to regulate future action in light of past events? It obviously is not. So the Court must invent yet another doctrine to address my rst example, the law mak\u00ading persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans. According to the Court, that statute differs from \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because it \"has a prospective thrust.\" Ante, at 271, n. 7. I cannot imagine what that means, other than that the statute regulates postenactment conduct. 282 VARTELAS v. HOLDER Scalia, J., dissenting But, of course, so does \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Rather than reconciling any of these distinctions with Justice Story's formulation of retroactivity, the Court leaves to lower courts the unenviable task of identifying new-disabilities-not\u00addesigned-to-guard-against-future-danger-and-also-lacking-a\u00adprospective-thrust. And anyway, is there any doubt that \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is intended to guard against the \"dangers that arise postenact\u00adment\" from having aliens in our midst who have shown them\u00adselves to have proclivity for crime? Must that be rejected as its purpose simply because Congress has not sought to achieve it by all possible means\u2014by ferreting out such dangerous aliens and going through the expensive and lengthy process of deporting them? At least some of the postenactment danger can readily be eliminated by forcing lawful permanent residents who have committed certain crimes to undergo formal \"admission\" procedures at our bor\u00adders. Indeed, by limiting criminal aliens' opportunities to travel and then return to the United States, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) may encourage self-deportation. But all this is irrelevant. The positing of legislative \"purpose\" is always a slippery en\u00adterprise compared to the simple determination whether a statute regulates a future event\u2014and it is that, rather than the Court's pronouncement of some forward-looking reason, which governs whether a statute has retroactive effect. Finally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court's concern about the fairness or rationality of applying \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statutory-interpretation question, that concern is greatly exaggerated. In disregard of a federal statute, convicted criminal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece without ever seeking formal admission at this country's borders. When he was nally unlucky enough to be apprehended, and sought discre\u00adtionary relief from removal under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found that Vartelas had made frequent trips Cite as: 566 U. S. 257 (2012) 283 Scalia, J., dissenting to Greece and had remained there for long periods of time, that he was \"a serious tax evader,\" that he had offered testi\u00admony that was \"close to incredible,\" and that he had not shown hardship to himself or his estranged wife and children should he be removed. See 620 F. 3d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief for Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In decrying the \"harsh penalty\" imposed by this statute on Vartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts. Ante , at 268. But never mind. Under any sensible ap\u00ad proach to the presumption against retroactivity, these fac\u00adtual subtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal applica\u00adtion of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). * * * This case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory inter\u00ad pretation, not broader questions about frustrated expecta\u00adtions or fairness. Our approach to answering that question should be similarly straightforward: We should determine what relevant activity the statute regulates (here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activ\u00adity which occurs after the statute's effective date should be covered (here, post-1996 reentries). If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irrational enough to violate the Constitu\u00adtion, that is another matter entirely, and one not presented here. Our interpretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just that\u2014a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a license to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers more desirable. I respectfully dissent. 284 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION et al. v. COOPER certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1024. Argued November 30, 2011\u2014Decided March 28, 2012 Respondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human immuno\u00ad deciency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical certicates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with HIV . Subse\u00adquently, respondent applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and received long-term disability benets on the basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certicate with the FAA on several occa\u00adsions, each time intentionally withholding information about his condi\u00adtion. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAA's parent agency, launched a joint criminal investigation with the SSA to identify medically unt individuals who had obtained FAA certications. The DOT provided the SSA with the names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had also received disability benets. Respondent's name appeared on the spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his ad\u00admission that he had intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the FAA. His pilot certicate was revoked, and he was indicted for making false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and was ned and sentenced to probation. He then led suit, alleging that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of records held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an ag\u00adgrieved individual to sue for \"actual damages,\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A), if the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act's require\u00adments in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specically, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his con\u00addential medical information had caused him mental and emotional dis\u00adtress. The District Court concluded that the Government had violated the Act. But, nding the term \"actual damages\" ambiguous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which provides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in the Government's favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 285 Syllabus that \"actual damages\" in the Act is not ambiguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress. Held: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for men\u00ad tal or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Government's sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 290-304. (a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, see, e. g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192, and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 290-291. (b) The term \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act is a legal term of art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, \" 'presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,' \" Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise meaning of \"actual damages\" is far from clear. Although the term is sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary harm. Because of the term's chameleon-like quality, it must be consid\u00adered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 291-294. (c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they rst prove at least some \"actual damages,\" \"parallels\" the common-law torts of libel per quod slander, under which plaintiffs can recover \"general dam\u00ad ages\" if they rst prove \"special damages.\" Doe v. Chao , 540 U. S. 614, 625. \"Special damages\" are limited to actual pecuniary loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. \"General damages\" cover non-pecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This parallel sug\u00adgests the possibility that Congress intended the term \"actual damages\" to mean \"special damages,\" thus barring Privacy Act victims from any recovery unless they can rst show some actual pecuniary harm. That Congress would choose \"actual damages\" instead of \"special damages\" is not without precedent, as the terms have occasionally been used in\u00adterchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about the plausibility of con\u00adstruing \"actual damages\" as special damages in the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress' deliberate refusal to allow recovery for \"general damages.\" In common-law defamation and privacy cases, special dam\u00adages is the only category of compensatory damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to authorize general damages, it 286 FAA v. COOPER Syllabus is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the term \"actual dam\u00ad ages\" in the Act to mean special damages for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 294-299. (d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court adopts an in\u00adterpretation of \"actual damages\" limited to proven pecuniary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress' sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly requires. P. 299. (e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) Common-law cases often dene \"actual damages\" to mean all compensatory damages; (2) the elimination of \"general damages\" from the Privacy Act means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress; (3) because some courts have construed \"actual damages\" in similar statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must have intended \"actual damages\" in the Act to include mental and emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act's remedial purpose. None of these argu\u00adments overcomes the sovereign immunity canon. Pp. 299-303. 622 F. 3d 1016, reversed and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.

S. 284 (2012) 287 Opinion of the Court Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. The Privacy Act of 1974, codied in part at 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a, contains a comprehensive and detailed set of re\u00ad quirements for the management of condential records held by Executive Branch agencies. If an agency fails to com\u00adply with those requirements \"in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,\" the Act authorizes the individual to bring a civil action against the agency. \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D). For violations found to be \"intentional or willful,\" the United States is liable for \"actual damages.\" \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A). In this case, we must decide whether the term \"actual damages,\" as used in the Privacy Act, includes damages for mental or emotional distress. We hold that it does not. I The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires pi\u00ad lots to obtain a pilot certicate and medical certicate as a precondition for operating an aircraft. 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 61.3(a), (c) (2011). Pilots must periodically renew their medical cer\u00adticates to ensure compliance with FAA medical standards. See \u00a7 61.23(d). When applying for renewal, pilots must dis\u00adclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they have had, and they must identify any medications they are taking. See 14 CFR pt. 67. Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot since 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human immu\u00adnodeciency virus (HIV) infection and began taking antiret\u00adroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not issue medical certicates to persons with respondent's condition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal of his medical certicate, respondent initially grounded himself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he applied for and received a medical certicate, but he did so without disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He renewed his certicate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004, each time intentionally withholding in\u00adformation about his condition. 288 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court When respondent's health deteriorated in 1995, he applied for long-term disability benets under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 401 et seq. To substantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the Social Security Ad\u00administration (SSA), which awarded him benets for the year from August 1995 to August 1996. In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAA's parent agency, launched a joint criminal investigation with the SSA, known as \"Operation Safe Pilot,\" to identify medically unt individuals who had obtained FAA certica\u00adtions to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names and other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots in northern California. The SSA then compared the list with its own records of benet recipients and compiled a spread\u00adsheet, which it gave to the DOT. The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current medical certicate but had also received disability benets. After reviewing respondent's FAA medical le and his SSA disability le, FAA flight surgeons determined in 2005 that the FAA would not have issued a medical certicate to re\u00adspondent had it known his true medical condition. When investigators confronted respondent with what had been discovered, he admitted that he had intentionally with\u00adheld from the FAA information about his HIV status and other relevant medical information. Because of these fraud\u00adulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent's pilot cer\u00adticate, and he was indicted on three counts of making false statements to a Government agency, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1001. Respondent ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a false ofcial writing, in vio\u00adlation of \u00a7 1018. He was sentenced to two years of probation and ned $1,000. 1 1 Respondent eventually applied for recertication as a pilot. After re\u00ad viewing respondent's medical records, including information about his HIV diagnosis and treatment, the FAA reissued his pilot certicate and medical certicate. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1. Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 289 Opinion of the Court Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter Gov\u00ad ernment) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his records with one another, respondent led suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his con\u00addential medical information, including his HIV status, had caused him \"humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe emotional distress.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a. Notably, he did not allege any pecuniary or economic loss. The District Court granted summary judgment against re\u00ad spondent. 816 F. Supp. 2d 778, 781 (2008). The court con\u00adcluded that the Government had violated the Privacy Act and that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the violation was intentional or willful. 2 But the court held that respondent could not recover damages because he alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic loss. Find\u00ading that the term \"actual damages\" is \"facially ambiguous,\" id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign immunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Government, the court concluded that the Act does not authorize the recovery of damages from the Government for nonpecuniary mental or emotional harm. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010). The court acknowledged that the term \"actual damages\" is a \" 'chameleon' \" in that \"its meaning changes with the specic 2 With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for an agency to disclose a rec\u00ad ord to another agency without the written consent of the person to whom the record pertains. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(b). One exception to this nondis\u00adclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a written request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that maintains the record. See \u00a7 552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could easily have shared respondent's medical records pursuant to the procedures pre\u00adscribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court concluded that they failed to do so. 290 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court statute in which it is found.\" Id., at 1029. But the court nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act, the term includes damages for mental and emotional distress. Look\u00ading to what it described as \"[i]ntrinsic\" and \"[e]xtrinsic\" sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded that the mean\u00ad ing of \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act is not ambiguous and that \"a construction that limits recovery to pecuniary loss\" is not \"plausible,\" id., at 1034. The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing en banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at 1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and we granted review. 564 U. S. 1018 (2011). II Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compensa\u00ad tion from the Government for mental and emotional harm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act waives the Government's sovereign immunity with respect to such a recovery. A We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be \"unequivocally expressed\" in statutory text. See, e. g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a waiver that is not clearly evident from the language of the statute. Lane , supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995), so that the Government's consent to be sued is never enlarged beyond what a fair read\u00ading of the text requires, Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club , 463 U. S. 680, 685-686 (1983) (citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 291 Opinion of the Court not authorize money damages against the Government. Nordic Village , supra, at 34, 37. The question that confronts us here is not whether Con\u00ad gress has consented to be sued for damages under the Privacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which expressly authorizes recovery from the Government for \"ac\u00adtual damages.\" Rather, the question at issue concerns the scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we refuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously expressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities in the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane , supra, at 192. Although this canon of interpretation requires an unmis\u00ad takable statutory expression of congressional intent to waive the Government's immunity, Congress need not state its in\u00adtent in any particular way. We have never required that Congress use magic words. To the contrary, we have ob\u00adserved that the sovereign immunity canon \"is a tool for inter\u00adpreting the law\" and that it does not \"displac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construction.\" Richlin Secu\u00ad rity Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of Congress' waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory text in light of tradi\u00adtional interpretive tools. If it is not, then we take the inter\u00adpretation most favorable to the Government. B The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides that, for any \"intentional or willful\" refusal or failure to comply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for \"actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not dene \"actual damages,\" respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary meaning of the word \"actual\" as it is dened in standard general-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals 292 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court explained, \"actual damages\" is a legal term of art, 622 F. 3d, at 1028, and it is a \"cardinal rule of statutory construction\" that, when Congress employs a term of art, \" 'it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,' \" Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)). Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of \"actual damages\" is far from clear. The latest edition of Black's Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the Pri\u00ad vacy Act dened \"actual damages\" as \"[r]eal, substantial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury, as op\u00adposed on the one hand to 'nominal' damages, and on the other to 'exemplary' or 'punitive' damages.\" Black's Law Diction\u00adary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). But this general (and notably circular) denition is of little value here because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed, the precise meaning of the term \"changes with the specic statute in which it is found.\" 622 F. 3d, at 1029. The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm. Take, for instance, some courts' interpretations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3613(c), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n, 1681o . A number of courts have construed \"actual\" dam\u00ad ages in the remedial provisions of both statutes to include compensation for mental and emotional distress. See, e. g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634, 636-638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages under the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3612, the predecessor to \u00a7 3613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d 380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the FHA \"are not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may include an award for emotional distress and humiliation\"); Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682 F. 2d 509, 513-514 (CA5 1982) (per Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 293 Opinion of the Court curiam) (explaining that, \"[e]ven when there are no out- of-pocket expenses, humiliation and mental distress do con\u00ad stitute recoverable elements of damage\" under the FCRA); Millstone v. O'Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834- 835 (CA8 1976) (approving an award of damages under the FCRA for \"loss of sleep, nervousness, frustration and men\u00adtal anguish\"). In other contexts, however, the term has been used or construed more narrowly to authorize damages for only pecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress au\u00adthorized \"actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2674, \u00b62. At least one court has dened \"actual damages\" in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 101(b) (1970 ed.), as \"the extent to which the market value of a copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an infringement.\" Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d Rieser , 296 F. 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding that \" 'hurt feelings' over the nature of the infringement\" have no place in the actual damages calculus). And some courts have construed \"actual dam\u00adages\" in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78bb(a), to mean \"some form of economic loss.\" Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc., 556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v. Zipf, 645 F. 2d 107, 111 (CA2 1981) (stating that the purpose of \u00a7 78bb(a) \"is to compensate civil plaintiffs for economic loss suffered as a result of wrongs committed in violation of the 1934 Act\"); Herpich v. Wallace , 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5 1970) (noting that the \"gist\" of an action for damages under the Act is \"economic injury\"). 3 3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci\u00ad sions as well. See, e. g., Reist v. Manwiller , 231 Pa. Super. 444, 449, n. 4, 332 A. 2d 518, 520, n. 4 (1974) (explaining that recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed \"despite the total absence of physical injury and actual damages\"); Nalder v. Crest Corp., 93 Idaho 744, 294 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court Because the term \"actual damages\" has this chameleon- like quality, we cannot rely on any all-purpose denition but must consider the particular context in which the term appears. 4 C The Privacy Act directs agencies to establish safeguards to protect individuals against the disclosure of condential records \"which could result in substantial harm, embarrass\u00ad 749, 472 P. 2d 310, 315 (1970) (noting that damages for \"mental anguish\" due to the wrongful execution of a judgment \"are allowable only as an element of punitive but not of actual damages\"). It is also reflected in post-Privacy Act statutes and judicial decisions. See, e. g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 1009(d)(1)(A)(ii) (dening \"actual damages\" in the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 as \"the royalty payments that should have been paid\"); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2318(e)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (calculating \"actual damages\" for purposes of a counterfeit labeling statute in terms of nancial loss); Guz\u00ad man v. Western State Bank of Devils Lake , 540 F. 2d 948, 953 (CA8 1976) (stating that compensatory damages in a civil rights suit \"can be awarded for emotional and mental distress even though no actual damages are proven\"). 4 The dissent criticizes us for noting that the dictionary denition con\u00ad tains an element of circularity. The dissent says that the denition\u2014 \" '[a]ctual damages' compensate for actual injury\"\u2014is of Sotomayor, But dening \"actual\" damages by reference to \"actual\" injury is hardly helpful when our task is to deter\u00admine what Congress meant by \"actual.\" The dissent's reference to the current version of Black's Law Dictionary, which provides that \"actual damages\" can mean \"tangible damages,\" only highlights the term's ambi\u00adguity. See Black's Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009). If \"actual dam\u00adages\" can mean \"tangible damages,\" then it can be construed not to in\u00adclude intangible harm, like mental and emotional distress. Similarly unhelpful is the dissent's citation to a general-purpose dictionary that de\u00adnes \"actual\" as in fact or reality\" and \"damages\" as \"compensa\u00ad tion or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong or injury.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (emphasis added). Combining these two lay denitions says nothing about whether compen\u00adsation for mental and emotional distress is in fact imposed by law . The denitions merely beg the question we are trying to answer. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that \"actual damages\" has taken on different meanings in different statutes, as our examples amply illustrate. Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 295 Opinion of the Court ment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(e)(10); see also \u00a7 2(b), 88 Stat. 1896 (stating that the \"purpose of this Act is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy\"). Because the Act serves interests similar to those protected by defamation and pri\u00advacy torts, there is good reason to infer that Congress relied upon those torts in drafting the Act. In Doe v. Chao , 540 U. S. 614 (2004), we held that the Pri\u00ad vacy Act's remedial provision authorizes plaintiffs to recover a guaranteed minimum award of $1,000 for violations of the Act, but only if they prove at least some \"actual damages.\" Id., at 620, 627; see \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A). Although we did not address the meaning of \"actual damages,\" id., at 622, n. 5, 627, n. 12, we observed that the provision \"parallels\" the re\u00ad medial scheme for the common-law torts of libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover \"general damages,\" but only if they prove \"special harm\" (also known as \"special damages\"), id., at 625; see also 3 Restatement of Torts \u00a7 575, Comments a and b (1938) (hereinafter Restate\u00ad ment); D. Dobbs, ac\u00ad tual pecuniary loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. 1 D. Haggard, Cooley on Torts \u00a7 164, p. 580 (4th ed. 1932) (hereinafter Cooley). 6 \"General damages,\" on the 5 Libel per quod and slander (as opposed to libel and slander per se) apply to a communication that is not defamatory on its face but that is defamatory when coupled with some other extrinsic fact. Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 512-513. 6 See also 575, Comment b (\"Special harm . . . is harm of a material and generally of a pecuniary nature\"); Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 520 (\"Special damages in defamation cases mean pecuniary damages, or at least 'material loss' \" (footnote omitted)). Special damages do not include mental or emotional distress. See 3 Restatement \u00a7 575, Comment c (\"The emotional distress caused to the person slandered by his knowledge that he has been defamed is not special harm and this is so although the dis\u00adtress results in a serious illness\"); Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 520 (\"Even under the 296 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court other hand, cover \"loss of reputation, shame, mortication, injury to the feelings and the like and need not be alleged in detail and require no proof.\" Id., \u00a7 164, at 579. 7 This parallel between the Privacy Act and the common- law torts of libel per quod and slander suggests the possibil\u00ad ity that Congress intended the term \"actual damages\" in the Act to mean special damages. The basic idea is that Privacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slander, are barred from any recovery unless they can rst show actual\u2014 that is, pecuniary or material\u2014harm. Upon showing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they can recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably for any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to use the term \"actual damages\" instead of \"special damages\" was not without prec\u00adedent. The terms had occasionally been used interchange\u00adably. See, e. g., Wetzel v. Gulf Oil Corp., 455 F. 2d 857, 862 (CA9 1972) (holding that plaintiff could not establish libel per quod because he \"did not introduce any valid and sufcient evidence of actual damage\"); Electric Furnace Corp. v. Deer\u00ad ing Milliken Research Corp., 325 F. 2d 761, 765 (CA6 1963) (stating that \"libel per quod standing alone without proof of actual damages . . . will not support a verdict for the plain\u00adtiff \"); M & S Furniture Sales Co. v. Edward J. De Bartolo Corp., 249 Md. 540, 544, 241 A. 2d 126, 128 (1968) (\"In the more modern approach, special damages in defamation cases must be eco\u00ad nomic in nature, and it is not enough that the plaintiff has suffered harm to reputation, mental anguish or other dignitary harm, unless he has also suffered the loss of something having economic value\"). 7 See also id., \u00a7 3.2, at 139 (explaining that noneconomic harms \"are called general damages\"); W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 112, p. 761 (4th ed. 1971) (noting that \" 'general' damages may be recovered for the injury to the plaintiff 's reputation, his wounded feelings and humiliation, and resulting physical illness and pain, as well as estimated future damages of the same kind\" (footnotes omitted)); 3 Restatement \u00a7 621, Comment a (stating that, in actions for defamation, a plaintiff may recover general damages for \"impairment of his reputation or, through loss of reputation, to his other interests\").

Minnesota Tribune Co., 45 Minn. 303, 47 N. W. 781 (1891) (distinguishing \"actual, or, as they are sometimes termed, 'special,' damages\" from \"general damages\u2014that is, damages not pecuniary in their nature\"). 8 Any doubt about the plausibility of construing \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act synonymously with \"special damages\" is put to rest by Congress' refusal to authorize \"general damages.\" In an uncodied section of the Act, Congress established the Privacy Protection Study Commis\u00adsion to consider, among other things, \"whether the Federal Government should be liable for general damages.\" \u00a7 5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat. 1907, note following 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a, p. 84 (1970 ed., Supp. IV). As we explained in Doe, \"Con\u00ad gress left the question of general damages . . . for another day.\" 540 U. S., at 622. Although the Commission later recommended that general damages be allowed, ibid., n. 4, Congress never amended the Act to include them. For that reason, we held that it was \"beyond serious doubt\" that gen\u00aderal damages are not available for violations of the Privacy Act. Id., at 622. By authorizing recovery for \"actual\" but not for \"general\" damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those terms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation and related 8 The dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless im\u00ad precision. Post, at 311, n. 6. But just as we assume that Congress did not act carelessly, we should not be so quick to assume that the courts did. The better explanation for these precedents is not that the courts were careless, but that the term \"actual damages\" has a varied meaning that, depending on the context, can be limited to compensation for only pecuni\u00adary harm. 298 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court dignitary torts, two categories of compensatory damages are recoverable: general damages and special damages. Cooley \u00a7 164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement \u00a7 867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for interference with privacy \"can be awarded in the same way in which general damages are given for defamation\"). 9 Because Congress declined to au\u00ad thorize \"general damages,\" we think it likely that Congress intended \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act to mean spe\u00adcial damages for proven pecuniary loss. Not surprisingly, this interpretation was accepted by the Privacy Protection Study Commission, an expert body au\u00adthorized by Congress and highly sensitive to the Act's goals. The Commission understood \"actual damages\" in the Act to be \"a synonym for special damages as that term is used in defamation cases.\" Personal Privacy in an Information So\u00adciety: The Report of the Privacy Protection Study Commis\u00adsion 530 (July 1977); see also ibid.

Although we are not bound in any way by the Commission's report, we think it conrms the reasonableness of interpreting \"actual damages\" in the unique context of the Privacy Act as the equivalent of special damages. D We do not claim that the contrary reading of the statute accepted by the Court of Appeals and advanced now by re\u00adspondent is inconceivable. But because the Privacy Act waives the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, the question we must answer is whether it is plausible to read the statute, as the Government does, to authorize only dam\u00adages for economic loss. Nordic Village , 503 U. S., at 34, 37. When waiving the Government's sovereign immunity, Con\u00adgress must speak unequivocally. Lane , 518 U. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a consequence, we adopt an interpretation of \"actual damages\" limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress' sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly requires. III None of respondent's contrary arguments sufces to over\u00ad come the sovereign immunity canon. A Respondent notes that the term \"actual damages\" has often been dened broadly in common-law cases, and in our own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief for Respondent 18-25. For example, in Birdsall v. Coolidge , 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we observed that \"[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages mean the same thing.\" Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual injury in the defama\u00ad300 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court tion context \"is not limited to out-of-pocket loss\" and that it customarily includes \"impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\" Id., at 350. These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the unremarkable point that the term \"actual damages\" can include nonpecuniary loss. But this generic meaning does not establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy Act, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for mental and emotional distress. As we already explained, the term \"actual damages\" takes on different meanings in different contexts. B Respondent's stronger argument is that the exclusion of \"general damages\" from the statute simply means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy Act vic\u00adtims can still recover for mental and emotional distress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief for Respond\u00adent 54-56. 10 This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven mental and emotional distress does not count as general damages. The term \"general damages\" is not limited to compensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensation for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement \u00a7 621, Com\u00adment a (noting that general damages compensate for \"harm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof, is assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff 's] reputation\"). To be sure, specic proof of emotional harm is not required to recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs \u00a7 7.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages cannot be recov\u00adered for emotional harm that is actually proved. Aside from the fact that general damages need not be proved, what distinguishes those damages, whether proved 10 The dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 312-314. Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 301 Opinion of the Court or not, from the only other category of compensatory dam\u00ad ages available in the relevant common-law suits is the type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, \"the affront to the plaintiff 's dignity and the emotional harm done\" are \"called general damages, to distinguish them from proof of actual economic harm,\" which is called \"special damages.\" Id., \u00a7 3.2, at 139; see also supra, at 295-296, 298, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general damages is special damages, not all proven damages, as respondent would have it. Because Congress removed \"general damages\" from the Act's remedial provision, it is reasonable to infer that Con\u00adgress foreclosed recovery for nonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and instead waived the Govern\u00adment's sovereign immunity only with respect to harm com\u00adpensable as special damages. C Looking beyond the Privacy Act's text, respondent points to the use of the term \"actual\" damages in the remedial pro\u00advisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3613(c), and the FCRA, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n, 1681o . As previously mentioned, courts have held that \"actual\" damages within the meaning of these statutes include compensation for mental and emotional dis\u00adtress. Supra, at 292-293. Citing the rule of construction that Congress intends the same language in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per cu\u00ad riam), respondent argues that the Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing damages for mental and emo\u00adtional distress. See Brief for Respondent 25-32. Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower court decisions are correct, they provide only weak support for respondent's argument here. Since the term \"actual dam\u00adages\" can mean different things in different contexts, statutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited in\u00ad302 FAA v. COOPER Opinion of the Court terpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither the FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mirrors the Privacy Act. 11 In neither of those statutes did Congress specically decline to authorize recovery for general dam\u00adages as it did in the Privacy Act. Supra, at 297-298. And most importantly, none of the lower court cases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has cited, see Brief for Re\u00adspondent 29-31, involves the sovereign immunity canon. Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA's gen\u00ad eral liability provision does not even use the term \"actual damages.\" It instead provides that the \"United States shall be liable\" for certain tort claims \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual\" under relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2674, \u00b61. For that reason alone, the FTCA's general liability provision is not a reliable source for interpreting the term \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA's wrongful-death provision\u2014which au\u00adthorizes \"actual or compensatory damages, measured injuries resulting from such death,\" \u00a7 2674, \u00b62\u2014 prove that Congress understood the term \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act to include nonpecuniary mental and emo\u00adtional harm. To the contrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood to entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context. Because the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not share the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not a tting analog for construing the Act. 11 Compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 3613(c)(1) (stating that \"the court may award to the plaintiff actual and punitive damages\"); 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681n(a)(1) (au\u00ad thorizing \"(A) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000; or (B) . . . actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or $1,000, whichever is greater\"); \u00a7 1681o(a)(1) (authorizing \"any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure\") with 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A) (authorizing \"actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 303 Opinion of the Court D Finally, respondent argues that excluding damages for mental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results. Persons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would be entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only severe and debilitating mental or emotional distress would get noth\u00ading. See Brief for Respondent 33-35. Contrary to respondent's suggestion, however, there is nothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Government's Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent insists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act's remedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by deliberately refus\u00ading to authorize general damages, Congress intended to cabin relief, not to maximize it. 12 12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps in our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sovereign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment. See post, at 305-306. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our understand\u00ading of the canon's meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges that statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term \"actual damages\" to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 308, and that determining its mean\u00ad ing in a particular statute requires consideration of context, see ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes\u2014as it must in light of our reasoning in Doe v. Chao , 540 U. S. 614 (2004)\u2014that the common law of defamation has rele\u00ad vance in construing the term \"actual damages\" in the Privacy Act. See post, at 310-312. The dissent's argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose of the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the term \"actual damages,\" as used in the Act, means compensatory damages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm. The dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary and nonpecuni\u00adary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the recovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both types of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoidable. The Act de\u00adters violations of its substantive provisions in other ways\u2014for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by imposing criminal sanc\u00adtions for some violations, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(i); and possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 304 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting * * * In sum, applying traditional rules of construction, we hold that the Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize an award of damages for mental or emotional distress. Accord\u00adingly, the Act does not waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or deci\u00ad sion of this case. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting. Congress enacted the Privacy Act of 1974 for the stated purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against Govern\u00adment invasion. To that end, the Act provides a civil remedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain agency misconduct to recover \"actual damages\" sustained as a result of the unlawful action. Today the Court holds that \"actual damages\" is limited to pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer recover what our precedents and common sense understand to be the primary, and often only, damages sustained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely, mental or emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text, structure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples the Act's core purpose of redressing and deterring violations of privacy in\u00adterests. I respectfully dissent. U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706; see Doe, supra, at 619, n. 1 (noting that the absence of equitable relief in suits under \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(C) or \u00a7 552a(g)(1)(D) may be explained by the availability of such relief under the APA). Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 305 Sotomayor, J., dissenting I The majority concludes that \"actual damages\" in the civil- remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery for pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpretation is not compelled by the plain text of the statute or otherwise required by any other traditional tool of statutory interpre\u00adtation. And it candidly acknowledges that a contrary read\u00ading is not \"inconceivable.\" Ante, at 299. Yet because it considers its reading of \"actual damages\" to be \"plausible,\" the majority contends that the canon of sovereign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most favorable to the Government. Ibid. The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority as\u00ad cribes it. \"The sovereign immunity canon is just that\u2014a canon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction.\" Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008) (majority opinion of Alito , J.). Here, traditional tools of statutory construc\u00ad tion\u2014the statute's text, structure, drafting history, and pur\u00adpose\u2014provide a clear answer: The term \"actual damages\" permits recovery for all injuries established by competent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental and emotional dis\u00adtress. There is no need to seek refuge in a canon of con\u00adstruction, see id., at 589-590 (declining to rely on canon as there is \"no ambiguity left for us to construe\" after applica\u00adtion of \"traditional tools of statutory construction and con\u00adsiderations of stare decisis\"), much less one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court's history, see United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 42 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (canon is \"nothing but a judge-made rule that is sometimes favored and sometimes disfavored\" (footnote omitted)) (collecting cases). It bears emphasis that we have said repeatedly that, while \"we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver 306 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting [of sovereign tended,\" \"[n]either . . . should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended.\" United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117-118 (1979) (emphasis added). See also, e. g., Block v. Neal, 460 U. S. 289, 298 (1983) (\"The exemption of the sovereign from suit involves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are not to add to its rigor by renement of construction where consent has been announced\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In the Privacy Act, Congress expressly authorized recovery of \"actual damages\" for certain intentional or willful agency misconduct. The Court should not \"as a self-constituted guardian of the Treasury import immunity back into a stat\u00adute designed to limit it.\" Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 61, 69 (1955). II A \"In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the stat\u00adute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circum\u00adstance, is nished.\" Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992). The language of the civil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act is clear. At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black's Law Dic\u00ad tionary dened \"actual damages\" as \"[r]eal, substantial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury\" and as \"[s]ynonymous with 'compensatory damages.' \" Black's Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter Black's). The majority claims this is a \"general\" and \"notably circular\" def\u00adinition, ante , at 292, but it is unclear why. The denition is plain enough: \"Actual damages\" compensate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous with compensatory dam\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 307 Sotomayor, J., dissenting ages. See Black's 467 (dening \"compensatory damages\" as damages that \"will compensate the injured party for the in\u00adjury sustained, and nothing more; such as will simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or injury\"). 1 There is nothing circular about that denition.2 It is the denition this Court adopted more than a century ago when we recognized that \"[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages mean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be the result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the amount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with the injury suffered.\" Birdsall v. Coolidge , 93 U. S. 64 (1876). It is the denition embraced in current legal dictionaries. See Black's 445 (9th ed. 2009) (dening \"actual damages\" as \"[a]n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages that repay actual losses.\u2014 Also termed compensatory damages; tangible damages; real damages\" (italics omitted)). And it is the denition that ac\u00adcords with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (dening \"actual\" as \"existing in fact or reality\" and \"dam\u00adages\" as \"compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a 1 Black's Law Dictionary also dened \"actual damages\" damages.\" Black's 467. While \"general damages\" has a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander cases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that \"did in fact result from the wrong, directly and proximately,\" Black's 468. 2 The majority declares the denition circular because \"dening 'actual' damages by reference to 'actual' injury is hardly helpful when our task is to determine what Congress meant by 'actual.' \" Ante, at 294, n. 4. \"Ac\u00ad tual injury,\" however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This Court al\u00adready has recognized in the defamation context that \"actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.\" Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the denitions of the terms. See Black's 53, 924 (dening \"actual\" as \"[r]eal; substantial; existing presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed to that which is merely theoretical or possible,\" and \"injury\" as \"[a]ny wrong or damage done to another\"). 308 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting wrong or injury caused by a violation of a legal right\"). Thus, both as a term of art and in its plain meaning, \"actual damages\" connotes compensation for proven injuries or losses. Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven injuries need be pecuniary in nature. The majority discards all this on the asserted ground that \"the precise meaning of the term 'changes with the specic statute in which it is found.' \" Ante, at 292 (quoting 622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is relevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues that Con\u00adgress did not employ a word or phrase in its ordinary mean\u00ading. That well-established interpretive rule cannot, how\u00adever, render irrelevant\u2014as the majority would have it\u2014the ordinary meaning of \"actual damages.\" Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim that \"actual damages\" has no xed meaning undermines\u2014 rather than supports\u2014its holding. Each cited authority in\u00advolves either a statute in which Congress expressly directed that compensation be measured in strictly economic terms, or else a statute (e. g., the Copyright Act of 1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable consequence of a violation of the dened legal interest. 3 Neither factor is present here. Notably absent from the Privacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that \"actual damages\" should be limited to economic loss. And while \" ' \"hurt feelings\" over the nature of the [copyright] infringement' \" may \"have no place in the actual damages calculus\" under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 293 (quoting in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser , 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding that \"hurt feelings\" are equally in\u00advalid in an Act concerned with safeguarding individual pri\u00advacy. Thus, while context is no doubt relevant, the majori\u00ad 3 See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2674; 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 1009(d)(1); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2318(e)(3) (2006 ed., IV); 17 U. S. C. 101(b) (1970 ed.); 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78bb(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 309 Sotomayor, J., dissenting ty's cited authority does little to help its cause in the stated context of this statute. B Indeed, the relevant statutory context\u2014the substantive provisions whose breach may trigger suit under the civil-remedies provision\u2014only reinforces the ordinary meaning of \"actual damages.\" Congress established substantive duties in the Act that are expressly designed to prevent agency conduct resulting in intangible harms to the individual. The Act requires agencies to \"establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards\" to ensure against security breaches that could result in \"substantial harm, embarrassment, in\u00adconvenience, or unfairness to any individual.\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies to \"maintain all rec\u00adords\" used in making a determination about an individual in a manner that is \"reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.\" \u00a7 552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of the Act if it fails, e. g., to main\u00ad tain safeguards protecting against \"embarrassment\"; there is no additional requirement that the pocketbook be im\u00adplicated. An agency's intentional or willful violation of those duties triggers liability for \"actual damages\" under \u00a7 552a(g)(4) in the event of an adverse impact. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(g) (1)(C)-(D), (g)(4). Adopting a permits re\u00ad covery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect between the Act's substantive and remedial provisions. It allows a swath of Government violations to go unremedied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo establishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment and no success\u00adful private action could be taken against it for the harm Con\u00adgress identied. Only an interpretation of \"actual damages\" that permits recovery for nonpecuniary harms harmonizes the Act's substantive and remedial provisions. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (statutory interpreta\u00ad310 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting tion must consider \"the broader context of the statute as a whole\").4 The majority draws a different conclusion from the sub\u00ad stantive provisions of the Privacy Act. It (correctly) infers from them that the Act \"serves interests similar to those protected by defamation and privacy torts.\" Ante , at 295. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao , 540 U. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act's civil-remedies provision \"paral\u00adlels\" the remedial scheme for the common-law torts of def\u00ad amation per quod, which permitted recovery of \"general damages\" (i. e., presumed damages) only if a plaintiff rst establishes \"special damages\" (i. e., monetary loss). 5 Ante , at 295. That \"parallel,\" the majority concludes, \"suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term 'actual dam\u00adages' in the Act to mean special damages.\" Ante , at 296. 4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive relief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(g)(1)(C) and (D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a limited cate\u00adgory of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to a record. See \u00a7\u00a7 552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like respondent, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an intentional or willful viola\u00adtion of the Act will be without a remedy under the majority's reading of \"actual damages.\" 5 As the majority notes, \"general damages\" at common law refers to damages \"presumed\" to accrue from the violation of the legally protected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a7 7.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S., at \"meant monetary loss.\" Dobbs \u00a7 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling within the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to recover \"general damages.\" See Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at 621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod, which per\u00ad mitted recovery only if the plaintiff established \"special damages.\" See Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in defamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary injuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 521; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante , at 295. Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 311 Sotomayor, J., dissenting The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that case was the question whether the Act's civil-suit provision authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award of $1,000 absent proof of some \"actual damages.\" The Court answered in the negative, and in the course of doing so re\u00adplied to the petitioner's argument that there was \"something peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . . only to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages.\" 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the Act's parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting that nothing was \"peculiar\" about the Act's remedial scheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that \"actual damages\" means economic loss alone. Indeed, it expressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12. The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the Act's parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest Congress intended \"actual damages\" to mean \"special dam\u00adages.\" Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress \"would probably have known about\" defamation per quod actions, id., at 625, makes it all the more signicant that Congress did not write \"special damages\" in the civil-remedies provision. This Court is typically not in the business of substituting words we think Congress intended to use for words Con\u00adgress in fact used. Yet that is precisely what the majority does when it rewrites \"actual damages\" to mean \"special damages.\" 6 In sum, the statutory context, and in particu\u00ad lar the Act's substantive provisions, conrms the ordinary meaning of \"actual damages.\" Although the Act shares par\u00adallels with common-law defamation torts, such analogies do 6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used \"actual damages\" in place of \"special damages\" to note that Congress would not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the latter. Ante, at 297-298. But that a handful of lower courts on occasion have been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis to assume the Legis\u00adlature has been equally careless in the text of a statute. 312 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting not warrant a reading of the phrase that is at odds with the statute's plain text.7 C An uncodied provision of the Act, tied to the Act's draft\u00ad ing history, also reinforces the ordinary meaning of \"actual damages.\" As the majority notes, prior to reconciliation, the Senate and House bills contained civil-remedies provi\u00adsions that were different in a critical respect: The Senate bill allowed for the recovery of \"actual and general damages,\" whereas the House bill allowed for the recovery of \"actual damages\" alone. 8 In the reconciliation process, the provi\u00ad sion for \"general damages\" was dropped and an uncodied section of the Act was amended to require the newly estab\u00adlished Privacy Protection Study Commission to consider, among its other jobs, \"whether the Federal Government should be liable for general damages incurred by an individ\u00adual as the result of a willful or intentional violation of the provisions of sections 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D).\" \u00a7 5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat. 1907; see also Doe, 540 U. S., at 622. As the Court explained in Doe, \"[t]he deletion of 'general damages' from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate elimi\u00adnation of any possibility of imputing harm and awarding pre\u00adsumed damages.\" Id., at 623; see also id., at 622, n. 5 (\"Con\u00ad gress explicitly rejected the proposal to make presumed 7 There is yet another flaw in the majority's reasoning. At common law a plaintiff who successfully established \"special damages\" in an action for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for emotional and mental distress. See ante , at 295; n. 5, supra. If \"Congress intended the term 'actual damages' in the Act to mean special damages,\" ante , at 296, then an individual who successfully establishes some pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act\u2014presumably as trivial as the cost of a bottle of Tylenol\u2014should be permitted to recover for emotional and mental dis\u00adtress. The majority, of course, does not accept that result, and its piece\u00admeal embrace of the common law undermines its assertion that Congress intended \"special damages\" in place of Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 313 Sotomayor, J., dissenting damages available for Privacy Act violations\"). The elimi\u00ad nation of presumed damages from the bill can only reason\u00adably imply that what Congress left behind\u2014\"actual dam\u00adages\"\u2014comprised damages that are not presumed, i. e., damages proved by competent evidence in the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 349-350 (1974) (dis\u00ad tinguishing in defamation context between presumed dam\u00adages and damages for actual injuries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which include \"impairment of reputa\u00adtion and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\"); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262-264 (1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and proven damages for mental and emotional distress). Rather than view the deletion of general damages (pre\u00ad sumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven damages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a subset of proven damages\u2014those of an economic nature, i. e., \"spe\u00ad cial damages.\" Once again, however, the majority's insist\u00adence that \"Congress intended 'actual damages' in the Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecuniary loss,\" ante, at 298, nds no basis in the statutory text, see supra, at 311-312. And its response to the conclusion that Congress retained recovery for proven damages when it eliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying. The majority declares such a conclusion \"flawed\" because \"general dam\u00adages\" \"includes compensation for proven injuries as well,\" so that \"what distinguishes [general] damages, whether proved or not, from the only other category of compensatory dam\u00adages available in the relevant common-law suits is the type of harm\" the term encompasses\u2014which the majority takes to be emotional harm alone. Ante , at 300-301. That asser\u00ad tion is defective on two scores. First, a plaintiff 's ability to present proof of injury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for such proven injury) does not alter the denition of \"general damages,\" which we already explained in Doe 314 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting means \"presumed damages.\" 540 U. S., at 621; see also id., at 623; n. 5, supra. Second, \"general damages\" is not limited to a \"type\" of harm. The majority's contrary assertion that the term permits recovery only for emotional \"types\" of harm overlooks the fact that \"general damages are partly based on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable pecuniary losses.\" Dobbs \u00a7 7.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It thus was established at common law that in a defamation per se action, \"the plaintiff is usually free to prove whatever actual pecuniary loss he can,\" and \"the jury may be permit\u00adted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the tip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more unproven, and award damage accordingly.\" Ibid. At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following syllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in defamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery for \"general damages,\" it must have meant to retain recov\u00adery only for \"special damages.\" That syllogism, of course, ignores that there is another category of damages. It is the very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy Act: \"actual damages.\" However much Congress may have drawn \" 'parallels,' \" ante , at 295, between the Act and the common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that Congress expressly chose not to use the words \"special damages.\" 9 D I turn nally to the statute's purpose, for \"[a]s in all cases of statutory construction, our task is to interpret the words of th[e] statut[e] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\" Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organiza\u00ad tion, 441 U. S. 600, 608 (1979); see also Dolan v. Postal Serv\u00ad 9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study Commission in support of its interpretation of \"actual damages.\" The majority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratex\u00adtual material is due any deference; nor do I nd its unelaborated conclu\u00adsions persuasive. Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 315 Sotomayor, J., dissenting ice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (\"Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, con\u00ad sidering the purpose and context of the statute, and consult\u00ading any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\"). The purposes of the Privacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent with interpreting \"actual damages\" according to its ordinary meaning. \"The historical context of the Act is important to an under\u00ad standing of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Congress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance and investi\u00adgation of individuals by federal agencies that had been ex\u00ad posed during the Watergate scandal.\" Dept. of Justice, Of\u00adce of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974, p. 4 (2010). In particular, Congress recognized that \"the increasing use of computers and sophisticated in\u00adformation technology . . . has greatly magnied the harm to individual privacy that can occur from any collection, main\u00adtenance, use, or dissemination of personal information.\" \u00a7 2(a)(2), 88 Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to privacy as \"a personal and fundamental right,\" Congress found it \"nec\u00adessary and proper\" to enact the Privacy Act \"in order to protect the privacy of individuals identied in information systems maintained by Federal agencies.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2(a)(4), (5), ibid. Congress explained that the \"purpose of this Act is to pro\u00ad vide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,\" inter alia, \"be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a result of willful or intentional action which violates any individual's rights under this Act.\" \u00a7 2(b)(6), ibid. (emphasis added). That statement is an explicit reference to suits brought under \u00a7 552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a civil suit based on \"willful or intentional\" agency misconduct. It signals un\u00admistakably congressional recognition that the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing the Act's purposes. 316 FAA v. COOPER Sotomayor, J., dissenting Reading \"actual damages\" to permit recovery for any in\u00ad jury established by competent evidence in the record\u2014pecu\u00ad niary or not\u2014best effectuates the statute's basic purpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result in economic loss, we have recognized time and again that the primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes mental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (\"In the 'right of privacy' cases the pri\u00admary damage is the mental distress\"); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (\"[A]ctual injury\" in defamatory falsehood cases \"is not limited to out-of-pocket loss. Indeed, the more cus\u00ad tomary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory false\u00adhood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\"). Accord, 2 Dobbs \u00a7 7.1(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a dignitary interest, and \"in a great many of the cases\" in which the interest is invaded \"the only harm is the affront to the plaintiff 's dignity as a human being, the dam\u00adage to his self-image, and the resulting mental distress\"). That accords with common sense. In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not forget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect privacy. The majority's reading of \"actual damages\" renders the re\u00admedial provision impotent in the face of concededly unlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely nonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Congress' stated pur\u00adpose. The majority, however, does not grapple with the ramications of its opinion. It acknowledges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd results as it allows individu\u00adals suffering relatively minor pecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering severe mental anguish to re\u00adcover nothing. But it concludes that \"there is nothing ab\u00adsurd about a scheme that limits the Government's Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.\" Ante, at 303. Perhaps; it is cer\u00ad tainly within Congress' prerogative to enact the statute the Cite as: 566 U. S. 284 (2012) 317 Sotomayor, J., dissenting majority envisions, namely, one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of privacy without remedying the primary harm that results from invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is that one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the statute before us that Congress intended such a result. Nowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint that it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of remedy than debilitating mental distress, and the majority's contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emotional harm caused by an invasion of the personal in\u00adtegrity that privacy protects. * * * After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial the resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by a fed\u00aderal agency's intentional or willful violation of the Privacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she is able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result Congress intended when it enacted an Act with the express purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against Government inva\u00adsion. And it is not a result remotely suggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of the Act. For those rea\u00adsons, I respectfully dissent. 318 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 10-945. Argued October 12, 2011\u2014Decided April 2, 2012 Petitioner was arrested during a trafc stop by a New Jersey state trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a bench warrant issued for petitioner's arrest after he failed to appear at a hearing to enforce a ne. He was initially detained in the Burlington County De\u00adtention Center and later in the Essex County Correctional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the ne had been paid. At the rst jail, petitioner, like every incoming detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed. Petitioner claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. At the second jail, petitioner, like other arriving detain\u00adees, had to remove his clothing while an ofcer looked for body mark\u00adings, wounds, and contraband; had an ofcer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, ngers, hands, armpits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his clothes examined. Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting. He led a 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 action in the Federal Dis\u00adtrict Court against the government entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive searches unless prison ofcials have reason to suspect conceal\u00adment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband. The court granted him summary judgment, ruling that \"strip-searching\" nonindictable offend\u00aders without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment. The Third Circuit reversed. Held: The judgment is afrmed. 621 F. 3d 296, afrmed. Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV , concluding that the search procedures at the county jails struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions, and thus the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner proposes. Pp. 326338, 339340. Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 319 Syllabus (a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the expertise of correctional ofcials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to problems. A regulation impinging on an inmate's constitutional rights must be upheld \"if it is reasonably re\u00adlated to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78, 89. This Court, in Bell v. Wolsh, 441 U. S. 520, 558, upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional facilities \"to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search con\u00adducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institu\u00adtion[s],\" deferring to the judgment of correctional ofcials that the in\u00adspections served not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items. In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586587, the Court upheld a general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling threat posed by such visits and the difculty of carving out exceptions for certain detainees. The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 522523, also recognized that deter\u00ad ring the possession of contraband depends in part on the ability to con\u00adduct searches without predictable exceptions when it upheld the consti\u00adtutionality of random searches of inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is concealing a prohibited item. These cases establish that correctional ofcials must be permitted to devise reason\u00adable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and that \"in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the ofcials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judg\u00adment in such matters,\" Block, supra, at 584-585. Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to be processed at jails. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354. Pp. 326330. (b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives in\u00ad volved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband. Cor\u00adrectional ofcials have a signicant interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake process. The admission of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee population, and the new detainees themselves. Ofcials therefore must screen for conta\u00adgious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. It may be difcult to identify and treat medical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual inspection. Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving them reasonable justi\u00adcation for a visual inspection of detainees for signs of gang afliation 320 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Syllabus as part of the intake process. Additionally, correctional ofcials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and other prohibited items new de\u00adtainees may possess. Drugs can make inmates aggressive toward of\u00adcers or each other, and drug trading can lead to violent confrontations. Contraband has value in a jail's culture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods can lead to violence, extortion, and disor\u00adder. Pp. 330334. (c) Petitioner's proposal\u2014that new detainees not arrested for serious crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from inva\u00adsive searches unless they give ofcers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding contraband\u2014is unworkable. The seriousness of an of\u00adfense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be difcult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the proposed ex\u00ademption. Even persons arrested for a minor offense may be coerced by others into concealing contraband. Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and result in more contraband being brought into the deten\u00adtion facility. It also may be difcult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search. Jail ofcials know little at the outset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about his iden\u00adtity. The ofcers conducting an initial search often do not have access to criminal history records. And those records can be inaccurate or incomplete. Even with accurate information, ofcers would encounter serious implementation difculties. They would be required to deter\u00admine quickly whether any underlying offenses were serious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol. Other possible classica\u00adtions based on characteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory applica\u00adtion. To avoid liability, ofcers might be inclined not to conduct a thor\u00adough search in any close case, thus creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population. While the restrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy of some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not re\u00adquire adoption of the proposed framework. Pp. 334338, 339. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV . Roberts, C.

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, ex\u00ad cept as to Part IV .* Correctional ofcials have a legitimate interest, indeed a responsibility, to ensure that jails are not made less secure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on their bod\u00adies. Facility personnel, other inmates, and the new detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these threats are intro\u00adduced into the jail population. This case presents the ques\u00adtion of what rules, or limitations, the Constitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who are to be held in jail while their cases are being processed. The term \"jail\" is used here in a broad sense to include prisons and other de\u00adtention facilities. The specic measures being challenged will be described in more detail; but, in broad terms, the controversy concerns whether every detainee who will be admitted to the general population may be required to un\u00addergo a close visual inspection while undressed. The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court has sufcient expertise and information in the record to mandate, under the Constitution, the specic restrictions and limitations sought by those who challenge the visual search procedures at issue.

S. 318 (2012) 323 Opinion of the Court rectional officials unless the record contains substantial evidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or unjus\u00adtied response to problems of jail security. That necessary showing has not been made in this case. I In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, peti\u00ad tioner Albert Florence was arrested after fleeing from police ofcers in Essex County, New Jersey. He was charged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly weapon. Peti\u00adtioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser offenses and was sentenced to pay a ne in monthly installments. In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments and failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. He paid the outstanding balance less than a week later; but, for some unexplained reason, the warrant re\u00admained in a statewide computer database. Two years later, in Burlington County, New Jersey, peti\u00ad tioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile by a state trooper. Based on the outstanding warrant in the computer system, the ofcer arrested petitioner and took him to the Burlington County Detention Center. He was held there for six days and then was transferred to the Essex County Correctional Facility. It is not the arrest or con\u00adnement but the search process at each jail that gives rise to the claims before the Court. Burlington County jail procedures required every arrestee to shower with a delousing agent. Ofcers would check ar\u00adrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as they disrobed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a-56a. Petitioner claims he was also instructed to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. (It is not clear whether this last step was part of the normal practice. See ibid.) Petitioner shared a cell with at least one other person and interacted with other inmates following his admission to the jail. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. 324 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court The Essex County Correctional Facility, where petitioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail in New Jersey. App. 70a. It admits more than 25,000 inmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at any given time. When petitioner was transferred there, all arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and waited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search. When they left the holding cell, they were instructed to remove their clothing while an ofcer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband. Apparently without touching the detain\u00adees, an ofcer looked at their ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, ngers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings. Id., at 57a-59a; App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a-144a. This policy applied regardless of the circumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the detainee's behavior, demeanor, or criminal history. Petitioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough in a squatting position as part of the process. After a mandatory shower, during which his clothes were inspected, petitioner was admitted to the facility. App. 3a-4a, 52a, 258a. He was released the next day, when the charges against him were dismissed. Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated the jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants. The suit was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Seeking relief under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that persons ar\u00adrested for a minor offense could not be required to remove their clothing and expose the most private areas of their bod\u00adies to close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process. Rather, he contended, ofcials could conduct this kind of search only if they had reason to suspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs, or other contraband. The District Court certied a class of individuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense under New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington County or Essex County Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 325 Opinion of the Court jail, and directed to strip naked even though an ofcer had not articulated any reasonable suspicion they were conceal\u00ading contraband. After discovery, the court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the unlawful search claim. It con\u00adcluded that any policy of \"strip searching\" nonindictable of\u00adfenders without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the procedures described by the District Court struck a rea\u00adsonable balance between inmate privacy and the security needs of the two jails. 621 F. 3d 296 (2010). The case pro\u00adceeds on the understanding that the ofcers searched detain\u00adees prior to their admission to the general population, as the Court of Appeals seems to have assumed. See id., at 298, 311. Petitioner has not argued this factual premise is incorrect. The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on le, and some cases of this Court refer to a \"strip search.\" The term is imprecise. It may refer simply to the instruction to re\u00admove clothing while an ofcer observes from a distance of, say, ve feet or more; it may mean a visual inspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it may include directing detainees to shake their heads or to run their hands through their hair to dislodge what might be hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise arms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the ears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to cough in a squatting position. In the instant case, the term does not include any touching of un\u00adclothed areas by the inspecting ofcer. There are no allega\u00adtions that the detainees here were touched in any way as part of the searches. The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing con\u00ad clusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires cor\u00adrectional ofcials to exempt some detainees who will be ad\u00admitted to a jail's general population from the searches here 326 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court at issue. This Court granted certiorari to address the ques\u00ad tion. 563 U. S. 917 (2011). II The difculties of operating a detention center must not be underestimated by the courts. Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78, 84-85 (1987). Jails (in the stricter sense of the term, excluding prison facilities) admit about 13 million inmates a year. See, e. g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010\u2014Statistical Tables 2 (2011). The largest facilities process hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be crowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation, or because of detainees arriv\u00ading from other jurisdictions. Maintaining safety and order at these institutions requires the expertise of correctional ofcials, who must have substantial discretion to devise rea\u00adsonable solutions to the problems they face. The Court has conrmed the importance of deference to correctional of\u00adcials and explained that a regulation impinging on an in\u00admate's constitutional rights must be upheld \"if it is reason\u00adably related to legitimate penological 539 U. S. 126, 131-132 (2003). But see Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 510- 511 (2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classications). The Court's opinion in Bell v. Wolsh, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), is the starting point for understanding how this framework applies to Fourth Amendment challenges. That case ad\u00addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees in any cor\u00adrectional facility run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons \"to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a per\u00adson from outside the institution.\" Id., at 558. Inmates at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City argued there was no security justication for these searches. Ofcers searched guests before they entered the visiting room, and the inmates were under constant surveil\u00adlance during the visit. Id., at 577-578 (Marshall, J., dissent\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 327 Opinion of the Court ing). There had been but one instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak contraband back into the facility. See id., at 559 (majority opinion). The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy. It deferred to the judgment of correc\u00adtional ofcials that the inspections served not only to dis\u00adcover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items inside. Id., at 558. The Court explained that there is no mechanical way to determine whether intrusions on an inmate's privacy are reasonable. Id., at 559. The need for a particular search must be bal\u00adanced against the resulting invasion of personal rights. Ibid. Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and pris\u00ad ons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell. In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the Court concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could ban all contact visits because of the threat they posed: \"They open the institution to the introduction of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can easily con\u00adceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contraband in count\u00adless ways and pass them to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And these items can readily be slipped from the clothing of an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors permitted close contact with inmates.\" Id., at 586. There were \"many justications\" for imposing a general ban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain detainees. Id., at 587. Among other problems, it would be \"a difcult if not impossible task\" to identify \"inmates who have propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.\" Ibid. This was made \"even more difcult by the brevity of detention and the constantly changing nature of the inmate population.\" Ibid. The Court has also recognized that deterring the posses\u00ad sion of contraband depends in part on the ability to con\u00ad328 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court duct searches without predictable exceptions. In Hudson v. Palmer , 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question whether prison ofcials could perform random searches of inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect a particular individual of concealing a prohibited item. Id., at 522-523. The Court upheld the constitutionality of the practice, recognizing that \" '[f]or one to advocate that prison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an enunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at a particular inmate is to ignore the realities of prison operation.' \" Id., at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)). Inmates would adapt to any pattern or loopholes they discovered in the search protocol and then undermine the security of the institution. 468 U. S., at 529. These cases establish that correctional ofcials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities. See Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (\"[M]aintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of retained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees\"). The task of determining whether a policy is reasonably related to legitimate security interests is \"pecu\u00adliarly within the province and professional expertise of cor\u00adrections ofcials.\" Id., at 548. This Court has repeated the admonition that, \" 'in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the ofcials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should ordi\u00adnarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.' \" Block, supra, at 584-585; Bell, supra, at 548. In many jails ofcials seek to improve security by requir\u00ad ing some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be de\u00adtained. These procedures have been used in different places throughout the country, from Cranston, Rhode Island, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho. See Roberts v. Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 329 Opinion of the Court Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 108-109 (CA1 2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d 393, 394 (CA10 1993); Giles v. Acker\u00ad man, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984) (per curiam); see also, e. g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San Francisco , 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Francisco, Cal.); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11 2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Crouch, 872 F. 2d 1248, (Jefferson Cty., 804 F. 2d 796, 797-798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty., N. Y .); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5 1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.). Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the de\u00ad tainees processed at these facilities. This is, in part, a consequence of the exercise of state authority that was the subject of Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001). At- water addressed the perhaps more fundamental question of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in the rst place. The case involved a woman who was arrested after a police ofcer noticed neither she nor her children were wearing their seatbelts. The arrestee argued the Fourth Amendment prohibited her custodial arrest without a war\u00adrant when an offense could not result in jail time and there was no compelling need for immediate detention. Id., at 346. The Court held that a Fourth Amendment restriction on this power would put ofcers in an \"almost impossible spot.\" Id., at 350. Their ability to arrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the precise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat offender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling need to detain someone. Id., at 348-349. The Court rejected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred custodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of constitutional law. It ruled, based on established principles, that ofcers may make an arrest based upon probable cause to believe the person has com\u00admitted a criminal offense in their presence. See id., at 354. The Court stated that \"a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards requiring sensitive, 330 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court case-by-case determinations of government need, lest every discretionary judgment in the eld be converted into an occa\u00adsion for constitutional review.\" Id., at 347. Atwater did not address whether the Constitution imposes special restrictions on the searches of offenders suspected of committing minor offenses once they are taken to jail. Some Federal Courts of Appeals have held that corrections ofcials may not conduct a strip search of these detainees, even if no touching is involved, absent reasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. 621 F. 3d, at 303-304, and n. 4. The Courts of Appeals to address this issue in the last dec\u00adade, however, have come to the opposite conclusion. See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame v. Dillard, 637 F. 3d 380 (CADC 2011); Powell, supra; Bull, supra. The current case is set against this precedent and governed by the principles an\u00adnounced in Turner and Bell. III The question here is whether undoubted security impera\u00ad tives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the more invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband. The Court has held that deference must be given to the ofcials in charge of the jail unless there is \"substantial evidence\" demonstrating their response to the situation is exaggerated. Block, 468 U. S., at 584-585 (internal quotation marks omitted). Peti\u00ad tioner has not met this standard, and the record provides full justications for the procedures used. A Correctional ofcials have a signicant interest in conduct\u00ad ing a thorough search as a standard part of the intake proc\u00adess. The admission of inmates creates numerous risks for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee himself or herself. The danger of introducing Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 331 Opinion of the Court lice or contagious infections, for example, is well docu\u00ad mented. See, e. g., Deger & Quick, The Enduring Menace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention in a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174-175, 177-178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and Prisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007). The Federal Bureau of Prisons recommends that staff screen new detain\u00adees for these conditions. See Clinical Practice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clinical Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011). Persons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries requiring immediate medical attention. It may be difcult to identify and treat these problems until detainees remove their clothes for a vis\u00adual inspection. See Prison and Jail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P. Carlson & G. Garrett eds., 2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Carlson & Garrett). Jails and prisons also face grave threats posed by the in\u00ad creasing number of gang members who go through the intake process. See Brief for Policemen's Benevolent Asso\u00adciation, Local 249, et al. as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief); New Jersey Comm'n of Investigation, Gangland Behind Bars: How and Why Organized Criminal Street Gangs Thrive in New Jersey's Prisons . . . And What Can Be Done About It 10-11 (2009). \"Gang rivalries spawn a climate of tension, violence, and coercion.\" Carlson & Gar\u00adrett 462. The groups recruit new members by force, engage in assaults against staff, and give other inmates a reason to arm themselves. Ibid. Fights among feuding gangs can be deadly, and the ofcers who must maintain order are put in harm's way. PBA Brief 17. These considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify a visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of gang afliation as part of the intake process. The identication and isolation of gang members before they are admitted protects everyone in the facility. Cf. Fraise v. Terhune , 283 F. 3d 506, 509-510 (CA3 332 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court 2002) (Alito, J.) (describing a statewide policy authorizing the identication and isolation of gang members in prison). Detecting contraband concealed by new detainees, fur\u00ad thermore, is a most serious responsibility. Weapons, drugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a jail. Cf. Hud\u00ad son, 468 U. S., at 528 (recognizing \"the constant ght against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit drugs, and other contraband\"). Correctional ofcers have had to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor blades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their person, including in their body cavities. See Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 967, 969; Brief for New Jersey County Jail Wardens Association as Amicus Curiae 17-18 (hereinafter New Jersey Wardens Brief ). They have also found crack, heroin, and marijuana. Brief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici Curiae 9-11 (hereinafter San Francisco Brief). The use of drugs can embolden inmates in aggression toward ofcers or each other; and, even apart from their use, the trade in these substances can lead to violent confrontations. See PBA Brief 11. There are many other kinds of contraband. The textbook denition of the term covers any unauthorized item. See Prisons: Today and Tomorrow 237 (J. Pollock ed. 1997) (\"Con\u00adtraband is any item that is possessed in violation of prison rules. Contraband obviously includes drugs or weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even some types of clothing\"). Everyday items can undermine security if intro\u00adduced into a detention facility: \"Lighters and matches are re and arson risks or poten\u00adtial weapons. Cell phones are used to orchestrate vio\u00adlence and criminality both within and without jailhouse walls. Pills and medications enhance suicide risks. Chewing gum can block locking devices; hairpins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and weapons.\" New Jersey Wardens Brief 8-9. Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 333 Opinion of the Court Something as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a signi\u00ad cant danger. Inmates commit more than 10,000 assaults on correctional staff every year and many more among them\u00adselves. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and Federal Correc\u00adtional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003). Contraband creates additional problems because scarce items, including currency, have value in a jail's culture and underground economy. Correctional officials inform us \"[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence, extor\u00adtion, and disorder.\" New Jersey Wardens Brief 2. Gangs exacerbate the problem. They \"orchestrate thefts, commit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take the contra\u00adband from the weak.\" Id., at 9-10. This puts the entire facility, including detainees being held for a brief term for a minor offense, at risk. Gangs do coerce inmates who have access to the outside world, such as people serving their time on the weekends, to sneak things into the jail. Id., at 10; see, e. g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect Has Term To Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005, p. B1 (\"Weekend-only jail sentences are a common punishment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . . \"). These inmates, who might be thought to pose the least risk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into jail. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10. Concealing contraband often takes little time and effort. It might be done as an ofcer approaches a suspect's car or during a brief commotion in a group holding cell. Some\u00adthing small might be tucked or taped under an armpit, be\u00adhind an ear, between the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the mouth or some other body cavity. It is not surprising that correctional ofcials have sought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease, gang af\u00adliation, and contraband. Jails are often crowded, unsani\u00adtary, and dangerous places. There is a substantial interest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own will or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or work at these 334 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court institutions at even greater risk when he is admitted to the general population. B Petitioner acknowledges that correctional ofcials must be allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake process and that this will require at least some detainees to lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position. These procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are designed to uncover contraband that can go undetected by a patdown, metal detector, and other less invasive searches. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23 (hereinafter United States Brief); New Jersey Wardens Brief 19, n. 6. Peti\u00adtioner maintains there is little benet to conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee who has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any offense involving a weapon or drugs. In his view these detainees should be ex\u00adempt from this process unless they give ofcers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding contraband. It is reason\u00adable, however, for correctional ofcials to conclude this standard would be unworkable. The record provides evi\u00addence that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband and that it would be difcult in prac\u00adtice to determine whether individual detainees fall within the proposed exemption. 1 People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be the most devious and dangerous criminals. Cf. Clements v. Logan, 454 U. S. 1304, 1305 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., in cham\u00adbers) (deputy at a detention center shot by misdemeanant who had not been strip searched). Hours after the Okla\u00adhoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a state trooper who noticed he was driving without a license plate. Johnston, Suspect Won't Answer Any Questions, N. Y . Times, Apr. 25, 1995, p. A1. Police stopped serial killer Joel Rifkin for the same reason. McQuiston, Confes\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 335 Opinion of the Court sion Used To Portray Rifkin as Methodical Killer, N. Y . Times, Apr. 26, 1994, p. B6. One of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks was stopped and ticketed for speeding just two days before hijacking Flight 93. The Terrorists: Hijacker Got a Speeding Ticket, N. Y . Times, Jan. 8, 2002, p. A12. Reasonable correctional ofcials could con\u00adclude these uncertainties mean they must conduct the same thorough search of everyone who will be admitted to their facilities. Experience shows that people arrested for minor offenses have tried to smuggle prohibited items into jail, sometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for the concealment. They may have some of the same incentives as a serious criminal to hide contraband. A detainee might risk carry\u00ading cash, cigarettes, or a penknife to survive in jail. Others may make a quick decision to hide unlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at the time of their arrest. This record has concrete examples. Ofcers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility, for example, discovered that a man arrested for driving under the influence had \"2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of rolling papers, 20 matches and 5 sleeping pills\" taped under his scrotum. Brief for Atlantic County et al. as Amici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). A person booked on a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter, tobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his rectal cavity. See United States Brief 25, n. 15. San Francisco ofcials have discovered contraband hidden in body cavities of people arrested for trespassing, public nui\u00adsance, and shoplifting. San Francisco Brief 3. There have been similar incidents at jails throughout the country. See United States Brief 25, n. 15. Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not them\u00ad selves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may be coerced into doing so by others. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (\"It is not unreasonable 336 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of the Court to assume, for instance, that low security risk detainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or weapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact visits\"). This could happen any time detainees are held in the same area, including in a van on the way to the station or in the holding cell of the jail. If, for example, a person arrested and de\u00adtained for unpaid trafc citations is not subject to the same search as others, this will be well known to other detainees with jail experience. A hardened criminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, approach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of a crime, a weapon, or some other contraband. As an expert in this case explained, \"the inter\u00adaction and mingling between misdemeanants and felons will only increase the amount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only conduct admission searches on felons.\" App. 381a. Exempting people arrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and result in more contraband being brought into the deten\u00adtion facility. This is a substantial reason not to mandate the exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional law. 2 It also may be difcult, as a practical matter, to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search. Jails can be even more dangerous than prisons be\u00adcause ofcials there know so little about the people they admit at the outset. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 11-14. An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie about his iden\u00adtity. The ofcers who conduct an initial search often do not have access to criminal history records. See, e. g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13. And those records can be inaccurate or incomplete. See Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989). Petitioner's rap sheet is an example. It did not re\u00adflect his previous arrest for possession of a deadly weapon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19. In the absence of reliable informa\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 337 Opinion of the Court tion it would be illogical to require ofcers to assume the arrestees in front of them do not pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility. The laborious administration of prisons would become less effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were the prac\u00adtical problems inevitable from the rules suggested by peti\u00adtioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate. Even if they had accurate information about a detainee's current and prior arrests, ofcers, under petitioner's proposed regime, would encounter serious implementation difculties. They would be required, in a few minutes, to determine whether any of the underlying offenses were serious enough to au\u00adthorize the more invasive search protocol. Other possible classications based on characteristics of individual detain\u00adees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory application. Most ofcers would not be well equipped to make any of these legal determina\u00adtions during the pressures of the intake process. Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985-987 (Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 761-762 (1984) (White, J., dissent\u00ad ing) (\"[T]he Court's approach will necessitate a case-by-case evaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a difcult task for which ofcers and courts are poorly equipped\"). To avoid liability, ofcers might be inclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population. Cf. Atwater , 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22. The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater . The petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment prohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of the suspected crime \"could not ultimately carry any jail time\" and there was \"no compelling need for immediate detention.\" Id., at 346. That rule \"promise[d] very little in the way of administrability.\" Id., at 350. Ofcers could not be ex\u00ad pected to draw the proposed lines on a moment's notice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would have discouraged 338 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Opinion of Kennedy, J. them from arresting criminals in any questionable circum\u00ad stances. Id., at 350-351 (\"An ofcer not quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail time or not quite cer\u00adtain about a suspect's risk of flight would not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn out that, in fact, the of\u00adfense called for incarceration and the defendant was long gone on the day of trial\"). The Fourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater . The Court held that ofcers who have probable cause to believe even a minor criminal offense has been committed in their presence may arrest the offender. See id., at 354. Individual jurisdictions can of course choose \"to impose more restrictive safeguards through statutes limiting warrantless arrests for minor of\u00adfenses.\" Id., at 352. One of the central principles in Atwater applies with equal force here. Ofcers who interact with those suspected of violating the law have an \"essential interest in readily ad\u00administrable rules.\" Id., at 347; accord, New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981). The ofcials in charge of the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any complicated con\u00adstitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less thorough inspections of some detainees based on their behavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other factors. They offer signicant reasons why the Constitution must not pre\u00advent them from conducting the same search on any suspected offender who will be admitted to the general population in their facilities. The restrictions suggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the privacy of some detainees but at the risk of increased danger to everyone in the facility, including the less serious offenders themselves. IV This case does not require the Court to rule on the types of searches that would be reasonable in instances where, for example, a detainee will be held without assignment to the general jail population and without substantial contact with Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 339 Opinion of the Court other detainees. This describes the circumstances in At- water . See 532 U. S., at 324 (\"Ofcers took Atwater's 'mug shot' and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and released on $310 bond\"). The accommodations provided in these situ\u00adations may diminish the need to conduct some aspects of the searches at issue. Cf. United States Brief 30 (discussing the segregation, and less invasive searches, of individuals held by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for misdemeanors or civil contempt). The circumstances before the Court, however, do not present the opportunity to consider a narrow excep\u00adtion of the sort Justice Alito describes, post, at 341-342 (concurring opinion), which might restrict whether an ar\u00adrestee whose detention has not yet been reviewed by a mag\u00adistrate or other judicial ofcer, and who can be held in avail\u00adable facilities removed from the general population, may be subjected to the types of searches at issue here. Petitioner's amici raise concerns about instances of of\u00ad cers engaging in intentional humiliation and other abusive practices. See Brief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al. as Amici Curiae; see also Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528 (\"[I]ntentional harassment of even the most hardened criminals cannot be tolerated by a civilized society\"); Bell, 441 U. S., at 560. There also may be legitimate concerns about the invasive\u00adness of searches that involve the touching of detainees. These issues are not implicated on the facts of this case, how\u00adever, and it is unnecessary to consider them here. V Even assuming all the facts in favor of petitioner, the search procedures at the Burlington County Detention Cen\u00adter and the Essex County Correctional Facility struck a rea\u00adsonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the framework of rules petitioner proposes. 340 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Alito, J., concurring The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Cir\u00ad cuit is afrmed. It is so ordered. Chief Justice Roberts, concurring. I join the opinion of the Court. As with Justice Alito , however, it is important for me that the Court does not fore\u00ad close the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces. Justice Kennedy explains that the circumstances before it do not afford an opportunity to consider that possibility. Ante, at 339. Those circumstances include the facts that Florence was detained not for a minor trafc offense but in\u00adstead pursuant to a warrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if Florence were to be de\u00adtained, to holding him in the general jail population. Factual nuances have not played a signicant role as this case has been presented to the Court. Both courts below regarded acknowledged factual disputes as \"immaterial\" to their conflicting dispositions, 621 F. 3d 296, 300 (CA3 2010), and before this Court Florence challenged suspicionless strip searches \"no matter what the circumstances,\" Pet. for Cert. i. The Court makes a persuasive case for the general applica\u00ad bility of the rule it announces. The Court is nonetheless wise to leave open the possibility of exceptions, to ensure that we \"not embarrass the future.\" Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota, 322 U. S. 292, 300 (1944) (Frankfurter, J .). Justice Alito , concurring. I join the opinion of the Court but emphasize the limits of today's holding. The Court holds that jail administrators may require all arrestees who are committed to the general population of a jail to undergo visual strip searches not involving physical contact by corrections ofcers. To per\u00adform the searches, ofcers may direct the arrestees to dis\u00adrobe, shower, and submit to a visual inspection. As part of Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 341 Alito, J., concurring the inspection, the arrestees may be required to manipulate their bodies. Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliating and deeply offensive to many, but there are reasonable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are ad\u00admitted to the general population of a jail. As the Court ex\u00adplains, there is a serious danger that some detainees will attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contraband into the jail. Some detainees may have lice, which can easily spread to others in the facility, and some detainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail is required to provide medical treatment. In addition, if a detainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed with detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue. Petitioner and the dissent would permit corrections of\u00ad cers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here only if the ofcers have a reasonable basis for thinking that a partic\u00adular arrestee may present a danger to other detainees or members of the jail staff. But as the Court explains, correc\u00adtions ofcers are often in a very poor position to make such a determination, and the threat to the health and safety of detainees and staff, should the ofcers miscalculate, is simply too great. It is important to note, however, that the Court does not hold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip search of an arrestee whose detention has not been reviewed by a judicial ofcer and who could be held in available facilities apart from the general population. Most of those arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are released from custody prior to or at the time of their initial appear\u00adance before a magistrate. In some cases, the charges are dropped. In others, arrestees are released either on their own recognizance or on minimal bail. In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration. For these persons, admission to the general jail population, with the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may not be reasonable, particularly if an 342 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting alternative procedure is feasible. For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and possibly even some local jails appear to segregate temporary detainees who are minor of\u00adfenders from the general population. See, e. g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30; Bull v. City and Cty. of San Francisco , 595 F. 3d 964, 968 (CA9 2010) (en banc).* The Court does not address whether it is always reason\u00ad able, without regard to the offense or the reason for deten\u00adtion, to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee's de\u00adtention has been reviewed by a judicial ofcer. The lead opinion explicitly reserves judgment on that question. See ante, at 339. In light of that limitation, I join the opinion of the Court in full. Justice Breyer , with whom Justice Ginsburg, Jus\u00ad tice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. The petition for certiorari asks us to decide \"[w]hether the Fourth Amendment permits a . . . suspicionless strip search of every individual arrested for any minor offense . . . .\" Pet. for Cert. i. This question is phrased more broadly than what is at issue. The case is limited to strip searches of those arrestees entering a jail's general population, see 621 *In its amicus brief, the United States informs us that, according to BOP policy, prison and jail ofcials cannot subject persons arrested for misdemeanor or civil contempt offenses to visual body-cavity searches without their consent or without reasonable suspicion that they are con\u00adcealing contraband. Brief for United States 30. Those who are not searched must be housed separately from the inmates in the general popu\u00adlation. Ibid. Similarly, as described by the Court of Appeals in Bull, 595 F. 3d 964, the San Francisco County jail system distinguishes between arrestees who are eligible for release because, for instance, they can post bail within 12 hours and those who must be housed for an extended period of time. Id., at 968. The former are kept in holding cells at a temporary intake and release facility where they are pat searched and scanned with a metal detector but apparently are not strip searched. Ibid. The latter are transported to a jail with custodial housing facilities where they are then strip searched prior to their admission into the general population. Ibid. Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 343 Breyer, J., dissenting F. 3d 296, 298 (CA3 2010). And the kind of strip search in question involves more than undressing and taking a shower (even if guards monitor the shower area for threatened dis\u00adorder). Rather, the searches here involve close observation of the private areas of a person's body and for that rea\u00adson constitute a far more serious invasion of that person's privacy. The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue here is not unique. A similar practice is well described in Dodge v. County of Orange , 282 F. Supp. 2d 41 (SDNY 2003). In that New York case, the \"strip search\" (as described in a relevant prison manual) involved \" 'a visual inspection of the inmate's naked body. This should include the inmate opening his mouth and moving his tongue up and down and from side to side, removing any dentures, running his hands through his hair, allow\u00ading his ears to be visually examined, lifting his arms to expose his arm pits, lifting his feet to examine the sole, spreading and/or lifting his testicles to expose the area behind them and bending over and/or spreading the cheeks of his buttocks to expose his anus. For females, the procedures are similar except females must in addi\u00adtion, squat to expose the vagina.' \" Id., at 46. Because the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical in\u00ad formation about the need for such a search in respect to minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in this case do not differ signicantly, I shall use the succinct Dodge description as a template for the kind of strip search to which the question presented refers. See, e. g., 621 F. 3d, at 299 (alleging that ofcers inspected his genitals from an arm's length away, required him to lift his genitals, and ex\u00adamined his anal cavity). In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a minor offense that does not involve drugs or violence\u2014say, a trafc offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil 344 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting matter, or any other such misdemeanor\u2014is an \"unreasonable searc[h]\" forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless prison authorities have reasonable suspicion to believe that the indi\u00advidual possesses drugs or other contraband. And I dissent from the Court's contrary determination. I Those conned in prison retain basic constitutional rights. Bell v. Wolsh, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (\"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Consti\u00adtution\"). The constitutional right at issue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" And, as the Court notes, the applicable stand\u00adard is the Fourth Amendment balancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates in Bell v. Wolsh, supra. The Court said: \"The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amend\u00adment is not capable of precise denition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the man\u00adner in which it is conducted, the justication for initiat\u00ading it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id., at 559. I have described in general terms, see supra, at 342-343, the place, scope, and manner of \"the particular intrusion,\" Bell, 441 U. S., at 559. I now explain why I believe that the \"in\u00ad vasion of personal rights\" here is very serious and lacks need or justication, ibid.\u2014at least as to the category of minor offenders at issue. II A strip search that involves a stranger peering without consent at a naked individual, and in particular at the most Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 345 Breyer, J., dissenting private portions of that person's body, is a serious invasion of privacy. We have recently said, in respect to a schoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the \"meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demand\u00ading its own specic suspicions.\" Safford Unied Redding , 557 U. S. 364, 377 (2009). The Courts of Appeals have more directly described the privacy inter\u00adests at stake, writing, for example, that practices similar to those at issue here are \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undigni\u00aded, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, [and] repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G. v. Chicago , 723 F. 2d 1263, 1272 (CA7 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); see e. g., Blackburn v. Snow , 2d \" have recog\u00adnized the \" 'severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy' \" that accompany visual body-cavity searches (quoting Arruda v. Fair , 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))). These kinds of searches also gave this Court the \"most pause\" in Bell, supra, at 558 (guards strip searched prisoners after they received outside visits). Even when carried out in a respectful manner, and even absent any physical touch\u00ading, see ante, at 325, 339, such searches are inherently harm\u00ad ful, humiliating, and degrading. And the harm to privacy interests would seem particularly acute where the person searched may well have no expectation of being subject to such a search, say, because she had simply received a trafc ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he had not previously paid a civil ne, or because she had been arrested for a minor trespass. In Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 323-324 (2001), for example, police arrested a mother driving with her two children because their seatbelts were not buckled. This Court held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest for a minor seatbelt offense. Id., at 323. But, in doing so, it pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour (before 346 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting being taken to a magistrate and released on bond) and that the search\u2014she had to remove her shoes, jewelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355\u2014was not \" 'unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical interests.' \" Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 818 (1996)). Would this Court have upheld the arrest had the magistrate not been immediately available, had the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had they subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here? Cf. County of River\u00ad side v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56 (1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest). The petitioner, Albert W. Florence, states that his present arrest grew out of an (erroneous) report that he had failed to pay a minor civil ne previously assessed because he had hindered a prosecution (by fleeing police ofcers in his auto\u00admobile). App. 25a-26a. He alleges that he was held for six days in jail before being taken to a magistrate and that he was subjected to two strip searches of the kind in question. 621 F. 3d, at 299. Amicus briefs present other instances in which individuals arrested for minor offenses have been subjected to the hu\u00admiliations of a visual strip search. They include a nun, a Sister of Divine Providence for 50 years, who was arrested for trespassing during an antiwar demonstration. Brief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al. as Amici Curiae 6. They include women who were strip searched during periods of lactation or menstruation. Id., at 11-12 (describing humiliating expe\u00ad rience of female student who was strip searched while men\u00adstruating); Archuleta v. Wagner , 523 F. 3d 1278, 1282 (CA10 2008) (same for woman lactating). They include victims of sexual violence. Brief for Domestic Violence Legal Empow\u00aderment and Appeals Project et al. as Amici Curiae . They include individuals detained for such infractions as driving with a noisy muffler, driving with an inoperable headlight, failing to use a turn signal, or riding a bicycle without an audible bell. Brief for Petitioner 11, 25; see also Mary Beth Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 347 Breyer, J., dissenting G., supra, at 1267, n. 2 (considering strip search of a person arrested for having outstanding parking tickets and a person arrested for making an improper left turn); Jones v. Ed\u00ad wards, 770 F. 2d 739, 741 (CA8 1985) (same for violation of dog leash law). They include persons who perhaps should never have been placed in the general jail population in the rst place. See ante, at 341 (Alito, J. concurring) (\"admis\u00ad sion to the general jail population, with the concomitant hu\u00admiliation of a strip search, may not be reasonable\" for those \"whose detention has not been reviewed by a judicial ofcer and who could be held in available facilities apart from the general population\"). I need not go on. I doubt that we seriously disagree about the nature of the strip search or about the serious affront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it presents. The basic question before us is whether such a search is nonetheless justied when an individual arrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the general jail or prison population. III The majority, like the respondents, argues that strip searches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such as lice, that might spread in connement, (2) to identify gang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special housing to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, including drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum, which might prove harmful or dangerous in prison. In evaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize: that managing a jail or prison is an \"inordinately difcult undertaking,\" Turner , 482 U. S., at 85; that prison regulations that inter\u00ad fere with important constitutional interests are generally valid as long as they are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\" id., at 89; that nding injuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing the threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are \"legitimate pe\u00adnological interests,\" ibid.; and that we normally defer to the 348 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting expertise of jail and prison administrators in such matters, id., at 85. Nonetheless, the \"particular\" invasion of interests, Bell, 441 U. S., at 559, must be \" 'reasonably related' \" to the justifying \"penological interest\" and the need must not be \" 'exaggerated,' \" Turner , supra, at 87. It is at this point that I must part company with the majority. I have found no convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of rea\u00adsonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those ar\u00adrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to further the penal interests mentioned. And there are strong rea\u00ad sons to believe they are not justied. The lack of justication is fairly obvious with respect to the rst two penological interests advanced. The searches already employed at Essex and Burlington include: (1) pat frisking all inmates; (2) making inmates go through metal detectors (including the \"Body Orice Screening System (BOSS)\" chair used at Essex County Correctional Facility that identies metal hidden within the body); (3) making in\u00admates shower and use particular delousing agents or bathing supplies; and (4) searching inmates' clothing. In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees could be lawfully subject to being viewed in their undergarments by jail ofcers or during showering (for security purposes). Brief for Peti\u00adtioner 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8 (\"Showering in the presence of ofcers is not something that requires reasonable suspicion\"). No one here has offered any reason, example, or empirical evidence suggesting the inadequacy of such practices for de\u00adtecting injuries, diseases, or tattoos. In particular, there is no connection between the genital lift and the \"squat and cough\" that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health or gang concerns. See Brief for Academics on Gang Behav\u00adior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New Jersey et al. as Amici Curiae . The lack of justication for such a strip search is less obvi\u00ad ous but no less real in respect to the third interest, namely, Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 349 Breyer, J., dissenting that of detecting contraband. The information demonstrat\u00ad ing the lack of justication is of three kinds. First, there are empirically based conclusions reached in specic cases. The New York Federal District Court, to which I have re\u00adferred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons admitted to the Orange County correctional facility between 1999 and 2003. Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69. These 23,000 persons under\u00ad went a strip search of the kind described, supra, at 343. Of these 23,000 persons, the court wrote, \"the County encoun\u00adtered three incidents of drugs recovered from an inmate's anal cavity and two incidents of drugs falling from an in\u00ad mate's underwear during the course of a strip search.\" 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69. The court added that in four of these ve instances there may have been \"reasonable suspicion\" to search, leaving only one instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy \"arguably\" detected additional contraband. Id., at 70. The study is imperfect, for search standards changed during the time it was conducted. Id., at 50-51. But the large number of inmates, the small number of \"inci\u00addents,\" and the District Court's own conclusions make the study probative though not conclusive. Similarly, in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2 2001), the court received data produced by the county jail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip searches, simi\u00adlar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new inmates over a period of ve years. Brief for Plaintiff-Appellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00-7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16 (citing to its App. 343a-493a). In 16 instances the searches led to the discovery of contra\u00adband. The record further showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband would have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes and outer clothing. In the three instances in which contraband was found on the detainee's body or in a body cavity, there was a drug or felony history that would have justied a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion. Ibid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as Amicus Curiae 10. 350 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting Second, there is the plethora of recommendations of pro\u00ad fessional bodies, such as correctional associations, that have studied and thoughtfully considered the matter. The Amer\u00adican Correctional Association (ACA)\u2014an association that in\u00adforms our view of \"what is obtainable and what is acceptable in corrections philosophy,\" Brown v. Plata, 563 U. S. 493, 540 (2011)\u2014has promulgated a standard that forbids suspicion-less strip searches. And it has done so after consultation with the American Jail Association, National Sheriffs' Associ\u00adation, National Institute of Corrections of the Department of Justice, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. ACA, Performance- Based Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities, Stand\u00adard 4-ALDF-2C-03, p. 36 (4th ed. 2004); Dept. of Justice, Federal Performance-Based Detention Standards Handbook \u00a7 C.6, p. 99 (rev-2 Feb. 23, 2011), http://www.justice.gov/ofdt/ fpbds02232011.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 30, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court's case le); ACA, Core Jail Standards \u00a7 1-CORE-2C-02, pp. vii, 23 (2010). A standard desk reference for general information about sound correctional practices advises against suspicionless strip searches. Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Correc\u00adtions, M. Martin & T. Rosazza, Resource Guide for Jail Ad\u00administrators 4, 113 (2004); see also Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, M. Martin & P. Katsampes, Sheriff 's Guide to Effective Jail Operations 50 (2007). Moreover, many correctional facilities apply a reasonable suspicion standard before strip searching inmates entering the general jail population, including the U. S. Marshals Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. See U. S. Marshals Serv., Policy Directive, Prisoner Custody-Body Searches \u00a7 9.1(E)(3) (2010), http://www.usmarshals.gov/foia/Directives\u00adPolicy/prisoner_ops/ body_searches.pdf; ICE, Ofce of De\u00adtention and Removal Operations (DRO), 2008 Operations Manual ICE Performance-Based National Detention Stand\u00adard Searches of Detainees 1, http://www.ice.gov/doclib/dro/ Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 351 Breyer, J., dissenting detention-standards/pdf/searches_of_detainees.pdf; id., ICE/DRO Detention Standard: Admission and Release 4-5, http://www.ice.gov/doclib/dro/detention-standards/pdf/ environmental_health_and_safety.pdf; Bureau of Indian Af\u00adfairs, Ofce of Justice Servs., BIA Adult Detention Facility Guidelines 22 (Draft 2010). The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) itself forbids suspicionless strip searches for minor of\u00adfenders, though it houses separately (and does not admit to the general jail population) a person who does not consent to such a search. See Dept. of Justice, BOP Program State\u00adment 5140.38, p. 5 (2004), http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/ 5140_038.pdf. Third, there is general experience in areas where the law has forbidden here-relevant suspicionless searches. Laws in at least 10 States prohibit suspicionless strip searches. See, e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 544.193.2 (2011) (\"No person arrested or detained for a trafc offense or an offense which does not constitute a felony may be subject to a strip search or a body cavity search . . . unless there is probable cause to believe that such person is concealing a weapon . . . or contraband\"); Kan. Code Stat., ch. 725, 1(c) (West 2011) (similar Admin. Regs. Code (similar); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 16-3-405(1) (2011) (no strip search absent individualized suspicion unless person has been arraigned and court orders that suspect be detained); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 901.211(2) (2010) (simi\u00adlar); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 764.25a(2) (West 2000) (simi\u00adlar); Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 10.79.130(1) (2010) (similar). At the same time at least seven Courts of Appeals have considered the question and have required reasonable suspi\u00adcion that an arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband before a strip search of one arrested for a minor offense can take place. See, e. g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 112-113 (CA1 2001); Weber v. Dell, 804 F. 2d 796, 802 352 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting (CA2 1986); Logan v. Shealy , 660 F. 2d 1007, 1013 (CA4 1981); Stewart F. 2d 153, 156-157 (CA5 1985); Mary Beth G., 1266, 1273; Edwards, 770 F. 2d, at v. Bogans, 735 F. 2d 391, 394 (CA10 1984). But see 621 F. 3d, at 311 (case below); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco , 595 F. 3d 964, 975 (CA9 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298, 1307 (CA11 2008) (en banc). Respondents have not presented convincing grounds to be\u00ad lieve that administration of these legal standards has in\u00adcreased the smuggling of contraband into prison. Indeed, neither the majority's opinion nor the briefs set forth any clear example of an instance in which contraband was smuggled into the general jail population during intake that could not have been discovered if the jail was employing a reasonable suspicion standard. The majority does cite general examples from Atlantic County and Washington State where contraband has been recovered in correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving under the influ\u00adence and disorderly conduct. Ante, at 335. Similarly, the majority refers to information, provided by San Francisco jail authorities, stating that they have found handcuff keys, syringes, crack pipes, drugs, and knives during body-cavity searches, including during searches of minor offenders, in\u00adcluding a man arrested for illegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prostitution and public nuisance (\" 'bin\u00addles of crack cocaine' \"). Brief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici Curiae 7-13; Bull, supra, at 969; ante, at 335. And associated statistics indicate that the pol\u00ad icy of conducting visual cavity searches of all those admitted to the general population in San Francisco may account for the discovery of contraband in approximately 15 instances per year. Bull, supra, at 969. But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us whether reasonable suspicion was present or absent in any of the 15 instances. Nor is there any showing by the major\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 353 Breyer, J., dissenting ity that the few unclear examples of contraband recovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or anywhere else could not have been discovered through a policy that re\u00adquired reasonable suspicion for strip searches. And without some such indication, I am left without an example of any instance in which contraband was found on an individual through an inspection of their private parts or body cavities which could not have been found under a policy requiring reasonable suspicion. Hence, at a minimum these examples, including San Francisco's statistics, do not provide a signi\u00adcant counterweight to those presented in Dodge and Shain. Nor do I nd the majority's lack of examples surprising. After all, those arrested for minor offenses are often stopped and arrested unexpectedly. And they consequently will have had little opportunity to hide things in their body cavi\u00adties. Thus, the widespread advocacy by prison experts and the widespread application in many States and federal cir\u00adcuits of \"reasonable suspicion\" requirements indicate an ability to apply such standards in practice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal interest in preventing the smuggling of contraband. The majority is left with the word of prison ofcials in support of its contrary proposition. And though that word is important, it cannot be sufcient. Cf. Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, W. Collins, Jails and the Constitution: An Overview 28-29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though prison ofcials often \"passionately believed\" similar require\u00adments would lead to contraband-related security problems, once those requirements were imposed those \"problems did not develop\"). The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S. 520, itself. Ante, at 326-327. In that case, the Court considered a prison policy requiring a strip search of all detainees after \"contact visits\" with unimprisoned visitors. 441 U. S., at 558. The Court found that policy justied. Id., at 560. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, that case does not provide prece\u00ad354 FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON Breyer, J., dissenting dent for the proposition that the word of prison ofcials (ac\u00ad companied by \"one instance\" of empirical example) is suf\u00adcient to support a strip search policy. Ante, at 327. The majority correctly points out that there was but \"one instance\" in which the policy had led to the discovery of an effort to smuggle contraband. Bell, 441 U. S., at 558. But the Court understood that the prison had been open only four months. Id., at 526. And the Court was also pre\u00ad sented with other examples where inmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact visits. Id., at 559. It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison justied in conducting postcontact searches even as to pretrial detain\u00ad ees who had been brought before a magistrate, denied bail, and \"committed to the detention facility only because no other less drastic means [could] reasonably assure [their] presence at trial.\" Id., at 546, n. 28. The Court recognized that those ordered detained by a magistrate were often those \"charged with serious crimes, or who have prior rec\u00adords.\" Ibid. For that reason, those detainees posed at least the same security risk as convicted inmates, if not \"a greater risk to jail security and order,\" and a \"greater risk of escape.\" Ibid. And, of course, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors had the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case, unlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after an unexpected arrest). The Bell Court had no occasion to focus upon those ar\u00ad rested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial ofcer's determi\u00adnation that they should be committed to prison. I share Justice Alito' s intuition that the calculus may be different in such cases, given that \"[m]ost of those arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are released from cus\u00adtody prior to or at the time of their initial appearance before a magistrate.\" Ante, at 341 (concurring opinion). As he notes, this case does not address, and \"reserves judgment on,\" whether it is always reasonable \"to strip search an ar\u00adrestee before the arrestee's detention has been reviewed by Cite as: 566 U. S. 318 (2012) 355 Breyer, J., dissenting a judicial ofcer.\" Ante, at 342. In my view, it is highly questionable that ofcials would be justied, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world of the general jail popula\u00adtion and subjecting to a strip search someone with no crimi\u00adnal background arrested for jaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 346-347. Indeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Federal Government and many States segregate such individuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions provide that such individuals be re\u00adleased without detention in the ordinary case. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 853.6 (West Supp. 2012). In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for the Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to admit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail population, and to subject her to the \"humiliation of a strip search,\" prior to any review by a judicial ofcer. Ante, at 341 (Alito, J., concurring). * * * For the reasons set forth, I cannot nd justication for the strip search policy at issue here\u2014a policy that would subject those arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal privacy. I consequently dissent. 356 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus REHBERG v. PAULK certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit No. 10-788. Argued November 1, 2011\u2014Decided April 2, 2012 Respondent, the chief investigator for a district attorney's ofce, testied at grand jury proceedings that resulted in petitioner's indictment. After the indictments were dismissed, petitioner brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that respondent had conspired to pre\u00adsent and did present false testimony to the grand jury. The Federal District Court denied respondent's motion to dismiss on immunity grounds, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that respondent had absolute immunity from a \u00a7 1983 claim based on his grand jury testimony. Held: A witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983 as a witness who testies at trial. Pp. 361-375. (a) Section 1983, which derives from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort law and the common-law immunities applicable in tort suits. See, e. g., Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 484. This interpretation of \u00a7 1983 has been reafrmed by the Court time and again. Thus, the Court looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the immunities available in actions brought under \u00a7 1983. See Kalina v. Fletcher , 522 U. S. 118, 123. Taking a \"functional approach,\" see, e. g., Forrester v. White , 484 U. S. 219, 224, the Court identies those governmental func\u00ad tions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are performed \" 'with independence and without fear of consequences,' \" Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554. The Court's functional approach is tied to the common law's identica\u00ad tion of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity, but the Court's precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to protect those functions. For example, it was common in 1871 for cases to be prose\u00adcuted by private parties, who did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit. But as the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public ofcials, common-law courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 357 Syllabus private predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert. This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to private, prosecutors. Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under \u00a7 1983 reached this Court in Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead relied substantially on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for common-law torts. Neither has the Court suggested that \u00a7 1983 is simply a federalized amalgam\u00adation of pre-existing common-law claims. The new federal claim cre\u00adated by \u00a7 1983 differs in important ways from pre-existing common-law torts. Accordingly, both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in \u00a7 1983 actions differ in some respects from the common law. Pp. 361-366. (b) A trial witness sued under \u00a7 1983 enjoys absolute immunity from any claim based on his testimony. Briscoe v. LaHue , 460 U. S. 325. Without absolute immunity, the truth-seeking process would be im\u00adpaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify, and even a witness who took the stand \"might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff \" for \"fear of subsequent liability.\" Id., at 333. These factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses. In both contexts, a witness' fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence. And in neither context is the deter\u00adrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony because other sanctions, chiefly prosecution for perjury, provide a sufcient deterrent. For the reasons identied in Briscoe, supra, at 342-344, there is no reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses in \u00a7 1983 actions. And the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any \u00a7 1983 claim based on the witness' testimony may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony, or by using evidence of the witness' testimony to support any other \u00a7 1983 claim concerning the initiation or mainte\u00adnance of a prosecution. Were it otherwise, a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the preparatory activity\u2014 such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the sub\u00adstance of his intended testimony\u2014rather than the absolutely immune actions themselves. Pp. 366370. (c) Petitioner's main argument is that under Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340341, and Kalina, supra, at 131, grand jury witnesses who 358 REHBERG v. PAULK Syllabus are \"complaining witnesses\" are not entitled to absolute immunity. But at the time \u00a7 1983's predecessor was enacted, a \"complaining witness\" was a party who procured an arrest and initiated a criminal prosecution. A \"complaining witness\" might testify, either before a grand jury or at trial, but testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a \"complaining witness.\" Thus, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive function performed by a \"complaining witness.\" A \"complaining witness\" cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testi\u00ad mony, see Briscoe, supra, at 326, and there is no more reason why a \"complaining witness\" should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury. Once the distinctive function performed by a \"complaining witness\" is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement ofcer who testies before a grand jury is not comparable to a \"complaining witness\" be\u00adcause it is not the ofcer who makes the critical decision to press crimi\u00adnal charges, but the prosecutor. It would be anomalous to permit a police ofcer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for the deci\u00adsion to initiate a prosecution. Petitioner also contends that the deter\u00adrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury proceedings because trial witnesses face cross-examination. But the force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allowing such civil actions would create\u2014subversion of grand jury secrecy, which is essen\u00adtial to the proper functioning of the grand jury system. See United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424. And nally, con\u00ad trary to petitioner's suggestion, recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction be\u00adtween States that use grand juries and States that permit felony prose\u00adcutions to be brought by complaint or information. Most States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at which witnesses testify, and the lower courts have held that prelimi\u00adnary hearing witnesses are protected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses. Pp. 370375. 611 F. 3d 828, afrmed. Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Andrew J. Pincus argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Charles A. Rothfeld and Jeffrey A. Meyer. Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 359 Opinion of the Court John C. Jones argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Theodore Freeman, Sun S. Choy, and Jacob E. Daly.* Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. This case requires us to decide whether a \"complaining witness\" in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same immunity in an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 as a witness who testies at trial. We see no sound reason to draw a distinction for this purpose between grand jury and trial witnesses. I Petitioner Charles Rehberg, a certied public accountant, sent anonymous faxes to several recipients, including the management of a hospital in Albany, Georgia, criticizing the hospital's management and activities. In response, the local district attorney's ofce, with the assistance of its chief in\u00advestigator, respondent James Paulk, launched a criminal investigation of petitioner, allegedly as a favor to the hospi\u00ad tal's leadership. Respondent testied before a grand jury, and petitioner was then indicted for aggravated assault, burglary, and six counts of making harassing telephone calls. The indictment charged that petitioner had assaulted a hospital physician, Dr. James Hotz, after unlawfully entering the doctor's home. Petitioner challenged the sufciency of the indictment, and it was dismissed. A few months later, respondent returned to the grand jury, and petitioner was indicted again, this time for assaulting *Solicitor General Verrilli, Assistant Attorney General West, Deputy Solicitor General Katyal, Eric D. Miller, and Barbara L. Herwig led a brief for the United States as amicus curiae in support of vacatur and remand. Lawrence Rosenthal led a brief for the International Municipal Law\u00ad yers Association et al. as amici curiae urging afrmance. 360 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court Dr. Hotz on August 22, 2004, and for making harassing phone calls. On this occasion, both the doctor and respondent tes\u00adtied. Petitioner challenged the sufciency of this second indictment, claiming that he was \" 'nowhere near Dr. Hotz' \" on the date in question and that \" '[t]here was no evidence whatsoever that [he] committed an assault on anybody.' \" 611 F. 3d 828, 836 (CA11 2010). Again, the indictment was dismissed. While the second indictment was still pending, respondent appeared before a grand jury for a third time, and yet an\u00adother indictment was returned. Petitioner was charged with assault and making harassing phone calls. This nal indictment was ultimately dismissed as well. Petitioner then brought this action against respondent under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Petitioner al\u00adleged that respondent conspired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury. Respondent moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that he was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury testimony. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Geor\u00adgia denied respondent's motion to dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in accordance with Circuit prece\u00addent, that respondent was absolutely immune from a \u00a7 1983 claim based on his grand jury testimony. The Court of Appeals noted petitioner's allegation that re\u00ad spondent was the sole \"complaining witness\" before the grand jury, but the Court of Appeals declined to recognize a \"complaining witness\" exception to its precedent on grand jury witness immunity. See 611 F. 3d, at 839-840. \"[A]l\u00adlowing civil suits for false grand jury testimony,\" the court reasoned, \"would . . . emasculate the condential nature of grand jury testimony, and eviscerate the traditional absolute immunity for witness testimony in judicial proceedings.\" Id., at 840. The court went on to hold that respondent was entitled to absolute immunity, not only with respect to claims based directly on his grand jury testimony, but also with Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 361 Opinion of the Court respect to the claim that he conspired to present such testi\u00ad mony. Id., at 841. To allow liability to be predicated on the alleged conspiracy, the court concluded, \" 'would be to per\u00admit through the back door what is prohibited through the front.' \" Ibid. (quoting Jones v. Cannon, 174 F. 3d 1271, 1289 (CA11 1999)). We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict regard\u00ad ing the immunity of a \"complaining witness\" in a grand jury proceeding, 562 U. S. 1286 (2011), and we now afrm. II Section 1983, which derives from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, creates a private right of action to vindicate violations of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States. Under the terms of the statute, \" '[e]very person' who acts under color of state law to deprive another of a constitutional right [is] answerable to that person in a suit for damages.\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417 (1976) (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983). A Despite the broad terms of \u00a7 1983, this Court has long rec\u00ad ognized that the statute was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort law and the common-law im\u00admunities applicable in tort suits. See, e. g., Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 484 (1991). More than 60 years ago, in Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U. S. 367 (1951), the Court held that \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate the long-established absolute immunity en\u00adjoyed by legislators for actions taken within the legitimate sphere of legislative authority. Immunities \"well grounded in history and reason,\" the Court wrote, were not somehow eliminated \"by covert inclusion in the general language\" of \u00a7 1983. Id., at 376. This interpretation has been reafrmed by the Court time and again and is now an entrenched feature of our \u00a7 1983 jurisprudence. See, e. g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554- 362 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court 555 (1967) (\"The legislative record gives no clear indication that Congress meant to abolish wholesale all common-law immunities. Accordingly, this Court held . . . that the immu\u00adnity of legislators for acts within the legislative role was not abolished. The immunity of judges for acts within the judi\u00adcial role is equally well established, and we presume that Congress would have specically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine\"); Imbler , supra, at 418 (statute must \"be read in harmony with general principles of tort immuni\u00adties and defenses rather than in derogation of them\"); Procu\u00ad nier v. Navarette , 434 U. S. 555, 561 (1978) (\"Although the Court has recognized that in enacting \u00a7 1983 Congress must have intended to expose state ofcials to damages liability in some circumstances, the section has been consistently con\u00adstrued as not intending wholesale revocation of the common-law immunity afforded government ofcials\"); Briscoe v. LaHue , 460 U. S. 325, 330 (1983) (\" 'It is by now well settled that the tort liability created by \u00a7 1983 cannot be understood in a historical vacuum. . . . One important assumption under\u00adlying the Court's decisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar with common-law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort liti\u00adgation, and that they likely intended these common-law prin\u00adciples to obtain, absent specic provisions to the contrary' \" (quoting Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 258 (1981))); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984) (\"The starting point in our own analysis is the common law. Our cases have proceeded on the assumption that common-law principles of . . . immunity were incorporated into our judicial system and that they should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so\"). B Recognizing that \"Congress intended [\u00a7 1983] to be con\u00ad strued in the light of common-law principles,\" the Court has looked to the common law for guidance in determining the Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 363 Opinion of the Court scope of the immunities available in a \u00a7 1983 action. Kalina v. Fletcher , 522 U. S. 118, 123 (1997). We do not simply make our own judgment about the need for immunity. We have made it clear that it is not our role \"to make a free\u00adwheeling policy choice,\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986), and that we do not have a license to create immunities based solely on our view of sound policy, see Tower v. Glover , 467 U. S. 914, 922-923 (1984). Instead, we conduct \"a con\u00adsidered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant ofcial at common law and the interests behind it.\" Imbler, supra, at 421. We take what has been termed a \"functional approach.\" See Forrester v. White , 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988); Burns, supra, at 486. We consult the common law to identify those governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litiga\u00adtion that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are performed \" 'with inde\u00adpendence and without fear of consequences.' \" Pierson, supra, at 554 (quoting Bradley v. Fisher , 13 Wall. 335, 350, n. (1872)). Taking this approach, we have identied the following functions that are absolutely immune from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983: actions taken by legislators within the legitimate scope of legislative authority, see Tenney , supra; actions taken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial authority, see Pierson, supra; actions taken by prosecutors in their role as advocates, see Imbler , supra, at 430-431; and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial, see Briscoe , supra. By contrast, the Court has found no absolute immunity for the acts of the chief executive ofcer of a State, the senior and subordinate ofcers of a State's National Guard, the president of a state university, see Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 247-248 (1974); school board members, see Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 318 (1975); the superintendent of a state hospital, see O'Connor v. Don\u00ad aldson, 422 U. S. 563, Pierson, 364 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court 386 at 555; prison ofcials and ofcers, Procunier , supra, at 561; and private co-conspirators of a judge, see Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24, 27 (1980). C While the Court's functional approach is tied to the com\u00ad mon law's identication of the functions that merit the pro\u00ad tection of absolute immunity, the Court's precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity that the common law provided to protect those functions. See, e. g., Burns, 500 U. S., at 493 (\" '[T]he pre\u00ad cise contours of ofcial immunity' need not immu\u00adnity at common law\" (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987))). This approach is illustrated by the Court's analysis of the absolute immunity enjoyed today by public prosecutors. When \u00a7 1983's predecessor was enacted in 1871, it was com\u00admon for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private parties. See, e. g., Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 198 (1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (\"[E]very man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit\"). And private prosecutors, like private plaintiffs in civil suits, did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit. See Malley , 475 U. S., at 340-341, and n. 3 (citing cases). Instead, \"the generally accepted rule\" was that a private complainant who procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable in an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant acted with malice and with\u00adout probable cause. See id., at 340-341; see also Briscoe , supra, at 351 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"Both English and American courts routinely permitted plaintiffs to bring ac\u00adtions alleging that the defendant had made a false and mali\u00adcious accusation of a felony to a magistrate or other judicial ofcer\"); Wheeler v. Nesbitt, 24 How. 544, 550 (1861) (\"Un\u00ad doubtedly, every person who puts the criminal law in force Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 365 Opinion of the Court maliciously, and without any reasonable or probable cause, commits a wrongful act; and if the accused is thereby preju\u00addiced, either in his person or property, the injury and loss so sustained constitute the proper foundation of an action to recover compensation\"); Dinsman v. Wilkes, 12 How. 390, 402 (1852) (no immunity \"where a party had maliciously, and without probable cause, procured the plaintiff to be indicted or arrested for an offence of which he was not guilty\"). In the decades after the adoption of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, however, the prosecutorial function was increasingly as\u00adsumed by public ofcials, and common-law courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an ag\u00adgrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert, namely, claims for malicious prosecution or defama\u00adtion. See Imbler , 424 U. S., at 441-442 (White, J., concur\u00ad ring in judgment); Kalina, supra, at 124, n. that cases \"decided after 1871 . . . granted a broader immunity to public prosecutors than had been available in malicious prosecution actions against private persons who brought prosecutions at early common law\"); see also Burns, supra, at 505 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dis\u00adsenting in part) (noting that the \"common-law tradition of prosecutorial immunity . . . developed much later than 1871\"). This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to private, prosecu\u00adtors. Because the daily function of a public prosecutor is to bring criminal charges, tort claims against public prosecu\u00adtors \"could be expected with some frequency, for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the State's advocate.\" Imbler , 424 U. S., at 425. Such \"harass\u00ad ment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor's energies from his public duties,\" and would re\u00adsult in a severe interference with the administration of an important public ofce. Id., at 423. Constant vulnerability to vexatious litigation would give rise to the \"possibility that 366 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court [the prosecutor] would shade his decisions instead of exercis\u00ad ing the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\" Ibid. Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under \u00a7 1983 reached this Court in Imbler , the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead placed substantial reliance on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecu\u00adtors sued for common-law torts. While the Court has looked to the common law in deter\u00ad mining the scope of the absolute immunity available under \u00a7 1983, the Court has not suggested that \u00a7 1983 is simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims, an all-in-one federal claim encompassing the torts of assault, trespass, false arrest, defamation, malicious prosecu\u00adtion, and more. The new federal claim created by \u00a7 1983 dif\u00adfers in important ways from those pre-existing torts. It is broader in that it reaches constitutional and statutory viola\u00adtions that do not correspond to any previously known tort. See Kalina, 522 U. S., at 123. But it is narrower in that it applies only to tortfeasors who act under color of state law. See Briscoe , 460 U. S., at 329. Section 1983 \"ha[s] no precise counterpart in state law. . . . [I]t is the purest coincidence when state statutes or the common law provide for equiva\u00adlent remedies; any analogies to those causes of action are bound to be imperfect.\" Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 272 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in \u00a7 1983 actions differ in some respects from the common law. III A At common law, trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form of absolute immunity for statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding: They had complete immunity against Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 367 Opinion of the Court slander and libel claims, even if it was alleged that the state\u00ad ments in question were maliciously false. Kalina, supra, at 133 (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing F. Hilliard, Law of Torts 319 (1866)); see Briscoe , supra, at 351 (Marshall, J., dis\u00ad senting); Burns, 500 U. S., at 501 (opinion of Scalia, J.). In Briscoe , however, this Court held that the immunity of a trial witness sued under \u00a7 1983 is broader: In such a case, a trial witness has absolute immunity with respect to any claim based on the witness' testimony. When a witness is sued because of his testimony, the Court wrote, \" 'the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of public policy.' \" 460 U. S., at 332-333 (quoting Calkins v. Sumner , 13 Wis. 193, 197 (1860)). Without absolute immunity for witnesses, the Court concluded, the truth-seeking process at trial would be impaired. Witnesses \"might be reluctant to come for\u00adward to testify,\" and even if a witness took the stand, the witness \"might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff\" for \"fear of subsequent liability.\" 460 U. S., at 333. The factors that justify absolute immunity for trial wit\u00ad nesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses. In both contexts, a witness' fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence. And in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent perjurious testimony. In Briscoe , the Court con\u00ad cluded that the possibility of civil liability was not needed to deter false testimony at trial because other sanctions\u2014 chiefly prosecution for perjury\u2014provided a sufcient deter\u00adrent. Id., at 342. Since perjury before a grand jury, like perjury at trial, is a serious criminal offense, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1623(a), there is no reason to think that this de\u00adterrent is any less effective in preventing false grand jury testimony. B Neither is there any reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses. In Briscoe , it was argued 368 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court that absolute immunity was not needed for police ofcer wit\u00ad nesses, but the Court refused to draw that distinction. The Court wrote: \"When a police ofcer appears as a witness, he may rea\u00adsonably be viewed as acting like any other witness sworn to tell the truth\u2014in which event he can make a strong claim to witness immunity; alternatively, he may be regarded as an ofcial performing a critical role in the judicial process, in which event he may seek the benet afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding. Nothing in the language of the statute sug\u00adgests that such a witness belongs in a narrow, spe\u00adcial category lacking protection against damages suits.\" 460 U. S., at 335-336 (footnote omitted). See also id., at 342 (\"A police ofcer on the witness stand performs the same functions as any other witness\"). The Briscoe Court rebuffed two arguments for distin\u00ad guishing between law enforcement witnesses and lay wit\u00adnesses for immunity purposes: rst, that absolute immunity is not needed for law enforcement witnesses because they are less likely to be intimidated by the threat of suit and, second, that such witnesses should not be shielded by ab\u00adsolute immunity because false testimony by a police of\u00adcer is likely to be more damaging than false testimony by a lay witness. See ibid. The Court observed that there are other factors not applicable to lay witnesses that weigh in favor of extending absolute immunity to police ofcer witnesses. First, police ofcers testify with some frequency. Id., at 343. \"Police ofcers testify in scores of cases every year,\" the Court noted, \"and defendants often will transform resentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury by the State's ofcial witnesses.\" Ibid. If police ofcer witnesses were routinely forced to defend against claims Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 369 Opinion of the Court based on their testimony, their \" 'energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.' \" Id., at 343-344 (quoting Imbler , 424 U. S., at 425). Second, a police ofcer witness' potential liability, if con\u00ad ditioned on the exoneration of the accused, could influence decisions on appeal and collateral relief. 460 U. S., at 344. Needless to say, such decisions should not be influenced by the likelihood of a subsequent civil rights action. But the possibility that a decision favorable to the accused might subject a police ofcer witness to liability would create the \" 'risk of injecting extraneous concerns' \" into appellate re\u00adview and postconviction proceedings. Ibid. (quoting Imbler , supra, at 428, n. 27). In addition, law enforcement wit\u00ad nesses face the possibility of sanctions not applicable to lay witnesses, namely, loss of their jobs and other employment-related sanctions. For these reasons, we conclude that grand jury witnesses should enjoy the same immunity as witnesses at trial. This means that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any \u00a7 1983 claim based on the witness' testimony. In addi\u00adtion, as the Court of Appeals held, this rule may not be cir\u00adcumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony or by using evidence of the wit\u00adness' testimony to support any other \u00a7 1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution. Were it oth\u00aderwise, \"a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could sim\u00adply reframe a claim to attack the preparation instead of the absolutely immune actions themselves.\" Buckley v. Fitz\u00ad simmons, 509 U. S. 259, 283 (1993) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also Dykes v. Hosemann, 776 F. 2d 942, 946 (CA11 1985) (per curiam) (\"[J]udges, on mere allegations of conspiracy or prior agreement, could be hauled into court and made to defend their judicial acts, the precise result judicial immunity was designed to avoid\"). In the vast majority of cases involving a claim against a grand 370 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court jury witness, the witness and the prosecutor conducting the investigation engage in preparatory activity, such as a pre\u00adliminary discussion in which the witness relates the sub\u00adstance of his intended testimony. We decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is so easily frustrated. 1 IV A Petitioner's main argument is that our cases, chiefly Mal\u00ad ley and Kalina, already establish that a \"complaining wit\u00ad ness\" is not shielded by absolute immunity. See Brief for Petitioner 17-22. In those cases, law enforcement ofcials who submitted afdavits in support of applications for arrest warrants were denied absolute immunity because they \"per\u00adformed the function of a complaining witness.\" Kalina, 522 U. S., at 131; see Malley , 475 U. S., at 340-341. Relying on these cases, petitioner contends that certain grand jury witnesses\u2014namely, those who qualify as \"complaining wit\u00adnesses\"\u2014are not entitled to absolute immunity. Petitioner's argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinctive function played by a \"complaining witness\" dur\u00ading the period when \u00a7 1983's predecessor was enacted. At that time, the term \"complaining witness\" was used to refer to a party who procured an arrest and initiated a crimi\u00adnal prosecution, see Kalina, 522 U. S., at 135 (Scalia, J., con\u00ad curring). A \"complaining witness\" might not actually ever testify, and thus the term \" 'witness' in 'complaining witness' is witness \"procure[s] the of an arrest war\u00adrant by submitting a complaint\"); Wyatt v. Cole , 504 U. S. 1 Of course, we do not suggest that absolute immunity extends to all activity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room. For ex\u00ad ample, we have accorded only qualied immunity to law enforcement of\u00adcials who falsify afdavits, see Kalina v. Fletcher , 522 U. S. 118, 129-131 (1997); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340-345 (1986), and fabricate evidence concerning an unsolved crime, see Buckley , 509 U. S., at 272-276. Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 371 Opinion of the Court 158, 164-165 (1992) (complaining witness \"set[s] the wheels of government in motion by instigating a legal action\"). It is true that a mid-19th-century complaining witness might testify, either before a grand jury or at trial. But testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a \"complain\u00ading witness.\" See M. Newell, Malicious Prosecution 368 (1892). Nor have we been presented with evidence that wit\u00adnesses who did no more than testify before a grand jury were regarded as complaining witnesses and were successfully sued for malicious prosecution. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15, 24-25. In sum, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive function performed by a complaining witness. It is clear\u2014and petitioner does not contend other-wise\u2014that a complaining witness cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testimony. Briscoe , supra, at 326. And there is no more reason why a complaining witness should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury. Once the distinctive function performed by a \"complaining witness\" is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement ofcer who testies before a grand jury is not at all com\u00adparable to a \"complaining witness.\" By testifying before a grand jury, a law enforcement ofcer does not perform the function of applying for an arrest warrant; nor does such an ofcer make the critical decision to initiate a prosecution. It is of course true that a detective or case agent who has performed or supervised most of the investigative work in a case may serve as an important witness in the grand jury proceeding and may very much want the grand jury to re\u00adturn an indictment. But such a witness, unlike a complain\u00ading witness at common law, does not make the decision to press criminal charges. Instead, it is almost always a prosecutor who is responsible for the decision to present a case to a grand jury, and in many jurisdictions, even if an indictment is handed up, a prosecution cannot proceed unless the prosecutor signs the 372 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court indictment.2 It would thus be anomalous to permit a police ofcer who testies before a grand jury to be sued for mali\u00ad ciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prose\u00adcutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for the decision to prosecute. See Albright v. Oliver , 510 U. S. 266, 279, n. 5 (1994) (Ginsburg, J ., concur\u00ad ring) (the prosecutor is the \"principal player in carrying out a prosecution\"); see ibid. (\"[T]he star player is exonerated, but the supporting actor is not\"). 3 2 The federal courts have concluded uniformly that Rule 7(c) of the Fed\u00ad eral Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing that an indictment \"must be signed by an attorney for the government,\" precludes federal grand juries from issuing an indictment without the prosecutor's signature, signifying his or her approval. See 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 15.1(d) (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave). How\u00adever, in some jurisdictions, the grand jury may return an indictment and initiate a prosecution without the prosecutor's signature, but such cases are rare. See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman, & M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice, p. 4-76, and n. 2 (2d ed. 2001). 3 Petitioner says there is no reason to distinguish between a person who goes to the police to swear out a criminal complaint and a person who testies to facts before a grand jury for the same purpose and with the same effect. Brief for Petitioner 2, 23. But this is like saying that a bicycle and an F-16 are the same thing. Even if the functions are similar as a general matter, the entities are quite different. Grand juries, by tradition, statute, and sometimes constitutional mandate, have a status and entitlement to information that absolute immunity furthers. See, e. g., Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 423, n. 20 (1976) (\"It is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of the judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors being referred to as 'quasi-judicial' ofcers, and their immunities being termed 'quasi-judicial' as well\"); see also United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 423 (1983) (\"The grand jury has always occupied a high place as an instrument of justice in our system of criminal law\u2014so much so that it is enshrined in the Constitution\"). Our holding today supports the functioning of the grand jury system. The importance of the grand jury cannot be underes\u00adtimated: In the federal system and many States, see LaFave \u00a7 15.1(d), a felony cannot be charged without the consent of community representatives, a vital protection from unwarranted prosecutions. Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 373 Opinion of the Court Precisely because no grand jury witness has the power to initiate a prosecution, petitioner is unable to provide a work\u00ad able standard for determining whether a particular grand jury witness is a \"complaining witness.\" Here, respondent was the only witness to testify in two of the three grand jury sessions that resulted in indictments. But where multiple witnesses testify before a grand jury, identifying the \"com\u00adplaining witness\" would often be difcult. Petitioner sug\u00adgests that a witness\" is \"someone who the prosecution in motion.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 8; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. And petitioner maintains that the same distinction made at common law between complaining wit\u00adnesses and other witnesses applies in \u00a7 1983 actions. See id., at 14-16. But, as we have explained, a complaining wit\u00ad ness played a distinctive role, and therefore even when a \"complaining witness\" testied, there was a clear basis for distinguishing between the \"complaining witness\" and other witnesses. Because no modern grand jury witness plays a comparable role, petitioner's proposed test would be of little use. Consider a case in which the case agent or lead detec\u00adtive testies before the grand jury and provides a wealth of background information and then a cooperating witness appears and furnishes critical incriminating testimony. Or suppose that two witnesses each provide essential testimony regarding different counts of an indictment or different ele\u00adments of an offense. In these cases, which witnesses would be \"complaining witnesses\" and thus vulnerable to suit based on their testimony? B Petitioner contends that the deterrent effect of civil liabil\u00ad ity is more needed in the grand jury context because trial witnesses are exposed to cross-examination, which is de\u00adsigned to expose perjury. See Brief for Petitioner 21, 25- 26. This argument overlooks the fact that a critical grand jury witness is likely to testify again at trial and may be 374 REHBERG v. PAULK Opinion of the Court cross-examined at that time. But in any event, the force of petitioner's argument is more than offset by a special prob\u00adlem that would be created by allowing civil actions against grand jury witnesses\u2014subversion of grand jury secrecy. \" 'We consistently have recognized that the proper func\u00ad tioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.' \" United States v. Sells Engi\u00ad neering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424 (1983) (quoting Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U. S. 211, 218-219 (1979)). \" '[I]f preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come for\u00adward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they tes\u00adtify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribu\u00adtion.' \" 463 U. S., at 424. Allowing \u00a7 1983 actions against grand jury witnesses would compromise this vital secrecy. If the testimony of witnesses before a grand jury could provide the basis for, or could be used as evidence supporting, a \u00a7 1983 claim, the identities of grand jury witnesses could be discovered by ling a \u00a7 1983 action and moving for the disclosure of the transcript of grand jury proceedings. Especially in cases in\u00advolving violent criminal organizations or other subjects who might retaliate against adverse grand jury witnesses, the threat of such disclosure might seriously undermine the grand jury process. C Finally, contrary to petitioner's suggestion, recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction between States that use grand juries and those that do not. Petitioner argues that it would make no sense to distinguish for purposes of \u00a7 1983 immunity between prosecutions initiated by the return of a grand jury indictment and those initiated by the ling of a complaint or information, and he notes that 26 States permit felony Cite as: 566 U. S. 356 (2012) 375 Opinion of the Court prosecutions to be brought by information. Brief for Peti\u00ad tioner 23-24. But petitioner draws the wrong analogy. In States that permit felony prosecutions to be initiated by in\u00adformation, the closest analog to a grand jury witness is a witness at a preliminary hearing. Most of the States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a pre\u00adliminary hearing at which witnesses testify. See LaFave \u00a7 14.2(d), at 304, and n. 47, 307, and n. 60. The lower courts have held that witnesses at a preliminary hearing are pro\u00adtected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses, see, e. g., Brice v. Nkaru, 220 F. 3d 233, 239, n. 6 (CA4 2000); Curtis v. Bembenek, 48 F. 3d 281, 284-285 (CA7 1995) (citing cases), and petitioner does not argue otherwise, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. * * * For these reasons, we hold that a grand jury witness is entitled to the same immunity as a trial witness. Accord\u00adingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is Afrmed. 376 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Per Curiam V ASQUEZ v.

OCTOBER TERM, 2011 377 Syllabus FILARSKY v. DELIA certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1018. Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 17, 2012 Respondent Delia, a reghter employed by the city of Rialto, California (City), missed work after becoming ill on the job. Suspicious of Delia's extended absence, the City hired a private investigation rm to conduct surveillance on him. When Delia was seen buying berglass insulation and other building supplies, the City initiated an internal affairs investi\u00ad gation. It hired petitioner Filarsky, a private attorney, to interview Delia. At the interview, which Delia's attorney and two re depart\u00adment ofcials also attended, Delia acknowledged buying the supplies, but denied having done any work on his home. To verify Delia's claim, Filarsky asked Delia to allow a re department ofcial to enter his home and view the unused materials. When Delia refused, Filarsky ordered him to bring the materials out of his home for the ofcial to see. This prompted Delia's attorney to threaten a civil rights action against the City and Filarsky. Nonetheless, after the interview concluded, ofcials followed Delia to his home, where he produced the materials. Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 against the City, the re department, Filarsky, and other individuals, alleging that the order to produce the building materials violated his Fourth and Four\u00adteenth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary judg\u00adment to the individual defendants on the basis of qualied immunity. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afrmed with respect to all individual defendants except Filarsky, concluding that he was not enti\u00ad tled to seek qualied immunity because he was a private attorney, not a City employee. Held: A private individual temporarily retained by the government to carry out its work is entitled to seek qualied immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983. Pp. 383394. (a) In determining whether the Court of Appeals made a valid dis\u00ad tinction between City employees and Filarsky for qualied immunity purposes, this Court looks to the general principles of tort immunities and defenses applicable at common law, and the reasons the Court has afforded protection from suit under \u00a7 1983. See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 418. The common law as it existed in 1871, when Con\u00adgress enacted \u00a7 1983, did not draw a distinction between full-time public 378 FILARSKY v. DELIA Syllabus servants and private individuals engaged in public service in according protection to those carrying out government responsibilities. Govern\u00adment at that time was smaller in both size and reach, had fewer respon\u00adsibilities, and operated primarily at the local level. Government work was carried out to a signicant extent by individuals who did not devote all their time to public duties, but instead pursued private callings as well. In according protection from suit to individuals doing the govern\u00adment's work, the common law did not draw distinctions based on the nature of a worker's engagement with the government. Indeed, exam\u00adples of individuals receiving immunity for actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself. Common law principles of immunity were incorporated into \u00a7 1983 and should not be abrogated absent clear legis\u00adlative intent. See Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529. Immunity under \u00a7 1983 therefore should not vary depending on whether an individ\u00adual working for the government does so as a permanent or full-time employee, or on some other basis. Pp. 383-389. (b) Nothing about the reasons this Court has given for recognizing immunity under \u00a7 1983 counsels against carrying forward the common law rule. First, the government interest in avoiding \"unwarranted ti\u00admidity\" on the part of those engaged in the public's business\u2014which has been called \"the most important special government immunity-producing concern,\" Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 409\u2014is equally implicated regardless of whether the individual sued as a state actor works for the government full time or on some other basis. Sec\u00adond, affording immunity to those acting on the government's behalf serves to \" 'ensure that talented candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.' \" Id., at 408. The government, in need of specialized knowledge or expertise, may look outside its permanent work force to secure the services of private individuals. But because those individuals are free to choose other work that would not expose them to liability for government actions, the most talented candidates might decline public engagements if they did not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public employee counterparts. Third, the public interest in ensuring performance of government duties free from the distractions that can accompany law\u00adsuits is implicated whether those duties are discharged by private indi\u00adviduals or permanent government employees. Finally, distinguishing among those who carry out the public's business based on their particu\u00adlar relationship with the government creates signicant line-drawing problems and can deprive state actors of the ability to \" 'reasonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages,' \" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646. Pp. 389392. Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 379 Syllabus (c) This conclusion is not contrary to Wyatt v. Cole , 504 U. S. 158, or Richardson v. McKnight, supra. Wyatt did not implicate the reasons underlying recognition of qualied immunity because the defendant in that case had no connection to government and pursued purely private ends. Richardson involved the unusual circumstances of prison guards employed by a private company who worked in a privately run prison facility. Nothing of the sort is involved here, or in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist in carrying out its work. Pp. 392393. 621 F. 3d 1069, reversed. Roberts, C.

Section 1983 provides a cause of action against state ac\u00ad tors who violate an individual's rights under federal law. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. At common law, those who carried out the work of government enjoyed various protections from liability when doing so, in order to allow them to serve the government without undue fear of personal exposure. Our decisions have looked to these common law protections in affording either absolute or qualied immunity to individuals sued under \u00a7 1983. The question in this case is whether an individual hired by the government to do its work is prohib\u00adited from seeking such immunity, solely because he works for the government on something other than a permanent or full-time basis. I A Nicholas Delia, a reghter employed by the city of Rialto, California (or City), became ill while responding to a toxic spill in August 2006. Under a doctor's orders, Delia missed three weeks of work. The City became suspicious of Delia's extended absence, and hired a private investigation rm to conduct surveillance on him. The private investigators ob\u00adserved Delia purchasing building supplies\u2014including several rolls of fiberglass insulation\u2014from a home improvement store. The City surmised that Delia was missing work to Cooper, Jr., of Tennessee, Mark L. Shurtleff of Utah, Kenneth Cuccinelli II of Virginia, Rob McKenna of Washington, Darrell V. McGraw, Jr., of West Virginia, and Gregory A. Phillips of Wyoming; for the American Bar Association by Wm. T. Robinson III, Michael T. Kamprath, and Robert H.

White led a brief for the American Association for Justice as amicus curiae urging afrmance. Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 381 Opinion of the Court do construction on his home rather than because of illness, and it initiated a formal internal affairs investigation of him. Delia was ordered to appear for an administrative investi\u00ad gation interview. The City hired Steve Filarsky to conduct the interview. Filarsky was an experienced employment lawyer who had previously represented the City in several investigations. Delia and his attorney attended the inter\u00adview, along with Filarsky and two re department ofcials, Mike Peel and Frank Bekker. During the interview, Filar\u00adsky questioned Delia about the building supplies. Delia ac\u00adknowledged that he had purchased the supplies, but claimed that he had not yet done the work on his home. During a break, Filarsky met with Peel, Bekker, and Fire Chief Stephen Wells. Filarsky proposed resolving the in\u00advestigation by verifying Delia's claim that he had not done any work on his home. To do so, Filarsky recommended asking Delia to produce the building materials. Chief Wells approved the plan. When the meeting resumed, Filarsky requested permis\u00ad sion for Peel to enter Delia's home to view the materials. On the advice of counsel, Delia refused. Filarsky then asked Delia if he would be willing to bring the materials out onto his lawn, so that Peel could observe them without entering his home. Delia again refused to consent. Unable to obtain Delia's cooperation, Filarsky ordered him to produce the ma\u00adterials for inspection. Delia's counsel objected to the order, asserting that it would violate the Fourth Amendment. When that objection proved unavailing, Delia's counsel threatened to sue the City. He went on to tell Filarsky that \"[w]e might quite possibly nd a way to gure if we can name you Mr. Filarsky. . . . If you want to take that chance, you go right ahead.\" App. 131-132. The threat was repeated over and over: \"[E]very\u00adbody is going to get named, and they are going to sweat it out as to whether or not they have individual liability . . . .\" \"[Y]ou order him and you will be named and that is not an 382 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court idle threat.\" \"Whoever issues that order is going to be named in the lawsuit.\" \"[W]e will seek any and all damages including individual liability. . . . [W]e are coming if you order this.\" \"[M]ake sure the spelling is clear [in the order] so we know who to sue.\" Id., at 134-136, 148-149. Despite these threats, Filarsky prepared an order directing Delia to produce the materials, which Chief Wells signed. As soon as the interview concluded, Peel and Bekker fol\u00ad lowed Delia to his home. Once there, Delia, his attorney, and a union representative went into Delia's house, brought out the four rolls of insulation, and placed them on Delia's lawn. Peel and Bekker, who remained in their car during this process, thanked Delia for showing them the insulation and drove off. B Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 against the City, its re department, Chief Wells, Peel, Bekker, Fi\u00adlarsky, and 10 unidentied individuals, alleging that the order to produce the building materials violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Dis\u00adtrict Court granted summary judgment to all the individual defendants, concluding that they were protected by qualied immunity. The court held that Delia had \"not demonstrated a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,\" be\u00adcause \"Delia was not threatened with insubordination or ter\u00admination if he did not comply with any order given and none of these defendants entered [his] house.\" Delia v.

The Court of Ap\u00adpeals concluded that the order violated the Fourth Amend\u00adment, but agreed with the District Court that Delia \"ha[d] not demonstrated that a constitutional right was clearly established as of the date of Chief Wells's order, such that defendants would have known that their actions were unlaw\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 383 Opinion of the Court ful.\" Delia v. Rialto , 621 F. 3d 1069, 1079 (2010). As to Filarsky, however, the court concluded that because he was a private attorney and not a City employee, he was not enti\u00adtled to seek the protection of qualied immunity. Id., at 1080-1081. The court noted that its decision conflicted with a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, see Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F. 3d 301, 310 (1997), but consid\u00ad ered itself bound by Circuit precedent and therefore \"not free to follow the Cullinan decision.\" 621 F. 3d, at 1080 (citing Gonzalez v. Spencer , 336 F. 3d 832 (CA9 2003) (per curiam )). Filarsky led a petition for certiorari, which we granted. 564 U. S. 1066 (2011). II Section 1983 provides a cause of action against any person who deprives an individual of federally guaranteed rights \"under color\" of state law. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Anyone whose conduct is \"fairly attributable to the State\" can be sued as a state actor under \u00a7 1983. See Lugar v. Edmond- son Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 937 (1982). At common law, government actors were afforded certain protections from liability, based on the reasoning that \"the public good can best be secured by allowing ofcers charged with the duty of deciding upon the rights of others, to act upon their own free, unbiased convictions, uninfluenced by any apprehen\u00adsions.\" Wasson v. Mitchell, 18 Iowa 153, 155-156 (1864) (in\u00ad ternal quotation marks omitted); see also W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 25, p. 150 (1941) (common law protections derived from the need to avoid the \"impossible burden [that] would fall upon all our agencies of government\" if those acting on behalf of the government were \"unduly hampered and intim\u00adidated in the discharge of their duties\" by a fear of personal liability). Our decisions have recognized similar immunities under \u00a7 1983, reasoning that common law protections \" 'well grounded in history and reason' had not been abrogated 'by covert inclusion Imbler 384 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 418 (1976) (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951)). In this case, there is no dispute that qualied immunity is available for the sort of investigative activities at issue. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 243-244 (2009). The Court of Appeals granted this protection to Chief Wells, Peel, and Bekker, but denied it to Filarsky, because he was not a public employee but was instead a private individual \"retained by the City to participate in internal affairs in\u00advestigations.\" 621 F. 3d, at 1079-1080. In determining whether this distinction is valid, we look to the \"general principles of tort immunities and defenses\" applicable at common law, and the reasons we have afforded protection from suit under \u00a7 1983. Imbler , supra, at 418. A Under our precedent, the inquiry begins with the common law as it existed when Congress passed \u00a7 1983 in 1871. Tower v. Glover , 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984). Understanding the protections the common law afforded to those exercising government power in 1871 requires an appreciation of the nature of government at that time. In the mid-19th century, government was smaller in both size and reach. It had fewer responsibilities, and operated primarily at the local level. Local governments faced tight budget constraints, and generally had neither the need nor the ability to main\u00adtain an established bureaucracy staffed by professionals. See B. Campbell, The Growth of American Government: Governance From the Cleveland Era to the Present 14-16, 20-21 (1995); id., at 20 (noting that in nor's ofce staff in Wisconsin . . . totaled ve workers if we count the lieutenant governor and the janitor\"). As one commentator has observed, there was at that time \"no very clear conception of a professional ofce, that is, an ofce the incumbent of which devotes his entire time to the discharge of public functions, who has no other occupa\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 385 Opinion of the Court tion, and who receives a sufciently large compensation to enable him to live without resorting to other means.\" F. Goodnow, Principles of the Administrative Law of the United States 227 (1905). Instead, to a signicant extent, govern\u00adment was \"administered by members of society who tempo\u00adrarily or occasionally discharge[d] public functions.\" Id., at 228. Whether government relied primarily upon profes\u00ad sionals or occasional workers obviously varied across the country and across different government functions. But even at the turn of the 20th century, a public servant was often one who \"does not devote his entire time to his public duties, but is, at the same time that he is holding public ofce, permitted to carry on some other regular business, and as a matter of fact nds his main means of support in such business or in his private means since he receives from his ofce a compensation insufcient to support him.\" Id., at 227. Private citizens were actively involved in government work, especially where the work most directly touched the lives of the people. It was not unusual, for example, to see the owner of the local general store step behind a window in his shop to don his postman's hat. See, e. g., Stole Stamps, Maysville, Ky., The Evening Bulletin, p. 1, Sept. 25, 1895 (re\u00adporting that \"[t]he postofce and general store at Mount Hope was broken into,\" resulting in the loss of $400 worth of cutlery and stamps). Nor would it have been a surprise to nd, on a trip to the docks, the local ferryman collecting har\u00adbor fees as public wharfmaster. See 3 E. Johnson, A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians 1346 (1912). Even such a core government activity as criminal prosecu\u00ad tion was often carried out by a mixture of public employees and private individuals temporarily serving the public. At the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted, private lawyers were regularly engaged to conduct criminal prosecutions on behalf of the State. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Gibbs, 70 Mass. 146 (1855); White v. Polk County , 17 Iowa 413 (1864). Abraham 386 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court Lincoln himself accepted several such appointments. See, e. g., An Awful Crime and Speedy Punishment, Springeld Daily Register, May 14, 1853 (reporting that \"A. Lincoln, esq. was appointed prosecutor\" in a rape case). In addition, pri\u00advate lawyers often assisted public prosecutors in signicant cases. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Knapp, 10 Mass. 477, 490-491 (1830); Chambers v. State , 22 Tenn. 237 (1842). And public prosecutors themselves continued to represent private clients while in ofce\u2014sometimes creating odd conflicts of interest. See People v. Bussey , 82 Mich. 49, 46 N. W. 97, 98 (1890) (public prosecutor employed as private counsel by the defendant's wife in several civil suits against the defendant); Phillip v. Waller , 5 Haw. 609, 617 (1886) (public prosecutor represented plaintiff in a suit for malicious prosecution); Oliver v. Pate , 43 Ind. 132, 139 (1873) (public prosecutor who conducted a state prosecution against a defendant later served as counsel for the defendant in a malicious prosecu\u00adtion suit against the complaining witness). This mixture of public responsibility and private pursuits extended even to the highest levels of government. Until the position became full time in 1853, for example, the Attor\u00adney General of the United States was expected to and did maintain an active private law practice. To cite a notable illustration, in Hayburn's Case , 2 Dall. 409 (1792), the rst Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, sought a writ of man\u00addamus from this Court to compel a lower court to hear Wil\u00adliam Hayburn's petition to be put on the pension list. When this Court did not allow the Attorney General to seek the writ in his ofcial capacity, Randolph readily solved the prob\u00adlem by arguing the case as Hayburn's private lawyer. Ibid.; see also Letter from Edmund Randolph to James Madison (Aug. 12, 1792), reprinted in 14 The Papers of James Madison 348, 349 (R. Rutland, T. Mason, R. Brugger, J. Sisson, & F. Teute eds. 1983); Bloch, The Early Role of the Attorney Gen\u00aderal in Our Constitutional Scheme: In the Beginning There Was Pragmatism, 1989 Duke L. J. 561, 598-599, n. 121, 619. Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 387 Opinion of the Court Given all this, it should come as no surprise that the com\u00ad mon law did not draw a distinction between public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in accord\u00ading protection to those carrying out government responsibil\u00adities. Government actors involved in adjudicative activities, for example, were protected by an absolute immunity from suit. See Bradley v. Fisher , 13 Wall. 335, 347-348 (1872); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Non-Contract Law \u00a7 781 (1889). This immunity applied equally to \"the highest judge in the State or nation\" and \"the lowest ofcer who sits as a court and tries petty causes,\" T. Cooley, Law of Torts 409 (1879), including those who served as judges on a part-time or episodic basis. Justices of the peace, for example, often maintained active private law practices (or even had nonlegal livelihoods), and generally served in a judicial capacity only part time. See Hubbell v. Harbeck, 54 Hun. 147, 7 N. Y . S. 243 (1889); Ingraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847). In fact, justices of the peace were not even paid a salary by the gov\u00adernment, but instead received compensation through fees payable by the parties that came before them. See W. Mur\u00adfree, The Justice of the Peace \u00a7 1145 (1886). Yet the common law extended the same immunity \"to a justice of the peace as to any other judicial ofcer.\" Pratt v. Gardner , 56 Mass. 63, 70 (1848); see also Mangold v. Thorpe , 33 N. J. L. 134, 137-138 (1868). The common law also extended certain protections to in\u00ad dividuals engaged in law enforcement activities, such as sheriffs and constables. At the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted, however, \"[t]he line between public and private policing was frequently hazy. Private detectives and privately employed patrol personnel often were publicly appointed as special po\u00adlicemen, and the means and objects of detective work, in par\u00adticular, made it difcult to distinguish between those on the public payroll and private detectives.\" Sklansky, The Pri\u00advate Police, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1165, 1210 (1999) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted). The protections 388 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court provided by the common law did not turn on whether some\u00ad one we today would call a police ofcer worked for the gov\u00adernment full time or instead for both public and private employers. Rather, at common law, \"[a] special constable, duly appointed according to law, ha[d] all the powers of a regular constable so far as may be necessary for the proper discharge of the special duties intrusted to him, and in the lawful discharge of those duties, [was] as fully protected as any other ofcer.\" W. Murfree, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other Ministerial Ofcers \u00a7 1121, p. 609 (1884). Sheriffs executing a warrant were empowered by the com\u00ad mon law to enlist the aid of the able-bodied men of the com\u00ad munity in doing so. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 332 (1765); In re Quarles, 158 U. S. 532, 535 (1895). While serving as part of this \"posse comitatus,\" a private individual had the same authority as the sheriff, and was protected to the same extent. See, e. g., Robinson v. State , 93 Ga. 77, 83, 18 S. E. 1018, 1019 (1893) (\"A member of a posse comitatus summoned by the sheriff to aid in the execution of a warrant for [a] felony in the sheriff 's hands, is en\u00adtitled to the same protection in the discharge of his duties as the sheriff himself\"); State v. Mooring , 115 N. C. 709, 710- 711, 20 S. E. 182 (1894) (considering it \"well settled by the Courts\" that a sheriff may break open the doors of a house to execute a search warrant and that \"if he act in good faith in doing so, both he and his posse comitatus will be pro\u00ad tected\"); North Carolina v. Gosnell, 74 F. 734, 738-739 (CC WDNC 1896) (\"Both judicial and ministerial ofcers, in the execution of the duties of their ofce, are under the strong protection of the law; and their legally summoned assistants, for such time as in service, are ofcers of the law\"); Reed v. Rice , 25 Ky. 44, 46-47 (App. 1829) (private individuals sum\u00ad moned by a constable to execute a search warrant were pro\u00adtected from a suit based on the invalidity of the warrant). Indeed, examples of individuals receiving immunity for ac\u00ad tions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 389 Opinion of the Court or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself. See, e. g., Gregory v. Brooks, 37 Conn. 365, 372 (1870) (public wharfmaster not liable for ordering removal of a ves\u00adsel unless the order was issued maliciously); Henderson v. Smith, 26 W. Va. 829, 836-838 (1885) (notaries public given immunity for discretionary acts taken in good faith); Cham\u00ad berlain v. Clayton, 56 Iowa 331, 9 N. W. 237 (1881) (trustees of a public institution for the disabled not liable absent a showing of malice); McCormick v. Burt, 95 Ill. 263, 265-266 (1880) (school board members not liable for suspending a stu\u00addent in good faith); Donahoe v. Richards, 38 Me. 379, 392 (1854) (same); Downer v. Lent, 6 Cal. 94, 95 (1856) (members of a Board of Pilot Commissioners given immunity for ofcial acts); Rail v. Potts & Baker , 27 Tenn. 225, 228-230 (1847) (private individuals appointed by the sheriff to serve as judges of an election were not liable for refusing a voter ab\u00adsent a showing of malice); Jenkins v. Waldron, 11 Johns. 114, 120-121 (NY Sup. Ct. 1814) (same). We read \u00a7 1983 \"in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses.\" Imbler , 424 U. S., at 418. And we \"proceed[ ] on the assumption that common-law princi\u00adples of . . . immunity were incorporated into our judicial system and that they should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so.\" Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Under this assumption, immunity under \u00a7 1983 should not vary depending on whether an individual working for the government does so as a full-time employee, or on some other basis. B Nothing about the reasons we have given for recognizing immunity under \u00a7 1983 counsels against carrying forward the common-law rule. As we have explained, such immunity \"protect[s] government's ability to perform its traditional functions.\" Wyatt v. Cole , 504 U. S. 158, 167 (1992). It does so by helping to avoid \"unwarranted timidity\" in perform\u00adance of public duties, ensuring that talented candidates are 390 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court not deterred from public service, and preventing the harm\u00ad ful distractions from carrying out the work of government that can often accompany damages suits. Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 409-411 (1997). We have called the government interest in avoiding \"un\u00ad warranted timidity\" on the part of those engaged in the public's business \"the most important special government immunity-producing concern.\" Id., at 409. Ensuring that those who serve the government do so \"with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good,\" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 240 (1974), is of vital importance re\u00ad gardless whether the individual sued as a state actor works full time or on some other basis. Affording immunity not only to public employees but also to others acting on behalf of the government similarly serves to \" 'ensure that talented candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.' \" Richardson, supra, at 408 (quoting Wyatt, supra, at 167). The government's need to attract talented individuals is not limited to full-time public employees. Indeed, it is often when there is a particular need for specialized knowledge or expertise that the government must look outside its perma\u00adnent work force to secure the services of private individuals. This case is a good example: Filarsky had 29 years of special\u00adized experience as an attorney in labor, employment, and personnel matters, with particular expertise in conducting internal affairs investigations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59, 89; App. 156. The City of Rialto certainly had no permanent employee with anything approaching those qualications. To the extent such private individuals do not depend on the government for their livelihood, they have freedom to select other work\u2014work that will not expose them to liability for government actions. This makes it more likely that the most talented candidates will decline public engagements if they do not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their pub\u00adlic employee counterparts. Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 391 Opinion of the Court Sometimes, as in this case, private individuals will work in close coordination with public employees, and face threat\u00ad ened legal action for the same conduct. See App. 134 (De\u00adlia's lawyer: \"everybody is going to get named\" in threatened suit). Because government employees will often be pro\u00adtected from suit by some form of immunity, those working alongside them could be left holding the bag\u2014facing full liability for actions taken in conjunction with government employees who enjoy immunity for the same activity. Under such circumstances, any private individual with a choice might think twice before accepting a government assignment. The public interest in ensuring performance of govern\u00ad ment duties free from the distractions that can accompany even routine lawsuits is also implicated when individuals other than permanent government employees discharge these duties. See Richardson, supra, at 411. Not only will such individuals' performance of any ongoing government re\u00adsponsibilities suffer from the distraction of lawsuits, but such distractions will also often affect any public employees with whom they work by embroiling those employees in litigation. This case is again a good example: If the suit against Filar\u00adsky moves forward, it is highly likely that Chief Wells, Bek\u00adker, and Peel will all be required to testify, given their roles in the dispute. Allowing suit under \u00a7 1983 against private individuals assisting the government will substantially un\u00addermine an important reason immunity is accorded public employees in the rst place. Distinguishing among those who carry out the public's business based on the nature of their particular relationship with the government also creates signicant line-drawing problems. It is unclear, for example, how Filarsky would be categorized if he regularly spent half his time working for the City, or worked exclusively on one City project for an entire year. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-36. Such questions deprive state actors of the ability to \"reasonably anticipate 392 FILARSKY v. DELIA Opinion of the Court when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages,\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646 (1987) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), frustrating the pur\u00adposes immunity is meant to serve. An uncertain immunity is little better than no immunity at all. III Our decisions in Wyatt v. Cole , supra, and Richardson v. McKnight, supra, are not to the contrary. In Wyatt, we held that individuals who used a state replevin law to compel the local sheriff to seize disputed property from a former business partner were not entitled to seek qualied immu\u00adnity. Cf. Lugar , 457 U. S. 922 (holding that an individual who uses a state replevin, garnishment, or attachment stat\u00adute later declared to be unconstitutional acts under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983). We explained that the rea\u00adsons underlying recognition of qualied immunity did not support its extension to individuals who had no connection to government and pursued purely private ends. Because such individuals \"hold no ofce requiring them to exercise discretion; nor are they principally concerned with enhanc\u00ading the public good,\" we concluded that extending immunity to them would \"have no bearing on whether public ofcials are able to act forcefully and decisively in their jobs or on whether qualied applicants enter public service.\" 504 U. S., at 168. Wyatt is plainly not implicated by the circumstances of this case. Unlike the defendants in Wyatt, who were using the mechanisms of government to achieve their own ends, indi\u00adviduals working for the government in pursuit of govern\u00adment objectives are \"principally concerned with enhancing the public good.\" Ibid. Whether such individuals have as\u00ad surance that they will be able to seek protection if sued under \u00a7 1983 directly affects the government's ability to achieve its objectives through their public service. Put sim\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 393 Opinion of the Court ply, Wyatt involved no government agents, no government interests, and no government need for immunity. In Richardson, we considered whether guards employed by a privately run prison facility could seek the protection of qualied immunity. Although the Court had previously determined that public-employee prison guards were enti\u00adtled to qualied immunity, see Procunier v. Navarette , 434 U. S. 555 (1978), it determined that prison guards employed by a private company and working in a privately run prison facility did not enjoy the same protection. We explained that the various incentives characteristic of the private mar\u00adket in that case ensured that the guards would not perform their public duties with unwarranted timidity or be deterred from entering that line of work. 521 U. S., at 410-411. Richardson was a self-consciously \"narrow[ ]\" decision. Id., at 413 (\"[W]e have answered the immunity question nar\u00adrowly, in the context in which it arose\"). The Court made clear that its holding was not meant to foreclose all claims of immunity by private individuals. Ibid. Instead, the Court emphasized that the particular circumstances of that case\u2014 \"a private rm, systematically organized to assume a major lengthy administrative task (managing an institution) with limited direct supervision by the government, undertak[ing] that task for prot and potentially in competition with other rms\"\u2014combined sufciently to mitigate the concerns un\u00adderlying recognition of governmental immunity under \u00a7 1983. Ibid. Nothing of the sort is involved here, or in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist in carrying out its work. * * * A straightforward application of the rule set out above is sufcient to resolve this case. Though not a public em\u00adployee, Filarsky was retained by the City to assist in con\u00adducting an ofcial investigation into potential wrongdoing. There is no dispute that government employees performing 394 FILARSKY v. DELIA Ginsburg, J., concurring such work are entitled to seek the protection of qualied immunity. The Court of Appeals rejected Filarsky's claim to the protection accorded Wells, Bekker, and Peel solely be\u00adcause he was not a permanent, full-time employee of the City. The common law, however, did not draw such distinctions, and we see no justication for doing so under \u00a7 1983. New York City has a Department of Investigation staffed by full-time public employees who investigate city personnel, and the resources to pay for it. The City of Rialto has nei\u00adther, and so must rely on the occasional services of private individuals such as Filarsky. There is no reason Rialto's in\u00adternal affairs investigator should be denied the qualied im\u00admunity enjoyed by the ones who work for New York. In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying qualied immunity to Filarsky is reversed. It is so ordered. Justice Ginsburg , concurring. The Court addresses a sole question in this case: Is a pri\u00ad vate attorney retained by a municipality to investigate a per\u00ad sonnel matter eligible for qualied immunity in a suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 alleging a constitutional violation com\u00admitted in the course of the investigation? I agree that the answer is yes and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals holding private attorney Filarsky categorically ineligible for qualied immunity must be reversed. Qualied immunity may be overcome, however, if the defendant knew or should have known that his conduct violated a right \"clearly estab\u00adlished\" at the time of the episode in suit. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider the application of that standard to Filarsky, the matter, as I see it, may be pursued on remand. Filarsky was retained by the City of Rialto to investigate whether city reghter Delia was taking time off from work under the false pretense of a disabling physical condition. Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 395 Ginsburg, J., concurring In pursuit of the investigation, Filarsky asked Delia to con\u00ad sent to a search of his home to determine what Delia had done with several rolls of insulation he had recently pur\u00adchased at a home improvement store. When Delia, on coun\u00adsel's advice, refused to consent to the search, Filarsky \"hatch[ed] a plan\" to overcome Filarsky informed Delia. App. 129; see 621 F. 3d, 1077 (\"Unable to obtain Delia's consent to a warrant- of his house . . . , Filarsky tried a different tactic.\"). Following Filarsky's advice, Fire Chief Wells ordered Delia to bring the insulation out of his house and place the rolls on his lawn for inspection. App. 158. Filarsky recom\u00admended this course, the Ninth Circuit observed, mindful that \"an individual does not have an expectation of privacy in items exposed to the public, thereby eliminating the need for a search warrant.\" 621 F. 3d, at 1077. Delia complied with Chief Wells's order by producing the rolls, all of them un\u00adused, App. 78, 85, after which the investigation into the legit\u00adimacy of Delia's absence from work apparently ended. In explaining why the individual defendants other than Fi\u00ad larsky were entitled to summary judgment on their qualied immunity pleas, the Ninth Circuit stated that \"no . . . threat to [Delia's] employment\" Wells's order. 621 F. 3d, at 1079. The District Court similarly stated that \"Delia was not threatened with insubordination or termina\u00adtion if he did not comply with [the] order.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 48. These statements are at odds with the facts, as recounted by the Court of Appeals. \"At the onset of the interview,\" the Ninth Circuit stressed, \"Filarsky warned Delia that he was obligated to fully cooperate,\" and that \"[i]f at any time it is deemed you are not cooperating then you can be held to be insubordinate and subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\" 621 F. 3d, at 1072 (internal quota\u00ad396 FILARSKY v. DELIA Ginsburg, J., concurring tion marks omitted). Continuing in this vein, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"Delia's actions were involuntary and coerced by the direct threat of sanctions including loss of his reghter position.\" Id., at 1077; see id., at 1085 (\"Delia's actions were involuntary and occurred as a result of the di\u00adrect threat of sanctions.\"). In further proceedings upon return of this case to the Court of Appeals, these questions bear attention. First, if it is \"clearly established,\" as the Ninth Circuit thought it was, that \"the warrantless search of a home is presumptively unreasonable,\" id., at 1075, and that a well-trained investi\u00ad gating ofcer would so comprehend, 1 may an ofcial circum\u00ad vent the warrant requirement by ordering the person under investigation to cart his personal property out of the house for inspection? 2 And if it is \"clearly established\" that an employee may not be red for exercising a constitutional right, see id., at 1079, 3 is it not equally plain that discipline or discharge may not be threatened to induce surrender of such a right? In short, the Court has responded appropriately to the question tendered for our review, but the Circuit's law will 1 Delia also suggests that Filarsky's conduct should be measured against a \"reasonable attorney\" standard: whether an attorney providing advice in a public-employee investigation should have known that the search of Delia's personal property, stored in his home, would be lawless. See Brief for Respondent 45-46. 2 An additional inquiry may be appropriate: Although conceived as a substitute for a warrantless entry, should the inspection order Filarsky counseled pass muster as a permissible discovery device?

S. 186, 195, 208-211 (1946) (sub\u00ad poena duces tecum for a corporation's business records, authorized by \u00a7 9 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, encountered no Fourth Amendment shoal). 3 The Ninth Circuit referred to cases holding that public employees' job retention cannot be conditioned on relinquishing the Fifth Amendment's safeguard against self-incrimination: Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968), and Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U. S. 273 (1968). Cite as: 566 U. S. 377 (2012) 397 Sotomayor, J., concurring remain muddled absent the Court of Appeals' focused atten\u00ad tion to the question whether \"clearly established\" law. Justice Sotomayor , concurring. The Court of Appeals denied qualied immunity to Filar\u00ad sky solely because, as retained outside counsel, he was not a formal employee of the city of Rialto. I agree with and join today's opinion holding that this distinction is not a sound basis on which to deny immunity. I add only that it does not follow that every private indi\u00ad vidual who works for the government in some capacity nec\u00adessarily may claim qualied immunity when sued under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Such individuals must satisfy our usual test for conferring immunity. As the Court explains, that test \"look[s] to the 'general principles of tort immunities and de\u00adfenses' applicable at common law, and the reasons we have afforded protection from suit under \u00a7 1983.\" Ante, at 384 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 418 (1976)). Thus in Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997), we denied qualied immunity to prison guards who were privately employed, despite their quintessentially public function. We did so because we found \"no special reasons signicantly favoring an extension of governmental immu\u00adnity\" in that context. Id., at 412. We left open, however, the question whether immunity would be appropriate for \"a private individual briefly associated with a government body, serving as an adjunct to government in an essential govern\u00admental activity, or acting under close ofcial supervision.\" Id., at 413. Filarsky, supported by the United States as amicus cu\u00ad riae, contends that he ts into this coda because he worked in close coordination with and under the supervision of city employees. Whether Filarsky was supervised by those em\u00adployees, and did not himself do the supervising, is unclear. But there is no doubt that Filarsky worked alongside the 398 FILARSKY v. DELIA Sotomayor, J., concurring employees in investigating Delia. In such circumstances, I agree that Filarsky should be allowed to claim qualied immunity from a \u00a7 1983 suit. As the Court's opinion persua\u00adsively explains, there is a \" 'rmly rooted' tradition of immu\u00adnity\" applicable to individuals who perform government work in capacities other than as formal employees. Id., at 404; see ante, at 384-390. And conferring qualied immu\u00ad nity on individuals like Filarsky helps \"protec[t] govern\u00adment's ability to perform its traditional functions,\" and thereby helps \"protect the public at large.\" Wyatt v. Cole , 504 U. S. 158, 167-168 (1992). When a private individual works closely with immune government employees, there is a real risk that the individual will be intimidated from per\u00adforming his duties fully if he, and he alone, may bear the price of liability for collective conduct. See ante, at 391; see also ibid. (noting distraction caused to immune public employees by \u00a7 1983 litigation brought against nonimmune associates). This does not mean that a private individual may assert qualied immunity only when working in close coordination with government employees. For example, Richardson's suggestion that immunity is also appropriate for individuals \"serving as an adjunct to government in an essential govern\u00admental activity,\" 521 U. S., at 413, would seem to encompass modern-day special prosecutors and comparable individuals hired for their independence. There may yet be other cir\u00adcumstances in which immunity is warranted for private actors. The point is simply that such cases should be de\u00adcided as they arise, as is our longstanding practice in the eld of immunity law. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 399 Syllabus CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD., et al. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit No. 10-844. Argued December 5, 2011\u2014Decided April 17, 2012 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling of prescription drugs. A brand-name drug manufac\u00ad turer seeking FDA approval for a drug submits a new drug application (NDA) containing, among other things, a statement of the drug's compo\u00adnents and proposed labeling describing the uses for which the drug may be marketed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1), (d). Once the FDA has ap\u00adproved a brand manufacturer's drug, another company may seek permis\u00adsion to market a generic version by ling an abbreviated new drug ap\u00adplication (ANDA). See \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv). But the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that would infringe a brand manufacturer's patent. To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments require a brand manufacturer to submit its patent numbers and expiration dates, \u00a7 355(b)(1); and FDA regulations require a description of any method-of-use patent, known as a use code, see 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e). The FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufactur\u00aders supply. Instead, it simply publishes the codes, patent numbers, and expiration dates in a large volume known as the Orange Book. After consulting the Orange Book, an ANDA applicant enters one of several certications to assure the FDA that its generic drug will not infringe the brand's patent. If the patent has not expired, an applicant may fulll this requirement in one of two ways. First, it may submit a so-called section viii statement asserting that it will market the drug for only those methods of use not covered by the brand's patent, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(viii), and proposing a label that \"carves out\" method(s) of use, see 21 CFR \u00a7 314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA will not approve an ANDA with a section viii statement if the proposed label overlaps at all with the brand's use code. Second, the ANDA applicant may le a so-called paragraph IV certication stating that the brand's patent \"is invalid or will not be infringed by the [generic drug's] manufacture, use, or sale.\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Such l\u00ading is treated as an act of infringement, giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting in a delay in the generic drug's approval. 400 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Syllabus In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission issued a study detailing evi\u00ad dence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent information to the FDA in order to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs. In response, Congress created a statutory counterclaim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringement. The provision allows a generic manufacturer to \"assert a counterclaim seeking an order requir\u00ading the [brand] to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355] on the ground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). This case concerns the scope of the counterclaim provision. Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture the brand-name version of the diabetes drug repaglinide. The FDA has approved three uses of the drug, but Novo's method-of-use patent claims only one. Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of the drug for the other two approved methods of use. Caraco initially led a para\u00adgraph IV certication and, considering this an act of infringement, Novo brought suit. Caraco then submitted a section viii statement and a proposed label carving out Novo's patented therapy. But before the FDA could approve Caraco's ANDA, Novo changed its use code to indi\u00adcate that it held a patent on all three approved methods of using repag\u00adlinide. Because Caraco's proposed label now overlapped with Novo's use code, the FDA would not permit Caraco to employ section viii to bring its drug to market. Caraco led a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement ac\u00ad tion, seeking an order requiring Novo to \"correct\" its use code because the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of using repaglinide. The District Court granted Caraco summary judgment, but the Federal Circuit reversed. It read the counterclaim's phrase \"the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug\" as requiring Caraco to demonstrate that Novo's patent does not claim any approved method of use; because the patent covers one approved method, the counterclaim was unavailable. The court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not \"patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\" of \u00a7 355. That information, the court concluded, consists only of the patent number and expiration date expressly required by the statutory provisions. Held: A generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brand's patent as covering a particular method of using a drug. Pp. 412-426. (a) The parties rst dispute the meaning of \"not an\" in the phrase \"the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\" 402 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Syllabus claims no approved method of use, the remedy will always be to delete the patent information. And if the counterclaim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates, the Orange Book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction. Pp. 419-421. (d) Novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaim's drafting history, but neither overcomes the statutory text and context. The company rst points out that Congress failed to pass an earlier bill that would have required brands to le descriptions of method-of-use patents and would have allowed generic companies to bring civil actions to \"delete\" or \"correct\" the information led. Because that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, Novo contends that this Court cannot read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the same. But the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have caused its failure. And the limited criti\u00adcism of its mechanism for challenging brands' descriptions of their pat\u00adents focused on the creation of an independent cause of action\u2014stronger medicine than the counterclaim at issue here. Finally, between that bill's demise and the counterclaim's enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring brands to supply use codes. The counterclaim provision's drafters thus had no need to require this information. Novo next contends that Congress established the counterclaim only to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the Orange Book\u2014a problem that had come to light when the Federal Circuit held in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F. 3d 1323, that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent. Novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provision. But this Court thinks Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem: that ge\u00ad neric companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands' patent listings, and that the FDA therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market. Again, the proof of that lies in the statute itself\u2014its text and context demon\u00adstrate that the counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is baseless, but also (as here) when it is overbroad. Moreover, Congress's equation of the two situations makes perfect sense. In either case, the brand submits misleading patent information to the FDA, delaying or blocking approval of a generic drug that in\u00adfringes no patent and thus, under the statute, should go to market. Pp. 421-425. 601 F. 3d 1359, reversed and remanded. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Sotomayor, J., led a concurring opinion, post, p. 426. Cite as: 566 U.

Letter, and Daniel Tenny. Mark A. Perry argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Scott P . Martin, Michael A. Sitzman, and Josh A. Krevitt.* Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court. When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates an application to market a generic drug, it considers whether the proposed drug would infringe a patent held by the manu\u00adfacturer of the brand-name version. To assess that matter, the FDA requires brand manufacturers to submit descrip\u00adtions of the scope of their patents, known as use codes. The FDA does not attempt to determine if that information is accurate. Rather, the FDA assumes that it is so and decides whether to approve a generic drug on that basis. As a result, the breadth of the use code may make the differ\u00adence between approval and denial of a generic company's application. *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were led for AARP et al. by David A. Balto, Stacy Canan, and Michael Schuster; for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association by Roy T. Englert, Jr., and Mark T. Stancil; for Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., by Dan L. Bagatell and David J.

Scordino; for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America by Robert A. Long, Jr., and Natalie M. Derzko; and for the Washington Legal Founda\u00ad tion by Daniel J. Popeo and Richard A. Samp. Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 401 Syllabus Novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent claims no approved method of use, but Caraco reads this language to permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particular method that the ANDA applicant seeks to market. In isolation, either of these readings is plausible, so the meaning of the phrase \"not an\" turns on statutory context, see Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 139. This context favors Caraco: Congress understood that a drug may have multiple methods of use, not all of which a patent covers; and a section viii statement allows the FDA to approve a generic drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market. The statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones. Within this scheme, the coun\u00adterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand's assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic company wishes to pursue; the counterclaim's availability matches the availability of FDA approval under the statute. Pp. 413-417. (b) The parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as \"patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\" of \u00a7 355. A use code, which is a description of the patent, surely qualies as \"patent information.\" Novo nonetheless contends that use codes are not \"submitted under\" subsections (b) and (c) because those provisions expressly require an NDA applicant to provide only \"the patent number and the expiration date of any patent\" claiming the drug or a method of its use. But \u00a7\u00a7 355(b) and (c) also govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the FDA. The term \"under\" is broad enough to include patent information, like use codes, that brands submit as required by this scheme. This reading draws support from the Court's prior decisions in, e. g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 665-668, and Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135; and it is bolstered by Congress's use of the narrower phrases \"described in\" and \"prescribed by\" in neighboring provisions. See \u00a7\u00a7 355(c)(2), (d)(6). Again, conclusion that use codes are \"sub\u00admitted under\" \u00a7\u00a7 355(b) and (c) ts the broader statutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA's implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and so it is unsurprising that the counterclaim provision's language sweeps widely enough to embrace them. Pp. 417-419. (c) The counterclaim provision's description of available remedies dis\u00ad patches whatever remains of Novo's arguments. The Court's reading gives content to both remedies: It \"delete[s]\" a listing from the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and \"correct[s]\" the list\u00ading when the brand has misdescribed the patent's scope. By contrast, Novo's interpretation would all but read \"correct\" out of the statute. If, as Novo contends, the counterclaim is available only where the patent 404 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court In this case, we consider whether Congress has authorized a generic company to challenge a use code's accuracy by bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufacturer in a patent infringement suit. The relevant statute provides that a generic company \"may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand manufacturer] to correct or delete the patent information [it] submitted . . . under [two statutory subsections] on the ground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\" 117 Stat. 2452, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). We hold that a generic manufacturer may employ this provision to force cor\u00adrection of a use code that inaccurately describes the brand's patent as covering a particular method of using the drug in question. I A The FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling of prescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme. To begin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer wishes to market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA must include, among other things, a statement of the drug's components, scientic data showing that the drug is safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing the uses for which the drug may be marketed. See \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1), (d). The FDA may approve a brand-name drug for multiple methods of use\u2014either to treat different conditions or to treat the same condition in different ways. Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer's drug, another company may seek permission to market a generic version pursuant to legislation known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. See Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585. Those amend\u00adments allow a generic competitor to le an abbreviated new Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 405 Opinion of the Court drug application (ANDA) piggy-backing on the brand's NDA. Rather than providing independent evidence of safety and efcacy, the typical ANDA shows that the generic drug has the same active ingredients as, and is biologically equivalent to, the brand-name drug. See \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv). As we have previously recognized, this process is de\u00adsigned to speed the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 676 (1990). Because the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that would infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA's approval depends on the scope and duration of the patents cover\u00ading the brand-name drug. Those patents come in different varieties. One type protects the drug compound itself. Another kind\u2014the one at issue here\u2014gives the brand manu\u00adfacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of using the drug. In some circumstances, a brand manufacturer may hold such a method-of-use patent even after its patent on the drug compound has expired. To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as pat\u00ad ents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA regu\u00adlations direct brand manufacturers to le information about their patents. The statute mandates that a brand submit in its NDA \"the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the [brand] submit\u00adted the [NDA] or which claims a method of using such drug.\" \u00a7 355(b)(1). And the regulations issued under that statute require that, once an NDA is approved, the brand provide a description of any method-of-use patent it holds. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e) (2011). That description is known as a use code, and the brand submits it on FDA Form 3542. As later discussed, the FDA does not attempt to ver\u00adify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply. It simply publishes the codes, along with the corre\u00adsponding patent numbers and expiration dates, in a fat, 406 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court brightly hued volume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more ofcially denominated Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations). After consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an ANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic drug will not infringe the brand's patents. When no patents are listed in the Orange Book or all listed patents have expired (or will expire prior to the ANDA's approval), the generic manufacturer simply certies to that effect. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I)-(III). Otherwise, the appli\u00adcant has two possible ways to obtain approval. One option is to submit a so-called section viii statement, which asserts that the generic manufacturer will market the drug for one or more methods of use not covered by the brand's patents. See \u00a7 355( j)(2)(A)(viii). A section viii statement is typically used when the brand's patent on the drug compound has expired and the brand holds patents on only some approved methods of using the drug. If the ANDA applicant follows this route, it will propose labeling for the generic drug that \"carves out\" from the brand's ap\u00adproved label the still-patented methods of use. See 21 CFR \u00a7 314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA may approve such a modied label, see \u00a7 314.127(a)(7), as an exception to the usual rule that a generic drug must bear the same label as the brand-name product, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(v), (j)(4)(G). FDA acceptance of the carve-out label allows the gen\u00aderic company to place its drug on the market (assuming the ANDA meets other requirements), but only for a subset of approved uses\u2014i. e., those not covered by the brand's patents. Of particular relevance here, the FDA will not approve such an ANDA if the generic's proposed carve-out label over\u00adlaps at all with the brand's use code. See 68 Fed. Reg. 36682-36683 (2003). The FDA takes that code as a given: It does not independently assess the patent's scope or other\u00adwise look behind the description authored by the brand. According to the agency, it lacks \"both [the] expertise and Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 407 Opinion of the Court [the] authority\" to review patent claims; although it will for\u00ad ward questions about the accuracy of a use code to the brand, 1 its own \"role with respect to patent listing is ministe\u00ad rial.\" Id., at 36683; see ibid. (\"A fundamental assumption of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is that the courts are the appropriate mechanism for the resolution of disputes about the scope and validity of patents\"). 2 Thus, whether section viii is available to a generic manufacturer depends on how the brand describes its patent. Only if the use code pro\u00advides sufcient space for the generic's proposed label will the FDA approve an ANDA with a section viii statement. The generic manufacturer's second option is to file a so-called paragraph IV certication, which states that a listed patent \"is invalid or will not be infringed by the man\u00adufacture, use, or sale of the [generic] drug.\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will typi\u00adcally take this path in either of two situations: if it wants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving out those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as described above, that any carve-out label it is willing to adopt cannot avoid the brand's use code. Filing a paragraph IV certi\u00adcation means provoking litigation. The patent statute treats such a ling as itself an act of infringement, which gives the brand an immediate right to sue. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A). Assuming the brand does so, the FDA gener\u00adally may not approve the ANDA until 30 months pass or the court nds the patent invalid or not infringed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Accordingly, the paragraph IV 1 Under the FDA's regulations, any person may dispute the accuracy of patent information listed in the Orange Book by notifying the agency in writing. See 21 CFR \u00a7 314.53(f). The FDA will then request that the brand verify the information, but will make no changes \"[u]nless the [brand] withdraws or amends\" the listing. Ibid. 2 Several courts have afrmed the FDA's view of its ministerial role. See, e. g., Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 F. 3d 1335, 1349 (CA Fed. 2003); aaiPharma Inc. v. Thompson, 296 F. 3d 227, 242-243 (CA4 2002). That question is not before us, and we express no view on it. 408 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court process is likely to keep the generic drug off the market for a lengthy period, but may eventually enable the generic com\u00adpany to market its drug for all approved uses. In the late 1990's, evidence mounted that some brands were exploiting this statutory scheme to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs, and the Federal Trade Com\u00admission (FTC) soon issued a study detailing these anticom\u00adpetitive practices. See FTC, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study, pp. iii-vi (July 2002) (hereinafter FTC Study). That report focused attention on brands' submission of inaccurate patent information to the FDA. In one case cited by the FTC, Mylan Pharmaceuti\u00ad cals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F. 3d 1323 (CA Fed. 2001), a brand whose original patent on a drug was set to expire listed a new patent ostensibly extending its rights over the drug, but in fact covering neither the compound nor any method of using it. The FDA, as was (and is) its wont, ac\u00adcepted the listing at its word and accordingly declined to approve a generic product. The generic manufacturer sued to delete the improper listing from the Orange Book, but the Federal Circuit held that the Hatch-Waxman Amendments did not allow such a right of action. See id., at 1330-1333. As the FTC noted, that ruling meant that the only option for generic manufacturers in Mylan's situation was to le a paragraph IV certication (triggering an infringement suit) and then wait out the usual 30-month period before the FDA could approve an ANDA. See FTC Study 40-45. Congress responded to these abuses by creating a mecha\u00ad nism, in the form of a legal counterclaim, for generic man\u00adufacturers to challenge patent information a brand has submitted to the FDA. See Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117 Stat. 2452. The provision authorizes an ANDA applicant sued for patent infringement to \"assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand] to correct or delete the patent information sub\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 409 Opinion of the Court mitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of \u00a7 355] on the ground that the patent does not claim either\u2014 \"(aa) the drug for which the [brand's NDA] was ap\u00adproved; or \"(bb) an approved method of using the drug.\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). The counterclaim thus enables a generic competitor to obtain a judgment directing a brand to \"correct or delete\" certain patent information that is blocking the FDA's approval of a generic product. This case raises the question whether the counterclaim is available to x a brand's use code. B The parties to this case sell or seek to sell the diabetes drug repaglinide. Respondents (collectively Novo) manu\u00adfacture Prandin, the brand-name version of the drug. The FDA has approved three uses of Prandin to treat diabetes: repaglinide by itself; repaglinide in combination with thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of the drug for two of those uses. Novo originally owned a patent for the repaglinide com\u00ad pound, known as the '035 patent, but it expired in 2009. In 2004, Novo also acquired a method-of-use patent for the drug, called the '358 patent, which does not expire until 2018. That patent\u2014the one at issue here\u2014claims a F. 3d 1359, 1362 (CA Fed. 2010). Thus, Novo currently holds a patent for one of the three FDA-approved uses of repaglinide\u2014its use with met\u00adformin. But Novo holds no patent for the use of repaglinide with TZDs or its use alone. In 2005, Caraco led an ANDA seeking to market a generic version of repaglinide. At that time, the Orange Book entry for Prandin listed both the '035 patent (the drug 410 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court compound) and the '358 patent (the use of the drug with metformin). Caraco assured the FDA that it would not market its generic drug until the '035 patent expired, thus making that patent irrelevant to the FDA's review of the ANDA. Caraco led a paragraph IV certication for the remaining, '358 patent, stating that it was \"invalid or [would] not be infringed.\" \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra, at 407- 408. In accord with the patent statute, Novo treated this ling as an act of infringement and brought suit. When Caraco led its ANDA, Novo's use code for the '358 patent represented that the patent covered \" '[u]se of re\u00adpaglinide in combination with metformin to lower blood glucose.' \" 601 F. 3d, at 1362-1363. The FDA therefore ad\u00advised Caraco that if it did not seek to market repaglinide for use with metformin, it could submit a section viii statement. That would allow Caraco, assuming its ANDA was otherwise in order, to market its generic drug for the other two uses. Caraco took the FDA's cue and in 2008 submitted a section viii statement, with proposed labeling carving out Novo's patented metformin therapy. See App. 166-176. Before the FDA took further action, however, Novo changed its use code for the '358 patent. The new use code describes \" '[a] method for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.' \" 3 601 F. 3d, at 1363. Be\u00ad cause that code indicates that the '358 patent protects all three approved methods of using repaglinide to treat diabe\u00adtes, Caraco's proposed carve-out of metformin therapy was no longer sufcient; even with that exclusion, Caraco's label now overlapped with Novo's use code on the other two uses. 3 Novo asserts that it made the change so that its use code would mirror its label, which the FDA had just asked it to alter. See Brief for Respond\u00ad ents 14. But the FDA, in calling for new labeling, neither requested nor required Novo to amend its use code. And indeed, Novo's counsel con\u00adceded before the Federal Circuit that Novo modied its use code in part as \" 'a response to the [FDA's] section viii' \" suggestion. 601 F. 3d, at 1380-1381 (Dyk, J., dissenting). Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 411 Opinion of the Court And Caraco could not carve out those uses as well, because at that point nothing would be left for it to market. The FDA has approved repaglinide for only three uses, and Novo's use code encompassed them all. The FDA accord\u00adingly informed Caraco that it could no longer employ section viii to bring its drug to market. Caraco responded to Novo's new, preclusive use code by ling a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement suit. The counterclaim sought an order requiring Novo to \"correct\" its use code \"on the ground that [the '358] patent does not claim\" two approved methods of using repaglinide\u2014 alone and in combination with TZDs. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I); see supra, at 408-409. That order would permit the FDA to accept Caraco's proposed carve-out label and approve the company's ANDA. The District Court granted summary judgment to Novo to \"correct the '358 patent\" by submitting a new Form 3542 to the FDA that would \"reinstat[e] its former\" use code. App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a-66a. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Caraco lacked \"a statutory basis to assert a counterclaim.\" 601 F. 3d, at 1360. The court rst read the statutory phrase \"the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug\" to require Caraco to demonstrate that the '358 patent does not claim any approved method of use. See id., at 1365 (\" '[A]n approved method' means 'any approved method' \"). Because the patent covers one approved method of use\u2014 repaglinide in combination with metformin\u2014the counter\u00adclaim was unavailable. The court further ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not \"patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c).\" On the Federal Circuit's view, that information consists only of the patent number and expira\u00adtion date. See id., at 1366-1367. Judge Dyk dissented. He would have read the phrase \"the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug\" to include situations 412 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court where, as here, the use code wrongly indicates that the pat\u00ad ent covers one or more particular approved methods of use. See id., at 1376-1378. And he would have construed \"patent information submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\" to include use codes. See id., at 1370-1376. 4 We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1035 (2011), and now reverse. II We begin \"where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself.\" United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989). This case re\u00adquires us to construe two statutory phrases. First, we must decide when a \"patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using\" a drug. Second, we must determine the content of \"patent information submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\" of \u00a7 355. We consider both of those questions against the backdrop of yet a third statutory phrase, providing that the remedy for a prevailing counterclaimant is an order re\u00adquiring the brand \"to correct or delete\" that patent informa\u00adtion. And we consider each question in the context of the entire statute. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (Statutory interpretation focuses on \"the language itself, the specic context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole\"). We cannot say that the counterclaim clause is altogether free of ambigu\u00adity. But when we consider statutory text and context to\u00adgether, we conclude that a generic manufacturer in Caraco's position can use the counterclaim. 5 4 On remand from the Federal Circuit's decision, the District Court de\u00ad termined that the '358 patent was invalid and unenforceable. See 775 F. Supp. 2d 985 (ED Mich. 2011). The Federal Circuit stayed Novo's ap\u00ad peal from that judgment pending the decision here. 5 Before proceeding to the merits, we dispose of a recently raised ju\u00ad risdictional argument. Novo now contends that the federal courts lost subject-matter jurisdiction over this infringement action (including the counterclaim) at the moment Caraco led its section viii statement. On Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 413 Opinion of the Court A An ANDA applicant sued for patent infringement may bring a counterclaim \"on the ground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). The parties debate the meaning of this language. Novo (like the Federal Circuit) reads \"not an\" to mean \"not any,\" contending that \"the counterclaim is available only if the listed patent does not claim any (or, equivalently, claims no) approved method of using the drug.\" Brief for Respondents 29 (internal quotation marks omitted). By that measure, Caraco may not bring a counterclaim be\u00adcause Novo's '358 patent claims the use of repaglinide with In contrast, Caraco reads \"not an\" to mean \"not a particular one,\" so that the statute permits a counterclaim whenever the patent does not claim a method of use for which the ANDA applicant seeks to market the drug. On that view, the counterclaim is available here\u2014indeed, is available twice over\u2014because the '358 patent does not claim the use of repaglinide with TZDs or its use alone. Truth be told, the answer to the general question \"What does 'not an' mean?\" is \"It depends\": The meaning of the phrase turns on its context. See Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 139 (2010) (\"Ultimately, context determines Novo's theory, such a statement (unlike a paragraph IV certication) does not count as an act of infringement under the patent statute, see 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), and so cannot provide a jurisdictional basis for the suit. But that argument is wrong even assuming (as Novo contends) that Caraco's section viii ling terminated its paragraph IV certication and that a section viii ling is not an act of infringement. The want of an infringing act is a merits problem, not a jurisdictional one. Nothing in the section of the statute dening certain lings as acts of infringement suggests anything to the contrary. And \"we are not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such.\" Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 480 (2011). In the absence of such a bar, the federal courts have jurisdiction over this suit for a single, simple reason: It \"ar[ose] under a[n] Act of Congress relating to patents.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1338(a). 414 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court meaning\"). \"Not an\" sometimes means \"not any,\" in the way Novo claims. If your spouse tells you he is late because he \"did not take a cab,\" you will infer that he took no cab at all (but took the bus instead). If your child admits that she \"did not read a book all summer,\" you will surmise that she did not read any book (but went to the movies a lot). And if a sports-fan friend bemoans that \"the New York Mets do not have a chance of winning the World Series,\" you will gather that the team has no chance whatsoever (because they have no hitting). But now stop a moment. Suppose your spouse tells you that he got lost because he \"did not make a turn.\" You would understand that he failed to make a particular turn, not that he drove from the outset in a straight line. Suppose your child explains her mediocre grade on a college exam by saying that she \"did not read an assigned text.\" You would infer that she failed to read a specic book, not that she read nothing at all on the syllabus. And suppose a lawyer friend laments that in her last trial, she \"did not prove an element of the offense.\" You would grasp that she is speaking not of all the elements, but of a particular one. The examples could go on and on, but the point is simple enough: When it comes to the meaning of \"not an,\" context matters. 6 And the statutory context here supports Caraco's position. As described earlier (and as Congress understood), a single drug may have multiple methods of use, only one or some of which a patent covers. See, e. g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(b)(1) (requiring that an NDA applicant le information about \"any patent which claims the drug . . . or which claims a method 6 For this reason, we nd Novo's reliance on the occasional dictionary denition of \"a[n]\" unconvincing. Although \"an\" sometimes means \"any\" when used in negative structures, see, e. g., Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary 1 (2001) (fth denition), it sometimes does not. Cf. FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397, 402-407 (2011) (rejecting a proposed denition of \"personal\" because it did not always hold in ordinary usage and the statutory context suggested it did not apply). Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 415 Opinion of the Court of using such drug\" (emphasis added)). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorize the FDA to approve the marketing of a generic drug for particular unpatented uses; and section viii provides the mechanism for a generic company to iden\u00adtify those uses, so that a product with a label matching them can quickly come to market. The statutory scheme, in other words, contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones. Within that framework, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand's assertion of rights over whichever discrete use (or uses) the generic company wishes to pursue. That assertion, after all, is the thing blocking the generic drug's entry on the market. The availability of the counter\u00adclaim thus matches the availability of FDA approval under the statute: A company may bring a counterclaim to show that a method of use is unpatented because establishing that fact allows the FDA to authorize a generic drug via section viii. Consider the point as applied to this case. Caraco wishes to market a generic version of repaglinide for two (and only two) uses. Under the statute, the FDA could approve Car\u00adaco's application so long as no patent covers those uses, regardless whether a patent protects yet a third method of using the drug. Novo agrees that Caraco could bring a counterclaim if Novo's assertion of patent protection for repaglinide lacked any basis\u2014for example, if Novo held no patent, yet claimed rights to the pair of uses for which Car\u00adaco seeks to market its drug. But because Novo has a valid patent on a different use, Novo argues that Caraco's counter\u00ad claim evaporates. And that is so even though, once again, Caraco has no wish to market its product for that patented use and the FDA stands ready, pursuant to the statute, to approve Caraco's product for the other two. To put the mat\u00adter simply, Novo thinks the counterclaim disappears because it has a patent for a method of use in which neither Caraco nor the FDA is interested at all. \"It would take strong evi\u00ad416 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court dence to persuade us that this is what Congress wrought.\" Eli Lilly , 496 U. S., at 673. That \"not an\" sometimes (but sometimes not) means \"not any\" is not enough. Novo argues that our reading must be wrong because Con\u00ad gress could have expressly \"impose[d] additional . . on the term \"an approved method of us[e]\"\u2014and indeed did so in another place in the statute. Brief for Re\u00adspondents 31; 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). Novo points here to section viii itself, which applies when the brand's patent \"does not claim a use for which the [ANDA] appli\u00ad cant is seeking approval .\" \u00a7 355( j)(2)(A)(viii) (emphasis added). But the mere possibility of clearer phrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading of a statute; if it could (with all due respect to Congress), we would interpret a great many statutes differently than we do. Nor does Congress's use of more detailed language in another provision, enacted years earlier, persuade us to put the counterclaim clause at odds with its statutory context. That is especially so because we can turn this form of argument back around on Novo. Congress, after all, could have more clearly ex\u00adpressed Novo's proposed meaning in the easiest of ways\u2014by adding a single letter to make clear that \"not an\" really means \"not any.\" And indeed, Congress used a \"not any\" construction in the very next subclause, enacted at the very same time. See \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(II) (\"Subclause (I) does not authorize the assertion of a claim . . . in any [other] civil action\"). So if we needed any proof that Congress knew how to say \"not any\" when it meant \"not any,\" here we nd it. We think that sees, raises, and bests Novo's argument. Our more essential point, though, has less gamesmanship about it: We think that the \"not any\" construction does not appear in the relevant counterclaim provision because Con\u00adgress did not mean what Novo wishes it had. And we think that is so because Congress meant (as it usually does) for the provision it enacted to t within the statutory scheme\u2014here, Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 417 Opinion of the Court by facilitating the approval of non-infringing generic drugs under section viii. B Novo contends that Caraco's counterclaim must fail for an\u00ad other, independent reason: On its view (as on the Federal Circuit's), the counterclaim does not provide a way to correct use codes because they are not \"patent information submit\u00adted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\" of \u00a7 355. Once again, we disagree. The statute does not dene \"patent information,\" but a use code must qualify. It describes the method of use claimed in a patent. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e). That ts under any ordinary understanding of the language. 7 The more difcult question arises from the \"submitted under\" phrase. The subsections mentioned there\u2014(b) and (c) of \u00a7 355\u2014require an NDA applicant to submit speci\u00ad ed information: \"the patent number and the expiration date of any patent\" claiming the drug or a method of its use. 21 7 Novo's only counter is to redene a use code. Novo argues that a use code need not be tied to the patent at all\u2014that \"[t]he relevant regulation requires [NDA] applicants to provide [only] 'a description of each approved method of use or indication.' \" Brief for Respondents 48 (quoting 21 CFR \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1)). Because an \"indication\" refers generally to what a drug does (here, treat diabetes), see \u00a7 201.57(c)(2), Novo claims that a use code may sweep more broadly than the patent. But that is incor\u00adrect. First, Novo does not cite the regulations that specify the informa\u00adtion required for publication\u2014i. e., use codes. See \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3) (requiring a \"description of the patented method of use as required for publication\"); \u00a7 314.53(e) (\"[F]or each use patent,\" the FDA will publish \"the approved indications or other conditions of use covered by a patent\"). Those provisions (whether referring to methods of use, conditions of use, or indications) all demand a description of the patent. And second, even the provision Novo cites\u2014which mandates the submission of additional material, not listed in the Orange Book\u2014ties information about indica\u00adtions to patent coverage; that regulation requires (when quoted in full) that the brand provide \"a description of each approved method of use or indication and related patent claim of the patent being submitted.\" \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1). 418 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1), (c)(2). According to Novo, only that in\u00ad formation comes within the counterclaim provision. But subsections (b) and (c) as well govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the FDA, both before and after an NDA is approved. In partic\u00adular, those subsections provide the basis for the regulation requiring brands to submit use codes, see 21 CFR \u00a7 314.53; in issuing that regulation, the FDA noted that \"[o]ur princi\u00adpal legal authority . . . is section 505 of the act [codied at \u00a7 355], in conjunction with our general rulemaking author\u00adity,\" 68 Fed. Reg. 36697-36698 (specically referring to sub\u00ad sections (b) and (c)). And the form (Form 3542) on which brands submit their use codes states that the information appearing there is \"provided in accordance with Section [355](b) and (c).\" App. 97. So use codes fall within the counterclaim's ambit if the phrase \"submitted under\" reaches lings that not only subsections (b) and (c) themselves but also their implementing regulations require. Several of our cases support giving \"under\" this broad meaning. For example, in Eli Lilly , 496 U. S., at 665-668, we examined a similar statutory reference to the \"submis\u00adsion of information under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(e)(1). We noted there that submitting information \"under a Fed\u00aderal law\" suggests doing so \"in furtherance of or compliance with a comprehensive scheme of regulation.\" 496 U. S., at 667. Likewise, in Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991), we held that a regulatory proceeding \"under section 554,\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(C)(i), proceeding \"sub\u00adject to,\" \"by reason of the au\u00adthority of\" that statutory provision. So too here. \"Patent information submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\" most naturally refers to patent informa\u00adtion provided as part of the \"comprehensive scheme of regu\u00adlation\" premised on those subsections. Eli Lilly , 496 U. S., at 667. It includes everything (about patents) that the FDA Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 419 Opinion of the Court requires brands to furnish in the proceedings \"subject to,\" \"governed by,\" or conducted \"by of\" \u00a7\u00a7 355(b) and (c). Ardestani, 502 U. S., at 135. The breadth of the term \"under\" becomes particularly clear when com\u00adpared with other phrases\u2014\"described in\" and \"prescribed by\"\u2014appearing in neighboring provisions. See, e. g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(c)(2) phrases denote a patent number and expiration date and nothing more. In contrast, the word \"under\" naturally reaches beyond that most barebones infor\u00admation to other patent materials the FDA demands in the regulatory process. Once again, that congressional choice ts the broader stat\u00ad utory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA's imple\u00admentation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\u2014and no less so because a regulation, rather than the statute itself, requires their submission. Recall that those Amendments instruct the FDA (assuming other requirements are met) to approve an ANDA led with a section viii statement when it proposes to market a drug for only unpatented methods of use. To fulll that charge, the FDA must determine whether any patent covers a particular method of use; and to do that, the agency (which views itself as lacking expertise in patent matters, see supra, at 406-407, and n. 2) relies on the use codes submitted in the regulatory process. See 68 Fed. Reg. 36682-36683. An overbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the FDA's ability to approve generic drugs as the statute contemplates. So it is not surprising that the language Congress used in the counterclaim provi\u00adsion sweeps widely enough to embrace that ling. C Another aspect of the counterclaim provision\u2014its descrip\u00ad tion of available remedies\u2014dispatches whatever remains of Novo's arguments. According to the statute, a successful 420 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court claimant may obtain an order requiring the brand to \"correct or delete\" its patent information. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). Our interpretation of the statute gives content to both those rem\u00adedies: It deletes a listing from the Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent's scope. By contrast, Novo's two arguments would all but read the term \"correct\" out of the statute. Consider rst how Novo's an-means-any contention would accomplish that result. Recall that on Novo's view, a coun\u00adterclaim can succeed only if the patent challenged does not claim either the drug or any approved method of using it. See supra, at 413. But when a generic manufacturer makes that showing, the remedy must be to \"delete\" the listing; no correction would be enough. Novo agrees with that prop\u00adosition; \"[a]t bottom,\" Novo avers, \"the counterclaim is a delisting provision.\" Brief for Respondents 20. But that raises the obvious question: Why did Congress also include the term \"correct\" in the statute? Novo can come up with just one answer: The counterclaim, it proposes, can correct erroneous patent numbers. Imag\u00adine, for example, that Novo mistakenly entered the number '359, instead of '358, when submitting information about its repaglinide patent for publication in the Orange Book. Then, Novo suggests, Caraco could bring a counterclaim to challenge the inaccurate listing (on the ground that '359 does not claim any method of use), and the remedy would be \"cor\u00adrect[ion]\" (substituting an 8 for a 9). But we think Novo's admission that this scenario would be \"unusual,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, considerably understates the matter. As Novo con\u00adcedes, brands have every incentive to provide the right pat\u00adent number in the rst place, and to immediately rectify any error brought to their attention. See id., at 40-41. By doing so, they place both generic companies and the FDA on notice of their patents and thereby prevent infringement. And conversely, generics have little or no incentive to bring Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 421 Opinion of the Court a counterclaim that will merely replace one digit in the Orange Book with another. So we doubt Congress created a legal action to \"correct\" patent information just to x such scrivener's errors. See, e. g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (refusing to adopt an interpretation of a statute that would render a piece of it \"insignicant, if not wholly superfluous\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). That would have been, in the most literal sense, to make a federal case out of nothing. The same problem afflicts Novo's alternative contention\u2014 that \"patent information submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\" includes only numbers and expiration dates (and not use codes). Once again, we cannot think Congress included the remedy of \"correct[ion]\" so that courts could expunge typos in patent numbers. And not even Novo has proffered a way for the counterclaim to \"correct\" an erroneous expira\u00adtion date. Suppose, for example, that a brand incorrectly lists the expiration date of a valid patent as 2018 rather than 2015. The counterclaim would be useless: It authorizes a remedy only \"on the ground that\" the listed patent does not claim the drug or an approved method of using it\u2014and not\u00adwithstanding the wrong expiration date, this patent does so. Alternatively, suppose the brand lists a patent as having a 2018 expiration date when in fact the patent has already lapsed. Then, a generic manufacturer could bring a coun\u00adterclaim alleging that the patent no longer claims the drug or a method of using it\u2014but the appropriate remedy would be deletion, not correction, of the brand's listing. Novo's reading of \"patent information,\" like its reading of \"not an,\" effectively deletes the term \"correct\" from the statute. III Novo nally advances two arguments relating to the coun\u00ad terclaim's drafting history. Neither contention, however, overcomes the statutory text and context. Indeed, consid\u00ad422 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court eration of the provision's background only strengthens our view of its meaning. A Novo rst contends that our interpretation of the statute \"effectively resurrect[s] the scheme rejected by Congress.\" Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197, 203, n. 4 (1993)). In 2002, Novo notes, Con\u00adgress failed to pass a bill that would have required brands to le specied \"patent information,\" including, for method\u00adof-use patents, a description of \"the approved use covered by (engrossed bill). That bill would have al\u00adlowed a generic company to bring its own civil action\u2014not merely a counterclaim in ongoing litigation\u2014to \"delete\" or \"correct\" the information led. Id., at 8. The Senate ap\u00ad proved the bill, but the House of Representatives took no action on it. Novo argues that because this failed legislation would have allowed a generic company to challenge over-broad descriptions of a patent, we cannot read the statute Congress eventually enacted as doing so. We disagree. We see no reason to assume, as Novo does, that Congress rejected S. 812 because it required brands to submit patent information beyond a number and expiration date. Indeed, Novo's argument highlights the perils of rely\u00ading on the fate of prior bills to divine the meaning of enacted legislation. \"A bill can be proposed for any number of rea\u00adsons, and it can be rejected for just as many others.\" Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of En\u00ad gineers, 531 U. S. 159, 170 (2001). S. 812 contained numer\u00adous items, including a title on importing prescription drugs (no controversy there!), that may have caused its failure. See S. 812, Tit. II. Moreover, what criticism there was of the bill's mechanism for challenging brands' patent claims focused not on the specication of \"patent information,\" but instead on the creation of an independent cause of action\u2014 stronger medicine than the counterclaim Congress ulti\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 423 Opinion of the Court mately adopted.8 And nally, Novo ignores a likely cause for the redrafting of the provision on submitting information. Between S. 812's demise and the counterclaim's enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring brands to supply material concerning method-of-use patents, including use codes. The drafters of the counterclaim provision knew about that rule, 9 and had no need to duplicate its list of mandated lings. So the drafting history does not support Novo's conclusion. If anything, the statute's evolution indicates that Congress de\u00adtermined to enforce the FDA's new listing provisions, includ\u00ading its use-code requirement, through the new counterclaim. B Novo next argues that Congress established the counter\u00ad claim only to solve the problem raised by the Federal Cir\u00adcuit's decision in Mylan, 268 F. 3d 1323\u2014the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the Orange Book. In Mylan, as earlier described, a generic company alleged that a brand had listed a patent that covered neither the approved drug nor any method of using it, and brought an action seeking delisting. See supra, at 408. The Federal Circuit held that no such action was available, even assuming the allegation was true. Because several legislators saw Mylan as \"exemplif[ying]\" brands' \"perceived abuse\" of the FDA's patent listing practices, Brief for Respondents 35, Novo contends that we should construe the counterclaim pro\u00advision to aid only a generic company that \"nds itself in the 8 See, e. g., 148 Cong. Rec. 15424 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Gregg) (\"Prob\u00ad ably the most signicant issue is the fact that it creates a new cause of action\"); id., at 15431-15432 (remarks of Sen. Grassley) (similar); id., at 14434 (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (similar). 9 See, e. g., Hearings on Barriers to Entry in the Pharmaceutical Market\u00ad place before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong., 1st Sess., 5-8 (2003) (statement of Daniel Troy, Chief Counsel to the FDA); id., at 19 (statement of Sen. Schumer) (\"The bill provides a critical complement to the work FDA has done in clarifying its regulations on patent listing, but it goes much further\"). 424 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Opinion of the Court same position as Mylan was in Mylan,\" Supp. Brief in Oppo\u00ad sition 5-6. Once again, we think not. Maybe Mylan triggered the legislative effort to enact a counterclaim, or maybe it didn't: By the time Congress acted, it also had at hand an FTC study broadly criticizing brands' patent listings and an FDA rule designed to address the very same issue. See supra, at 408, 423. But even assuming Mylan \"prompted the pro\u00ad posal\" of the counterclaim, \"whether that alone accounted for its enactment is quite a different question.\" Eli Lilly , 496 U. S., at 670, n. 3 (emphasis deleted). Here, we think Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem\u2014that generic compa\u00ad nies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands' patent listings, and that the FDA therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market. The proof of that lies in the statute itself (where the best proof of what Congress means to address almost always resides). As we have described, the statute's text and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is base\u00ad less, but also (as here) when it is overbroad. See supra, at 412-421. In particular, Congress's decision to allow a coun\u00adterclaimant to seek \"correct[ion]\" of patent information explodes Novo's theory, because the remedy for a Mylan\u00ad type impropriety is complete delisting. And to make matters still easier, Congress's equation of the two situations\u2014the one in Mylan and the one here\u2014 makes perfect sense. Whether a brand lists a patent that covers no use or describes a patent on one use as extending to others, the brand submits misleading patent information to the FDA. In doing so, the brand equally exploits the FDA's determination that it cannot police patent claims. And the brand's action may in either case delay or block ap\u00adproval of a generic drug that infringes no patent\u2014and that under the statute should go to market. See supra, at 406- 407. That is the danger Caraco faces here, as much as it Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 425 Opinion of the Court was the threat in Mylan: Novo seeks to preclude Caraco from selling repaglinide for unpatented uses until 2018, when Novo's patent on a different use expires. Indeed, the need for the counterclaim is greater here than in Mylan. When a brand lists a patent that covers no use, a generic company has a pathway aside from the counter\u00adclaim to challenge the listing. As described earlier, the com\u00adpany may make a paragraph IV certication stating that the listed patent \"is invalid or will not be infringed\" by the ge\u00adneric drug. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra, at 407-408. If the brand sues, the generic company can argue that its product would not infringe the patent. Using the counterclaim may enable a generic manufacturer to obtain delisting more quickly, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 54; but even with\u00adout it, the company can eventually get a judgment of non-infringement enabling the FDA to approve its ANDA. In contrast, where (as here) a brand les an overbroad use code, a generic company cannot use paragraph IV litigation to that end. A paragraph IV certication (unlike a section viii statement) requires the generic company to propose labeling identical to the brand's; it cannot carve out any uses. See supra, at 406. And that proposed label will necessarily in\u00ad fringe because it will include the use(s) on which the brand does have a patent. So here, a paragraph IV suit cannot lead to a judgment enabling FDA approval; the counterclaim offers the only route to bring the generic drug to market for non-infringing uses. Novo's view eliminates the counter\u00adclaim where it has the greatest value. IV The statutory counterclaim we have considered enables courts to resolve patent disputes so that the FDA can fulll its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do not in\u00adfringe patent rights. The text and context of the provision demonstrate that a generic company can employ the counter\u00adclaim to challenge a brand's overbroad use code. We accord\u00ad426 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Sotomayor, J., concurring ingly hold that Caraco may bring a counterclaim seeking to \"correct\" Novo's use code \"on the not claim . . an approved method of using the drug\"\u2014indeed, does not claim two. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor , concurring. The Court today interprets the counterclaim set forth in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) to permit generic manufac\u00adturers to force brand manufacturers to \"correct\" inaccurate use codes. While I too nd the counterclaim not \"free of ambiguity,\" ante, at 412, I join the Court's opinion because I agree this is the most sensible reading in light of the existing regulatory scheme. I write separately to add the following observations. I I rst underscore that the counterclaim can only lessen the difculties created by an overly broad use code; it cannot x them. The statutory scheme is designed to speed the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. See ante, at 405 (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 676 (1990)). To that end, the statute provides for the rapid approval of a drug that a generic manufacturer seeks to market for unpatented methods of use. The manufac\u00adturer need only submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with a section viii statement and a proposed label that \"carves out\" from the brand manufacturer's label any patented methods of use. See ante, at 406. So long as the use code is not overly broad (and all else is in order), the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may approve the application without requiring any further steps relating to the patent, and the generic drug may reach the public without undue delay. See ibid. Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 427 Sotomayor, J., concurring An overly broad use code \"throws a wrench\" into that scheme. Ante, at 419. The reason why is simple: FDA re\u00ad lies on use codes in determining whether to approve an ANDA, but it refuses to evaluate the accuracy of those use codes. See ante, at 406-407. Thus, if the use code overlaps with the generic manufacturer's proposed carve-out label (i. e., if the use code is overly broad), FDA will not approve an ANDA with a section viii statement. See ibid. After today's opinion, the generic manufacturer can re\u00ad spond to this situation by taking the following steps: submit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certication (which requires a proposed label materially identical to the brand manufac\u00adturer's label, see ante, at 425), wait for the brand manu\u00ad facturer to institute suit, le a counterclaim, litigate the counterclaim, and, if successful in securing the correction of the use code, return to the start of the process and do what it always wanted to do\u2014le an ANDA with a section viii statement and a carve-out label. The problem with this process is twofold. First, it results in delay and expense the statutory scheme does not envision. Second, there is no guarantee the process will work. It depends on the brand manufacturer initiating paragraph IV litigation, but it is not obvious the brand will have any incen\u00adtive to do so. In light of today's holding, the upshot of such litigation will be the correction of the use code through the assertion of a counterclaim\u2014an outcome that is desirable, to be sure, for the generic manufacturer, but perhaps less so for the brand manufacturer. Meanwhile, it is not clear what happens if the brand manu\u00ad facturer does not le suit. FDA may approve the generic manufacturer's application, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii), \"without prejudice to infringement claims the patent owner might assert when the ANDA applicant produces or mar\u00adkets the generic drug.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6 (hereinafter United States Brief). But the generic manufacturer, having been forced to proceed with a para\u00ad428 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Sotomayor, J., concurring graph IV certication, will have secured approval to mar\u00ad ket a drug with a label materially identical to the brand manufacturer's. That is not a position I imagine a generic manufacturer wants to be in: As the Solicitor General's Ofce informed us at argument, \"[i]t would be inducement of in\u00adfringement to sell a product with labeling that suggests that the product be used for a patented method of use.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 24; see also United States Brief 32 (noting that in this situation, if a generic manufacturer proceeded with a paragraph IV certication, \"[s]o long as the [new drug application (NDA)] holder's patent covers some approved method of using the approved drug, the proposed labeling will be infringing\" (emphasis deleted)). In short, the counterclaim cannot restore the smooth working of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an overly broad use code. At best, it permits the generic manufac\u00adturer to do what the scheme contemplates it should do\u2014le an ANDA with a section viii statement\u2014but only after ex\u00adpensive and time-consuming litigation. A x is in order, but it must come from Congress or FDA. II Precisely because the regulatory scheme depends on the accuracy and precision of use codes, I nd FDA's guidance as to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes remarkably opaque. The relevant regulation states simply that a brand manufacturer must provide \"[t]he description of the patented method of use as required for publication.\" 21 CFR \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3) (2011). The form on which brand manufacturers submit that information provides some addi\u00adtional detail, explaining that \"[e]ach approved use claimed by the patent should be separately identied . . . and contain adequate information to assist . . . applicants in determining whether a listed method of use patent claims a use for which the . . . applicant is not seeking approval.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 214a. But it also provides that brand manufacturers Cite as: 566 U. S. 399 (2012) 429 Sotomayor, J., concurring may \"us[e] no more than 240 total characters including spaces,\" id., at 213a, and elsewhere FDA acknowledges \"that in some cases 240 characters may not fully describe the use as claimed in the patent,\" 68 Fed. Reg. 36683 (2003); see also ibid. (indicating for this reason that use codes \"are not meant to substitute for the applicant's review of the patent\"). Indeed, in some respects we are here today because of FDA's opacity in describing what is required of brand manu\u00adfacturers. In its initial NDA ling, Novo submitted a use code for the '358 patent that was not \"overly broad\": It de\u00adscribed narrowly the single patented method of use. App. 54-55, 99. Some years later FDA required that Novo amend its label to \"[r]eplace all the separate indications\" \"with the following sentence: 'Prandin is indicated as an ad\u00adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.' \" Id., at 163-164, 215. Novo then amended its use code to track the new label, id., at 482-486, explaining that the amendment \"correspond[ed] with the change in labeling required by FDA,\" id., at 483. Novo understood its amended use code to comply with FDA regulations, likely on the ground it pressed before us: that the regulations permit a brand manufacturer to submit for publication in the Orange Book a description of either the patented method of use or the indication (which refers to \"what a drug does,\" ante , at 417, n. 7). Brief for Respond\u00ad ents 10, 22, 48-50. For the reasons explained by the Court, see ante, at 417, n. 7, Novo is mistaken. But the company can hardly be faulted for so thinking. The regulations also require sub\u00admission of \"a description of each approved method of use or indication,\" 21 CFR \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1), and the form on which brand manufacturers submit use codes requires \"infor\u00admation on the indication or method of use for the Orange Book 'Use Code' description,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 213a; see also ibid. (explaining brand manufacturers should \"[s]ub\u00ad mit the description of the approved indication or method of 430 CARA CO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v. NOVO NORDISK A/S Sotomayor, J., concurring use that you propose FDA include as the 'Use Code' in the Orange Book\"). Those sources at the least suggest (as Novo thought) that a method of use here is distinct from an indica\u00adtion and that either sufces as a use code. Prior to enactment of the counterclaim provision, Con\u00ad gress considered a bill that required brand manufacturers to submit a \"description of 'the approved use covered by the [patent] claim,' \" and that allowed a generic manufacturer to bring a civil action to correct that information. See ante, at 422. Congress rejected the bill, in part over criticism that it would encourage excess litigation.* Absent greater clarity from FDA concerning what is required of brand manufactur\u00aders in use codes, Congress' fears of undue litigation may be realized. *See, e. g., 148 Cong.

OCTOBER TERM, 2011 431 Syllabus KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE v. HYATT certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit No. 10-1219. Argued January 9, 2012\u2014Decided April 18, 2012 Under the Patent Act of 1952, if a Patent and Trademark Ofce (PTO) examiner denies a patent application, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 131, the applicant may le an administrative appeal with the PTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, \u00a7 134. If the Board also denies the application, the applicant may appeal directly to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under \u00a7 141. Alternatively, the applicant may le a civil action against the PTO Director under \u00a7 145, which permits the applicant to present evidence that was not presented to the PTO. Respondent Hyatt led a patent application covering multiple claims. The patent examiner denied all of the claims for lack of an adequate written description. Hyatt appealed to the Board, which approved some claims but denied others. Pursuant to \u00a7 145, Hyatt led a civil action against the Director, but the District Court declined to consider Hyatt's newly proffered written declaration in support of the adequacy of his description, thus limiting its review to the administrative record. Applying the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard of the Admin\u00adistrative Procedure Act (APA) to the PTO's factual ndings, the court granted summary judgment to the Director. On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that patent applicants can intro\u00adduce new evidence in \u00a7 145 proceedings, subject only to the limitations in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Proce\u00addure. It also reafrmed its precedent that when new, conflicting evi\u00addence is introduced, the district court must make de novo ndings to take such evidence into account. Held: There are no limitations on a patent applicant's ability to introduce new evidence in a \u00a7 145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Proce\u00addure. If new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact, the district court must make de novo factual ndings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the PTO. Pp. 437446. (a) Section 145, by its express terms, neither imposes unique eviden\u00ad tiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened 432 KAPPOS v. HYATT Syllabus standard of review for PTO factual ndings. Nonetheless, the Director contends that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and impose a deferential standard of re\u00adview in \u00a7 145 proceedings. As the Director concedes, however, judicial review in \u00a7 145 proceedings is not limited to the administrative record because the district court may consider new evidence. If it does so, the district court must act as a factnder and cannot apply the APA's deferential standard to PTO factual ndings when those ndings are contradicted by new evidence. Moreover, the doctrine of administra\u00adtive exhaustion\u2014the primary purpose of which is \"the avoidance of pre\u00admature interruption of the administrative process,\" McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193\u2014does not apply because the PTO process is complete by the time a \u00a7 145 proceeding occurs. Pp. 437439. (b) The core language of the 1870 Patent Act, codied as Revised Statute \u00a7 4915 (R. S. 4915), remains largely unchanged in \u00a7 145. Deci\u00adsions interpreting R. S. 4915 thus inform this Court's understanding of \u00a7 145. Both Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe , 112 U. S. 50, and Morgan v. Daniels, 153 U. S. 120, describe the nature of R. S. 4915 proceedings, but the two opinions can be perceived as being in some tension. Butterworth described the proceeding as an original civil ac\u00ad tion seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application, while Morgan described it as a suit for judicial review of agency action under a deferential standard. The cases are distinguishable, however, because they addressed different circumstances. Butterworth dis\u00ad cussed a patent applicant's challenge to the denial of his application, whereas Morgan involved an interference proceeding that would now be governed by \u00a7 146, not \u00a7 145, and in which no new evidence was pre\u00adsented. Here, this Court is concerned only with a \u00a7 145 proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the District Court, so Butter- worth guides this Court's decision. Thus, a district court conducting a \u00a7 145 proceeding may consider all competent evidence adduced and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the PTO. The introduction of new evidence in \u00a7 145 pro\u00adceedings is subject only to the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Fed\u00ad eral Rules of Civil Procedure, and if new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed factual question, de novo ndings by the district court will be necessary for that new evidence to be taken into account along with the evidence before the Board. Pp. 439445. (c) The district court may, however, consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the newly proffered evidence before the PTO in deciding what weight to afford that evidence. P. 445. 625 F. 3d 1320, afrmed and remanded. Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 433 Opinion of the Court Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Sotomayor, J., led a concurring opinion, in which Breyer, J., joined, post, p. 446. Ginger D. Anders argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Verrilli, Assistant Attorney General West, Deputy Solicitor General Stewart, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brinkmann, Raymond T. Chen, Robert J. McManus, and Thomas W. Krause. Aaron M. Panner argued the cause and led a brief for respondent.* Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. The Patent Act of 1952, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 100 et seq., grants a patent applicant whose claims are denied by the Patent and Trademark Ofce (PTO) the opportunity to challenge the PTO's decision by ling a civil action against the Director of the PTO in federal district court. In such a proceeding, the applicant may present evidence to the district court that he did not present to the PTO. This case requires us to con\u00adsider two questions. First, we must decide whether there are any limitations on the applicant's ability to introduce new evidence before the district court. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that there are no evidentiary restrictions beyond those already imposed by the Federal Rules of Evi\u00addence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Second, we must determine what standard of review the district court should apply when considering new evidence. On this *John A. Dragseth, Lauren A. Degnan, Tina M. Chappell, Kevin T. Kramer, and Horacio E. Guti\u00e9rrez led a brief for Intel Corp. et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.

HYATT Opinion of the Court question, we hold that the district court must make a de novo nding when new evidence is presented on a disputed ques\u00ad tion of fact. In deciding what weight to afford that evi\u00addence, the district court may, however, consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the evidence to the PTO. I The Patent Act of 1952 establishes the process by which the PTO examines patent applications. A patent examiner rst determines whether the application satises the statu\u00adtory prerequisites for granting a patent. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 131. If the examiner denies the application, the applicant may le an administrative appeal with the PTO's Board of Patent Ap\u00adpeals and Interferences (Board). \u00a7 134. If the Board also denies the application, the Patent Act gives the disappointed applicant two options for judicial review of the Board's deci\u00adsion. The applicant may either: (1) appeal the decision di\u00adrectly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to \u00a7 141; or (2) le a civil action against the Director of the PTO in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to \u00a7 145. 1 In a \u00a7 141 proceeding, the Federal Circuit must review the PTO's decision on the same administrative record that was before the PTO. \u00a7 144. Thus, there is no opportunity for the applicant to offer new evidence in such a proceeding. In 1 On September 16, 2011, the President signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 125 Stat. 284, into law. That Act made signicant changes to Title 35 of the United States Code, some of which are related to the subject matter of this case. For example, the Act changed the venue for \u00a7 145 actions from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, id., at 316, changed the name of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, id., at 290, and changed the name of interferences to derivation proceedings, ibid. Nei\u00ad ther party contends that the Act has any effect on the questions before us, and all references and citations in this opinion are to the law as it existed prior to the Act. Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 435 Opinion of the Court Dickinson v. Zurko , 527 U. S. 150 (1999), we addressed the standard that governs the Federal Circuit's review of the PTO's factual ndings. We held that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 701 et seq., applies to \u00a7 141 proceedings and that the Federal Circuit therefore should set aside the PTO's factual ndings only if they are \" 'unsup\u00adported by substantial evidence.' \" 527 U. S., at 152 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706). In Zurko , we also noted that, unlike \u00a7 141, \u00a7 145 permits the applicant to present new evidence to the district court that was not presented to the PTO. 527 U. S., at 164. This opportunity to present new evidence is signicant, not the least because the PTO generally does not accept oral testi\u00admony. See Brief for Petitioner 40, n. 11. We have not yet addressed, however, whether there are any limitations on the applicant's ability to introduce new evidence in such a proceeding or the appropriate standard of review that a dis\u00adtrict court should apply when considering such evidence. II In 1995, respondent Gilbert Hyatt led a patent appli\u00ad cation that, as amended, included 117 claims. The PTO's patent examiner denied each claim for lack of an adequate written description. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 112 (requiring patent applications to include a \"specication\" that provides, among other information, a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it). Hyatt appealed the examiner's decision to the Board, which eventu\u00adally approved 38 claims, but denied the rest. Hyatt then led a \u00a7 145 action in Federal District Court against the Di\u00adrector of the PTO (Director), petitioner here. To refute the Board's conclusion that his patent application lacked an adequate written description, Hyatt submitted a written declaration to the District Court. In the declara\u00adtion, Hyatt identied portions of the patent specication that, in his view, supported the claims that the Board held 436 KAPPOS v. HYATT Opinion of the Court were not patentable. The District Court determined that it could not consider Hyatt's declaration because applicants are \" 'precluded from presenting new issues, at least in the ab\u00adsence of some reason of justice put forward for failure to present the issue to the Patent Ofce.' \" Hyatt v. Dudas, Civ. Action No. 03-0901 (D DC, Sept. 30, 2005), p. 9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a (quoting DeSeversky v. Brenner 858 (CADC 1970) (per curiam)). Because the excluded declaration was the only additional evidence submitted by Hyatt in the \u00a7 145 proceeding, the evidence remaining before the District Court consisted entirely of the PTO's adminis\u00adtrative record. Therefore, the District Court reviewed all of the PTO's factual ndings under the APA's deferential \"substantial evidence\" Mazzari v. Rogan, 323 F. 3d 1000, 1004-1005 (CA Fed. 2003). Applying that stand\u00ad ard, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Director. Hyatt appealed to the Federal Circuit. A divided panel afrmed, holding that the APA imposed restrictions on the admission of new evidence in a \u00a7 145 proceeding and that the district court's review is not \"wholly de novo.\" Hyatt v. Doll, 576 F. 3d 1246, 1269-1270 (2009). The Federal Circuit granted rehearing en banc and vacated the District Court's grant of summary judgment. The en banc court rst held \"that Congress intended that applicants would be free to in\u00adtroduce new evidence in \u00a7 145 proceedings subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" even if the applicant had no justication for failing to present the evidence to the PTO. 625 F. 3d 1320, 1331 (2010). Reaf\u00adrming its precedent, the court also held that when new, conflicting evidence is introduced in a \u00a7 145 proceeding, the district court must make de novo ndings to take such evi\u00ad dence into account. Id., at 1336. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. 1036 (2011), and now afrm. Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 437 Opinion of the Court III The Director challenges both aspects of the Federal Cir\u00ad cuit's decision. First, the Director argues that a district court should admit new evidence in a \u00a7 145 action only if the proponent of the evidence had no reasonable opportunity to present it to the PTO in the rst instance. Second, the Di\u00adrector contends that, when new evidence is introduced, the district court should overturn the PTO's factual ndings only if the new evidence clearly establishes that the agency erred. Both of these arguments share the premise that \u00a7 145 creates a special proceeding that is distinct from a typical civil suit led in federal district court and that is thus governed by a different set of procedural rules. To support this interpre\u00adtation of \u00a7 145, the Director relies on background principles of administrative law and pre-existing practice under a pat\u00adent statute that predated \u00a7 145. For the reasons discussed below, we nd that neither of these factors justies a new evidentiary rule or a heightened standard of review for fac\u00adtual ndings in \u00a7 145 proceedings. A To address the Director's challenges, we begin with the text of \u00a7 145. See, e. g., Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U. S. 320, 331 (2010). Section 145 grants a disappointed patent applicant a \"remedy by civil action against the Director.\" The section further explains that the district court \"may ad\u00ad judge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention, as specied in any of his claims involved in the decision of the [PTO], as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the Director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law.\" By its terms, \u00a7 145 neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of review for factual ndings by the PTO. 438 KAPPOS v. HYATT Opinion of the Court B In the absence of express support for his position in the text of \u00a7 145, the Director argues that the statute should be read in light of traditional principles of administrative law, which Congress codied in the APA. The Director notes that \u00a7 145 requires a district court to review the reasoned decisionmaking of the PTO, an executive agency with specic authority and expertise. Accordingly, the Director contends that a district court should defer to the PTO's factual nd\u00adings. The Director further contends that, given the tradi\u00adtional rule that a party must exhaust his administrative rem\u00adedies, a district court should consider new evidence only if the party did not have an opportunity to present it to the agency. We reject the Director's contention that background prin\u00ad ciples of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and require a deferential standard of review in a \u00a7 145 proceeding. Under the APA, judicial review of an agency decision is typically limited to the administrative rec\u00adord. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706. But, as the Director concedes, \u00a7 145 proceedings are not so limited, for the district court may consider new evidence. When the district court does so, it must act as a factnder. Zurko , 527 U. S., at 164. In that role, it makes little sense for the district court to apply a deferential standard of review to PTO factual ndings that are contradicted by the new evidence. The PTO, no matter how great its authority or expertise, cannot account for evi\u00addence that it has never seen. Consequently, the district court must make its own ndings de novo and does not act as the \"reviewing court\" envisioned by the APA. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706. We also conclude that the principles of administrative ex\u00ad haustion do not apply in a \u00a7 145 proceeding. The Director argues that applicants must present all available evidence to the PTO to permit the PTO to develop the necessary facts and to give the PTO the opportunity to properly apply the Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 439 Opinion of the Court Patent Act in the rst instance. Brief for Petitioner 21-22 (citing McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193-194 (1969)). But as this Court held in McKart, a primary purpose of administrative exhaustion \"is, of course, the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process.\" Id., at 193. That rationale does not apply here because, by the time a \u00a7 145 proceeding occurs, the PTO's process is complete. Section 145, moreover, does not pro\u00advide for remand to the PTO to consider new evidence, and there is no pressing need for such a procedure because a district court, unlike a court of appeals, has the ability and the competence to receive new evidence and to act as a fact-nder. In light of these aspects of \u00a7 145 proceedings\u2014at least in those cases in which new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed question of fact\u2014we are not persuaded by the Director's suggestion that \u00a7 145 proceed\u00adings are governed by the deferential principles of agency review. C Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor back\u00ad ground principles of administrative law support an eviden\u00adtiary limit or a heightened standard of review for factual ndings in \u00a7 145 proceedings, we turn to the evidentiary and procedural rules that were in effect when Congress enacted \u00a7 145 in 1952. Although \u00a7 145 is a relatively modern statute, the language in that provision originated in the Act of July 8, 1870 (1870 Act), ch. 230, 16 Stat. 198, and the history of \u00a7 145 proceedings can be traced back to the Act of July 4, 1836 (1836 Act), ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117. Thus, we begin our inquiry with the 1836 Act, which established the Patent Of\u00adce, the PTO's predecessor, and rst authorized judicial re\u00adview of its decisions. 1 The 1836 Act provided that a patent applicant could bring a bill in equity in federal district court if his application was 440 KAPPOS v. HYATT Opinion of the Court denied on the ground that it would interfere with another patent. Id., at 123-124; see also B. Shipman, Handbook of the Law of Equity Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 101-103, pp. 168-171 (1897). Three years later, Congress expanded that provision, making judicial review available whenever a patent was refused on any ground. Act of Mar. 3, 1839, 5 Stat. 354. Pursuant to these statutes, any disappointed patent applicant could le a bill in equity to have the district court \"adjudge\" whether the applicant was \"entitled, according to the principles and provisions of [the Patent Act], to have and receive a patent for his invention.\" 1836 Act, 5 Stat. 124. In 1870, Congress amended the Patent Act again, adding intermediate layers of administrative review and introduc\u00ading language describing the proceeding in the district court. 16 Stat. 198. Under the 1870 Act, an applicant denied a patent by the primary examiner could appeal rst to a three-member board of examiners-in-chief, then to the Commis\u00adsioner for Patents, and nally to an en banc sitting of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. 2 Id., at 205. Notably, Congress described that court's review as an \"ap\u00adpeal\" based \"on the evidence produced before the commis\u00adsioner.\" Ibid. The 1870 Act preserved the prior remedy of a bill in equity in district court for the applicant whose appeal was denied either by the Commissioner or by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Ibid. The dis\u00ad trict court, in a proceeding that was distinct from the appeal considered on the administrative record by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, would \"adjudge\" whether the applicant was \"entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention . . . as the facts in the case may appear.\" Ibid. In 1878, Congress codied this provision of 2 The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia was a trial court cre\u00ad ated by Congress in 1863. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 91, 12 Stat. 762. Al\u00ad though the court was generally one of rst instance, it also functioned as an appellate court when it sat en banc. Voorhees, The District of Colum\u00adbia Courts: A Judicial Anomaly, 29 Cath. U. L. Rev. 917, 923 (1980). Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 441 Opinion of the Court the 1870 Act as Revised Statute \u00a7 4915 (R. S. 4915). That statute was the immediate predecessor to \u00a7 145, and its core language remains largely unchanged in \u00a7 145. Accordingly, both parties agree that R. S. 4915 and the judicial decisions interpreting that statute should inform our understanding of \u00a7 145. 2 This Court described the nature of R. S. 4915 proceedings in two different cases: Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50 (1884), and Morgan v. Daniels, 153 U. S. 120 (1894). In Butterworth, the Court held that the Secre\u00ad tary of the Interior, the head of the federal department in which the Patent Ofce was a bureau, had no authority to review a decision made by the Commissioner of Patents in an interference proceeding. In its discussion, the Court de\u00adscribed the remedy provided by R. S. 4915 as \"a proceeding in a court of the United States having original equity jurisdiction under the patent laws, ac\u00adcording to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure. It is not a technical appeal from the Patent Ofce, like that authorized [before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia], conned to the case as made in the record of that ofce, but is prepared and heard upon all competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits.\" 112 U. S., at 61. The Butterworth Court also cited several lower court cases, which similarly described R. S. 4915 proceedings as \"alto\u00adgether independent\" from the hearings before the Patent Ofce and made clear that the parties were \"at liberty to introduce additional evidence\" under \"the rules and practice of a court of equity.\" In re Squire , 22 F. Cas. 1015, 1016 (No. 13,269) (CC ED Mo. 1877); see also Whipple v. Miner , 15 F. 117, 118 (CC Mass. 1883) (describing the federal court's jurisdiction in an R. S. 4915 proceeding as \"an independ\u00adent, original jurisdiction\"); Butler v. Shaw , 21 F. 321, 327 442 KAPPOS v. HYATT Opinion of the Court (CC Mass. 1884) (holding that \"the court may receive new evidence, and has the same powers as in other cases in equity\"). Ten years later, in Morgan, this Court again confronted a case involving proceedings under R. S. 4915. 153 U. S. 120. There, a party challenged a factual nding by the Patent Ofce, but neither side presented additional evidence in the District Court. Id., at 122-123. This Court described the parties' dispute as one over a question of fact that had al\u00adready \"been settled by a special tribunal [e]ntrusted with full power in the premises\" and characterized the resulting District Court proceeding not as an independent civil action, but as \"something in the nature of a suit to set aside a judg\u00adment.\" Id., at 124. Consistent with that view, the Court held that the agency's ndings should not be overturned by \"a mere preponderance of evidence.\" Ibid. Viewing Butterworth and Morgan together, one might perceive some tension between the two cases. Butterworth appears to describe an R. S. 4915 proceeding as an original civil action, seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application. Morgan, on the other hand, appears to describe an R. S. 4915 proceeding as a suit for judicial review of agency action, governed by a deferential standard of re\u00adview. To resolve that apparent tension, the Director urges us to disregard the language in Butterworth as mere dicta and to follow Morgan. He argues that Butterworth \"shed[s] no light on the extent to which new evidence was admissible in R. S. 4915 proceedings or on the standard of review that applied in such suits.\" Brief for Petitioner 33. The Direc\u00adtor maintains that Morgan, in contrast, rmly established that a district court in such a proceeding performs a deferen\u00adtial form of review, governed by traditional principles of ad\u00administrative law. We reject the Director's position. 3 3 Both parties cite additional cases from the lower courts that they claim support their view of the statute, but these cases are too diverse to sup\u00ad port any rm inferences about Congress' likely intent in enacting \u00a7 145. Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 443 Opinion of the Court We think that the differences between Butterworth and Morgan are best explained by the fact that the two cases addressed different circumstances. Butterworth discussed the character of an R. S. 4915 proceeding in which a disap\u00ad pointed patent applicant challenged the Board's denial of his application. Although that discussion was not strictly nec\u00adessary to Butterworth's holding it was also not the kind of ill-considered dicta that we are inclined to ignore. The But\u00ad terworth Court carefully examined the various provisions providing relief from the nal denial of a patent application by the Commissioner of Patents to determine that the Secre\u00adtary of the Interior had no role to play in that process. 112 U. S., at 59-64. The Court further surveyed the decisions of the lower courts with regard to the nature of an R. S. 4915 proceeding and concluded that its view was \"the uniform and correct practice in the Circuit Courts.\" Id., at 61. We note that this Court reiterated Butterworth' s well-reasoned inter\u00ad pretation of R. S. 4915 in three later cases. 4 Morgan, on the other hand, concerned a different situation from the one presented in this case. First, Morgan ad\u00ad dressed an interference proceeding. See 153 U. S., at 125 (emphasizing that \"the question decided in the Patent Ofce is one between contesting parties as to priority of inven\u00adtion\"). Although interference proceedings were previously governed by R. S. 4915, they are now governed by a separate section of the Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 146, and therefore do not implicate \u00a7 145. In addition, Morgan did not involve a 4 In Gandy v. Marble , 122 U. S. 432 (1887), the Court described an R. S. 4915 proceeding as \"a suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure\" rather than a \"technical appeal from the Patent Ofce.\" Id., at 439 (citing Butterworth, 112 U. S., at 61). Likewise, in In re Hien, 166 U. S. 432 (1897), the Court distinguished an R. S. 4915 pro\u00adceeding from the \" 'technical appeal from the Patent Ofce' \" authorized under R. S. 4911, the predecessor to current \u00a7 141. Id., at 439 (quoting Butterworth, supra, at 61). And, nally, in Hoover Co. v. Coe, 325 U. S. 79 (1945), the Court cited Butterworth to support its description of an R. S. 4915 proceeding as a \"formal trial.\" 325 U. S., at 83, and n. 4. 444 KAPPOS v. HYATT Opinion of the Court proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the Dis\u00ad trict Court. See 153 U. S., at 122 (stating that the case \"was submitted, without any additional testimony, to the Circuit Court\"). 3 Because in this case we are concerned only with \u00a7 145 pro\u00ad ceedings in which new evidence has been presented to the District Court, Butterworth rather than Morgan guides our decision. In Butterworth, this Court observed that an R. S. 4915 proceeding should be conducted \"according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure\" and that it should be \"prepared and heard upon all competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits.\" 112 U. S., at 61. Likewise, we conclude that a district court conducting a \u00a7 145 proceeding may consider \"all competent evidence adduced,\" id., at 61, and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the PTO. Thus, we agree with the Federal Circuit that \"Congress intended that applicants would be free to introduce new evidence in \u00a7 145 proceedings subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" 625 F. 3d, at 1331. We also agree with the Federal Circuit's longstanding view that, \"where new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed fact question, a de novo nding will be neces\u00ad sary to take such evidence into account together with the evidence before the board.\" Fregeau v. Mossinghoff, 776 F. 2d 1034, 1038 (1985). As we noted in Zurko , the district court acts as a factnder when new evidence is introduced in a \u00a7 145 proceeding. 527 U. S., at 164. The district court must assess the credibility of new witnesses and other evi\u00addence, determine how the new evidence comports with the existing administrative record, and decide what weight the new evidence deserves. As a logical matter, the district court can only make these determinations de novo because it is the rst tribunal to hear the evidence in question. Fur\u00adthermore, a de novo standard adheres to this Court's instruc\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 445 Opinion of the Court tion in Butterworth that an R. S. 4915 proceeding be heard \"upon the whole merits\" and conducted \"according to the or\u00ad dinary course of equity practice and procedure.\" 112 U. S., at 61. D Although we reject the Director's proposal for a stricter evidentiary rule and an elevated standard of review in \u00a7 145 proceedings, we agree with the Federal Circuit that the dis\u00adtrict court may, in its discretion, \"consider the proceedings before and ndings of the Patent Ofce in deciding what weight to afford an applicant's newly-admitted evidence.\" 625 F. 3d, at 1335. Though the PTO has special expertise in evaluating patent applications, the district court cannot meaningfully defer to the PTO's factual ndings if the PTO considered a different set of facts. Cf. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. 91, 111 (2011) (noting that \"if the PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment may lose signicant force\"). For this reason, we conclude that the proper means for the district court to ac\u00adcord respect to decisions of the PTO is through the court's broad discretion over the weight to be given to evidence newly adduced in the \u00a7 145 proceedings. The Director warns that allowing the district court to con\u00ad sider all admissible evidence and to make de novo ndings will encourage patent applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO intentionally with the goal of presenting that evi\u00addence for the rst time to a nonexpert judge. Brief for Peti\u00adtioner 23. We nd that scenario unlikely. An applicant who pursues such a strategy would be intentionally under\u00admining his claims before the PTO on the speculative chance that he will gain some advantage in the \u00a7 145 proceeding by presenting new evidence to a district court judge. IV For these reasons, we conclude that there are no limita\u00ad tions on a patent applicant's ability to introduce new evi\u00addence in a \u00a7 145 proceeding beyond those already present in 446 KAPPOS v. HYATT Sotomayor, J., concurring the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, if new evidence is presented on a dis\u00adputed question of fact, the district court must make de novo factual ndings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the PTO. In light of these conclusions, the Federal Circuit was correct to vacate the judgment of the District Court, which excluded newly presented evidence under the view that it \"need not consider evidence negligently submitted after the end of administra\u00adtive proceedings.\" Civ. Action No. 03-0901, at 15, App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a. The judgment is afrmed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring. As the Court today recognizes, a litigant in a 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 145 proceeding is permitted to introduce evidence not pre\u00adsented to the Patent and Trademark Ofce (PTO) \" 'accord\u00ading to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure.' \" Ante, at 441 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 61 (1884)). Dating back to \u00a7 145's original predecessor, Congress contemplated that courts would man\u00adage such actions \"according to the course and principles of courts of equity.\" Act of July 4, 1836, \u00a7 17, 5 Stat. 124. And this Court and other courts have acknowledged and applied that principle on numerous occasions. See, e. g., Gandy v. Marble , 122 U. S. 432, 439 (1887) (describing Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4915 (R. S. 4915) proceeding as \"a suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure\"); In re Hien, 166 U. S. 432, 438 (1897) (same); In re Squire , 22 F. Cas. 1015, 1016 (No. 13,269) (CC ED Mo. 1877) (in an R. S. 4915 proceed\u00ading, the parties were \"at liberty to introduce additional evi\u00addence\" under \"the rules and practice of a court of equity\"); ante, at 441, 443, n. 4 (citing same cases). Cite as: 566 U. S. 431 (2012) 447 Sotomayor, J., concurring Consistent with ordinary equity practice and procedure, there may be situations in which a litigant's conduct before the PTO calls into question the propriety of admitting evi\u00addence presented for the rst time in a \u00a7 145 proceeding be\u00adfore a district court. The most well-known example was presented in Barrett Co. v. Koppers Co., 22 F. 2d 395, 396 (CA3 1927), a case in which the Barrett Company, during proceedings before the Patent Ofce, \"expressly refused to disclose and to allow their witnesses to answer questions\" essential to establishing the priority of its invention. After the Patent Ofce ruled against it, the Barrett Company at\u00adtempted to present in a subsequent R. S. 4915 proceeding \"the very subject-matter concerning which . . . witnesses for the [patent] application were asked questions and the Bar\u00adrett Company forbade them to answer.\" Ibid. The Third Circuit understandably found the Barrett Company estopped from introducing evidence that it had \"purposely\" withheld from prior factnders, lest the company be allowed prot by [its] own . . . wrong doing.\" Id., at 397. See also Dow- ling v. Jones, 67 F. 2d 537, 538 (CA2 1933) (L. Hand, J.) (describing Barrett as a case in which \"the Third Circuit refused to consider evidence which the inventor had deliber\u00adately suppressed\"). For the reasons the Court articulates, \u00a7 145 proceedings are not limited to the administrative record developed be\u00ad fore the PTO and applicants are entitled to present new evi\u00addence to the district court. Accordingly, as Judge Hand sug\u00adgested, a court's equitable authority to exclude evidence in such proceedings is limited, and must be exercised with cau\u00adtion. See Dowling , 67 F. 2d, at 538 (describing as \"doubtful\" the proposition that a court should exclude evidence that was \"not suppressed, but merely neglected,\" before the Patent Ofce). Thus, when a patent applicant fails to present evi\u00addence to the PTO due to ordinary negligence, a lack of fore\u00adsight, or simple attorney error, the applicant should not be estopped from presenting the evidence for the rst time in a \u00a7 145 proceeding. 448 KAPPOS v. HYATT Sotomayor, J., concurring Because there is no suggestion here that the applicant's failure to present the evidence in question to the PTO was anything other than the product of negligence or a lack of foresight, I agree that the applicant was entitled to present his additional evidence to the District Court. But I do not understand today's decision to foreclose a district court's authority, consistent with \" 'the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure,' \" ante, at 445 (quoting Butterworth, 112 U. S., at 61), to exclude evidence \"deliberately sup\u00adpressed\" from the PTO or otherwise withheld in bad faith. For the reasons set out by the Court, see ante, at 445, an applicant has little to gain by such tactics; such cases will therefore be rare. In keeping with longstanding historical practice, however, I understand courts to retain their ordi\u00adnary authority to exclude evidence from a \u00a7 145 proceeding when its admission would be inconsistent with regular equity practice and procedure. With those observations, I join the Court's opinion in full. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 449 Syllabus MOHAMAD, individually and for ESTATE OF RAHIM, DECEASED, et al. v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit No. 11-88. Argued February 28, 2012\u2014Decided April 18, 2012 While visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence of\u00ad cers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Rahim's relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Lib\u00aderation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA or Act), which authorizes a cause of action against \"[a]n individ\u00adual\" for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under author\u00adity or color of law of any foreign nation. 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1350. The District Court dismissed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPA's authorization of suit against \"[a]n indi\u00advidual\" extended liability only to natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit afrmed. Held: As used in the TVPA, the term \"individual\" encompasses only natu\u00ad ral persons. Consequently, the Act does not impose liability against organizations. Pp. 453-461. (a) The ordinary, everyday meaning of \"individual\" refers to a human being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course does not employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act denes \"person\" to include certain articial entities \"as well as individuals,\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1, thereby marking \"individual\" as distinct from articial entities. Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an \"individual\" and an organizational entity. See, e. g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 92(k), 511. And the very Congress that passed the TVPA dened \"person\" in a separate Act to include \"any individual or entity.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2331(3). Pp. 453-455. (b) Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some indica\u00ad tion that it intended such a result. There are no such indications in the TVPA. To the contrary, the statutory context conrms that Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons alone. The Act's liability provision uses the word \"individual\" ve times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four times to refer to the victim. See TVPA \u00a7 2(a). Since only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difcult to conclude that Congress used \"individual\" four times in the same sentence to refer to 450 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Syllabus a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsover\u00ad eign organization. In addition, the TVPA holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to \"any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.\" See TVPA \u00a7 2(a)(2). \"Persons\" often has a broader meaning in the law than \"individual,\" and frequently includes nonnatural persons. Construing \"individual\" in the Act to encom\u00adpass solely natural persons credits Congress' use of disparate unpersuasive. Pp. 456-461. dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires this Court's result. First, they rely on denitions that frame \"individual\" in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of \"oneness,\" but these de\u00adnitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA. Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal sys\u00adtems of other nations. But while \"Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles,\" Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino , 501 U. S. 104, 108, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to subject organizations to liability. Petitioners next argue that the TVPA's scope of liability should be con\u00adstrued to conform with other federal statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing. But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs the term \"individual,\" as the TVPA, to describe the covered defendant. Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not fol\u00adlow that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations. Pp. 457-458.

(3) Finally, petitioners argue that precluding organizational liabil\u00ad ity may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives. This purposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of the plain text. Moreover, Congress appeared well aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the TVPA.

Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 734 (2011). Petitioners are the rela\u00adtives of Azzam Rahim, who immigrated to the United States in the 1970's and became a naturalized citizen. In 1995, while on a visit to the West Bank, Rahim was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence ofcers. He was taken to a prison in Jericho, where he was imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. The following year, the U. S. Department of State issued a report concluding that Rahim \"died in the custody of [Palestinian Authority] intelligence ofcers in Jer\u00adicho.\" Dept. of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995, Submitted to the House Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on For\u00adeign Relations, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 1183 (Joint Committee Print 1996). In 2005, petitioners led this action against respondents, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Orga\u00adnization, asserting, inter alia, claims of torture and extraju\u00ad dicial killing under the TVPA. The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss, concluding, as relevant, that the Act's authorization of suit against \"[a]n individual\" ex\u00adtended liability only to natural persons. Mohamad v. Ra\u00ad joub , 664 F. Supp. 2d 20, 22 (DC 2009). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit af\u00adrmed on the same ground. See Mohamad v. Rajoub , 634 F. 3d 604, 608 (2011) (\"Congress used the word 'individual' to denote only natural persons\"). 1 We granted certiorari, 565 U. S. 962 (2011), to resolve a split among the Circuits 1 Respondents also argued before the District Court that the TVPA's requirement that acts be committed under authority or color of law of a foreign nation was not met. Neither the District Court nor Court of Ap\u00adpeals addressed the argument, and we offer no opinion on its merits. Cite as: 566 U. S. 449 (2012) 453 Opinion of the Court with respect to whether the TVPA authorizes actions against defendants that are not natural persons,2 and now afrm. II The TVPA imposes liability on individuals for certain acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. The Act provides: \"An individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation\u2014 \"(1) subjects an individual to torture shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to that individual; or \"(2) subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to the indi\u00advidual's legal representative, or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.\" \u00a7 2(a). The Act denes \"torture\" and \"extrajudicial killing,\" \u00a7 3, and imposes a statute of limitations and an exhaustion require\u00adment, \u00a7\u00a7 2(b), (c). It does not dene \"individual.\" Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued under the Act\u2014namely, that the Act does not create an ex\u00adception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1602 et seq ., which renders foreign sovereigns largely immune from suits in U. S. courts. They argue, how\u00adever, that the TVPA does not similarly restrict liability against other juridical entities. In petitioners' view, by per\u00admitting suit against \"[a]n individual,\" the TVPA contem\u00adplates liability against natural persons and nonsovereign organizations (a category that, petitioners assert, includes respondents). We decline to read \"individual\" so unnatu\u00adrally. The ordinary meaning of the word, fortied by its 2 Compare Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F. 3d 388 (CA4 2011) (TVPA ex\u00ad cludes corporate defendants from 634 F. 3d 604 (CADC 2011) (TVPA liability to natural persons); Chevron Corp ., 621 F. 3d 1116 (CA9 2010) (same as Aziz), with Sinaltrai\u00ad nal v. Coca-Cola Co., 578 F. 3d 1252, 1264, n. 13 (CA11 2009) (TVPA liabil\u00ad ity extends to corporate defendants). 454 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Opinion of the Court statutory context, persuades us that the Act authorizes suit against natural persons alone. A Because the TVPA does not dene the term \"individual,\" we look rst to the word's ordinary meaning. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397, 403 (2011) (\"When a statute does not dene a term, we typically give the phrase its ordinary meaning\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). As a noun, \"individual\" ordinarily means \"[a] human being, a person.\" 7 Oxford English Dictionary 880 (2d ed. 1989); see also, e. g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (\"a person\"); Webster's Third (1986) (hereinafter Webster's) (\"a particular person\"). After all, that is how we use the word in every\u00adday parlance. We say \"the individual went to the store,\" \"the individual left the room,\" and \"the individual took the car,\" each time referring unmistakably to a natural person. And no one, we hazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organization as an \"individual.\" Evidencing that com\u00admon usage, this Court routinely uses \"individual\" to denote a natural person, and in particular to distinguish between a natural person and a corporation. See, e. g., Goodyear Dun- lop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. 915, 924 (2011) (\"For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exer\u00adcise of general jurisdiction is the individual's domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corpo\u00adration is fairly regarded as at home\"). Congress does not, in the ordinary course, employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act instructs that \"[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise associations, rms, part\u00adnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as indi\u00ad viduals.\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). With the phrase \"as well as,\" the denition marks \"individual\" as distinct from the list of articial entities that precedes it. Cite as: 566 U. S. 449 (2012) 455 Opinion of the Court In a like manner, federal statutes routinely distinguish be\u00ad tween an \"individual\" and an organizational entity of some kind. See, e. g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a7 92(k) (\" 'Person' includes part\u00ad nerships, associations, and corporations, as well as individu\u00adals\"); \u00a7 511 (same); 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 717a (\" 'Person' includes an individual or a corporation\"); 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 796(4) (\" '[P]erson' means an individual or a corporation\"); 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(b)(3) (\" '[P]erson' means an individual or an organization\"). In\u00addeed, the very same Congress that enacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for U. S. nationals injured \"by reason of an act of international terrorism\" and dened \"per\u00adson\" as it appears in the statute to include \"any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or benecial interest in property.\" Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2333(a), 2331(3) (emphasis added). B This is not to say that the word \"individual\" invariably means \"natural person\" when used in a statute. Congress remains free, as always, to give the word a broader or differ\u00adent meaning. But before we will assume it has done so, there must be some indication Congress intended such a re\u00ad sult. Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point to only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue Code) in which Congress expressly denes \"individual\" to include corporate entities. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 542(a)(2). Or perhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998), the statutory context makes that intention clear, because any other reading of \"individual\" would lead to an \" 'absurd' \" result Congress could not plausibly have intended. There are no such indications in the TVPA. As noted, the Act does not dene \"individual,\" much less do so in a manner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage. And the statutory context strengthens\u2014not undermines\u2014the conclu\u00adsion that Congress intended to create a cause of action against natural persons alone. The Act's liability provision 456 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Opinion of the Court uses the word \"individual\" ve times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i. e., the defendant) and four times to refer to the victim. See \u00a7 2(a). Only a natural per\u00adson can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing. \"Since there is a presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a presumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence,\" Brown v. Gardner , 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (citation omitted), it is difcult indeed to conclude that Con\u00adgress employed the term \"individual\" four times in one sen\u00adtence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natu\u00adral person and any nonsovereign organization. See also \u00a7 3(b)(1) (using term \"individual\" six times in referring to victims of torture). It is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to \"any person who may be a claim\u00ad ant in an action for wrongful death.\" \u00a7 2(a)(2) (emphasis added). \"Person,\" we have recognized, often has a broader meaning in the law than \"individual,\" see Clinton, 524 U. S., at 428, n. 13, and frequently includes nonnatural persons, see, e. g., 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. We generally seek to respect Congress' decision to use different terms to describe different catego\u00adries of people or things. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Our construction of \"individual\" to encompass solely natural persons credits Congress' use of the disparate terms; petitioners' construction does not. 3 In sum, the text of the statute persuades us that the Act authorizes liability solely against natural persons. III Petitioners' counterarguments are unpersuasive. 3 The parties debate whether estates, or other nonnatural persons, in fact may be claimants in a wrongful-death action. We think the debate largely immaterial. Regardless of whether jurisdictions today allow for such actions, Congress' use of the broader term evidences an intent to accommodate that possibility. Cite as: 566 U. S. 449 (2012) 457 Opinion of the Court A Petitioners rst dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires today's result. Although they concede that an ordi\u00ad nary meaning of \"individual\" is \"human being,\" petitioners . . . in distinctly non-human terms, instead placing their empha\u00adses on the oneness of something.\" Brief for Petitioners e. g., Webster's 1152 (dening \"individual\" as \"a single or particular being or thing or group of being or things\")). Those denitions, however, do not account even for petition\u00aders' preferred interpretation of \"individual\" in the Act, for foreign states\u2014which petitioners concede are not liable under the Act\u2014do not differ from nonsovereign organiza\u00adtions in their degree of \"oneness.\" Moreover, \"[w]ords that can have more than one meaning are given content . . . by their surroundings,\" Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 466 (2001), and for the reasons explained supra, petitioners' denition makes for an awk\u00ad ward t in the context of the TVPA. Petitioners next claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of other nations. We are not convinced, however, that any such \"domestic and international presumption of organizational liability\" in tort actions overcomes the ordinary meaning of \"individual.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. It is true that \"Congress is under\u00adstood to legislate against a background of common-law adju\u00addicatory principles.\" Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino , 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991). But Congress plainly can override those principles, see, e. g., id., at 108-109, and, as explained supra, the TVPA's text evinces a clear intent not to subject nonsovereign organizations to liability. 4 4 Petitioners' separate contention that the TVPA must be construed in light of international agreements prohibiting torture and extrajudicial kill\u00ad ing fails for similar reasons. Whatever the scope of those agreements, the TVPA does not dene \"individual\" by reference to them, and principles 458 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Opinion of the Court We also decline petitioners' suggestion to construe the TVPA's scope of liability to conform with other federal stat\u00ad utes that petitioners contend provide civil remedies to vic\u00adtims of torture or extrajudicial killing. None of the three statutes petitioners identify employs the term \"individual\" to describe the covered defendant, and so none assists in the interpretive task we face today. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983; 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1603(a) (2006 ed.), \u00a7 1605A(c) (2006 S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2333, 2334(a)-(b), 2337. The same is true of the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1350, so it offers no com\u00adparative value here regardless of whether corporate entities can be held liable in a federal common-law action brought under that statute. Compare Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11 (CADC 2011), with Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petro\u00ad leum Co., 621 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2010), cert. granted, 565 U. S. 961 (2011). Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against ofcers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e. g., Chavez v. Carranza, 559 F. 3d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not follow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations. An ofcer who gives an order to torture or kill is an \"individual\" in that word's ordinary usage; an organization is not. B Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their broad reading of \"individual.\" But \"reliance on legis\u00adlative history is unnecessary in light of the statute's unam\u00adbiguous language.\" Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P . A. v. they elucidate cannot overcome the statute's text. The same is true of petitioners' suggestion that Congress in the TVPA imported a \"specialized usage\" of the word \"individual\" in international law. See Brief for Peti\u00adtioners 6. There is no indication in the text of the statute or legislative history that Congress knew of any such specialized usage of the term, much less intended to import it into the Act. Cite as: 566 U. S. 449 (2012) 459 Opinion of the Court United States, 559 U. S. 229, 236, n. 3 (2010). In any event, the excerpts petitioners cite do not help their cause. Peti\u00adtioners note that the Senate Report states that \"[t]he legisla\u00adtion uses the term 'individual' to make crystal clear that for\u00adeign states or their entities cannot be sued under this bill under any circumstances.\" S. Rep. No. 102-249, p. 7 (1991) (S. Rep.); see also H. R. Rep. No. 102-367, pt. 1, p. 4 (1991) (\"Only 'individuals,' not foreign states, can be sued\"). Yet that statement, while clarifying that the Act does not encom\u00adpass liability against foreign states, says nothing about liabil\u00adity against nonsovereign organizations. The other excerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the meaning of \"individual,\" for they signal only that the Act does not im\u00adpose liability on perpetrators who act without authority or color of law of a foreign state. See, e. g., id., at 5 (\"The bill does not attempt to deal with torture or killing by purely private groups\"); S. Rep., at 8 (The bill \"does not cover purely private criminal acts by individuals or nongovern\u00admental organizations\"). Indeed, although we need not rely on legislative history given the text's clarity, we note that the history only sup\u00adports our interpretation of \"individual.\" The version of the TVPA that was introduced in the 100th Congress established liability against a \"person.\" Hearing and Markup on H. R. 1417 before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Its Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organiza\u00adtions, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 82 (1988). During the markup session of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of the bill's sponsors proposed an amendment \"to make it clear we are applying it to individuals and not to corporations.\" Id., at 81, 87. Counsel explained that it was a \"fairly simple\" matter \"of changing the word, 'person' to 'individuals' in sev\u00aderal places in the bill.\" Id., at 87-88. The amendment was unanimously adopted, and the version of the bill reported out of Committee reflected the change. Id., at 88; H. R. Rep. 460 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Opinion of the Court No. 100-693, pt. 1, p. 1 (1988). A materially identical ver\u00ad sion of the bill was enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Con\u00adgress. Although we are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history, cf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Serv\u00ad ices, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005), we nevertheless nd it telling that the sole explanation for substituting \"individual\" for \"person\" conrms what we have concluded from the text alone. C Petitioners' nal argument is that the Act would be ren\u00ad dered toothless by a construction of \"individual\" that limits liability to natural persons. They contend that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives for any number of reasons. Vic\u00adtims may be unable to identify the men and women who sub\u00adjected them to torture, all the while knowing the organiza\u00adtion for whom they work. Personal jurisdiction may be more easily established over corporate than human beings. And natural persons may be more likely than organizations to be judgment proof. Indeed, we are told that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to recover successfully against a natural person\u2014one only after the defendant won the state lottery. See Jean v. Dor\u00e9lien, 431 F. 3d 776, 778 (CA11 2005). We acknowledge petitioners' concerns about the limita\u00ad tions on recovery. But they are ones that Congress imposed and that we must respect. \"[N]o legislation pursues its pur\u00adposes at all costs,\" Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525-526 (1987) (per curiam), and petitioners' purposive ar\u00ad gument simply cannot overcome the force of the plain text. We add only that Congress appeared well aware of the lim\u00adited nature of the cause of action it established in the Act. See, e. g., 138 Cong. Rec. 4177 (1992) (remarks of Sen. Simp\u00ad son) (noting that \"as a practical matter, this legislation will result in a very small number of cases\"); 137 Cong. Rec. 2671 (1991) (remarks of Sen. Specter) (\"Let me emphasize that Cite as: 566 U. S. 449 (2012) 461 Breyer, J., concurring the bill is a limited measure. It is estimated that only a few of these lawsuits will ever be brought\"). * * * The text of the TVPA convinces us that Congress did not extend liability to organizations, sovereign or not. There are no doubt valid arguments for such an extension. But Congress has seen t to proceed in more modest steps in the Act, and it is not the province of this branch to do otherwise. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is afrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Breyer , concurring. I join the Court's opinion with one qualication. The word \"individual\" is open to multiple interpretations, per\u00admitting it, linguistically speaking, to include natural persons, corporations, and other entities. Thus, I do not believe that word alone is sufcient to decide this case. The legislative history of the statute, however, makes up for whatever interpretive inadequacies remain after consid\u00adering language alone. See, e. g., ante, at 459 (describing markup session in which one of the bill's sponsors proposed an amendment containing the word \"individual\" to \" 'make it clear' \" that the statute applied to \" 'individuals and not to corporations' \"); Hearing on S. 1629 et al. before the Subcom\u00admittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 65 (1990) (witness explaining to Committee that there would be a \"problem\" with suing an \"independent entity or a series of entities that are not governments,\" such as the Palestine Liberation Organization); id., at 75 (allaying concerns that there will be a flood of lawsuits \"because of the requirement [in the statute] that an individual has to identify his or her precise torture[r] and they have to be both in the United States\"); see also ante, at 458-459 (making clear that peti\u00ad462 MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Breyer, J., concurring tioners' citations to the legislative history \"do not help their cause\"). After examining the history in detail, and consid\u00adering it along with the reasons that the Court provides, I join the Court's judgment and opinion. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 463 Syllabus WOOD v. MIL YARD, WARDEN, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 10-9995. Argued February 27, 2012\u2014Decided April 24, 2012 In 1987, petitioner Patrick Wood was convicted of murder and other crimes by a Colorado court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood led a federal habeas petition in 2008. After receiving Wood's petition, the U. S. District Court asked the State if it planned to argue that the petition was untimely. In response, the State twice informed the Dis\u00adtrict Court that it would \"not challenge, but [was] not conceding,\" the timeliness of Wood's petition. Thereafter, the District Court rejected Wood's claims on the merits. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief both the merits and the timeliness of Wood's petition. After brieng, the court held the petition time barred, concluding that the court had authority to raise timeliness on its own motion, and that the State had not taken the issue off the table by declining to raise a statute of limitations defense in the District Court. Held: 1. Courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\u2014though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative in exceptional cases. Pp. 468-473. (a) \"Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is for\u00ad feited if not raised in a defendant's answer or in an amendment thereto.\" Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202. An afrmative defense, once forfeited, is excluded from the case and, as a rule, cannot be asserted on appeal. In Granberry v. Greer , 481 U. S. 129, 133, this Court recognized a modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited defense. There, the Seventh Circuit addressed a nonexhaus\u00adtion defense the State raised for the rst time on appeal. The exhaus\u00adtion doctrine, this Court noted, is founded on concerns broader than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respectful, harmo\u00adnious relations between the state and federal judiciaries. Id., at 133- 135. With that comity interest in mind, the Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a nonexhaustion argument inadvertently overlooked by the State in the district court. Id., at 132, 134. In Day, the Court afrmed a federal district court's authority to con\u00ad sider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances so 464 WOOD v. MIL YARD Syllabus warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. The State in Day, having miscalculated a timespan, erroneously informed the District Court that Day's habeas petition was timely. Apprised of the error by a Magistrate Judge, the District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition as untimely. This Court afrmed, holding that \"district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to consider, sua sponte , the timeliness of a state prisoner's ha\u00ad beas petition.\" Id., at 209. Such leeway was appropriate, the Court again reasoned, because the statute of limitations under the Antiterror\u00adism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), like the exhaus\u00adtion doctrine, \"implicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.\" Id., at 205. The Court claried, however, that a federal court does not have carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation. See Green- law v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 243-244. It would be \"an abuse of discretion\" for a court \"to override a State's deliberate waiver of a limi\u00adtations defense.\" Day, 547 U. S., at 202. In Day itself, the State's timeliness concession resulted from \"inadvertent error,\" id., at 211, not a deliberate decision to proceed to the merits. Pp. 470-473. (b) Consistent with Granberry and Day, the Court declines to adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The institutional interests served by AEDPA's statute of limitations are also present when a ha\u00adbeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense. P. 473. 2. The Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed Wood's petition as untimely. In the District Court, the State was well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it, and of the arguments that could be made in support of that defense. Yet, the State twice informed the District Court that it would not \"challenge\" the timeliness of Wood's petition. In so doing, the State deliberately waived the stat\u00adute of limitations defense. In light of that waiver, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Court's lead and decided the merits of Wood's petition. Pp. 473-475. 403 Fed. Appx. 335, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., led an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Scalia, J., joined, post, p. 475. Kathleen A. Lord argued the cause and led briefs for petitioner. Cite as: 566 U.

Seidel and John J. Fuerst III, Senior Assistant Attorneys General, William S. Consovoy, and Thomas R. McCarthy. Melissa Arbus Sherry argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae supporting afrmance. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Verrilli, Assistant Attorney General Breuer, and Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben.* Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. This case concerns the authority of a federal court to raise, on its own motion, a statute of limitations defense to a ha\u00ad beas corpus petition. After state prisoner Patrick Wood led a federal habeas corpus petition, the State twice in\u00adformed the U. S. District Court that it \"[would] not chal\u00adlenge, but [is] not conceding, the timeliness of Wood's habeas petition.\" App. 70a; see id., at 87a. Thereafter, the Dis\u00ad trict Court rejected Wood's claims on the merits. On ap\u00adpeal, the Tenth Circuit directed the parties to brief the question whether Wood's federal petition was timely. Post-brieng, the Court of Appeals afrmed the denial of Wood's petition, but solely on the ground that it was untimely. *A brief of amici curiae urging afrmance was led for the State of Texas et al. by Greg Abbott, Attorney General of Texas, Daniel T.

Phillips of Wyoming. 466 WOOD v. MIL YARD Opinion of the Court Our precedent establishes that a court may consider a stat\u00ad ute of limitations or other threshold bar the State failed to raise in answering a habeas petition. Granberry v. Greer , 481 U. S. 129, 134 (1987) (exhaustion defense); Day v. McDon\u00ad ough, 547 U. S. 198, 202 (2006) (statute of limitations de\u00adfense). Does court discretion to take up timeliness hold when a State is aware of a limitations defense, and intelli\u00adgently chooses not to rely on it in the court of rst instance? The answer Day instructs is \"no\": A court is not at liberty, we have cautioned, to bypass, override, or excuse a State's deliberate waiver of a limitations defense. Id., at 202, 210, n. 11. The Tenth Circuit, we accordingly hold, abused its discretion by resurrecting the limitations issue instead of re\u00adviewing the District Court's disposition on the merits of Wood's claims. I In the course of a 1986 robbery at a pizza shop in a Colo\u00ad rado town, the shop's assistant manager was shot and killed. Petitioner Patrick Wood was identied as the perpetrator. At a bench trial in January 1987, Wood was convicted of murder, robbery, and menacing, and sentenced to life impris\u00adonment. The Colorado Court of Appeals afrmed Wood's convictions and sentence on direct appeal in May 1989, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied Wood's petition for cer\u00adtiorari ve months later. Wood did not ask this Court to review his conviction in the 90 days he had to do so. Wood then pursued postconviction relief, asserting consti\u00ad tutional inrmities in his trial, conviction, and sentence. Prior to the federal petition at issue here, which was led in 2008, Wood, proceeding pro se , twice sought relief in state court. First, in 1995, he led a motion to vacate his convic\u00adtion and sentence pursuant to Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984). 1 He also asked the Colorado trial 1 Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984) provides, in relevant part: \"[E]very person convicted of a crime is entitled as a matter of right to make application for postconviction review upon the groun[d] . . . [t]hat Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 467 Opinion of the Court court to appoint counsel to aid him in pursuit of the motion. When some months passed with no responsive action, Wood led a request for a ruling on his motion and accompanying request for counsel. The state court then granted Wood's plea for the appointment of counsel, but the record is completely blank on any further action regarding the 1995 motion. Second, Wood led a new pro se motion for post- conviction relief in Colorado court in 2004. On the rst page of his second motion, he indicated that \"[n]o other postconvic\u00adtion proceedings [had been] led.\" 00247 (D Colo.), Doc. 15-5 (Exh. E), p. 1. The state court denied Wood's motion four days after receiving it. Wood led a federal habeas petition in 2008, which the Dis\u00ad trict Court initially dismissed as untimely. App. 41a-46a. On reconsideration, the District Court vacated the dismissal and instructed the State to le a preanswer response \"lim\u00adited to addressing the afrmative defenses of timeliness . . . and/or exhaustion of state court remedies.\" Id., at 64a-65a. On timeliness, the State represented in its preanswer re\u00adsponse: \"Respondents will not challenge, but are not conced\u00ading, the timeliness of Wood's [federal] habeas petition.\" Id., at 70a. Consistently, in its full answer to Wood's federal pe\u00adtition, the State repeated: \"Respondents are not challeng\u00ading, but do not concede, the timeliness of the petition.\" Id., at 87a. Disposing of Wood's petition, the District Court dismissed certain claims for failure to exhaust state remedies, and denied on the merits Wood's two remaining claims\u2014one alleging a double jeopardy violation and one challenging the validity of Wood's waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Id., at 96a-111a. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief, along with the merits of Wood's double jeopardy and Sixth Amendment claims, \"the timeli\u00ad the conviction was obtained or sentence imposed in violation of the Consti\u00ad tution or laws of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state.\" 468 WOOD v. MIL YARD Opinion of the Court ness of Wood's application for [federal habeas relief].\" Id., at 129a. After brieng, the Court of Appeals afrmed the denial of Wood's petition without addressing the merits; in\u00adstead, the Tenth Circuit held the petition time barred. 403 Fed. Appx. 335 (2010). In so ruling, the Court of Appeals concluded it had authority to raise timeliness on its own mo\u00adtion. Id., at 337, n. 2. It further ruled that the State had not taken that issue off the table by declining to interpose a statute of limitations defense in the District Court. Ibid. We granted review, 564 U. S. 1066 (2011), to resolve two issues: rst, whether a court of appeals has the authority to address the timeliness of a habeas petition on the court's own initiative; 2 second, assuming a court of appeals has such authority, whether the State's representations to the District Court in this case nonetheless precluded the Tenth Circuit from considering the timeliness of Wood's petition. II A Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner has one year to le a federal petition for habeas corpus relief, start\u00ading from \"the date on which the judgment became nal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). For a prisoner whose judgment became nal before AEDPA was enacted, the one-year limitations period runs from AEDPA's effective date: April 24, 1996. See Serrano v. 3d 1181, 1183 (CA10 2004). \"The one-year clock is stopped, however, during the time the petitioner's 2 The Tenth Circuit's conclusion that it had authority to raise an AEDPA statute of limitations defense sua sponte conflicts with the view of the Eighth Circuit. Compare 403 Fed. Appx. 335, 337, n. 2 (CA10 2010) (case below), with Sasser v. Norris, 553 F. 3d 1121, 1128 (CA8 2009) (\"The dis\u00ad cretion to consider the statute of limitations defense sua sponte does not extend to the appellate level.\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 469 Opinion of the Court 'properly led' application for state postconviction relief 'is pending.' \" Day, 547 U. S., at 201 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)).3 The state judgment against Wood became nal on direct review in early 1990. See supra, at 466. Wood's time for ling a federal petition therefore began to run on the date of AEDPA's enactment, April 24, 1996, and expired on April 24, 1997, unless Wood had a \"properly led\" application for state postconviction relief \"pending\" in Colorado state court dur\u00ading that period. Wood maintains he had such an application pending on April 24, 1996: the Rule 35(c) motion he led in 1995. That motion, Wood asserts, remained pending (thus continuing to suspend the one-year clock) until at least Au\u00adgust 2004, when he led his second motion for postconviction relief in state court. The 2004 motion, the State does not contest, was \"properly led.\" Wood argues that this second motion further tolled the limitations period until February 5, 2007, exactly one year before he led the federal petition at issue here. If Wood is correct that his 1995 motion re\u00admained \"pending\" in state court from April 1996 until Au\u00adgust 2004, his federal petition would be timely. In its preanswer response to Wood's petition, the State set forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations issue. It noted that Wood's \"time for ling a [habeas] petition began to run on April 24, 1996, when the AEDPA became effec\u00adtive,\" and that Wood \"had until April 24, 1997, plus any toll\u00ading periods, to timely le his habeas petition.\" App. 69a- 70a. The State next identied the crucial question: Did Wood's 1995 state petition arrest the one-year statute of limi\u00adtations period from 1996 until 2004? Id., at 70a. \"[I]t is certainly arguable,\" the State then asserted, \"that the 1995 3 The one-year clock may also be stopped\u2014or \"tolled\"\u2014for equitable reasons, notably when an \"extraordinary circumstance\" prevents a pris\u00ad oner from ling his federal petition on time. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. 631 (2010). Wood does not contend that the equitable tolling doc\u00ad trine applies to his case. App. 144a, n. 5. 470 WOOD v. MIL YARD Opinion of the Court postconviction motion was abandoned before 1997 and thus did not toll the AEDPA statute of limitations at all.\" Ibid. But rather than inviting a decision on the statute of limita\u00adtions question, the State informed the District Court it would \"not challenge\" Wood's petition on timeliness grounds; instead, the State simply defended against Wood's double jeopardy and Sixth Amendment claims on the merits. B \"Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is forfeited if not raised in a defendant's answer or in an amend\u00adment thereto.\" Day, 547 U. S., at 202 (citing Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a)). See also Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) (requiring the State to plead a statute of limitations de\u00adfense in its answer). 4 An afrmative defense, once forfeited, is \"exclu[ded] from the case,\" 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed\u00aderal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1278, pp. 644-645 (3d ed. 2004), and, as a rule, cannot be asserted on appeal. See Day, 547 U. S., at 217 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Weinberger v. Sal, 422 U. S. 749, 764 (1975); McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. Tech\u00ad 2d 13, 22 (CA1 1991) (\"It is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the rst time on appeal.\"). In Granberry v. Greer , we recognized a modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited afrmative defense. 481 U. S., at 134. The District Court in Granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the merits. Id., at 130. On appeal, the State argued for the rst time that the petition should be dismissed because the petitioner had failed to exhaust relief available in state court. Ibid. 4 We note here the distinction between defenses that are \"waived\" and those that are \"forfeited.\" A waived claim or defense is one that a party has knowingly and intelligently relinquished; a forfeited plea is one that a party has merely failed to preserve. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 458, n. 13 (2004); United States v. Olano , 507 U. S. 725, 733 (1993). That distinction is key to our decision in Wood's case. Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 471 Opinion of the Court See Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) (listing \"failure to exhaust state remedies\" as a threshold bar to federal habeas relief). Despite the State's failure to raise the nonexhaustion argu\u00adment in the District Court, the Seventh Circuit accepted the argument and ruled for the State on that ground. We granted certiorari to decide whether a court of appeals has discretion to address a nonexhaustion defense that the State failed to raise in the district court. Id., at 130. Although \"express[ing] our reluctance to adopt rules that allow a party to withhold raising a defense until after the 'main event' . . . is over,\" id., at 132, we nonetheless con\u00ad cluded that the bar to court of appeals' consideration of a forfeited habeas defense is not absolute, id., at 133. The ex\u00ad haustion doctrine, we noted, is founded on concerns broader than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respectful, harmonious relations between the state and fed\u00aderal judiciaries. Id., at 133-135. With that comity interest in mind, we held that federal appellate courts have dis\u00adcretion, in \"exceptional cases,\" to consider a nonexhaustion argument \"inadverten[tly]\" overlooked by the State in the District Court. Id., at 132, 134. 5 In Day, we afrmed a federal district court's authority to consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary cir\u00adcumstances so warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. There, the State miscalculated a timespan, specically, the number of days running between the nality of Day's state-court conviction and the ling of his federal habeas petition. Id., at 203. As a result, the State erroneously informed the District Court that Day's petition was timely. Ibid. A Magistrate Judge caught the State's computation error and recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely, notwithstanding the State's timeliness concession. Id., at 204. The District 5 Although our decision in Granberry v. Greer , 481 U. S. 129 (1987), did not expressly distinguish between forfeited and waived defenses, we made clear in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), that a federal court has the authority to resurrect only forfeited defenses. See infra, at 472-473. 472 WOOD v. MIL YARD Opinion of the Court Court adopted the recommendation, and the Court of Ap\u00ad peals upheld the trial court's sua sponte dismissal of the peti\u00ad tion as untimely. Ibid. Concluding that it would make \"scant sense\" to treat AEDPA's statute of limitations differently from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners, we held \"that district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to con\u00adsider, sua sponte , the timeliness of a state prisoner's habeas petition.\" Id., at 209; ibid. (noting that Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) places \" 'a statute of limitations' defense on a par with 'failure to exhaust state remedies, a procedural bar, [and] non-retroactivity' \"). Affording federal courts leeway to consider a forfeited timeliness defense was appropriate, we again reasoned, because AEDPA's statute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, \"implicat[es] values beyond the con\u00adcerns of the parties.\" Day, 547 U. S., at 205 (quoting Acosta v. Artuz, 221 F. 3d 117, 123 (CA2 2000)); 547 U. S., at 205- 206 (\"The AEDPA statute of limitation promotes judicial ef\u00adciency and conservation of judicial resources, safeguards the accuracy of state court judgments by requiring resolu\u00adtion of constitutional questions while the record is fresh, and lends nality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We claried, however, that a federal court does not have carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presenta\u00ad tion basic to our adversary system. See Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 243-244 (2008). Only where the State does not \"strategically withh[o]ld the [limitations] defense or cho[o]se to relinquish it,\" and where the petitioner is ac\u00adcorded a fair opportunity to present his position, may a dis\u00adtrict court consider the defense on its own initiative and \" 'determine whether the interests of justice would be better served' by addressing the merits or by dismissing the peti\u00adtion as time barred.\" Day, 547 U. S., at 210-211 (quoting Granberry , 481 U. S., at 136; internal quotation marks omit\u00ad ted). It would be \"an abuse of discretion,\" we observed, for Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 473 Opinion of the Court a court \"to override a State's deliberate waiver of a limita\u00ad tions defense.\" 547 U. S., at 202. In Day's case itself, we emphasized, the State's concession of timeliness resulted from \"inadvertent error,\" id., at 211, not from any deliberate decision to proceed straightaway to the merits. Consistent with Granberry and Day, we decline to adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The institu\u00adtional interests served by AEDPA's statute of limitations are also present when a habeas case moves to the court of ap\u00adpeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonex\u00ad haustion defense. We accordingly hold, in response to the rst question presented, see supra, at 468, that courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\u2014though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative. C We turn now to the second, case-specic, inquiry. See ibid. Although a court of appeals has discretion to address, sua sponte , the timeliness of a habeas petition, appellate courts should reserve that authority for use in exceptional cases. For good reason, appellate courts ordinarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been raised and pre\u00adserved in the court of rst instance. See supra, at 470. That restraint is all the more appropriate when the appellate court itself spots an issue the parties did not air below, and therefore would not have anticipated in developing their ar\u00adguments on appeal. Due regard for the trial court's processes and time invest\u00ad ment is also a consideration appellate courts should not over\u00adlook. It typically takes a district court more time to decide a habeas case on the merits than it does to resolve a petition on threshold procedural grounds. See Dept. of Justice, Bu\u00adreau of Justice Statistics, R. Hanson & H. Daley, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging State Court Criminal Convictions 23 (NCJ-155504, 1995) (district courts spent an 474 WOOD v. MIL YARD Opinion of the Court average of 477 days to decide a habeas petition on the merits, and 268 days to resolve a petition on procedural grounds). When a court of appeals raises a procedural impediment to disposition on the merits, and disposes of the case on that ground, the district court's labor is discounted and the appel\u00adlate court acts not as a court of review but as one of rst view. In light of the foregoing discussion of the relevant consid\u00ad erations, we hold that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed Wood's petition as untimely. In the Dis\u00adtrict Court, the State was well aware of the statute of limita\u00ad tions defense available to it and of the arguments that could be made in support of the defense. See supra, at 467. Yet the State twice informed the District Court that it \"will not challenge, but [is] not conceding\" the timeliness of Wood's petition. Ibid. Essentially, the District Court asked the State: Will you oppose the petition on statute of limitations grounds? The State answered: Such a challenge would be supportable, but we won't make the challenge here. \"[W]aiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandon\u00ad ment of a known right.' \" Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 458, n. 13 (2004) (quoting United States v. Olano , 507 U. S. 725, 733 (1993)). The State's conduct in this case ts that description. Its decision not to contest the timeliness of Wood's petition did not stem from an \"inadvertent error,\" as did the State's concession in Day. See 547 U. S., at 211. Rather, the State, after expressing its clear and accurate un\u00adderstanding of the timeliness issue, see supra, at 469-470, deliberately steered the District Court away from the ques\u00adtion and toward the merits of Wood's petition. In short, the State knew it had an \"arguable\" statute of limitations defense, see ibid., yet it chose, in no uncertain terms, to re\u00ad frain from interposing a timeliness \"challenge\" to Wood's pe\u00adtition. The District Court therefore reached and decided the merits of the petition. The Tenth Circuit should have done so as well. Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 475 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment * * * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap\u00ad peals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is re\u00ad manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con\u00ad curring in the judgment. In Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), the Court held that a federal district court may raise sua sponte a forfeited statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus petition. Relying on Day and Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129 (1987), the Court now holds that a court of appeals may do the same. Because I continue to think that Day was wrongly decided and that Granberry is inapposite, I cannot join the Court's opinion. See Day, 547 U. S., at 212-219 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas and Breyer, JJ., dissenting). As the dissent in Day explained, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in habeas corpus cases to the extent that they are consistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules, the ha\u00adbeas corpus statute, and the historical practice of habeas pro\u00adceedings. Id., at 212 (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 529-530 (2005), and Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 208 (2003)). As relevant here, the Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a defendant forfeits his statute of limitations defense if he fails to raise it in his answer or in an amend\u00adment thereto. 547 U. S., at 212 (citing Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). That forfeiture rule is fully consistent with habeas corpus procedure. As an initial matter, the rule comports with the Habeas Rules' instruction that a State \"must\" plead any limitations defense in its answer. Id., at 212-213 (quot\u00ad ing Rule 5(b) (emphasis deleted)). Moreover, the rule does not conflict with the habeas statute, which imposes a 1-year period of limitations without any indication that typical for\u00adfeiture rules do not apply. Id., at 213 (citing 28 U. S. C. 476 WOOD v. MIL YARD Thomas, J., concurring in judgment \u00a7 2244(d)(1)). Finally, the rule does not interfere with his\u00ad torical practice. Prior to the enactment of a habeas statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\u00adalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), habeas practice included no limi\u00adtations period at all, much less one immune to forfeiture. 547 U. S., at 212. As the dissent in Day further explained, id., at 214, AEDPA's statute of limitations is distinguishable from the equitable defenses that we have traditionally permitted federal habeas courts to raise sua sponte . See, e. g., Gran- berry, supra, at 133 (holding that appellate courts may con\u00adsider a habeas petitioner's failure to exhaust state remedies despite a State's forfeiture of the defense). Those judicially created defenses were rooted in concerns of comity and nal\u00adity that arise when federal courts collaterally review state criminal convictions. Day, 547 U. S., at 214. But those same concerns did not lead this Court to recognize any equi\u00adtable time bar against habeas petitions. Id., at 214-215. Thus, nothing in this Court's pre-existing doctrine of equita\u00adble defenses supported the Day Court's \"decision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable 'limitations period' of \u00a7 2244(d) by making subject of sua sponte dismissal.\" Id., at 215-216. For these reasons, I believe that the Day Court was wrong to hold that district courts may raise sua sponte forfeited statute of limitations defenses in habeas cases. I therefore would not extend Day' s reasoning to proceedings in the courts of appeals. Appellate courts, moreover, are partic\u00adularly ill suited to consider issues forfeited below. Unlike district courts, courts of appeals cannot permit a State to amend its answer to add a defense, nor can they develop the facts that are often necessary to resolve questions of timeli\u00adness. Cf. id., at 209 (majority opinion) (nding no difference between a district court's ability to raise a forfeited limita\u00adtions defense sua sponte and its ability to notice the State's Cite as: 566 U. S. 463 (2012) 477 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment forfeiture and permit an amended pleading under Rule of Civil Procedure 15). In light of these considerations, I cannot join the Court's holding that a court of appeals has discretion to consider sua sponte a forfeited limitations defense. Nor can I join the Court's separate holding that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by raising a defense that had been de\u00adliberately waived by the State. As the dissent in Day noted, there is no principled reason to distinguish between forfeited and waived limitations defenses when determining whether courts may raise such defenses sua sponte . See 547 U. S., at 218, n. 3 (explaining that, if \" ' \"values beyond the concerns of the parties\" ' \" justify sua sponte consideration of forfeited defenses, such values equally support sua sponte consider\u00ad ation of waived defenses). Therefore, I concur only in the judgment. 478 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit No. 11-139. Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 25, 2012 Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deciency against a taxpayer within \"3 years after the return was led,\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6501(a), but that period is extended to 6 years when a taxpayer \"omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,\" \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A). Respondent taxpayers overstated the basis of certain property that they had sold. As a result, their returns understated the gross income they received from the sale by an amount in excess of 25%. The Com\u00admissioner asserted the deciency outside the 3-year limitations period but within the 6-year period. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the taxpayers' overstatements of basis, and resulting understatements of gross income, did not trigger the extended limitations period. Held: The judgment is afrmed. 634 F. 3d 249, afrmed. Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV-C, concluding that \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) does not apply to an overstatement of basis. Pp. 481-487. (a) In Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner , 357 U. S. 28, the Court inter\u00ad preted a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 containing lan\u00adguage materially indistinguishable from the language at issue here, holding that taxpayer misstatements that overstate the basis in prop\u00aderty do not fall within the statute's scope. The Court recognized that such an overstatement wrongly understates a taxpayer's income, but concluded that the phrase \"omits . . . an amount\" limited the statute's scope to situations in which specic receipts are left out of the computa\u00ad tion of gross income. The Court also noted that while the statute's language was not \"unambiguous,\" id., at 33, the statutory history showed that Congress intended to restrict the extended limitations pe\u00adriod to situations that did not include overstatements of basis. Finally, the Court found its conclusion \"in harmony with the unambiguous lan\u00adguage of \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A),\" id., at 37, the provision enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and applicable here. Pp. 481-483. (b) Colony determines the outcome of this case. The operative lan\u00ad guage of the 1939 provision and the provision at issue is identical. It Cite as: 566 U.

The Government suggests that differences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code favor a different interpretation than the one adopted in Colony. However, its arguments are too fragile to bear the signicant weight it seeks to place upon them. Pp. 483-486. (c) The Court also rejects the Government's argument that a recently promulgated Treasury Regulation interpreting the statute's operative language in its favor should be granted deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982.

HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of the Court Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, ex\u00ad cept as to Part IV-C. Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency against a taxpayer within \"3 years after the return was led.\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6501(a) (2000 ed.). The 3-year period is extended to 6 years, however, when a taxpayer \"omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\" \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) (emphasis added). The question before us is whether this latter provision ap\u00adplies (and extends the ordinary 3-year limitations period) when the taxpayer overstates his basis in property that he has sold, thereby understating the gain that he received from its sale. Following Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner , 357 U. S. 28 (1958), we hold that the provision does not apply to an overstatement of basis. Hence the 6-year period does not apply. I For present purposes the relevant underlying circum\u00ad stances are not in dispute. We consequently assume that (1) the respondent taxpayers led their relevant tax returns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis of certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a result the re\u00adturns understated the gross income that the taxpayers re\u00adceived from the sale of the property; and (4) the understate\u00adment exceeded the statute's 25% threshold. We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner asserted the relevant deciency within the extended 6-year limitations period, but Legal Center et al. by Elizabeth Milito, Karen R. Harned, and Ilya Shapiro. Briefs of amici curiae were led for the American College of Tax Coun\u00ad sel by Clifford M. Sloan, Pamela F. Olson, Julia M. Kazaks, David W. Foster, Richard M.

Hickman by Ms. Hickman, pro se . Cite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 481 Opinion of the Court outside the default 3-year period. Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations applies, the Government's efforts to assert a tax deciency came too late. Our conclusion\u2014that the extended limitations period does not apply\u2014follows di\u00adrectly from this Court's earlier decision in Colony. II In Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the Inter\u00ad nal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of which is identical to the language now before us. The Commissioner there had determined \"that the taxpayer had understated the gross prots on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the 'basis' of such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain unallow\u00adable items of development expense.\" Id., at 30. The Commissioner's assessment came after the ordinary 3-year limitations period had run. And, it was consequently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the 1939 Code, had \"omit[ted] from gross income an amount properly includ\u00adible therein which is in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return . . . .\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 275(c) (1940 ed.). The Code provision applicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially indistinguishable language. See \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.) (same, but replacing \"per centum\" with \"percent\"). See also Appendix, infra. In Colony this Court held that taxpayer misstatements, overstating the basis in property, do not fall within the scope of the statute. But the Court recognized the Commission\u00ader's contrary argument for inclusion. 357 U. S., at 32. Then as now, the Code itself dened \"gross income\" in this context as the difference between gross revenue (often the amount the taxpayer received upon selling the property) and basis (often the amount the taxpayer paid for the property). Compare 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 22, 111 (1940 ed.) with \u00a7\u00a7 61(a)(3), 482 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of the Court 1001(a) (2000 ed.). And, the Commissioner pointed out, an overstatement of basis can diminish the \"amount\" of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off the return might do. 357 U. S., at 32. Either way, the error wrongly understates the taxpayer's income. But, the Court added, the Commissioner's argument did not fully account for the provision's language, in particular the word \"omit.\" The key phrase says \"omits . . . The or \"un\u00adderstates\") means \" '[t]o leave out or unmentioned; not to insert, include, or name.' \" Ibid. (quoting Webster's New In\u00ad ternational Dictionary (2d ed. 1939)). Thus, taken literally, \"omit\" limits the statute's scope to situations in which spe\u00adcic receipts or accruals of income are left out of the compu\u00ad tation of gross income; to inflate the basis, however, is not to \"omit\" a specic item, not even of prot. While nding this latter interpretation of the language the \"more plausibl[e],\" the Court also noted that the language was not \"unambiguous.\" Colony, 357 U. S., at 33. It then examined various congressional Reports discussing the rele\u00advant statutory language. It found in those Reports \"persuasive indications that Congress merely had in mind failures to report particular income receipts and accruals, and did not intend the [extended] limitation to apply whenever gross income was understated . . . .\" Id., at 35. This \"history,\" the Court said, \"shows . . . that the Congress intended an exception to the usual three-year statute of limi\u00adtations only in the restricted type of situation already de\u00adscribed,\" a situation that did not include overstatements of basis. Id., at 36. The Court wrote that Congress, in enacting the provision, \"manifested no broader purpose than to give the Com\u00admissioner an additional two [now three] years to investi\u00adgate tax returns in cases where, because of a taxpayer's Cite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 483 Opinion of the Court omission to report some taxable item, the Commissioner is at a special disadvantage . . . [because] the return on its face provides no clue to the existence of the omitted item. . . . [W]hen, as here [i. e., where the overstatement of basis is at issue], the understatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting an item disclosed on the face of the return the Commissioner is at no such disadvantage . . . whether the error be one affecting 'gross income' or one, such as overstated deductions, affecting other parts of the return.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). Finally, the Court noted that Congress had recently enacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. And the Court observed that \"the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A),\" id., at 37, i. e., the provision relevant in this present case. III In our view, Colony determines the outcome in this case. The provision before us is a 1954 reenactment of the 1939 provision that Colony interpreted. The operative language is identical. It would be difcult, perhaps impossible, to give the same language here a different interpretation with\u00adout effectively overruling Colony, a course of action that basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not to take. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008) (\" [S]tare decisis in respect to statutory interpre\u00ad tation has special force, for Congress remains free to alter what we have done\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989). The Government, in an effort to convince us to interpret the operative language before us differently, points to differ\u00adences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code. It suggests that these differences counsel in favor of a different interpre\u00adtation than the one adopted in Colony . For example, the 484 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of the Court Government points to a new provision, \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says: \"In the case of a trade or business, the term 'gross in\u00adcome' means the total of the amounts received or ac\u00adcrued from the sale of goods or services (if such amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.\" If the section's basic phrase \"omi[ssion] from gross income\" does not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what Col\u00ad ony held), then what need would there be for clause (i), which leads to the same result in a specic subset of cases? And why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph, referring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who \"omits . . 6501(e)(2) (emphasis added). By speaking of \"items\" there does it not imply that omission of an \"amount\" covers more than omission of individual items\u2014indeed that it includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, diminish the amount of the prot that should have been reported as gross income? In our view, these points are too fragile to bear the sig\u00ad nicant argumentative weight the Government seeks to place upon them. For example, at least one plausible reason why Congress might have added clause (i) has nothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the general rule. Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code (prior to Col\u00ad ony), it did not yet know how the Court would interpret the provision's operative language. At least one lower court had decided that the provision did not apply to overstate\u00ad ments about the cost of goods that a business later sold. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner , 204 F. 2d 570 (CA3 1953). But see Reis v. Commissioner , 142 F. 2d 900, 902- 903 (CA6 1944). And Congress could well have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the Supreme Court, Upte\u00ad grove's interpretation would remain the law where a \"trade or business\" was at issue. Cite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 485 Opinion of the Court Nor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without work to do. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any pro\u00ad vision \"superfluous, void, or insignicant\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). That provision also explains how to calcu\u00adlate the denominator for purposes of determining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25% of \"gross income.\" For example, it tells us that a merchant who fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods has not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than $40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to acquire those goods. But without clause (i), the general statutory denition of \"gross income\" requires subtracting the cost from the sales price. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 61(a)(3), 1012. Under such a denition of \"gross income,\" the calculation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000, minus (2) \" the cost of such sales, \" say, $25,000. The $10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the \"gross income\" of $15,000. And the clause does this work in respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of our interpretation regarding overstatements of basis. The Government's argument about subsection (e)(2)'s use of the word \"item\" instead of \"amount\" is yet weaker. The Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about the word \"amount.\" It wrote: \"The Commissioner states that the draftsman's use of the word 'amount' (instead of, for example, 'item') sug\u00adgests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of the error\u2014that is whether or not gross income was under\u00adstated by as much as 25%.\" 357 U. S., at 32. But the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner's logic, rejected the argument (and the signicance of the word \"amount\") as insufcient to prove the Commissioner's conclu\u00adsion. And the addition of the word \"item\" in a different subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive force suf\u00adciently strong to affect our conclusion. The word's appear\u00ad486 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of the Court ance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new. But to rely in the case before us on this solitary word change in a different subsection is like hoping that a new batboy will change the outcome of the World Series. IV A Finally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1, which was promulgated in nal form in De\u00adcember 2010. See 26 CFR \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1 (2011). The reg\u00adulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and interprets the operative language of the statute in the Government's favor. The regulation says that \"an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unre\u00adcovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income.\" \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1(a)(1)(iii). In the Govern\u00adment's view this new regulation in effect overturns Colony's interpretation of this statute. The Government points out that the Treasury Regulation constitutes \"an agency's construction of a statute which it administers.\" Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). See also Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. 44 (2011) (applying Chevron in the tax con\u00ad text). The Court has written that a \"court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction oth\u00aderwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unam\u00ad biguous terms of the statute . . . .\" National Cable & Tele\u00ad communications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005) (emphasis added). And, as the Govern\u00ad ment notes, in Colony itself the Court wrote that \"it cannot be said that the language is unambiguous.\" 357 U. S., at 33. Hence, the Government concludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case. The question, rather, is whether the agency's construction is a \"permissible construction of the Cite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 487 Opinion of Breyer, J. statute.\" Chevron, supra, at 843. And, since the Govern\u00ad ment argues that the regulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible, construction of the statute, the Govern\u00adment believes it must win. B We do not accept this argument. In our view, Colony has already interpreted the statute, and there is no longer any different construction that is consistent with Colony and available for adoption by the agency. C The fatal flaw in the Government's contrary argument is that it overlooks the reason why Brand X held that a \"prior judicial construction,\" unless reflecting an \"unambiguous\" statute, does not trump a different agency construction of that statute. 545 U. S., at 982. The Court reveals that rea\u00adson when it points out that \"it is for agencies, not courts, to ll statutory gaps.\" Ibid. The fact that a statute is unam\u00ad biguous means that there is \"no gap for the agency to ll\" and thus \"no room for agency discretion.\" Id., at 982-983. In so stating, the Court sought to encapsulate what earlier opinions, including Chevron, made clear. Those opinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as that of decid\u00ading whether, or when, a particular statute in effect delegates to an agency the power to ll a gap, thereby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a reasonable gap-lling inter\u00adpretation. Thus, in Chevron the Court said that, when \"Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to ll, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specic provision of the statute by regula\u00adtion. . . . Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit. [But in either instance], a court may not sub\u00adstitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\" 467 U. S., at 843-844. 488 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of Breyer, J. See also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229 (2001); Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741 (1996); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448 (1987); Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231 (1974). Chevron and later cases nd in unambiguous language a clear sign that Congress did not delegate gap-lling author\u00ad ity to an agency; and they nd in ambiguous language at least a presumptive indication that Congress did delegate that gap-lling authority. Thus, in Chevron the Court wrote that a statute's silence or ambiguity as to a particular issue means that Congress has not \"directly addressed the precise question at issue\" (thus likely delegating gap-lling power to the agency). 467 U. S., at 843. In Mead the Court, describing Chevron, explained: \"Congress . . . may not have expressly delegated author\u00adity or responsibility to implement a particular provision or ll a particular gap. Yet it can still be apparent from the agency's generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or lls a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not ac\u00adtually have an intent as to a particular result.\" 533 U. S., at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted). Chevron added that \"[i]f a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\" 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9 (emphasis added). As the Government points out, the Court in Colony stated that the statutory language at issue is not \"unambiguous.\" 357 U. S., at 33. But the Court decided that case nearly 30 years before it decided Chevron. There is no reason to be\u00ad lieve that the linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 489 Opinion of Breyer, J. lling power to the agency. At the same time, there is every reason to believe that the Court thought that Congress had \"directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" and thus left \"[no] gap for the agency to ll.\" Chevron, supra, at 842-843. For one thing, the Court said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument. Colony , 357 U. S., at 33. For another, its examination of legislative history led it to believe that Congress had decided the question deni\u00adtively, leaving no room for the agency to reach a contrary result. It found in that history \"persuasive indications\" that Congress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute's scope, and it said that it was satised that Congress \"intended an exception . . . only in the restricted type of situation\" it had already described. Id., at 35-36. Further, it thought that the Commissioner's interpretation (the inter\u00adpretation once again advanced here) would \"create a patent incongruity in the tax law.\" Id., at 36-37. And it reached this conclusion despite the fact that, in the years leading up to Colony , the Commissioner had consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit courts. See, e. g., Uptegrove , 204 F. 2d F. 2d American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commis\u00ad sioner , 1 T. C. 386 (1942). Cf. Slaff v. Commissioner , 220 F. 2d 65 (CA9 v. Hightower , 230 F. 2d 549 (CA5 1956). Thus, the Court was aware it was rejecting the ex\u00adpert opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. And nally, after completing its analysis, Colony found its inter\u00ad pretation of the 1939 Code \"in harmony with the [now] unam\u00adbiguous language\" of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests that the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as inconsistent with its conclusion. 357 U. S., at 37. It may be that judges today would use other methods to determine whether Congress left a gap to ll. But that is beside the point. The question is whether the Court in Col\u00ad ony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in our 490 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Appendix to opinion of the Court view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the Court) makes clear that it did not. Given principles of stare decisis, we must follow that inter\u00ad pretation. And there being no gap to ll, the Government's gap-lling regulation cannot change Colony' s interpretation of the statute. We agree with the taxpayers that overstate\u00adments of basis, and the resulting understatements of gross income, do not trigger the extended limitations period of \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A). The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion. See 634 F. 3d 249 (CA4 2011). And its judg\u00adment is afrmed. It is so ordered. APPENDIX We reproduce the applicable sections of the two relevant versions of the U. S. Code below. Section 6501 was amended and reorganized in 2010. See Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, \u00a7 513, 124 Stat. 111. But the parties agree that the amendments do not affect this case. We therefore have referred to, and reproduce here, the section as it ap\u00adpears in the 2000 edition of the U. S. Code. Title 26 U. S.

It would be reasonable, I think, to deny all precedential effect to Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner , 357 U. S. 28 (1958)\u2014 to overrule its holding as obviously contrary to our later law that agency resolutions of ambiguities are to be ac\u00ad corded deference. Because of justiable taxpayer reliance I would not take that course\u2014and neither does the Court's opinion, which says that \"Colony determines the outcome in this case.\" Ante , at 483. That should be the end of the matter. The plurality, however, goes on to address the Govern\u00ad ment's argument that Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1 effectively overturned Colony . See 26 CFR \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1 (2011). In my view, that cannot be: \"Once a court has de\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 493 Opinion of Scalia, J. cided upon its de novo construction of the statute, there no longer is a different construction that is consistent with the court's holding and available for adoption by the agency.\" National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 1018, n. 12 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). That view, of course, did not carry the day in Brand X, and the Government quite reasonably relies on the Brand X ma\u00ad jority's innovative pronouncement that a \"court's prior judi\u00adcial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute.\" Id., at 982. In cases decided pre-Brand X, the Court had no inkling that it must utter the magic words \"ambiguous\" or \"unam\u00ad biguous\" in order to (poof!) expand or abridge executive power, and (poof!) enable or disable administrative contradic\u00adtion of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Court was unaware of even the utility (much less the necessity) of making the ambiguous/nonambiguous determination in cases decided pre-Chevron, before that opinion made the so-called \"Step 1\" determination of ambiguity vel non a customary (though hardly mandatory 1) part of judicial-review analysis, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\u00ad cil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). For many of those earlier cases, therefore, it will be incredibly difcult to determine 1 \"Step 1\" has never been an essential part of Chevron analysis. Whether a particular statute is ambiguous makes no difference if the in\u00ad terpretation adopted by the agency is clearly reasonable\u2014and it would be a waste of time to conduct that inquiry. See Entergy Corp. v. River- keeper, Inc., 556 U. S. 208, 218, and n. 4 (2009). The same would be true if the agency interpretation is clearly beyond the scope of any conceivable ambiguity. It does not matter whether the word \"yellow\" is ambiguous when the agency has interpreted it to mean \"purple.\" See Stephenson & Vermeule, Chevron Has Only One Step, 95 Va. L. Rev. 597, 599 (2009). 494 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of Scalia, J. whether the decision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous, or rather an unambiguous, statute. Thus, one would have thought that the Brand X majority would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case, involving a pre-Chevron opinion that (mirabile dictu) makes it ines\u00ad capably clear that the Court thought the statute ambiguous: \"[I]t cannot be said that the language is unambiguous.\" Colony , supra, at 33 (emphasis added). As today's plurality opinion explains, Colony \"said that the taxpayer had the bet\u00ad ter side of the textual argument,\" ante , at 489 (emphasis added)\u2014not what Brand X requires to foreclose administra\u00ad tive revision of our decisions: \"the only permissible reading of the statute,\" 545 U. S., at 984. Thus, having decided to stand by Colony and to stand by Brand X as well, the plural\u00ad ity should have found\u2014in order to reach the decision it did\u2014 that the Treasury Department's current interpretation was unreasonable. Instead of doing what Brand X would require, however, the plurality manages to sustain the justiable reliance of taxpayers by revising yet again the meaning of Chevron\u2014 and revising it yet again in a direction that will create confu\u00ad sion and uncertainty. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 245-246 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review of Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1457-1475 (2005). Of course there is no doubt that, with regard to the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department satises the Mead requirement of some indication \"that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law.\" 533 U. S., at 226-227. We have given Chevron deference to a Treasury Regulation before. See Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. 44, 58 (2011). But in order to evade Brand X and yet reafrm Colony , the plurality would add yet another lop-sided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our law of adminis\u00adtrative review has become: To trigger the Brand X power Cite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 495 Opinion of Scalia, J. of an authorized \"gap-lling\" agency to give content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determination that language is ambiguous does not alone sufce; the pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that Congress wanted the par\u00ad ticular ambiguity in question to be resolved by the agency. And here, today's plurality opinion nds, \"[t]here is no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony re\u00ad flects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap-lling power to the agency.\" Ante, at 488-489. The notion, seemingly, is that post-Chevron a nding of ambi\u00ad guity is accompanied by a nding of agency authority to re\u00ad solve the ambiguity, but pre-Chevron that was not so. The premise is false. Post-Chevron cases do not \"conclude\" that Congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved by the agency; that is simply the legal effect of ambiguity\u2014a legal effect that should obtain whenever the language is in fact (as Colony found) ambiguous. Does the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to Colo\u00ad ny's determination of ambiguity because the Court did not know, in that era, the importance of that determination\u2014 that it would empower the agency to (in effect) revise the Court's determination of statutory meaning? But as I sug\u00adgested earlier, that was an ignorance which all of our cases shared not just pre-Chevron, but pre-Brand X. Before then it did not really matter whether the Court was resolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute's clear meaning. The opinion might (or might not) advert to that point in the course of its analysis, but either way the Court's interpreta\u00adtion of the statute would be the law. So it is no small num\u00adber of still-authoritative cases that today's plurality opinion would exile to the Land of Uncertainty. Perhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach, the plu\u00ad rality opinion then pivots (as the a la mode vernacular has it)\u2014from focusing on whether Colony concluded that there was gap-lling authority to focusing on whether Colony con\u00ad cluded that there was any gap to be lled: \"The question is 496 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Opinion of Scalia, J. whether the Court in Colony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in our view, the opinion . . . makes clear that it did not.\" Ante, at 489-490. How does the plurality know this? Because Justice Harlan's opinion \"said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument\"; be\u00adcause it found that legislative history indicated \"that Con\u00adgress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute's scope\"; because it concluded that the Commission\u00ader's interpretation would \"create a patent incongruity in the tax law\"; and because it found its interpretation \"in harmony with the [now] unambiguous language\" of the 1954 Code. Ante, at 489 (internal quotation marks omitted). But these are the sorts of arguments that courts always use in resolv\u00ad ing ambiguities. They do not prove that no ambiguity ex\u00ad isted, unless one believes that an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never existed in the rst place. Colony said unambiguously that the text was ambiguous, and that should be an end of the matter\u2014unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis effect to Colony as a pre-Chevron decision. Rather than making our judicial-review jurisprudence cu\u00ad riouser and curiouser, the Court should abandon the opinion that produces these contortions, Brand X. I join the judg\u00ad ment announced by the Court because it is indisputable that Colony resolved the construction of the statutory language at issue here, and that construction must therefore control. And I join the Court's opinion except for Part IV-C. * * * I must add a word about the peroration of the dissent, which asserts that \"[o]ur legal system presumes there will be continuing dialogue among the three branches of Gov\u00adernment on questions of statutory interpretation and appli\u00adcation,\" and that the \" 'constructive discourse,' \" \" 'conver\u00ads[ations],' \" and \"instructive exchanges\" would be \"foreclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new, relevant statutory amend\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 497 Kennedy, J., dissenting ments.\" Post, at 503-504 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). This passage is reminiscent of Professor K. C. Davis's vision that administrative procedure is developed by \"a partnership between legislators and judges,\" who \"working [as] partners produce better law than legislators alone could possibly produce.\" 2 That romantic, judge-empowering image was obliterated by this Court in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978), which held that Congress prescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the administrative procedures that Congress has created. It seems to me that the dissent's vision of a troika partnership (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage. The discourse, conversation, and ex\u00adchange that the dissent perceives is peculiarly one-sided. Congress prescribes; and where Congress's prescription is ambiguous the Executive can (within the scope of the ambi\u00adguity) clarify that prescription; and if the product is constitu\u00adtional the courts obey. I hardly think it amounts to a \"dis\u00adcourse\" that Congress or (as this Court would allow in its Brand X decision) the Executive can change its prescription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant. What is needed for the system to work is that Congress, the Executive, and the private parties subject to their dispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts will give to their instruc\u00adtions. That goal would be obstructed if the judicially estab\u00adlished meaning of a technical legal term used in a very spe\u00adcic context could be overturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble as those asserted here. Justice Kennedy , with whom Justice Ginsburg , Jus\u00ad tice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. This case involves a provision of the Internal Revenue Code establishing an extended statute of limitations for tax assessment in cases where substantial income has been omit\u00ad 2 1 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 2.17, p. 138 (2d ed. 1978). 498 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Kennedy, J., dissenting ted from a tax return. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The Treasury Department has determined that taxpayers omit income under this section not only when they fail to report a sale of property but also when they overstate their basis in the property sold. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1, 26 CFR \u00a7 301.6501(e)-1 (2011). The question is whether this otherwise reasonable interpretation is fore\u00adclosed by the Court's contrary reading of an earlier version of the statute in Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner , 357 U. S. 28 (1958). In Colony there was no need to decide whether the mean\u00ad ing of the provision changed when Congress reenacted it as part of the 1954 revision of the Tax Code. Although the main text of the statute remained the same, Congress added new provisions leading to the permissible conclusion that it would have a different meaning going forward. The Colony decision reserved judgment on this issue. In my view, the amended statute leaves room for the Department's reading. A summary of the reasons for concluding the Department's interpretation is permissible, and for this respectful dissent, now follows. I The statute at issue in Colony , 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 275(c) (1940 ed.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It provided for a longer period of limitations if the Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer who had \"omit[ted] from gross income an amount . . . in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\" There was disagreement in the courts about the meaning of this provision in the statute as rst enacted. The Tax Court of the United States, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an overstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross income and could trigger the extended limitations period. See, e. g., Reis v. Commissioner , 142 F. 2d 900, 902-903 (1944); American Lib\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 499 Kennedy, J., dissenting erty Oil Co. v. Commissioner , 1 T. C. 386 (1942). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case where a corporation misre\u00adported its income after inflating the cost of goods it sold from inventory. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner , 204 F. 2d 570, 571-573 (1953). In the Third Circuit's view there could be an omission only where the taxpayer had left an entire \"item of gain out of his computation of gross income.\" Id., at 571. In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court resolved that dispute against the Government. Ac\u00adknowledging that \"it cannot be said that the language is un\u00ad ambiguous,\" 357 U. S., at 33, and relying in large part on the legislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded that the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an omis\u00adsion from gross income under \u00a7 275(c). If the Government is to prevail in the instant case the regulation in question must be a proper implementation of the same language the Court considered in Colony; but the statutory interpretation issue here cannot be resolved, and the Colony decision cannot be deemed controlling, without rst considering the inferences that should be drawn from added statutory text. The additional language was not part of the statute that governed the taxpayer's liability in Col\u00ad ony, and the Court did not consider it in that case. Con\u00ad gress revised the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, several years before Colony was decided but after the tax years in question in that case. Although the interpretation adopted by the Court in Colony can be a proper beginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute, it ought not to be the end. The central language of the new provision remained the same as the old, with the longer period of limitations still applicable where a taxpayer had \"omit[ted] from gross in\u00adcome an amount . . . in excess of 25 per[cent] of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\" In Colony , however, the Court left open whether Congress had nonetheless \"man\u00ad500 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Kennedy, J., dissenting ifested an intention to clarify or to change the 1939 Code.\" Id., at 37. The 1954 revisions, of course, could not provide a direct response to Colony , which had not yet been decided. But there were indications that, whatever the earlier version of the statute had meant, Congress expected that the over\u00adstatement of basis would be considered an omission from gross income as a general rule going forward. For example, the new law created a special exception for businesses by dening their gross income to be \"the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services\" without factoring in \"the cost of such sales or services.\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A)(i) (1958 ed.) (currently \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)). The principal pur\u00adpose of this provision, perhaps motivated by the facts in the Third Circuit's Uptegrove decision, seems to have been to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not be activated by a business' overstatement of the cost of goods sold. This did important work. There are, after all, unique complexities involved in calculating inventory costs. See, e. g., O. Whittington & K. Pany, Principles of Auditing and Other Assurance Services 488 (15th ed. 2006) (\"The audit of inventories presents the auditors with signicant risk be\u00adcause: ( a) they often represent a very substantial portion of current assets, ( b) numerous valuation methods are used for inventories, ( c) the valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods sold, and ( d) the determination of inventory quality, condition, and value is inherently complex\"); see also Internal Revenue Service, Publication 538, Accounting Peri\u00adods and Methods 17 (rev. Mar. 2008) (discussing methods for identifying the cost of items in inventory). Congress sought t to make clear that errors in these kinds of calculations would not extend the limitations period. Colony itself might be classied as a special \"business in\u00ad ventory\" case. Unlike the taxpayers here, the taxpayer in Colony claimed to be a business with income from the sale of goods, though the \"goods\" it held for sale were real estate lots. See Intermountain Ins. Serv. of Vail v. Commis\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 501 Kennedy, J., dissenting sioner , 650 F. 3d 691, 703 (CADC 2011) (Tatel, J.) (\"Colony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or business with income from the sale of goods or services\u2014i. e., as falling within [clause] (i)'s scope had the subsection applied pre\u00ad1954 . . . \"). The Court, in turn, observed that its construc\u00adtion of the pre-1954 statute in favor of the taxpayer was \"in harmony with the unambiguous language of [newly enacted] \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A).\" 357 U. S., at 37. Clause (i) of the new pro\u00advision, as just noted, ensured that the extended limitations period would not cover overstated costs of goods sold. The revised statute's special treatment of these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in other cases could have the effect of extending the limitations period. It is also signicant that, after 1954, the statute continued to address the omission of a substantial \"amount\" that should have been included in gross income. In the same round of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established an extended limitations period in certain cases where \"items\" had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return. 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6501(e)(2) (1958 ed.). There is at least some evidence that this term was used at that time to \"mak[e] it clear\" that the extended limitations period would not apply \"merely because of differences between the taxpayer and the Government as to the valuation of property.\" Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, Summary of the New Provi\u00adsions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 130 (Comm. Print 1955). Congress' decision not to use the term \"items\" to achieve the same result when it reen\u00adacted the statutory provision at issue is presumed to have been purposeful. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983). This consideration casts further doubt on the premise that the new version of the statute, \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as its predecessor. II In the instant case the Court concludes these statutory changes are \"too fragile to bear the signicant argumenta\u00ad502 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Kennedy, J., dissenting tive weight the Government seeks to place upon them.\" Ante, at 484. But in this context, the changes are meaningful. Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version of the statute could not be described as unambiguous, although it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of basis was not an omission from gross income. See 357 U. S., at 33. The statutory revisions, which were not considered in Colony , may not compel the opposite conclusion under the new stat\u00adute; but they strongly favor it. As a result, there was room for the Treasury Department to interpret the new provision in that manner. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\u00ad sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-845 (1984). In an earlier case, and in an unrelated controversy not im\u00ad plicating the Internal Revenue Code, the Court held that a judicial construction of an ambiguous statute did not fore\u00adclose an agency's later, inconsistent interpretation of the same provision. National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982-983 (2005) (\"Only a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency's interpretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to ll, displaces a conflicting agency construction\"). This general rule rec\u00adognizes that lling gaps left by ambiguities in a statute \"involves difcult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\" Id., at 980. There has been no opportunity to decide whether the analysis would be any different if an agency sought to interpret an ambiguous statute in a way that was inconsistent with this Court's own, earlier reading of the law. See id., at 1003 (Stevens, J., concurring). These issues are not implicated here. In Colony the Court did interpret the same phrase that must be inter\u00adpreted in this case. The language was in a predecessor stat\u00adute, however, and Congress has added new language that, in my view, controls the analysis and should instruct the Court to reach a different outcome today. The Treasury Depart\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 503 Kennedy, J., dissenting ment's regulations were promulgated in light of these statu\u00ad tory revisions, which were not at issue in Colony . There is a serious difculty to insisting, as the Court does today, that an ambiguous provision must continue to be read the same way even after it has been reenacted with additional lan\u00adguage suggesting Congress would permit a different inter\u00adpretation. Agencies with the responsibility and expertise necessary to administer ongoing regulatory schemes should have the latitude and discretion to implement their interpre\u00adtation of provisions reenacted in a new statutory framework. And this is especially so when the new language enacted by Congress seems to favor the very interpretation at issue. The approach taken by the Court instead forecloses later in\u00adterpretations of a law that has changed in relevant ways. Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 247 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Worst of all, the majority's ap\u00adproach will lead to the ossication of large portions of our statutory law. Where Chevron applies, statutory ambigu\u00ad ities remain ambiguities subject to the agency's ongoing clar\u00adication\"). The Court goes too far, in my respectful view, in constricting Congress' ability to leave agencies in charge of lling statutory gaps. Our legal system presumes there will be continuing dia\u00ad logue among the three branches of Government on questions of statutory interpretation and application. See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 326 (2004) (Kennedy, J., dissent\u00ading) (\"Constant, constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures is an integral and admirable part of the constitutional design\"); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989) (\"Our principle of separation of powers antici\u00adpates that the coordinate Branches will converse with each other on matters of vital common interest\"). In some cases Congress will set out a general principle, to be administered in more detail by an agency in the exercise of its discretion. The agency may be in a proper position to evaluate the best means of implementing the statute in its practical applica\u00ad504 UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPL Y, LLC Kennedy, J., dissenting tion. Where the agency exceeds its authority, of course, courts must invalidate the regulation. And agency inter\u00adpretations that lead to unjust or unfair consequences can be corrected, much like disfavored judicial interpretations, by congressional action. These instructive exchanges would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpreta\u00adtions of a statute even in light of new, relevant statutory amendments. Courts instead should be open to an agency's adoption of a different interpretation where, as here, Con\u00adgress has given new instruction by an amended statute. Under the circumstances, the Treasury Department had authority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new tax provision at issue. See Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. 44, 58 (2011). This was also the conclusion reached in well-reasoned opin\u00adions issued in several cases before the Courts of Appeals. E. g., Intermountain, 650 F. 3d, at 705-706 (reaching this conclusion \"because the Court in Colony never purported to interpret [the new provision]; because [the new provision]'s 'omits from gross income' text is at least ambiguous, if not best read to include overstatements of basis; and because neither the section's structure nor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity\"). The Department's clarication of an ambiguous statute, applicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate set\u00adtled expectations. Given the statutory changes described above, taxpayers had reason to question whether Colony's holding extended to the revised \u00a7 6501(e)(1). See, e. g., CC & F Western Operations L. P . v. Commissioner , 273 F. 3d 402, 406, n. 2 (CA1 2001) (\"Whether Colony's main holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least doubtful\"). Hav\u00ading worked no change in the law, and instead having inter\u00adpreted a statutory provision without an established meaning, the Department's regulation does not have an impermissible retroactive effect. Cf. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741, 744, n. 3 (1996) (rejecting retroactiv\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 478 (2012) 505 Kennedy, J., dissenting ity argument); Manhattan Gen.

As relevant here, \u00a7 507(a)(2) covers \"administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b),\" which estate.\" \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B)(i). Petitioners led for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their farm. They proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabil\u00adities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from the sale. Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance being discharged. The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398, 1399, it does not \"incur\" postpetition federal income taxes. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the tax was not \"incurred by the estate\" under \u00a7 503(b), it was not a priority claim eligible for the \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) exception. Held: The federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners' postpeti\u00ad tion farm sale is not \"incurred by the estate\" under \u00a7 503(b) of the Bank\u00adruptcy Code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the Chapter 12 plan. Pp. 511524. (a) The phrase \"incurred by the estate\" bears a plain and natural reading. A tax \"incurred by the estate\" is a tax for which the estate itself is liable. Only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes. IRC \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399 dene the division of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by\u00ad chapter basis. Under those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 507 Syllabus separately taxable entity. The debtor\u2014not the trustee\u2014is generally liable for taxes and les the only tax return. The postpetition income taxes are thus not \"incurred by the estate.\" Pp. 511513. (b) Section 346 of the Bankruptcy Code and its longstanding interplay with IRC \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399 reinforce that whether an estate \"incurs\" taxes turns on Congress' chapter-specic guidance on which estates are separately taxable. The original \u00a7 346 established that state or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, and only on the debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Congress applied the framework of \u00a7 346 to federal taxes two years later: IRC \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399 established that the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases, and not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter 12) cases. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 subsequently amended \u00a7 346, expressly aligning its assignment of state or local taxes with the IRC separate taxable entity rules for federal taxes. This Court assumes that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the existing law at the enactment of \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate's liability for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules. Pp. 513516. (c) Chapter 13, on which Chapter 12 was modeled, further bolsters this Court's holding. Established understandings hold that postpetition income taxes are not \"incurred by the [Chapter 13] estate\" under \u00a7 503(b) because they are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone. The Government has also long hewed to this position. Section 1305(a)(1), which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of col\u00adlecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case, would be super\u00adfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collectible inside the bankruptcy. It is thus clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and are not administrative expenses under \u00a7 503(b). To hold otherwise in Chapter 12 would dis\u00adrupt settled practices in Chapter 13 cases. Pp. 516519. (d) None of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent overcomes the statute's plain language, context, and structure. There is no textual basis for giving \"incurred by the estate\" a temporal mean\u00ading, such that it refers to all taxes \"incurred postpetition.\" Nor does the text support deeming a tax \"incurred by the estate\" whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate. Section 503's legisla\u00adtive history is not inconsistent with this Court's holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language. See Milner v. Department of Navy , 562 U. S. 562, 572. Meanwhile, any cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses are inapposite because they 508 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court involve corporate debtors, which Congress has singled out for responsi\u00ad bilities paralleling those borne by a separate taxable entity's trustee. Finally, petitioners contend that the purpose of \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts. There may be com\u00adpelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable. But if Congress intended petitioners' result, it did not so provide in the statute.

Under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, farmer debtors may treat certain claims owed to a governmental unit re\u00ad sulting from the disposition of farm assets as discharge-able, unsecured liabilities. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A). One such claim is for \"any . incurred by the estate.\" \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B)(i). The question presented is whether a fed\u00aderal income tax liability resulting from individual debtors' sale of a farm during the pendency of a Chapter 12 bank\u00adruptcy is \"incurred by the estate\" and thus dischargeable. We hold that it is not. *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were led for Donald W. Dawes et al. by G. Eric Brunstad, Jr., Collin O'Connor Udell, and Matthew J. Delude; and for Neil E. Harl et al. by Joseph A. Peiffer. Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 509 Opinion of the Court I A In 1986, Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1201 et seq., to allow farmer debtors with regular annual income to adjust their debts. Chapter 12 was mod\u00ad eled on Chapter 13, \u00a7 1301 et seq., which permits individual debtors with regular annual income to preserve existing assets subject to a \"court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income.\" Hamilton v. Lan\u00ad ning , 560 U. S. 505, 508 (2010). Chapter 12 debtors similarly le a plan of reorganization. \u00a7 1221. To be conrmed, the plan must provide for the full payment of priority claims. \u00a7 1222(a)(2). In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Pro\u00ad tection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), \u00a7 1003, 119 Stat. 186, Con\u00adgress created an exception to that requirement: \"Contents . \"(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless\u2014 \"(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, exchange, or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor's farming operation, in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to pri\u00adority under section 507, but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge.\" 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1222. Under \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A), certain governmental claims resulting from the disposition of farm assets are downgraded to gen\u00aderal, unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less than full payment. See \u00a7 1228(a). The claims are stripped of their priority status. 510 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court That exception, however, applies only to claims in the plan that are \"entitled to priority under section 507\" in the rst place. Section 507 lists 10 categories of such claims. Two pertain to taxes: One category, \u00a7 507(a)(8), covers prepetition taxes, and is inapplicable in this case. The other, \u00a7 507(a)(2), covers \"administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b),\" which in turn includes \"any tax . . by the estate.\" \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B)(i). Thus, for postpetition taxes to be entitled to priority under \u00a7 507 and eligible for the \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) exception, the taxes must be \"incurred by the estate.\" B Petitioners Lynwood and Brenda Hall petitioned for bank\u00ad ruptcy under Chapter 12 and sold their farm shortly thereaf\u00adter. Petitioners initially proposed a plan of reorganization under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a federal income tax of $29,000 on the capital gains from the farm sale. Petitioners amended their proposal to treat the income tax as a general, unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance discharged. Again the IRS objected. Taxes on income from a postpetition farm sale, the IRS argued, remain the debtors' independent responsibility because they are neither collectible nor dis-chargeable in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court sustained the objection. The court reasoned that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), see 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398, 1399, it cannot \"incur\" taxes for purposes of 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 503(b). The District Court reversed, expressing doubt that IRC provisions are relevant to interpreting \u00a7 503(b). Based on its reading of legislative history, the District Court deter\u00admined that Congress intended \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) to extend to petitioners' postpetition taxes. Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 511 Opinion of the Court The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 617 F. 3d 1161 (2010). The Court of Appeals held that the Chap\u00ad ter 12 estate does not \"incur\" the postpetition federal income taxes for purposes of \u00a7 503(b) because it is not a separate taxable entity under the IRC, and noted that Congress re\u00adpeatedly has indicated the relevance of the IRC's taxable en\u00adtity provisions to the Bankruptcy Code. Although \"sym\u00adpathetic\" to the view that the postpetition tax liabilities should be dischargeable, the Court of Appeals held that \"the operative language simply failed to make its way into the statute.\" Id., at 1167. The Court of Appeals concluded that because the taxes do not qualify under \u00a7 503(b), they are not priority claims in the plan eligible for the \u00a7 1222(a) (2)(A) exception. Judge Paez dissented, siding with a sister Circuit that had concluded that Congress intended \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) to ex\u00adtend to such postpetition federal income taxes. We granted certiorari to resolve the split of authority. 1 564 U. S. 1003 (2011). II A Our resolution of this case turns on the meaning of a phrase in \u00a7 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code: \"incurred by the estate.\" The parties agree that \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) applies only to priority claims collectible in the bankruptcy plan and that postpetition federal income taxes so qualify only if they con\u00adstitute a \"tax . . by the estate\" bears a plain and nat\u00ad ural reading. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397, 403 (2011) (\"When a statute does not dene a term, we typically 'give the phrase its ordinary meaning' \"). To \"incur,\" one 1 Compare In re Dawes, 652 F. 3d 1236 (CA10 2011), and 617 F. 3d 1161 (CA9 2010) (case below), with Knudsen v. IRS, 581 F. 3d 696 (CA8 2009) (postpetition federal taxes are eligible for the \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) exception and thus dischargeable). 512 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court must \"suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).\" Black's Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed. 2009); see also 1146 . . be\u00adcome liable or upon oneself\"); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (\"to become liable or subject to through one's own action; bring upon oneself\"). A tax \"incurred by the estate\" is a tax for which the estate itself is liable. As the IRC makes clear, only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes. Title 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399 address taxation in bankruptcy and dene the division of re\u00ad sponsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Section 1398 provides that when an individual debtor les for Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, the estate shall be liable for taxes. In such cases, the trustee les a separate return on the estate's behalf and \"[t]he tax\" on \"the taxable income of the estate . . shall be paid . an estate of individual under chapter 7 or 11 . . . shall be made by the duciary thereof\"). Section 1399 provides that \"[e]xcept in any case to which section 1398 applies, no separate taxable entity shall result from the commencement of a [bankruptcy] case.\" In Chap\u00adter 12 and 13 cases, then, there is no separately taxable es\u00adtate. The debtor\u2014not the trustee\u2014is generally liable for taxes and les the only tax return. See In re Lindsey , 142 B. R. 447, 448 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1992) (\"It is clear that, pursuant to 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 1398 and 1399, the standing Chapter 12 trustee neither les a return nor pays federal income tax\"); cf. infra, at 521-522 (discussing special trustee duties in corporate-debtor cases). These provisions sufce to resolve this case: Chapter 12 estates are not taxable entities. Petitioners, not the estate itself, are required to le the tax return and are liable for the taxes resulting from their postpetition farm sale. The postpetition federal income tax liability is not \"incurred by Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 513 Opinion of the Court the estate\" and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in the Chapter 12 plan.2 B Our reading of \"incurred by the estate\" as informed by the IRC's separate taxable entity rules draws support from a related provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 346, and its longstanding interplay with 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399. That relationship illustrates that from the inception of the current Bankruptcy Code, Congress has specied on a chapter-by-chapter basis which estates are separately tax\u00adable and therefore liable for taxes. That relationship also refutes the dissent's suggestion that applying such rules is an incongruous importation of \" tax law\" unconnected to \"bankruptcy principles (as Congress understood them).\" Post, at 531 (opinion of Breyer, J .). And it reinforces the reasonableness of our view that whether an estate \"in\u00adcurs\" taxes under \u00a7 503(b) turns on such chapter-by-chapter distinctions. In the original Bankruptcy Code, Congress included a pro\u00ad vision, \u00a7 346, that set out a chapter-specic division of tax liabilities between the estate and the debtor. Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2565. Section 346(b)(1) pro\u00advided that in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bank\u00adruptcy, \"any income of the estate may be taxed under a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only to the estate , and may not be taxed to such individual.\" 92 Stat. 2565 (emphasis added); see also 11 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6TX12.03[5][b][i], TX12-21 (16th ed. 2011) (hereinafter Collier) (Section 346(b) \"provided that in a case under chapter 7 [or] 11 . . . the estate of an individual is a taxable entity\"). Section 346(d) provided, meanwhile, that in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, \"any income of the estate or the debtor may be taxed under a 2 Because we hold that the postpetition federal income taxes at issue are not collectible in the plan because they are not \"incurred by the estate,\" we need not address the Government's broader alternative argument that Chapter 12 plans are exclusively limited to prepetition claims. 514 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court State or local law imposing a tax . . . only to the debtor , and may not be taxed to the estate .\" 92 Stat. 2566 (empha\u00ad sis added). Congress thus established that the estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy is a separate taxable entity; the estate in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is not. 3 Although \u00a7 346 concerned state or local taxes,4 Congress applied its framework to federal taxes two years later. In the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 3397, Congress enacted 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399. Section 1398 of the 3 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history conrms that Congress viewed \u00a7 346 as dening which estates were separate tax\u00ad able entities. See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 275 (1977) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (\"A threshold issue to be considered when a debtor les a petition under title 11 is whether the estate created . . . should be treated as a separate taxable entity\"); id., at 334 (\"Subsection (d) indicates that the estate in a chapter 13 case is not a separate taxable entity\"); accord, S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 45 (1978) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep., at 335 (noting \"the creation of the estate of an individual under chapters 7 or 11 of title 11 as a separate taxable entity\"); accord, S. Rep., at 46. The Reports also tie separate taxable entity status to the responsibility to le returns and pay taxes. See H. R. Rep., at 277 (\"If the estate is a separate taxable entity, then the representative of the estate is responsible for ling any income tax returns and paying any taxes due by the estate\"); id., at 278 (\"When the estate is not a separate taxable entity, then taxation of the debtor should be conducted on the same basis as if no petition were led\"). 4 A dispute over Committee jurisdiction led to the insertion of \"State or local\" before each mention of \"law imposing a Compare H. R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 346 (1977), with \u00a7 346, 92 Stat. 2565. Nonetheless, the House Report underscored that the policy behind \u00a7 346 applied equally to federal taxes: \"[T]here is a strong bankruptcy policy that these provisions apply equally to Federal, State, and local taxes. However, in order to avoid any possi\u00adble jurisdictional conflict with the Ways and Means Committee over the applicability of these provisions to Federal taxes, H. R. 8200 has been amended to make the sections inapplicable to Federal taxes. The amend\u00adment . . . will obviate the need for a sequential referral of the bill to Ways and Means, which will be considering these provisions and other bankruptcy-related tax law later in this Congress.\" H. R. Rep., at 275. Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 515 Opinion of the Court IRC, much like \u00a7 346(b) in the Bankruptcy Code, established that the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases. Section 1399 of the IRC, much like \u00a7 346(d) in the Bankruptcy Code, claried that the estate is not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter 12) cases. In 2005, Congress in BAPCPA amended \u00a7 346 and crystal\u00ad lized the connection between the Bankruptcy Code and the IRC. Section 346 now expressly aligns its assignment of state or local taxes with the rules for federal taxes, provid\u00ading in relevant part: \"(a) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that a separate taxable estate or entity is cre\u00adated in a case concerning a debtor under this title, and the income . . . of such estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate, a separate taxable estate is also created for purposes of any State and local law imposing a tax on or measured by income and such income . . . shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may not be taxed to or claimed by the debtor . . . . \"(b) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title, and the income . . . of an estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor, such income . . . shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under a State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income and may not be taxed to or claimed by the estate .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, whenever the estate is separately taxable under fed\u00ad eral income tax law, that \"is also\" the case under state or local income tax law, \u00a7 346(a), and vice versa, \u00a7 346(b). And given that the Bankruptcy Code instructs that the assign\u00adment of state or local tax liabilities shall turn on the IRC's separate taxable entity rules, there is parity in turning to such rules in assigning federal tax liabilities. 516 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court In the same Act, Congress added \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A). Section 1222(a)(2)(A) carves out an exception to the ordinary priority classication scheme. But \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) did not purport to redene which claims are otherwise entitled to priority, much less alter the underlying division of tax liability be\u00adtween the estate and the debtor in Chapter 12 cases. \"We assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,\" Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990), and the existing law at the enactment of \u00a7 1222(a) (2)(A) indicated that an estate's liability for taxes turned on chapter-by-chapter separate taxable entity rules. C The statutory structure further reinforces our holding that petitioners' postpetition income taxes are not \"incurred by the estate.\" As a leading bankruptcy treatise and lower courts recognize, \"[b]ecause chapter 12 was modeled on chap\u00adter 13, and because so many of the provisions are identical, chapter 13 cases construing provisions corresponding to chapter 12 provisions may be relied on as authority in chap\u00adter 12 cases.\" 8 Collier \u00b61200.01[5], at 1200-10; In re Lopez, 372 B. R. 40, 45, n. 13 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA9 2007); Justice v. Valley Nat. Bank, 849 F. 2d 1078, 1083 (CA8 1988). We agree. 1222(a)(2), requires full pay\u00adment of \"all claims entitled to priority under section 507\" under the plan. Both provisions cross-reference the same section of the Code, \u00a7 507, and in turn, the same subsection, \u00a7 503(b). Both are treated alike by IRC \u00a7\u00a7 and 1399. Whether postpetition taxes qualify under \u00a7 503(b) in Chapter 13 thus sheds light on whether they so qualify in petitioners' Chapter 12 case. Bankruptcy courts and commentators have reasoned that postpetition income taxes are not \"incurred by the estate\" under \u00a7 503(b) because \"a tax on postpetition income of the debtor or of the chapter 13 estate is not a liability of the chapter 13 estate; it is a liability of the debtor alone.\" 8 Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 517 Opinion of the Court Collier \u00b61305.02[1], at 1305-5 and 1305-6.5 For over a dec\u00ad ade, the Government has likewise hewed to the position that \"since post-petition tax liabilities are, in Chapter 13 cases, incurred by the debtor, rather than the bankruptcy estate, characterizing such liabilities as administrative expenses is inconsistent with section 503.\" IRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200113027, p. 6 (Mar. 30, 2001), 2001 WL 307746; see also Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 5.9.10.9.2(3) (2006) (hereinafter IRM); IRS Litigation Guideline Memorandum GL-26, p. 9 (Dec. 16, 1996), 1996 WL 33107107. We see no reason to de\u00ad part from those established understandings. To \" 'hold the Chapter 13 estate liable for [a] tax when it does not exist as a taxable entity dees common sense as well as Congress' intent.' \" In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 2008). The same holds true for a Chapter 12 estate. A provision in Chapter 13 conrms that postpetition in\u00ad come taxes fall outside \u00a7 503(b). Section 1305(a)(1) provides that \"[a] proof of claim may be led by any entity that holds a claim against the debtor . . . for taxes that become payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending.\" (Empha\u00adsis added.) That provision gives holders of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case\u2014an option that the Government would never need to invoke if postpetition tax liabilities were al\u00adready collectible inside the bankruptcy. Accordingly, lest we render \u00a7 1305 \" 'inoperative or superfluous,' \" Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004), it is clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and, a fortiori, are not administrative expenses under \u00a7 503(b). 5 See, e. g., In B. R. 616, 620 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tex. re 1, 5-6 (Bkrtcy. 3370867, *3 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass., Nov. 20, 2006); In re Gyulaa, 65 B. R. 913, 916 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1986). 518 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court It follows that postpetition income taxes are not automati\u00ad cally collectible in 12 plan.6 Because both 503(b) in an identical manner, see \u00a7\u00a7 1222(a)(2), are cognizant that any con\u00adflicting reading of \u00a7 503(b) here could disrupt settled Chapter 13 practices. See Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998) (the Court \" 'will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure' \"). Chapter 13 lings outnumber Chapter 12 lings six hundredfold. See U. S. Bankruptcy Courts\u2014Cases Commenced During the 12\u00adMonth Period Ending September 30, 2011 (Table F-2) (esti\u00admating 676 and 417,503 annual Chapter 12 and 13 lings, 6 The dissent suggests that Chapter 12 can be distinguished from Chap\u00ad ter 13 because Chapter 12 bankruptcies tend to be longer, such that the treatment of taxes is more \"important.\" Post, at 535. As a practical mat\u00ad ter, it is not clear that Chapter 12 bankruptcies are substantially longer. Compare Brief for Neil E. Harl et al. as Amici Curiae 33 (median Chapter 12 case duration is under 8 months) with Tr. of Oral Arg. 49 (\"on average we're talking about 4 months in a chapter 13 case\"). In any event, there is no indication that Congress intended any difference in duration\u2014if it anticipated a difference at all\u2014to flip the characterization of postpetition income taxes from one chapter to the other. Nor does the absence of a \u00a7 1305 equivalent in Chapter 12 justify shoehorning postpetition taxes into \u00a7 503(b), as the dissent argues. That Chapter 12 lacks a provision allow\u00ading such taxes to be brought inside the plan only claries that such taxes fall outside of the plan. The dissent alternatively suggests that it \"do[es] not see the serious harm in treating the relevant taxes as 'administrative expenses' in both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases.\" Post, at 536. The \"harm\" is to settled understandings in Chapter 13 to the contrary. The \"harm\" is also to \u00a7 1305; to avoid rendering \u00a7 1305 a nullity, the dissent recasts the provi\u00adsion as applicable not to all \"taxes that become payable . . . while the case is pending,\" but only those payable \" after the Chapter 13 Plan is con\u00ad rmed.\" Ibid. The dissent does not claim, however, that this was Con\u00ad gress' intent for \u00a7 1305, as Congress' choice of words would be exceedingly overbroad if it were. And the dissent's novel reading contravenes ample Chapter 13 authority recognizing no such limitation on \u00a7 1305's scope. E. g., 8 Collier \u00b61305.02 (citing cases). Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 519 Opinion of the Court respectively), http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/Bankruptcy Statistics.aspx (as visited May 14, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court's case le). Yet adopting petitioners' reading of \u00a7 503(b) would mean that, in every Chapter 13 case, the Government could ignore \u00a7 1305 and expect priority payment of postpetition income taxes in every plan. At bottom, \"identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.\" Pow\u00ad erex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007). Absent any indication that Congress intended a conflict between two closely related chapters, we decline to create one. 7 III Petitioners and the dissent advance several arguments for why the postpetition income taxes at issue should be consid\u00adered \"incurred by the estate,\" notwithstanding the IRC's separate taxable entity rules. But none provides sufcient reason to overcome the statute's plain language, context, and structure. Petitioners primarily argue that \"incurred by the estate\" has a temporal meaning. Petitioners emphasize that the es\u00adtate only comes into existence after a bankruptcy petition is led. Thus, they reason, taxes \"incurred by the estate\" refers to all taxes \"incurred postpetition,\" regardless of whether the estate is liable for the tax and regardless of the chapter under which a case is led. Although all taxes \"incurred by the estate\" are necessarily incurred postpeti\u00adtion, not all taxes incurred postpetition are \"incurred by the 7 IRS manuals dating back to 1998 indicate that the Government did not view postpetition federal income taxes as collectible in an individual debt\u00ad or's Chapter 12 plan, even when that view was adverse to its interests. See IRM \u00a7 25.17.12.9.3 ch. 10.8(4) (1998). Until the enactment of 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A), treating such taxes as priority claims in the plan would have assured the Government of full payment before or at the time of the plan. 520 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court estate.\" That an estate cannot incur liability until it exists does not mean that every liability that arises after that point automatically becomes the estate's liability. And there is no textual basis to focus on when the liability is incurred, as opposed to whether the liability is incurred \"by the estate.\" Alternatively, petitioners contend that a tax should be con\u00ad sidered \"incurred by the estate\" so long as it is payable out of estate assets. Income from postpetition sales of farm assets is considered property of the estate. See \u00a7 1207(a). Petitioners argue that even if the debtor\u2014and not the estate\u2014is liable for a tax, the tax is still \"incurred by the estate\" because the funds the debtor uses to pay the tax are property of the estate. But that too strains the text beyond what it can bear. To concede that someone other than the estate is liable for ling the return and paying the tax, and yet maintain that the estate is the one that has \"incurred\" the tax, dees the ordinary meaning of \"incur\" as bringing a liability upon oneself. The dissent, echoing both of these points, urges that we \"simply . . . consider the debtor and estate as merged.\" Post, at 534. \"The English language,\" the dissent reasons, \"permits this reading\" and \"do[es] not require\" our reading. Post, 531. But any reading of \"tax . . . incurred by the estate\" that is contingent on merging the debtor and estate\u2014 despite Congress' longstanding efforts to distinguish be\u00ad tween when tax liabilities are borne by the debtor or borne by the estate\u2014is not a natural construction of the statute as written. Moreover, these alternative readings create a conflict be\u00ad tween \u00a7 503(b) and \u00a7 346(b). Petitioners consider postpeti\u00adtion state or local income taxes, like federal income taxes, to be \"incurred by the estate\" under \u00a7 503(b). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. But \u00a7 346(b) requires that such taxes be borne by the Chapter 12 debtor, not the estate. It is implausible to maintain that taxes are \"incurred by the estate\" when Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 521 Opinion of the Court \u00a7 346(b) specically prohibits such taxes from being \"taxed to or claimed by the estate.\" To buttress their counterintuitive readings of the text, petitioners and the dissent suggest that there is a long history of treating postpetition taxes as administrative expenses entitled to priority. Both point to two legislative Reports accompanying the 1978 enactment of \u00a7 503. But neither snippet from which they quote is inconsistent with today's holding, 8 and we have cautioned against \"allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory lan\u00adguage.\" Milner v. Department of Navy , 562 U. S. 562, 572 (2011). Petitioners also point to cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses. E. g., United States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (corporate Chapter 11 debtor); Nicholas v. United States, 384 U. S. 678, 687-688 (1966) (corporate Chapter XI case under predecessor Bankruptcy Act). But those cases involve corporate debt\u00adors and are therefore inapposite. Among estates that are not separately taxable, those involving corporate debtors have long been singled out by Congress for special responsi\u00adbilities. 9 See H. R. Rep., at 277 (even \"[i]f the estate is not 8 The House Report stated\u2014after noting that, in addition to prepetition taxes, \"certain other taxes are entitled to priority\"\u2014that \"[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative expenses.\" H. R. Rep., at 193. That is still true. Many taxes arising after bankruptcy, as in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases, remain entitled to priority as administrative expenses. The Senate Report, meanwhile, stated: \"In general, administrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administering the debtor's es\u00adtate, including taxes on capital gains from sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the estate during the case.\" S. Rep., at 66 (emphasis added). That likewise remains true. Administrative expenses still include income taxes that \"the trustee,\" as opposed to the debtor, has incurred\u2014again, as in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases. 9 The original \u00a7 346 established that the estate of a corporate debtor is not a separate taxable entity, but nonetheless provided that \"the trustee shall make any [State or local] tax return otherwise required . . . to be 522 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court a separate taxable entity,\" administrative responsibility can \"var[y] according to the nature of the debtor\"). Although estates of corporate debtors are not separate taxable entities under 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399, the IRC requires a trustee that \"has possession of or holds title to all or substan\u00adtially all the property or business of a corporation\" to \"make the return of income for such corporation.\" \u00a7 6012(b)(3). In effect, Congress provided that the trustee in a corporate-debtor case may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne by the trustee of a separate taxable entity. In any event, petitioners do not deny that neither the separate tax\u00adable entity provisions nor the special provisions for corpo\u00adrate debtors apply to them. Finally, petitioners and the dissent contend that the pur\u00ad pose of 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts, relying on statements by a single Senator on unenacted bills introduced in years preced\u00ading the enactment. See Brief for Petitioners 23-36. They argue that deeming \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A) inapplicable to their post-petition income taxes would undermine that purpose and conne the exception to prepetition taxes. But we need not resolve here what other claims, if any, are covered by \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A). 10 Whatever the 2005 Congress' intent with respect to \u00a7 1222(a)(2)(A), that provision merely carved out led by or on behalf of such . . . corporation.\" \u00a7\u00a7 346(c)(1)-(2), 92 Stat. 2566. The \u00a7 346 similarly states, in the same provision deeming the debtor taxable when there is no separate taxable estate, that \"[t]he trustee shall make such tax returns of income of corporations . . . . The estate shall be liable for any [State or local] tax imposed on such corpora\u00adtion.\" \u00a7 346(b). 10 The dissent opines that employment taxes must be administrative ex\u00ad penses \"incurred by the estate\" because, in its view, they \"do not t easily\" within the category of administrative expenses under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A)(i), not\u00adwithstanding the Government's contrary representations on both points. Post, at 535. Because employment taxes are not at issue in this case, we offer no opinion on either question. Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 523 Opinion of the Court an exception to the pre-existing priority classification scheme. The exception could only apply to claims \"enti\u00ad tled to priority under section 507\" in the rst place. That pre-existing scheme was in turn premised on antecedent, decades-old understandings about the scope of \u00a7 503(b) and the division of tax liabilities between estates and debtors. See Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U. S. 410, 419 (1992) (\"When Con\u00ad gress amends the bankruptcy laws, it does not write 'on a clean slate' \"). If Congress wished to alter these back\u00adground norms, it needed to enact a provision to enable post-petition income taxes to be collected in the Chapter 12 plan in the rst place. The dissent concludes otherwise by an inverted analysis. Rather than demonstrate that such claims were treated as \u00a7 507 priority claims in the rst place, the dissent begins with the single Senator's stated purpose for the exception to that priority scheme. Post, at 529-530. It then reasons back\u00ad wards from there, and in the process upsets background norms in both Chapters 12 and 13. Certainly, there may be compelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable. But if Congress intended that result, it did not so provide in the statute. Given the statute's plain language, context, and structure, it is not for us to rewrite the statute, particularly in this complex terrain of interconnected provisions and ex\u00adceptions enacted over nearly three decades. Petitioners' po\u00adsition threatens ripple effects beyond this individual case for debtors in Chapter 13 and the broader bankruptcy scheme that we need not invite. As the Court of Appeals noted, \"Congress is entirely free to change the law by amending the text.\" 617 F. 3d, at 1167. * * * We hold that the federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners' postpetition farm sale is not \"incurred by the 524 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting estate\" under \u00a7 503(b) and thus is neither collectible nor dis- chargeable in the Chapter 12 plan. We therefore afrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It is so ordered. Justice Breyer , with whom Justice Kennedy, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code helps family farmers in economic difculty reorganize their debts without losing their farms. Consistent with the chapter's purposes, Con\u00adgress amended \u00a7 1222(a) of the Code (hereinafter Amend\u00adment) to enable the debtor to treat certain capital gains tax claims as ordinary unsecured claims. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1222(a) (2)(A). The Court's holding prevents the Amendment from carrying out this basic objective. I would read the statute differently, interpreting it in a way that, in my view, both is consistent with its language and allows the Amendment bet\u00adter to achieve its purposes. I A Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code helps indebted family farmers (and shermen) keep their farms by making commit\u00adments to pay those debts (in part) out of future income. An eligible farmer whose debts exceed his assets may enter Chapter 12 bankruptcy, at which point he must develop a detailed plan (hereinafter Plan) setting forth how he will pay his debts. That Plan must satisfy certain statutory criteria. \u00a7\u00a7 1221, 1222, 1225. A brief overview of these requirements helps to illuminate what is at stake in this case. Roughly speaking, the chapter requires that a holder of a secured claim receive the full amount of that claim up to the value of the collateral securing the loan. The claim may be paid over an extended period. If the claim exceeds the value of the collateral, the creditor is given an unsecured claim in the remainder. \u00a7\u00a7 506(a), 1225(a)(5). Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 525 Breyer, J., dissenting The holder of a \u00a7 507 priority claim (a category that in\u00ad cludes, among other things, domestic support obligations, debts for taxes incurred before ling the bankruptcy peti\u00adtion, and administrative expenses) must receive the full amount of the priority claim in deferred cash payments paid over the life of the Plan. \u00a7 1222(a)(2). The holder of an ordinary unsecured claim\u2014i. e., an un\u00ad secured claim of a kind not listed in \u00a7 507\u2014may receive at least a partial payment from the amount left over after the payment of the secured and \u00a7 507 priority claims. This amount may well be more than zero, for the Plan must pro\u00ad vide that the farmer will devote all \"disposable income\" (as dened by \u00a7 1225(b)(2)) or property of equivalent value to the repayment of his debts over the next three years (some\u00adtimes extended to ve years). \u00a7\u00a7 1222(c), 1225(b)(1). And that amount must prove sufcient to provide the unsecured creditor with no less than that creditor would receive in a Chapter 7 liquidation. \u00a7 1225(a)(4). Once the farmer completes his Plan payments, he will re\u00ad ceive a discharge even if his payments did not fully satisfy all unsecured claims. The Code does not, however, permit all debts to be discharged. There are categories of nondis\u00ad chargeable debts (including, for example, secured claims), which creditors can pursue after bankruptcy. \u00a7 1228(a). For present purposes, it is important to understand that if the debtor owes too much money to his \u00a7 507 priority credi\u00adtors, he may not have sufcient assets or future income to pay all his secured creditors and his \u00a7 507 priority creditors while leaving enough funds over to guarantee unsecured creditors the minimum amounts that Chapter 12 requires. If so, the farmer may not be able to proceed under Chapter 12. See \u00a7\u00a7 1225(a)(1), (6) (bankruptcy court will not conrm Plan unless it satises statutory criteria and debtor will be able to make good on his commitments under the Plan). It is also important to understand that the same kind of insufcient-assets-and-income problem might occur where 526 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting the debtor owes the Government a large post-petition tax debt. In general, postpetition claims are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings. See 7 Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice \u00a7 135:14 (3d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Norton). Unless the Government's debt falls within an exception to this general rule, bankruptcy law would leave the Govern\u00adment to collect its postpetition claim outside of bankruptcy as best it could. Again, the result will be to leave the farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his Chap\u00adter 12 Plan\u2014perhaps to the point where he cannot proceed under Chapter 12 at all. B With this general summary in mind, it is easier to under\u00ad stand the signicance of the question this case presents. The question arises out of an Amendment to a Chapter 12 provision. The provision as amended says: \"Contents of . \"(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless\u2014 \"(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, exchange, or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debt\u00ador's farming operation, in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a dis\u00adcharge; or \"(B) the holder of a particular claim agrees to a dif\u00ad ferent treatment of that claim.\" \u00a7 1222(a) (emphasis added). The Amendment consists of subparagraph (A). Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 527 Breyer, J., dissenting At rst blush, the Amendment seems to relegate the capi\u00ad tal gains tax collector to the status of an ordinary unsecured creditor. See ibid. (exception applies to claims \"owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale . . . of any farm asset\"). If, as petitioners claim, that is so, then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a farmer from proceed\u00ading under Chapter 12, since its treatment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the farmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full. But if the Government and the majority are right, then the capital gains tax falls outside the category of \u00a7 507 priority claims\u2014and therefore falls outside the scope of the Amend\u00adment; in fact, it falls outside the bankruptcy proceeding altogether. And the Government then might well be able to collect the debt in full outside the bankruptcy proceeding\u2014 even if doing so would reduce the farmer's assets and future income to the point where the farmer would not be able to proceed under Chapter 12. The question before us is whether we must interpret the Amendment in a way that could bring about this result. C 1 Congress did not intend this result. In a signicant num\u00ad ber of instances a Chapter 12 farmer, in order to have enough money to pay his creditors, might have to sell farmland or other farm assets at a price that would give rise to consider\u00adable capital gains taxes (particularly if the family has held the land or assets for many years). If the resulting tax debt were treated as a \u00a7 507 priority claim, then it might well absorb much of the money raised to the point where (de\u00adpending upon the size of his other debts) the farmer might be unable to proceed under Chapter 12. The Amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax authorities further back in the creditor queue, requiring them, like ordinary unsecured 528 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting creditors, to seek payment from the funds that remain after the \u00a7 507 priority creditors (and secured claimholders) have been paid. The Amendment's chief legislative sponsor, Senator Charles Grassley, explained this well when he told the Senate: \"Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to reorganize their business affairs. . . . [H]igh taxes have caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the bank\u00adruptcy code, the I. R. S. must be paid in full for any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy reorganization. If the farmer can't pay the I. R. S. in full, then he can't keep his farm. This isn't sound policy. Why should the I. R. S. be allowed to veto a farmer's reorganization plan? [The Amendment] takes this power away from the I. R. S. by reducing the priority of taxes during pro\u00adceedings. This will free up capital for investment in the farm, and help farmers stay in the business of farming.\" 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (1999). See also 14A J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 54:61, p. 11 (Oct. 2011 Supp.) (\"This provision attempts to mitigate the tax expense often incurred by farmers who have signicant taxable capital gains or depreciation recapture when their low basis farm assets are foreclosed, sold, or otherwise disposed of by their creditors\"). 2 The majority, following the Government's suggestion, interprets the relevant language in a way that denies the Amendment its intended effect. It holds that the only in\u00adcome tax claims to which \u00a7 507 accords priority are claims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in which the farmer led for bankruptcy. (We shall call these \"prepeti\u00adtion tax claims.\") In the majority's view, \u00a7 507 does not Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 529 Breyer, J., dissenting cover income tax liabilities that arise during the year of ling or during the Chapter 12 proceedings. (We shall call these \"postpetition tax claims.\") Ante, at 511-513; see Brief for United States 8 (the Amendment \"provides farmers relief from [only] those tax claims that are otherwise entitled to priority under 11 U. S. C. 507(a)(8), namely pre-petition claims arising from the sale of farm assets\"); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \u00a7 705(1)(A), 119 Stat. 126 (amending \u00a7 507(a)(8) to clarify that it only covers income tax claims for taxable years that end on or before the date of the ling of the bankruptcy petition). The majority then observes that the Amendment creates an exception only in respect to \u00a7 507 priority claims. \u00a7 1222(a)(2) (\"The plan shall full payment . . . of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless . . . \" (emphasis added)). Ante, at 509-510. Thus, if (without the Amendment) \u00a7 507 would not cover postpetition capital gains taxes in the rst place, the Amendment (creat\u00ading only a \u00a7 507 exception) cannot affect postpetition tax claims. An exception from nothing amounts to nothing. Consequently, the majority concludes that postpetition tax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely; the tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordinary tax debts; and the Government's efforts to collect them can lead to the very results (blocking the use of Chapter 12) that the Amendment sought to avoid. Therein lies the problem. These results are the very op\u00ad posite of what Congress intended. Congress did not want to relegate to ordinary-unsecured-claim status only prepeti\u00adtion tax claims, i. e., tax claims that accrued well before the Chapter 12 proceedings began. Rather, Congress was con\u00adcerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. See 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (the Amendment will have the effect of \"reducing the priority of taxes during proceedings\" (statement of Sen. 530 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting Grassley during a failed attempt to enact the Amendment; emphasis added)); Hearing on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., 121 (2001) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (\"[The Amendment] also reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganiza\u00ad tion plan\" (emphasis added)). The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels com\u00adpelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place. II Unlike the majority, I believe the relevant Bankruptcy Code language can be and is better interpreted in a way that would give full effect to the Amendment. In particular, the relevant language is better interpreted so that in the absence of the Amendment \u00a7 507 would cover these postpetition tax claims. Hence the Amendment creates an exception from what otherwise would amount to a \u00a7 507 priority claim. And it can take effect as written. It is common ground that subsection (a)(2) of \u00a7 507 covers, and gives \u00a7 507 priority to, \"administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b).\" \u00a7 507(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). It is also common ground that the relevant denitional section, namely, estate.\" \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed.). But after this point, we part company. The majority believes that the words any tax \"incurred by the estate\" cannot include postpetition taxes. It emphasizes that tax law does not treat a Chapter 12 bankruptcy estate as a \"separate taxable entity,\" i. e., as separate from the farmer-debtor for federal income tax purposes. 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1398, 1399. This means that there is just one entity\u2014the debtor\u2014for these purposes. And \u00a7 346 of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that any state and local income tax liabili\u00adties incurred by a Chapter 12 estate must also be taxed to Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 531 Breyer, J., dissenting the debtor . The majority says that these provisions mean that only the debtor, and not the estate, can \" 'incu[r]' \" taxes within the meaning of 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B)(i). Ante, at 511-512. In my view, however, these tax law circumstances do not require the majority's narrow reading of this Bankruptcy Code provision. That is to say, the phrase tax \"incurred by the [bankruptcy] estate\" can include a tax incurred by the farmer while managing his estate in the midst of his bank\u00adruptcy proceedings, i. e., between the time the farmer les for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy court conrms the farmer's Chapter 12 Plan. The bankruptcy estate is in existence during this time. Cf. \u00a7 1227(b) (property of the estate vests in the debtor at conrmation unless the Plan provides otherwise). The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the farmer's assets during this time. See \u00a7\u00a7 541, 1207; \u00a7 61:1, cen\u00adtralizes all of the estate's assets under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court\"). And, as a matter of both the English language and bankruptcy principles, one can consider a tax liability that the farmer incurs during this period (such as a capital gains tax arising from a sale of a portion of his farm assets to raise funds for creditors) as a liability that, in a bankruptcy sense, the estate incurs. The English language permits this reading of the phrase tax \"incurred by the estate.\" When the farmer, in the midst of Chapter 12 proceedings, sells a portion of his farm to raise money to help pay his creditors, one can say, as a matter of English, that the bankruptcy estate has \"incurred\" the associated tax, even if it is ultimately taxed to the farmer, just as one can say that an employee who makes purchases using a company credit card \"incurs costs\" for which his em\u00adployer is liable. As a matter of general bankruptcy principles (as Congress understood them), the history of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code 532 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting revision is replete with statements to the effect that \"[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative expenses.\" H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 193 (1977) (emphasis added). See S. Rep.

No. 95-989, p. 66 (1978) (\"In general, administrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administering the debtor's estate , includ\u00ad ing taxes on capital gains from sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the estate during the case\" (emphasis added)); 124 Cong.

And importantly, as the majority concedes, ante, at 521, bankruptcy law treats taxes incurred by corporate debtors while they are in bankruptcy proceedings as \"tax[es] in\u00adcurred by the estate,\" even though the Tax Code does not treat the bankruptcy estate of a corporate debtor as a \"sepa\u00adrate taxable entity.\" See, e. g., United States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (treating Chapter 11 corporate debtor's postpetition taxes as administrative expenses); In re Pacic- Atlantic Trading Co., 64 F. 3d 1292, 1298 (CA9 1995) (same); In re L. J.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 533 Breyer, J., dissenting Even though, as the majority says, corporate bankruptcies have some special features (in particular, a trustee in a cor\u00ad porate bankruptcy is required to le the estate's income tax return), it is unclear why these features should have any bearing on the denition of administrative expenses. See ante, at 522 (discussing 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6012(b)(3)). Indeed, in many corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcies, there is no trustee, in which case the debtor-in-possession, just like an individual Chapter 12 debtor, must le the tax return. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104, 1107 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); 5 Norton \u00a7\u00a7 91:3, 93:1 (typically, no trustee is appointed in a Chapter 11 bank\u00adruptcy, and the debtor-in-possession assumes most of the duties and powers of a trustee, continuing in possession and managing the business until the court determines, upon re\u00adquest of a party in interest, that grounds exist for the ap\u00adpointment of a trustee); Holywell Corp. v. Smith, 503 U. S. 47, 54 (1992) (\"As the assignee of 'all' or 'substantially all' of the property of the corporate debtors, the trustee must le the returns that the corporate debtors would have led had the plan not assigned their property to the trustee\" (empha\u00adsis added)). Consequently, I can nd no strong bankruptcy law reason for treating taxes incurred by a corporate debtor differently from those incurred by an individual Chapter 12 debtor. To the contrary, since corporations can le for bankruptcy under Chapter 12, the majority's argument implies that the treat\u00adment of postpetition taxes in Chapter 12 proceedings turns on whether the debtor happens to be a corporation. See \u00a7 101(18)(B) (2006 ed.) 109(f) (\"Only a family farmer or fam\u00adily sherman with regular annual income may be a debtor under chapter 12\"); Brief for United States 26, n. 9 (\"[T]he estate of a corporate (as opposed to individual) Chapter 12 debtor . . . could be viewed as incurring post-petition . collectible as administrative expenses . . . rather 534 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting than outside the bankruptcy case as required for an individ\u00ad ual Chapter 12 debtor\"). The majority does not point to any adverse consequences that might arise were bankruptcy law to treat taxes incurred in administering the bankruptcy estate (i. e., taxes incurred after ling and before Plan conrmation) as administrative expenses. The effect of doing so would simply be to con\u00adsider the debtor and estate as merged for purposes of de\u00ad termining which taxes fall within the Bankruptcy's Code's denition of \"administrative expenses,\" i. e., determining for that purpose that the estate may \"incur\" tax liabilities on behalf of the whole (with the ultimate liability assigned to the debtor), much like a married couple ling jointly, 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6013(a), or an afliated group of corporations ling a consolidated tax return, \u00a7 1501. Cf. In re Lumara Foods of America, Inc., 50 B. R. 809, 814-815 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ohio 1985) (describing the and conclud\u00ading that \"the elevation [of a tax] to an administrative priority is dependent upon when the tax accrued\"). In fact, the very tax provisions that separate the estate from the individual debtor in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 proceedings, \u00a7\u00a7 1398 and 1399, say that the Chapter 12 estate is not separate from the debtor for tax purposes\u2014a concept consistent, not at odds, with merging the two for this bankruptcy purpose. Nor is the majority's reading free of conceptual problems. If we read the phrase tax \"incurred by the estate\" as exclud\u00ad ing tax liabilities incurred while the farmer is in Chapter 12 bankruptcy, we must read it as excluding not only capital gains taxes but also other kinds of taxes, such as an em\u00adployer's share of Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, or other employee taxes. But no one claims that all of these taxes fall outside the scope of the term \"administrative ex\u00adpenses.\" See In re Ryan, 228 B. R. 746 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Ore. 1999) (treating postpetition employment taxes as adminis\u00adtrative expenses in a Chapter 12 proceeding); IRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200518002 (May 6, 2005), 2005 WL Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 535 Breyer, J., dissenting 1060956 (assuming that some postpetition federal taxes can be treated as administrative expenses in a Chapter 12 bankruptcy). In fact, the Government, realizing it cannot go this far, concedes that many of these other (e. g., employer) taxes are \"administrative expenses,\" but only, it suggests, because they fall within a different part of the \"administrative ex\u00adpenses\" denition, namely, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 that \"administrative expenses\" include \"the actual, nec\u00ad essary costs and expenses of preserving the estate including . . . wages, salaries, and commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.\" (Emphasis added.) See Brief for United States 27-28, n. 11. Employment taxes, however, do not t easily within the rubric \"wages, salaries, and commissions.\" They may well be \"necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.\" But then so are the capital gains taxes at issue here. Finally, the majority makes what I believe to be its strong\u00ad est argument. Ante, at 516-519. Chapter 13, it points out, allows individuals (typically those who are not farmers or shermen) to reorganize their debts in much the same way as does Chapter 12. And there is authority holding that taxes on income earned between the time the Chapter 13 debtor les for bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy Plan is conrmed are not \"tax[es] incurred by the estate.\" See In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 5-6 (Bkrtcy. Ct. 3370867, *3 Ct. Mass., Nov. 20, 2006); In re Jagours, 236 B. R. 616, 620, n. 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tex. 1999); In re Gyulaa, 65 B. R. 913, 916 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1986). Why, asks the majority, should the law treat Chapter 12 taxes differently? For one thing, the issue is less important in a Chapter 13 case, for the relevant time period\u2014between ling and Plan conrmation\u2014is typically very short. Compare H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 276 (\"most chapter 13 estates will only remain open for 1 or 2 months until conrmation of the plan\"), with 536 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting Brief for Neil E. Harl et al. as Amici Curiae 32-33 (survey of Chapter 12 bankruptcies found the average time from ling to conrmation in a district ranged from nearly ve months to over three years). See also 7 Norton \u00a7 122:14, at 122-27 (\"In Chapter 13, the plan must be led within 15 days after the ling of the petition, unless the time is extended for cause. A Chapter 12 plan must be led no later than 90 days after the order for relief, unless the court nds that an extension is substantially justied\" (footnote omitted)). For another, the issue arises differently in a Chapter 13 case. That chapter, unlike Chapter 12, contains a special provision that permits the Government to seek \u00a7 507 priority treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending. \u00a7 1305 (Government can le proof of claim to have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen before the petition was led). Finally, if uniformity of interpretation between these two chapters is critical, I do not see the serious harm in treating the relevant taxes as \"administrative expenses\" in both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases rather than in neither. The majority apparently believes that this would render \u00a7 1305 (the provision permitting the Government to seek \u00a7 507 priority treatment) superfluous. Ante, at 517-519. But that is not so. This interpretation would simply limit the scope of operation of \u00a7 1305 to the period of time after the Chapter 13 Plan is conrmed but while the Chapter 13 case is still pending. And that is likely to be a signicant period of time relative to the preconrmation period. See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 276 (\"[M]ost chapter 13 estates will only remain open for 1 or 2 months until conrmation of the plan\"); \u00a7\u00a7 1325(b)(1), (4) (debtor must commit all his projected disposable income over a 3-year period (sometimes extended to ve) to the Plan, unless all unsecured claims can be paid off over a shorter period). The greatest Chapter 13 harm this interpretation could cause is to require the Gov\u00adernment to pursue those tax liabilities as \u00a7 507 priority ad\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 537 Breyer, J., dissenting ministrative expense claims (rather than allow it to choose between \u00a7 507 priority treatment and pursuing those claims outside bankruptcy) during the relatively brief period of time between the ling of a petition and the Plan's conrmation. In sum, I would treat a postpetition/preconrmation tax liability as a tax \"incurred by the estate,\" hence as an \"ad\u00administrative expense,\" hence as a \"clai[m] entitled to priority under section 507, unless . . . ,\" hence as a claim falling within the scope of the Amendment. Doing so would allow the Amendment to take effect as Congress intended. III The Government argues that, even if tax liabilities arising during the bankruptcy proceedings are \"administrative expenses,\" they still do not fall within the Amendment's scope. It says that neither the Amendment nor anything else in \u00a7 1222(a) provides for the payment of administrative expenses. Rather, that section and its Amendment provide only for the payment of \"claims.\" \u00a7 1222(a)(2) (\"The plan shall payment . . . of all claims en\u00ad titled to priority under section 507, unless . . . \" (empha\u00adsis added)). And administrative expenses, the Government says, like all debts that are incurred postpetition, are not \"claims.\" The Government nds support for its view in the fact that \u00a7 1222 deals with the contents of a \"plan,\" while a later section, \u00a7 1227(a), says that the provisions of a \"conrmed plan bind the debtor, each creditor , [and certain others of no relevance here].\" (Emphasis added.) This is because the Code denes \"creditor\" to include only holders of pre-petition claims, thus excluding holders of post-petition claims, such as administrative expenses. \u00a7 101(10). The Government points out that a different Code section, namely, \u00a7 1226(b)(1), provides for the payment of administra\u00adtive expenses. That section says that \"[b]efore or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan, there shall 538 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting be paid . . . any unpaid claim of the kind specied in section 507(a)(2),\" namely, \"administrative expenses.\" And Con\u00adgress did it amended the earlier sec\u00adtion, \u00a7 1222(a). In short, the Government says, the Plan only covers those \u00a7 507 priority \"expenses and claims\" that are described as \"claims\" and can be held by \"creditors.\" Section 1226(b)(1), not \u00a7 1222, deals with administrative expenses. The bottom line of the Government's chain of logic is, once again, that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place. I concede that there is some text and legislative history that supports the Government's view that the word \"claim\" in \u00a7 1222(a) does not include \"administrative expenses.\" g., \u00a7 507(a) (referring to \"expenses and claims\" as if they are separate categories); S. Rep. No. 95-1106, at 20 (\"The committee amendments contain several changes designed to clarify the distinction between a 'claim' (which generally relates to a debt incurred before the bankruptcy petition is led) and an administrative expense (which is an expense incurred by the trustee after the ling of the petition)\"). But the language does not demand the Government's read\u00ad ing. For the Code also uses the word \"claim\" to cover both prepetition and postpetition claims (such as administrative expenses). E. g., \u00a7 101(5)(A) (dening a claim as a \"right to 726(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (referring to \"claims\" that include administrative expenses). Indeed, the very section that the Government says permits separate collec\u00adtion of administrative expenses, namely, \u00a7 1226(b)(1), refers to \"any unpaid claim\" for administrative expenses. (Em\u00ad phasis added.) And one can easily read that section as set\u00adting forth when, not whether, administrative expenses will be paid under the Plan (i. e., as specifying that the Plan must provide for the payment of administrative expenses be\u00adfore payments to other creditors are made). Thus, reading Cite as: 566 U. S. 506 (2012) 539 Breyer, J., dissenting \u00a7 1222(a)(2)'s reference to \"claims\" as administra\u00ad tive render \u00a7 1226(b)(1) surplusage. What about \u00a7 1227(a), which refers only to \"creditor[s]\"? One must read it in conjunction with \u00a7 1228(a), which provides that once the debtor has completed all payments under the Plan, \"the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of [1] all debts provided for by the plan[,] [2] allowed under section 503 of this title [which describes 'administrative ex\u00adpenses'] or [3] disallowed under section 502 of this title . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) (The rst few words of \u00a7 1227(a)\u2014\"[e]x\u00adcept as provided in section 1228(a)\"\u2014explain why I say \"must\"; the comma comes from 7 Norton \u00a7 137:2, at 137- 3, n. 1, which says that its omission was a typographical error.) Thus, by here referring to \"administrative ex\u00adpenses\" (through its reference to \u00a7 503), Chapter 12 makes clear that at least some postpetition claims are to be dis\u00ad charged once the debtor has completed his payments under the Plan. That fact, in turn, suggests that the Plan may provide for their payment and that the holders of such claims may be bound by the terms of a conrmed Plan. The upshot is that the Government's second argument pre\u00ad sents a plausible, but not the only plausible, interpretation of the Code's language. And the Government's second argu\u00adment, like the majority's argument, has a problem, namely, that it reduces Congress' Amendment to rubble. For that reason I believe it does not offer the better interpretation of the relevant language. IV In sum the phrase tax \"incurred by the estate\" in \u00a7 503(b) (the and the word \"claim\" in \u00a7 1222(a) are open to different interpretations. Each of the narrower interpretations advanced by the Government or adopted by the Court would either exclude postpeti\u00adtion taxes from the phrase taxes \"incurred by the estate\" or exclude all postpetition debts, including administrative 540 HAL L v. UNITED STATES Breyer, J., dissenting expenses, from the word \"claim.\" In these ways, these in\u00ad terpretations would, as I have said, prevent the Amendment from accomplishing its basic purpose. A broader interpretation of the word \"claim\" may allow the Plan to include certain postpetition debts. This, taken together with a broader interpretation of the phrase tax \"in\u00adcurred by the estate,\" prevents the Government from col\u00adlecting postpetition/preconrmation tax debts outside of Chapter 12, requiring it to assume a place in the creditor queue. Together these broader interpretations permit the Amendment to take effect as intended. I nd this last-mentioned consideration determinative. It seems to me unlikely that Congress, having worked on revi\u00adsions of the Code for many years with the help of bankruptcy experts, and having considered the Amendment several times over a period of years, would have made the drafting mistake that the Government and the majority necessarily imply that it made. Moreover, I believe it important that courts interpreting statutes make signicant efforts to allow the provisions of congressional statutes to function in the ways that the elected branch of Government likely intended and for which it can be held democratically accountable. For these reasons, with respect, I dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 541 Syllabus ASTRUE, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY v. CAPATO, on behalf of B. N. C. et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 11-159. Argued March 19, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012 Eighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, re\u00ad spondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using her husband's frozen sperm. Karen applied for Social Security survivors benets for the twins. The Social Security Adminis\u00adtration (SSA) denied her application, and the District Court afrmed. In accord with the SSA's construction of the Social Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify for benets only if, as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) species, they could inherit from the de\u00adceased wage earner under state intestacy law. The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children do not qualify for inheri\u00adtance through intestate succession. The Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under \u00a7 416(e), which denes child to mean, inter alia, \"the child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individual,\" the undis\u00ad puted biological children of an insured and his widow qualify for survi\u00advors benets without regard to state intestacy law. Held: The SSA's reading is better attuned to the statute's text and its design to benet primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime. Moreover, even if the SSA's longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\u00ad ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Pp. 547-559. (a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant here, \"[e]very child (as dened in section 416(e) of this title)\" of a deceased insured individual \"shall be entitled to a child's insurance benet.\" to mean: \"(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or stepgrand\u00adchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].\" Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 416(e)(2) and (e)(3), \u00a7 416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of the conditions under which a child qualies for benets. Section 416(h)(2)(A), how\u00adever, further addresses the term \"child,\" providing: \"In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall 542 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Syllabus apply [the intestacy law of the insured individual's domiciliary State].\" An applicant who does not meet \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A)'s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for benets under other criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track \u00a7\u00a7 416(h)(2) and (h)(3) in 20 CFR \u00a7 404.355. As the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 416(h) governs the meaning of \"child\" in \u00a7 416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benets as a \"child\" must pass. Pp. 547-550. (b) While the SSA regards 416(h) as completing \u00a7 416(e)'s sparse denition of \"child,\" the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends, that \u00a7 416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couple's biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Cir\u00adcuit's and respondent's reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive Pp. 550-557. (1) Nothing in \u00a7 416(e)'s Con\u00ad gress understood the word \"child\" to refer only to the children of married parents. The dictionary denitions offered by respondent are not so conned. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see \u00a7 402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodied term \"child.\" Nor does \u00a7 416(e) indicate that Congress intended \"biological\" parentage to be prerequi\u00adsite to \"child\" status. A biological parent is not always a child's parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not necessarily make a child's parentage certain, nor does the absence of marriage necessarily make a child's parentage uncertain. Finally, it is far from obvious that re\u00adspondent's proposed denition would cover her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 551-552. (2) The SSA nds a key textual cue in \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A)'s opening in\u00ad struction: \"In the child . . . of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,\" the Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence of any cross-reference in \u00a7 416(e) to \u00a7 416(h), but she overlooks that \u00a7 416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for \u00a7 416(h) purposes, but \"for purposes of this subchapter,\" which \u00a7\u00a7 402(d) 416(e). Having explicitly denitional provisions contained in \u00a7 416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in \u00a7 416(e). Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 543 Syllabus The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status, including an applicant's status as a wife, widow, husband, or widower. See, e. g., \u00a7\u00a7 416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-of-relationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Sal, 422 U. S. 749, 777-782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheri\u00adtance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast, no time constraint attends the Third Circuit's ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benets, no matter the length of time between the father's death and the child's conception and birth. Because a child who may take from a father's estate is more likely to \"be dependent during the parent's life and at his death,\" Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a \"child\" serves the Act's driving objective, which is to \"provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner's] family with protection against the hardship occasioned [the] loss of [the insured's] earnings,\" Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows, as respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated more advanta\u00adgeously than are children who must meet a \u00a7 416(h) criterion. Respond\u00adent charges that the SSA's construction of the Act raises serious consti\u00adtutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis review, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress easily passes inspection. Pp. 553-557. (c) Because the SSA's interpretation of the relevant provisions is at least reasonable, the agency's reading is entitled to this Court's defer\u00ad ence under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appropriate \"when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency gen\u00aderally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency inter\u00adpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226-227. Here, the SSA's longstanding interpretation, set forth in regulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is neither \"arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Mayo Founda\u00ad tion for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. 44, 53. It therefore warrants the Court's approbation. P. 558. 631 F. 3d 626, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. 544 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court Eric D. Miller argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Verrilli, Assistant At\u00ad torney General West, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Michael S. Raab, and Kelsi Brown Corkran. Charles A. Rothfeld argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Andrew J. Pincus, Michael B. Kimberly, Bernard A. Kuttner, and Jeffrey A. Meyer.* Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. Karen and Robert Capato married in 1999. Robert died of cancer less than three years later. With the help of in vitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months after her husband's death. Karen's application for Social Security survivors benets for the twins, which the Social Security Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this litigation. The technology that made the twins' conception and birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated by Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social Security Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to read as they now do (1965). Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act's initial denition of \"child\" in 42 U. 416(e): \" '[C]hild' means . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individ\u00adual.\" Robert was an insured individual, and the twins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of Karen and Robert. That satises the Act's terms, and no further inquiry is in order, Karen maintains. The SSA, however, identies sub\u00adsequent provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 416(h)(2) and (h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological children to benets only if they qualify for inheritance from the decedent under state *Briefs of amici curiae urging afrmance were led for the Cancer Legal Resource Center of the Disability Rights Legal Center by Mark B.

We conclude that the SSA's reading is better attuned to the statute's text and its design to benet primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime. And even if the SSA's longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction that garners the Court's respect under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). I Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required might render him sterile. Because the couple wanted chil\u00addren, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, deposited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and stored. Despite Robert's aggressive treatment regime, Karen con\u00adceived naturally and gave birth to a son in August 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to have a sibling. Robert's health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in Florida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002. His will, executed in Florida, named as beneciaries the son born of his marriage to Karen and two children from a previ\u00adous marriage. The will made no provision for children con\u00adceived after Robert's death, although the Capatos had told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be placed on a par with existing children. Shortly after Robert's death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her husband's frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003 and gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months after Robert's death. Karen Capato claimed survivors insurance benets on be\u00ad half of the twins. The SSA denied her application, and the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey afrmed the agency's decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a (deci\u00adsion of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at 15a (District 546 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court Court opinion). In accord with the SSA's construction of the statute, the District Court determined that the twins would qualify for benets only if, as \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) species, they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert Capato died domiciled in Flor\u00adida, the court found. Under that State's law, the court noted, a child born posthumously may inherit through intestate succession only if conceived during the decedent's lifetime. Id., at 27a-28a. 1 The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. Under \u00a7 416(e), the appellate court concluded, \"the undis\u00adputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and his widow\" qualify for survivors benets without regard to state intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011). 2 Courts of Ap\u00ad peals have divided on the statutory interpretation question this case presents. Compare ibid. and Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596-597 (CA9 2004) (biological but posthumously conceived child of insured wage earner and his widow qualies for benets), with Beeler v. Astrue , 651 F. (CA8 2011), and v. Astrue , qualica\u00adtion for benets depends on intestacy law of State in which wage earner was domiciled). To resolve the conflict, we granted the Commissioner's petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. 1033 (2011). 1 The District Court observed that Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 732.106 (West 2010) denes \" 'afterborn heirs' \" as \" 'heirs of the decedent conceived before his or her death, but born thereafter.' \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a (emphasis added by District Court). The court also referred to \u00a7 742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child \" 'shall not be eligible for a claim against the decedent's estate unless the child has been provided for by the decedent's will.' \" Id., at 28a. 2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived children qualify for survivors benets as a matter of federal law, it did not deni\u00adtively determine \"where [Robert] Capato delve into the law of intestacy of that state.\" 631 F. 3d, at 632, n. 6. These issues, if preserved, may be considered on remand. Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 547 Opinion of the Court II Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to pro\u00ad vide a monthly benet for designated surviving family mem\u00ad bers of a deceased insured wage earner. \"Child's insurance benets\" are among the Act's family-protective measures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 402(d). An applicant qualies for such benets if she meets the Act's denition of \"child,\" is unmarried, is below specied age limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began prior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the time of the insured's death. \u00a7 402(d)(1). 3 To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato twins rank as \"child[ren]\" under the Act's denitional provi\u00adsions. Section 402(d) provides that child (as dened in section 416(e) of this title)\" of a deceased insured individ\u00adual \"shall be entitled to a child's insurance benet.\" Section 416(e), in turn, states: \"The term 'child' means (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [who meets cer\u00adtain conditions].\" The word \"child,\" we note, appears twice in \u00a7 416(e)'s open\u00ad ing sentence: initially 'child' means (e)(1) (\"child or legally adopted child\"), delineating the rst of three beneficiary categories. Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 416(e)(2) and 3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be \"deemed dependent\" when the Act so provides. For example, a \"legiti\u00ad mate\" child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from her parent, is ordinarily \"deemed dependent\" on that parent. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 402(d)(3). Further, applicants \"deemed\" the child of an insured under \u00a7 416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also \"deemed legitimate,\" hence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from the parent. \u00a7 402(d)(3). See also Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 499, n. 2 (1976) (deeming dependent any child who qualies under \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14 (counsel for the SSA stated, in response to the Court's question, that statutory presumptions of dependency are irrebuttable). 548 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court (e)(3), which specify the circumstances under which step\u00ad children and grandchildren qualify for benets, \u00a7 416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare \"the child . (ap\u00ad plicant must have been a stepchild for at least nine months before the insured individual's death). A subsequent denitional provision further addresses the term \"child.\" Under the heading \"Determination of family status,\" \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) provides: \"In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Se\u00adcurity shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individu\u00adal's domiciliary State].\" 4 An applicant for child benefits who does not meet \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A)'s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qual\u00adify for benets under one of several other criteria the Act prescribes. First, an applicant who \"is a son or daughter\" of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a \"child\" under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless ranks as a \"child\" if the insured and the other parent went through a marriage ceremony that would have been valid but for certain legal impediments. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(B). Further, an ap\u00adplicant is deemed a \"child\" if, before death, the insured ac\u00adknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by a court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had been ordered to pay child support. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(i). In addition, an ap\u00ad 4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of the insured's domicile, \"would have the same status relative to taking intes\u00ad tate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.\" Asked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it would apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9, 54; see 20 CFR \u00a7 404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for benets if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under state law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of the adopting parent). Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 549 Opinion of the Court plicant may gain \"child\" status upon proof that the insured individual was the applicant's parent and \"was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant\" when the in\u00adsured individual died. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii). 5 The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The reg\u00adulations state that an applicant may be entitled to benets \"as a natural child, legally adopted child, stepchild, regulations closely track 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(h)(2) and (h)(3). They state that an applicant may qualify for insurance benets as a \"natural child\" by meeting any of four conditions: (1) The applicant \"could inherit the insured's personal property as his or her natural child under State inheritance laws\"; (2) the applicant is \"the insured's natural child and [his or her parents] went through a ceremony which would have resulted in a valid marriage between them except for a legal impediment\"; (3) before death, the in\u00adsured acknowledged in writing his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed by a court to be the applicant's par\u00adent, or was ordered by a court to contribute to the appli\u00adcant's support; or (4) other evidence shows that the in\u00adsured is the applicant's \"natural father or mother\" and was either living with, or contributing to the support of, the applicant. 20 CFR \u00a7 404.355(a) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 416(h) governs the meaning of \"child\" in \u00a7 416(e)(1). In other words, \u00a7 416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for insur\u00adance benets as a \"child\" must pass. See Beeler , 651 F. 3d, at 960 (\"The regulations make clear that the SSA interprets the Act to mean that the provisions of \u00a7 416(h) are the exclu\u00ad 5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis for the twins' \"child\" status. 550 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court sive means by which an applicant can establish 'child' status under \u00a7 416(e) as a natural child.\").6 III Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that \u00a7 416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrelevant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals determined, \u00a7 416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631 F. 3d, at 630-631. Under \u00a7 416(e), \"child\" means \"child of an [in\u00adsured] individual,\" and the Capato twins, the Third Circuit observed, clearly t that denition: They are undeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage earner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h) comes into play, the court reasoned, only when \"a claimant's status as a deceased wage-earner's child is in doubt.\" Id., at 631. That limita\u00ad tion, the court suggested, is evident from \u00a7 416(h)'s caption: \"Determination of family status.\" Here, \"there is no family status to determine,\" the court said, id., at 630, so \u00a7 416(h) has no role to play. In short, while the SSA regards \u00a7 416(h) as completing \u00a7 416(e)'s sparse denition of \"child,\" the Third Circuit considered each subsection to control different situations: \u00a7 416(h) governs when a child's family status needs to be determined; \u00a7 416(e), when it does not. When is there no need to determine a child's family status? The answer that the Third Circuit found plain: whenever the claimant is \"the biological child of a married couple.\" Id., at 630. 7 We point out, rst, some conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuit's and respondent Karen Capato's reading of the Act's 6 The Commissioner of Social Security has acquiesced in the Ninth Cir\u00ad cuit's conflicting interpretation for cases arising in that Circuit. See Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 05-1(9), 70 Fed. Reg. 55656 (2005). 7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unambigu\u00ad ous, it had no occasion to \"determine whether the [SSA's] interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.\" 631 F. 3d, at 631, n. 5 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984)). Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 551 Opinion of the Court provisions, and then explain why we nd the SSA's interpre\u00ad tation . an individual\") suggests that Congress understood the word \"child\" to refer only to the children of married parents. The dictionary denitions offered by re\u00adspondent are not so conned. See Webster's New Interna\u00adtional Dictionary (2d inter alia, \"[i]n Law , legitimate offspring; also, sometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegitimate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild, as the intention may ap\u00adpear\"); Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (\"child\" means \"son or daughter,\" or \"descendant\"). See also Restatement (Third) of Property \u00a7 2.5(1) (1998) (\"[a]n individual is the child of his or her genetic parents,\" and that may be so \"whether or not [the parents] are married to each other\"). Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to off\u00adspring of a marital union. See \u00a7 402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the \"legitimate . . . child\" of an individual). Other contem\u00adporaneous statutes similarly differentiate child of a marriage (\"legitimate child\") from the unmodied term \"child.\" See, e. g., Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443, \u00a7 120, 56 Stat. 385 (dening \"child\" to condi\u00adtions, \"stepchild\" child\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nor \u00a7 416(e) indicate that Congress intended \"biologi\u00ad cal\" parentage to be prerequisite to \"child\" status under that provision. As the SSA points out, \"[i]n 1939, there was no such thing as a scientically proven biological relationship between a child and a father, which is . . . part of the reason that the word 'biological' appears nowhere in the Act.\" Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological parent is not necessar\u00adily a child's parent under law. Ordinarily, \"a parent-child 552 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court relationship does not exist between an adoptee and the adoptee's genetic parents.\" Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 2- 119(a), 8 U. L. A. 55 (Supp. 2011) (amended 2008). Moreover, laws directly addressing use of today's assisted reproduction technology do not make biological parentage a universally determinative criterion. See, e. g., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7 7613(b) (West Supp. 2012) (\"The . for use in articial insemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other than the donor's wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived, unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the woman prior to the conception of the child.\"); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 46, \u00a7 4B (West 2010) (\"Any child born to a married woman as a result of articial insemination with the consent of her husband, shall be considered the legitimate child of the mother and such husband.\"). We note, in addition, that marriage does not ever and always make the parentage of a child certain, nor does the absence of marriage necessarily mean that a child's parent\u00adage is uncertain. An unmarried couple can agree that a child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during a marriage may be uncertain. See Reply Brief 11 (\"Re\u00adspondent errs in treating 'marital' and 'undisputed' as having the same meaning.\"). Finally, it is far from obvious that Karen Capato's pro\u00ad posed denition\u2014\"biological child of married parents,\" see Brief for Respondent 9\u2014would cover the posthumously conceived Capato twins. Under Florida law, a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price , 114 Fla. 233, 235, 153 So. 904, 905 (1934). If that law applies, rather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the Ca\u00adpato twins, conceived after the death of their father, would not qualify as \"marital\" children. 8 8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benets to the Ca\u00ad pato twins when, under \u00a7 416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained benets had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that would have Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 553 Opinion of the Court B Resisting the importation of words not found in \u00a7 416(e)\u2014 \"child\" means \"the biological child of married parents,\" Brief for Respondent 9\u2014the SSA nds a key textual cue in \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A)'s opening instruction: \"In determining whether applicant is the child . . . of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter ,\" the Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) Respondent notes the absence of any cross-reference in \u00a7 416(e) to \u00a7 416(h). Id., at 18. She overlooks, however, that \u00a7 416(h) provides the crucial link. The \"subchapter\" to which \u00a7 416(h) refers is Subchapter II of the Act, which spans \u00a7\u00a7 401 through 434. Section 416(h)'s reference to \"this subchapter\" denitional provisions contained in \u00a7 416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in \u00a7 416(e). See Schafer , in \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), provided \"plain and explicit instruc\u00adtion on how the determination of child status should be made\"; on this point, the statute's text \"could hardly be more clear.\"). The original version of today's \u00a7 416(h) was similarly drafted. It provided that, \"[i]n determining whether an ap\u00adplicant is . . [an] insured individual for purposes of sections 401-409 of this title, the Board shall apply [state intestacy law].\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 409(m) (1940 (emphasis added). Sections 401-409 embraced \u00a7\u00a7 402(c) and 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively. Reference to state law to determine an applicant's status as a \"child\" is anything but anomalous. Quite the opposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 548. Whether the Capatos' marriage ceremony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was extant when the twins were conceived. Reply Brief 11. 554 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court status. For example, the Act initially denes \"wife\" as \"the wife of an [insured] tautological (\" 'wife' means the [insured's] wife\"). One must read on, although there is no express cross-reference, to \u00a7 416(h) (rules on \"[d]etermination of family status\") to com\u00adplete the denition. Section 416(h)(1)(A) directs that, \" for purposes of this subchapter ,\" the law of the insured's domi\u00ad cile determines whether \"[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly married,\" and if they were not, whether the applicant would nevertheless have \"the same status\" as a wife under the State's intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act similarly denes the terms \"widow,\" \"hus\u00adband,\" and \"widower.\" See \u00a7\u00a7 416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A). Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision mandated the use of state intestacy law for \"determining whether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of [an] in\u00adsured individual.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 409(m) (1940 ed.). All wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to satisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born during their par\u00adents' marriage would have readily qualied under the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility to inherit under state law. But requiring all \"child\" applicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a simple test, one that ensured benets for persons plainly within the legislators' contempla\u00adtion, while avoiding congressional entanglement in the tradi\u00adtional state-law realm of family relations. Just as the Act generally refers to state law to determine whether an applicant qualies as a wife, widow, husband, widower, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child or parent, \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (\u00a7\u00a7 416(b), (c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship limitations. See Weinberger v. Sal, 422 U. S. 749, 777-782 (1975) (discussing \u00a7 416(e)(2)'s requirement that, as a check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild relationship must exist \"not less than nine months immediately preceding [insured's Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 555 Opinion of the Court death]\"). Time limits also qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously con\u00adceived children. See Cal. Prob. Code Ann. \u00a7 249.5(c) (West Supp. 2012) (allowing inheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent's death); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15-11- 120(11) (2011) (child in utero within three years or born within 45 months); Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 633.220A(1) (West Supp. 2012) (child born within two years); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:391.1(A) (West 2008) (child born within three years); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. \u00a7 30.1-04-19(11) (Lexis 2010) (child in utero within three years or born within 45 months). See also Uni\u00ad form Probate Code \u00a7 2-120(k), 8 U. L. A. 58 (Supp. 2011) (treating a posthumously conceived child as \"in gestation at the individual's death,\" but only if specied time limits are met). No time constraints attend the Third Circuit's ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married par\u00adents is eligible for survivors benets, no matter the length of time between the father's death and the child's conception and birth. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that, under the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the Third Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her father's death would be eligible for benets). The paths to receipt of benets laid out in the Act and regulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress' per\u00adception of the core purpose of the legislation. The aim was not to create a program \"generally beneting needy per\u00adsons\"; it was, more particularly, to . . dependent members of [a wage earner's] family with protection against the hardship occasioned [the] loss of [the insured's] earn\u00adings.\" Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52 (1977). We have recognized that \"where state intestacy law provides that a child may take personal property from a father's estate, it may reasonably be thought that the child will more likely be dependent during the parent's life and at his death.\" Ma\u00ad thews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514 (1976). Reliance on state 556 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court intestacy law to determine who is a \"child\" thus serves the Act's driving objective. True, the intestacy criterion yields benets to some children outside the Act's central concern. Intestacy laws in a number of States, as just noted, do pro\u00advide for inheritance by posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 555, 9 and under federal law, a child conceived shortly before her father's death may be eligible for benets even though she never actually received her father's support. It was nonetheless Congress' prerogative to legislate for the generality of cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit under state intestacy law as a workable substitute for burdensome case-by-case determinations whether the child was, in fact, dependent on her father's earnings. Respondent argues that on the SSA's reading, natural children alone must pass through a \u00a7 416(h) gateway. Adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-grandchildren, it is true, are dened in \u00a7 416(e), and are not further dened in \u00a7 416(h). Respondent overlooks, however, that although not touched by \u00a7 416(h), beneciaries described in \u00a7\u00a7 416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other statutorily pre\u00ad scribed criteria. In short, the Act and regulations set dif\u00ad ferent eligibility requirements for adopted children, step\u00ad children, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, see 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 404.356-404.358, but it hardly follows that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a \u00a7 416(h) criterion. The SSA's construction of the Act, respondent charges, raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro\u00adtection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for Re\u00ad 9 But see N. Y .

Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the read\u00ad ing of the Act respondent advances have rejected this argu\u00adment. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff v. Astrue , 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have applied an inter\u00admediate level of scrutiny to laws \"burden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the illicit relations of their parents, because 'visiting this condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and unjust.' \" Clark v. Jeter , 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (quoting Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175 (1972)). No showing has been made that posthumously conceived children share the character\u00adistics that prompted our skepticism of classications disad\u00advantaging children of unwed parents. We therefore need not decide whether heightened scrutiny would be appropri\u00adate were that the case. 10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress adopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit held, that regime is \"reasonably related to the government's twin interests in [reserving] benets [for] those children who have lost a parent's support, and in using reasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative bur\u00adden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.\" Ver\u00ad noff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at 509). 10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the \"illogical and unjust\" dis\u00ad crimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175-176 (1972), respondent asks us to differentiate between children whose parents were married and chil\u00addren whose parents' liaisons were not blessed by clergy or the State. She would eliminate the intestacy test only for biological children of married parents. 558 ASTR UE v. CAPATO Opinion of the Court IV As we have explained, \u00a7 416(e)(1)'s statement, \"[t]he an individual,\" is a denition of scant utility without aid from neighboring provisions. See Schafer , 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is supplied by \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), which completes the denition of subchapter\" that includes \u00a7 416(e)(1). the completed denition, which the SSA employs, \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the status of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA's interpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to without deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the agency's reading is therefore entitled to this Court's deference under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appropriate \"when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226-227 (2001). Here, as already noted, the SSA's longstanding interpretation is set forth in regula\u00adtions published after notice-and-comment rulemaking. See supra, at 549. Congress gave the Commissioner authority to promulgate rules \"necessary or appropriate to carry out\" the Commissioner's functions and the relevant statutory pro\u00advisions. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(a), 902(a)(5). The Commis\u00adsioner's regulations are neither \"arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. 44, 53 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). They thus warrant the Court's approbation. See Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 217-222, 225 (2002) (deferring to the Commissioner's \"considerable authority\" to interpret the Act). Cite as: 566 U. S. 541 (2012) 559 Opinion of the Court V Tragic circumstances\u2014Robert Capato's death before he and his wife could raise a family\u2014gave rise to this case. But the law Congress enacted calls for resolution of Karen Capato's application for child's insurance benets by refer\u00adence to state intestacy law. We cannot replace that ref\u00aderence by creating a uniform federal rule the statute's text scarcely supports. * * * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap\u00ad peals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is re\u00admanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 560 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD., dba MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 10-1472. Argued February 21, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012 Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, in\u00ad cludes \"compensation of interpreters\" among the costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. \u00a7 1920(6). In this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the prevail\u00ading party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award included the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain documents that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth Circuit afrmed, concluding that \u00a7 1920(6) covers the cost of translating documents as well as the cost of translating live speech. Held: Because the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" is someone who translates orally from one language to another, the category \"compensa\u00adtion of interpreters\" in \u00a7 1920(6) does not include the cost of document translation. Pp. 564575. (a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specied for the rst time what costs are allowable in federal court. That provi\u00ad sion denes the term \"costs\" as used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 441. As originally congured, \u00a7 1920 contained ve categories of taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which added a sixth category that includes \"compensation of interpreters.\" \u00a7 1920(6). Pp. 564566. (b) Because not dened in the Court Inter\u00ad preters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer , 513 U. S. 179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries dened \"interpreter\" as one who translates spoken, as opposed to writ\u00adten, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally dened \"inter\u00adpreter\" and \"interpret\" in terms of oral translation. Respondent relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster's Third New International Dictionary that dened \"interpreter\" as \"one that translates; esp: a per\u00ad son who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.\" Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one \"who translates orally,\" that mean\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 561 Syllabus ing is subsumed within the more general denition \"one that trans\u00ad lates.\" That a denition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all relevant dictionaries dened \"interpreter\" at the time of the statute's enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful dened the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials. Notably, the Ox\u00adford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative, recognized that \"interpreter\" can mean one who translates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete. Any denition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning. Given this survey of relevant diction\u00adaries, the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" does not include those who translate writings. Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a7 1920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory context suggests that \"interpreter\" includes only those who translate orally. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1827. Moreover, Congress' use of technical terminology reflects the distinction in rele\u00advant professional literature between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and translators, who are used for written communica\u00adtions. Pp. 566572. (c) No other rule of construction compels a departure from the ordi\u00ad nary meaning of \"interpreter.\" This Court has never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in \u00a7 1920. To the contrary, the Court has made clear that the \"discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade\" the specic categories of costs set forth by Congress, Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442, but \"is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in \u00a7 1920,\" ibid. This Court's conclusion is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent's extratextual arguments\u2014that doc\u00adumentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written\u2014are more properly directed at Congress. In any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" in \u00a7 1920(6). Pp. 572575. 633 F. 3d 1218, vacated and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Ginsburg, J., led a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., joined, post, p. 575. 562 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court Michael S. Fried argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Donald B. Ayer , Christopher J. Smith, and Douglas F. Cushnie. Dan Himmelfarb argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Michael B. Kimberly and Thomas L. Roberts.* Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. The costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in lawsuits brought in federal court are set forth in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920. The Court Interpreters Act amended that statute to include \"compensation of interpreters.\" \u00a7 1920(6); see also \u00a7 7, 92 Stat. 2044. The question presented in this case is whether \"compensation of interpreters\" covers the cost of translating documents. Because the ordinary meaning of the word \"interpreter\" is a person who translates orally from one language to another, we hold that \"compensation of in\u00adterpreters\" is limited to the cost of oral translation and does not include the cost of document translation. I This case arises from a personal injury action brought by petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball player in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacic Saipan, Ltd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Islands. Peti\u00adtioner was injured when his leg broke through a wooden deck during a tour of respondent's resort property. Ini\u00adtially, petitioner said that he needed no medical attention, *Mark T. Stancil, David T. Goldberg, Daniel R. Ortiz, James E. Ryan, and John P . Elwood led a brief for the National Association of Judiciary Interpreters and Translators as amicus curiae urging reversal. Deanne E. Maynard, Brian R. Matsui, and Marc A. Hearron led a brief for the Chicago Area Translators and Interpreters Association et al. as amici curiae urging afrmance. M. Scott Barnard, Scott T. Williams, and Patrick G. O'Brien led a brief for Interpreting and Translation Professors as amici curiae. Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 563 Opinion of the Court but two weeks later, he informed respondent that he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments from the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he claimed damages for med\u00adical expenses and for lost income from contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery concluded, both parties moved for summary judgment. The United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands granted respond\u00adent's motion on the ground that petitioner offered no evi\u00addence that respondent knew of the defective deck or other\u00adwise failed to exercise reasonable care. In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have various documents translated from Japanese to English. After the District Court granted summary judgment in respondent's favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs. Over petitioner's objection, the District Court awarded the costs to respondent as \"compensation of interpreters\" under \u00a7 1920(6). Explaining that interpreter services \"cannot be separated into 'translation' and 'interpretation,' \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs for document translation \"fal[l] within the meaning of 'compensation of an interpreter,' \" ibid. Finding that it was necessary for respondent to have the documents translated in order to depose petitioner, the court concluded that the translation services were properly taxed as costs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit afrmed both the District Court's grant of summary judg\u00adment and its award of costs. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the cost of document translation services is not recoverable as \"compensation of interpreters.\" The court explained that \"the word 'interpreter' can reasonably encompass a 'translator,' both according to the dictionary denition and common usage of these terms, which does not always draw precise distinctions between foreign language interpretations involving live speech versus written docu\u00adments.\" 633 F. 3d 1218, 1221 (2011). \"More importantly,\" the court stressed, this construction of the statute \"is more 564 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court compatible with Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce\u00ad dure, which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.\" Ibid. The court thus con\u00ad cluded that \"the prevailing party should be awarded costs for services required to interpret either live speech or writ\u00adten documents into a familiar language, so long as interpreta\u00adtion of the items is necessary to the litigation.\" Id., at 1221-1222. Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on this issue, 1 we granted certiorari. 564 U. S. 1066 (2011). II A Although the taxation of costs was not allowed at common law, it was the practice of federal courts in the early years to award costs in the same manner as the courts of the rele\u00advant forum State. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilder\u00ad ness Society , 421 U. S. 240, 247-248 (1975). In 1793, Con\u00ad gress enacted a statute that authorized the awarding of certain costs to prevailing parties based on state law: \"That there be allowed and taxed in the supreme, circuit and district courts of the United States, in favour of the parties obtaining judgments therein, such compensation for their travel and attendance, and for attornies and counsellors' fees . . . as are allowed in the supreme or superior courts of the respective states.\" Act of Mar. 1, 1793, ch. 20, \u00a7 4, 1 Stat. 333. 1 Compare BDT Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 405 F. 3d 415, 419 (CA6 2005) (holding that document translation costs are taxable under \u00a7 1920(6) because the \"denition of interpret expressly includes to 'trans\u00adlate into intelligible or familiar language' \" (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1182 (1981))), with Extra Equipamentos E Ex\u00ad porta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda. v. Case Corp., 541 F. 3d 719, 727-728 (CA7 2008) (holding that document translation costs are not taxable under \u00a7 1920(6) because an interpreter is \"normally understood [as] a person who translates living speech from one language to another\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 565 Opinion of the Court Although twice reenacted, this provision expired in 1799. Alyeska Pipeline , supra, at 248, n. 19; Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet even in the absence of express legislative authorization, the practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of costs persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U. S., at 250. Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying the costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The impe\u00ad tus for a uniform federal rule was largely the consequence of two developments. First, a \"great diversity in practice among the courts\" had emerged. Ibid. Second, \"losing liti\u00ad gants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor's attorney.\" Ibid. Against this backdrop, Con\u00ad gress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we have described as a \"far-reaching Act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts.\" Id., at 251-252. The substance of this Act was transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874 and the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of 1948, where it was codi\u00aded, \"without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules,\" as 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920. 421 U. S., at 255. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the dis\u00ad cretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule pro\u00advides in relevant part: \"Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than at\u00adtorney's fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing party.\" Rule 54(d)(1). We have held that \"\u00a7 1920 denes the term 'costs' as used in Rule 54(d).\" Crawford Fitting , 482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that \"the discre\u00adtion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in \u00a7 1920.\" Ibid. As originally congured, ve categories of taxable costs: (1) \"[f]ees of the clerk and marshal\"; (2) \"[f]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the steno\u00adgraphic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case\"; (3) \"[f]ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses\"; 566 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court (4) \"[f]ees for exemplication and copies of papers necessar\u00ad ily obtained for use in the case\"; and (5) \"[d]ocket fees under section 1923 of this title.\" 62 Stat. 955. In 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which amended \u00a7 1920 to add a sixth category: \"[c]ompensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, ex\u00adpenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920(6); see also \u00a7 7, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned here with this sixth cate\u00adgory, specically the item of taxable costs identied as \"com\u00adpensation of interpreters.\" B To determine whether the item \"compensation of inter\u00ad preters\" includes costs for document translation, we must look to the meaning of \"interpreter.\" That term is not de\u00adned in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision. When a term goes undened in a stat\u00adute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer , 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995). The question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\"? Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act in 1978 dened \"interpreter\" as one who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language. The American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, dened the term as \"[o]ne who translates orally from one language into another.\" American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978). The Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary dened the related word \"interpret\" as \"to translate orally.\" Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the Random House Dictionary dened the intransitive form of \"interpret\" as \"to translate what is said in a foreign language.\" Ran\u00ad dom House Dictionary of the English Language 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the Oxford English Dic\u00adtionary dened \"interpreter\" as \"[o]ne who translates lan\u00adguages,\" that denition into two senses: \"a. [a] translator of books or writings,\" which it designated Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 567 Opinion of the Court as obsolete, and \"b. [o]ne who translates the communications of persons speaking different languages; spec. one whose of\u00ad ce it is to do so orally in the presence of the persons; a dragoman.\" 5 Oxford English Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (\"[o]ne who interprets; one whose ofce it is to translate the words of persons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their presence\"); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686 (1973) (\"one who translates orally for the ben\u00adet of two or more parties speaking different languages: . . . a translator (obs.)\"). Pre-1978 generally defined the words \"interpreter\" and \"interpret\" in terms of oral transla\u00ad tion. The then-current edition of Black's Law Dictionary, for example, dened \"interpreter\" as \"[a] person sworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . . to the court,\" and it dened \"interpret\" in relevant part as \"to translate orally from one tongue to another.\" Black's Law Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also W. Anderson, A Diction\u00adary of Law 565 (1888) (\"[o]ne who translates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign tongue, for the benet of the court and jury\"); 1 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English Jurisprudence 639 (1878) (\"one who restates the testimony of a witness testify\u00ading in a foreign tongue, to the court and jury, in their lan\u00adguage\"). But see Ballentine's Law Dictionary 655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (dening \"interpreter\" as \"[o]ne who interprets, particularly one who interprets words written or spoken in a foreign language,\" and \"interpret\" as \"to translate from a foreign language\"). Against these authorities, respondent relies almost exclu\u00ad sively on Webster's Third New International Dictionary (hereinafter Webster's Third). The version of that diction\u00adary in print when Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act dened \"interpreter\" as \"one that translates; esp: a per\u00ad son who translates orally for parties conversing in different 568 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court tongues.\" Webster's Third 1182 (1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one \"who translates orally,\" but that meaning is subsumed within the more general denition \"one that translates.\" See 12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster's Third 15a (1986) (explaining that esp \"is used to introduce the most common meaning included in the more general pre\u00adceding denition\"). For respondent, the general denition sufces to establish that the term \"interpreter\" ordinarily includes persons who translate the written word. Explain\u00ading that \"the word 'interpreter' can reasonably encompass a 'translator,' \" the Court of Appeals reached the same conclu\u00adsion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree. That a denition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish that the word is ordinarily un\u00ad derstood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301 (1989) (relying on the \"most common meaning\" and the \"ordinary and natural signication\" of the word \"request,\" even though it may sometimes \"double for 'demand' or 'command' \"). The fact that the denition of \"interpreter\" in Webster's Third has a sense divider denoting the most common usage sug\u00adgests that other usages, although acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It is telling that all the dictionaries cited above dened \"interpreter\" at the time of the statute's enactment as including persons who translate orally, but only a handful dened the word broadly enough to encompass 2 A handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar formu\u00ad lation. See Funk & Wagnalls New Comprehensive International Diction\u00ad ary of the English Language 665 (1977) (\"[o]ne who interprets or trans\u00adlates; specically, one who serves as oral translator between people speaking different languages\"); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103 (C. Barn-hart & R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (\"a person whose business is translating, especially orally, from a foreign language\"); Cassell's English Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (\"[o]ne who interprets, esp. one employed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 569 Opinion of the Court translators of written material. See supra, at 566-568. Al\u00ad though the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most au\u00ad thoritative on the English language, recognized that \"inter\u00adpreter\" can mean one who translates writings, it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 566- 567. Were the meaning of \"interpreter\" that respondent ad\u00ad vocates truly common or ordinary, we would expect to see more support for that meaning. We certainly would not ex\u00adpect to see it designated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary. Any denition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning. Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we con\u00ad clude that the ordinary or common meaning of \"interpreter\" does not include those who translate writings. Instead, we nd that an interpreter is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to another. This sense of the word is far more natural. As the Seventh Circuit put it: \"Robert Fagles made famous translations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey , and the Aeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-language 'interpreter' of these works.\" Extra Equipamentos E Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda. v. Case Corp., 541 F. 3d 719, 727 (2008). To be sure, the word \"interpreter\" can encompass persons who translate documents, but because that is not the ordi\u00adnary meaning of the word, it does not control unless the con\u00adtext in which the word appears indicates that it does. Noth\u00ading in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a7 1920, however, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" and to embrace the broadest possi\u00adble meaning that the denition of the word can bear. If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite: that the word \"interpreter\" applies only to those who trans\u00adlate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress enacted \u00a7 1920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act. The main 570 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court provision of that Act is \u00a7 2(a), codied in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040-2042. Particularly relevant here is \u00a7 1827. As it now reads, that statute provides for the establishment of \"a program to facilitate the use of certied and otherwise qualied interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States.\" \u00a7 1827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an interpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the United States if a party or witness \"speaks only or primarily a language other than the English language\" or \"suffers from a hearing im\u00adpairment\" \"so as to inhibit such party's comprehension of the proceedings or communication with counsel or the presiding judicial ofcer, or so as to inhibit such witness' comprehen\u00adsion of questions and the presentation of such testimony.\" \u00a7 1827(d)(1). 3 As originally enacted, subsection (k) \"interpretation provided by certied inter\u00adpreters . . . shall be in the consecutive except that the presiding judicial ofcer . . . may authorize a \u00a7 1827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042. In its current form, subsection (k) provides that interpretation \"shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party . . . and in the consecutive mode for wit\u00adnesses,\" unless the court directs otherwise. The simultane\u00adous, consecutive, and summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation and have nothing to do with the translation of writings. 4 Taken together, these provisions are a strong 3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when rst enacted. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2040. 4The simultaneous mode requires the interpreter \"to interpret and to speak contemporaneously with the individual whose communication is being translated.\" H. R. Rep. No. 95-1687, p. 8 (1978). The consecutive mode requires the speaker whose communication is being translated to pause so that the interpreter can \"convey the testimony given.\" Ibid. And the summary mode \"allow[s] the interpreter to condense and distill the speech of the speaker.\" Ibid.; see generally Zazueta, Attorneys Guide to the Use of Court Interpreters, 8 U. C. D. L. Rev. 471, 477-478 (1975). Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 571 Opinion of the Court contextual clue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation in the Court Interpreters Act and that it in\u00adtended to use the term \"interpreter\" throughout the Act in its ordinary sense as someone who translates the spoken word. As we have said before, it is a \" 'normal rule of statu\u00adtory construction' that 'identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same mean\u00ading.' \" Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 570 (1995) (quoting Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, 342 (1994)). 5 The references to technical terminology in the Court In\u00ad terpreters Act further suggest that Congress used \"inter\u00adpreter\" in a technical sense, and it is therefore signicant that relevant professional literature draws a line between \"interpreters,\" who \"are used for oral conversations,\" and \"translators,\" who \"are used for written communications.\" Zazueta, supra n. 4, at 477; see also M. Frankenthaler, Skills for Bilingual Legal Personnel 67 (1982) (\"While the transla\u00adtor deals with the written word, the interpreter is concerned with the spoken language\"); Brislin, Introduction, in Transla\u00adtion: Applications and Research 1 (R. Brislin ed. 1976) (ex\u00adplaining that when both terms are used together, translation \"refers to the processing [of] written input, and interpreta\u00adtion to the processing of oral input\" (emphasis deleted)); J. Herbert, Interpreter's Handbook 1 (\"In the present-day jargon of international organisations, the words translate, translations, translator are used when the immedi\u00adate result of the work is a written text; and the words inter\u00ad 5 The dissent agrees that context should help guide our analysis, but instead of looking to the Court Interpreters Act, it looks to \"the practice of federal courts both before and after \u00a7 1920(6)'s enactment.\" Post, at 579 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). The practice of federal courts after the Act's enactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of enactment. And federal-court practice before the Act under other provi\u00ad sions of \u00a7 1920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress intended when it added paragraph (6). We think the statutory context in which the word \"interpreter\" appears is a more reliable guide to its meaning. 572 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court pret, interpreter, interpretation when it is a speech delivered orally\"). That Congress specified \"interpreters\" but not \"translators\" is yet another signal that it intended to limit \u00a7 1920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written, translation. 6 In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of \"in\u00ad terpreter,\" as well as the statutory context in which the word is found, lead to the conclusion that \u00a7 1920(6) does not apply to translators of written materials. 7 C No other rule of construction compels us to depart from the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter.\" The Court of Ap\u00adpeals reasoned that a broader meaning is \"more compatible with Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.\" 633 F. 3d, at 1221. But we have never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statutory con\u00adstruction in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in \u00a7 1920. To the contrary, we have made clear that the \"discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade\" the specic categories of costs set forth by Congress. Crawford Fitting , 482 U. S., at 442. \"Rather,\" 6 Some provisions within the United States Code use both \"interpreter\" and \"translator\" together, thus implying that Congress understands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above. See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1555(b) (providing that appropriations for the Immigration and Natu\u00adralization Service \"shall be available for payment of . . . interpreters and translators who are not citizens of the United States\"); 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 530C(b)(1)(I) (providing that Department of Justice funds may be used for \"[p]ayment of interpreters and translators who are not citizens of the United States\"). 7 Our conclusion is buttressed by respondent's concession at oral argu\u00ad ment that there is no provision in the United States Code where it is clear that the word extends to those who translate documents. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Petitioner 32 (\"And the Code is wholly devoid of any corresponding denition of 'interpreter' extending to the translation of written documents\"). As respondent acknowledged, either the word is used in a context that strongly suggests it applies only to oral translation or its meaning is unclear. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 573 Opinion of the Court we have said, \"it is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in \u00a7 1920.\" Ibid. Rule 54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the ordinary mean\u00ading of the various items enumerated in the costs statute, in\u00adcluding the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter.\" Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of taxable costs. \"Although 'costs' has an everyday meaning synony\u00admous with 'expenses,' the concept of taxable costs under Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those expenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court will assess against a litigant.\" 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Fed\u00aderal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2666, pp. 202-203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). Taxable costs are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses as is evident from \u00a7 1920, which lists such items as clerk fees, court reporter fees, expenses for printing and witnesses, expenses for ex\u00ademplication and copies, docket fees, and compensation of court-appointed experts. Indeed, \"the assessment of costs most often is merely a clerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.\" Hairline Creations, Inc. v. Kefalas, 664 F. 2d 652, 656 (CA7 1981). Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that \"costs almost always amount to less than the successful litigant's total expenses in connection with a lawsuit.\" 10 Wright & Miller \u00a7 2666, at 203. Be\u00adcause taxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in scope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary meaning of the cost items Congress authorized in \u00a7 1920. As for respondent's extratextual arguments, they are more properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to require the losing party to cover translation costs for spoken words but not for written words. Brief for Respondent 20. Respondent also observes that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written. Id., at 20-24. One task, called \" 'sight 574 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Opinion of the Court translation,' \" involves the oral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task involves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a third task, called \" 'document compar\u00ad ison,' \" involves comparing documents in the source and tar\u00adget language to verify that the two are identical. Id., at 21-22. Respondent argues that a narrow denition cannot account for these variations and that a bright-line denition of \"interpreter\" as someone who translates spoken and writ\u00adten words would avoid complication and provide a simple, administrable rule for district courts. Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" in \u00a7 1920(6). First, Congress might have distinguished between oral and written translation out of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear the potentially sizable costs of translating discovery documents, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral testimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair, especially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718 (1967) (noting the argument \"that since litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents' counsel\"). Congress might also have concluded that a document translator is more akin to an expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher documentary evidence\u2014like, for instance, a fo\u00adrensic accountant\u2014than to an interpreter whose real-time oral translation services are necessary for communication between litigants, witnesses, and the court. 8 8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral trans\u00ad lation, is essential \"to equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.\" Post, at 579. But a document translator is no more important than an expert or consultant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary evidence, yet expenses Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 575 Ginsburg, J., dissenting Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hybrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points actually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the problem of drawing the line between taxable and nontaxable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It certainly has not shown that any such problems will be more troublesome than the task of sifting through translated discovery documents to ascertain which can be taxed as necessary to the litigation. In any event, the present case does not present a hybrid situation; it involves purely written translation, which falls outside the tasks performed by an \"interpreter\" as that term is ordinarily understood. * * * Because the ordinary meaning of \"interpreter\" is someone who translates orally from one language to another, we hold that the category \"compensation of interpreters\" in \u00a7 1920(6) does not include costs for document translation. We there\u00adfore vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Ap\u00adpeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Ginsburg , with whom Justice Breyer and Jus\u00ad tice Sotomayor join, dissenting. To be comprehended by the parties, the witnesses, and the court, expression in foreign languages must be translated into English. Congress therefore provided, in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920(6), that the prevailing party may recoup compensation paid to \"interpreters.\" The word \"interpreters,\" the Court for experts and consultants are generally not taxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair a litigant's case, but docu\u00adment translation is not indispensable, in the way oral translation is, to the parties' ability to communicate with each other, with witnesses, and with the court. 576 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting emphasizes, commonly refers to translators of oral speech. Ante , at 566-567. But as the Court acknowledges, ante , at 567-568, and n. 2, \"interpreters\" is more than occasionally used to encompass those who translate written speech as well. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 1182 (hereinafter Webster's) (dening \"interpreter\" as \"one that translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues\"); Black's Law Dictionary 895 (9th ed. 2009) (den\u00ading \"interpreter\" as a \"person who translates, esp. orally, from one language to another\"); Ballentine's Law Dictionary 655 (3d ed. 1969) (dening \"interpreter\" as \"[o]ne who inter\u00adprets, particularly one who interprets words written or spo\u00adken in a foreign language\"). In short, employing the word \"interpreters\" to include translators of written as well as oral speech, if not \"the most common usage,\" ante, at 568, is at least an \"acceptable\" usage, ibid. Moreover, the word \"interpret\" is generally understood to mean \"to explain or tell the meaning of: trans\u00adlate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,\" while \"translate\" commonly means \"to turn into one's own or an\u00adother language.\" Webster's 1182, 2429. See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744, 1505 (1973) (dening the \"translate\" as \"to turn (something written or spoken) from one language into another\"). Notably, several Federal District Court decisions refer to translators of written documents as \"interpreters.\" E. g., United States v. Prado-Cervantez, No. 11-40044-11, 2011 WL 4691934, *3 (D Kan., Oct. 6, 2011) (\"Standby counsel should also be prepared to arrange for interpreters to inter\u00adpret or translate documents when necessary for defendant.\"); Mendoza v. Ring , No. 07-3144, 2008 WL 2959848, *2 (CD Ill., July 30, 2008) (\"The interpreter is also directed to trans\u00adlate lings by the plaintiff from Spanish to English. The original and translated versions will be docketed.\"). So do Cite as: 566 U. S. 560 (2012) 577 Ginsburg, J., dissenting a number of state statutes. E. g., Cal. Govt.

Most Federal Courts of Appeals confronted with the ques\u00ad tion have held that costs may be awarded under \u00a7 1920(6) for the translation of documents necessary to, or in preparation for, litigation. Compare 633 F. 3d 1218, 1220-1222 (CA9 2011); BDT Prods., Inc. 3d 415, 419 (CA6 v. Slagenweit, 63 curiam); Chore-Time Equip., Inc. v.

See, e. g., Raffold Process Corp. v. Castanea Paper Co., 25 F. Supp. 593, 594 (WD Pa. 1938). Before the Court Inter\u00adpreters Act added \u00a7 1920(6) to the taxation of costs statute in 1978, district courts awarded costs for document translation under \u00a7 1920(4), which allowed taxation of \"[f]ees for exem\u00ad 1 Translation costs, like other costs recoverable under \u00a7 1920, may be \"denied or limited\" if they \"were unreasonably incurred or unnecessary to the case.\" 10 Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 54.101[1][b], p. 54-158 (3d ed. 2012). 578 T ANIGUCHI v.

Pre-1978, district courts also awarded costs for oral translation of witness tes\u00adtimony. See, e. g., Kaiser Industries Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp ., 50 F. R. D. 5, 11 (ED Mich. 1970). Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act, a measure intended to expand access to interpretation services, indicates a design to eliminate the availability of costs awards for document translation.

(\"The committee . . . feels the time has come to provide by statute for the provision of and access to qualied certied interpret\u00aders, for a broader spectrum of people than the present law allows.\"). Post-1978, rulings awarding document transla\u00adtion costs under \u00a7 1920(6) indicate the courts' understanding both that the term \"interpreter\" can readily encompass oral and written translation, and that Congress did not otherwise instruct. 2 I agree that context should guide the determina\u00ad 2 Currently, some Federal District Courts make the practice of allowing fees for translation of documents explicit in their local rules.

But the context key for me is the practice of federal courts both before and after \u00a7 1920(6)'s enactment. The purpose of translation, after all, is to make relevant foreign-language communication accessible to the litigants and the court. See S.

Documentary evi\u00addence in a foreign language, no less than oral statements, must be translated to equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.

Nothing indicates that Congress intended paragraph (6), unlike paragraphs (2)-(4), to apply exclusively to oral communications. 580 T ANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD. Ginsburg, J., dissenting Distinguishing written from oral translation for cost- award purposes, moreover, is an endeavor all the more du\u00ad bious, for, as the Court acknowledges, ante , at 573-574, some translation tasks do not fall neatly into one category or the other. An interpreter, for example, may be called upon to \"sight translat[e]\" a written document, i. e., to convey a writ\u00ad ten foreign-language document's content orally in English. R. Gonz\u00e1lez, V . V\u00e1squez, & H. Mikkelson, Fundamentals of Court Interpretation: Theory, Policy, and Practice 401 (1991) (hereinafter Gonz\u00e1lez). In-court sight translation, Tani\u00adguchi concedes, counts as \"interpretation,\" even though it does not involve translating verbal expression. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. Yet an interpreter's preparation for in-court sight translation by translating a written document in advance, Taniguchi maintains, does not count as \"interpretation.\" Ibid. But if the interpreter then reads the prepared written translation aloud in court, that task, in Taniguchi's view, can be charged as \"interpretation,\" id., at 11, even though the reading involves no translation of foreign-language expres\u00adsion\u2014written or oral\u2014at all. Similarly hard to categorize is the common court- interpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign lan\u00adguage, transcribing it, then translating it into English. See Gonz\u00e1lez 439. Although this task involves oral foreign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi contends, qualify as \"interpretation,\" because it involves \"the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.\" Reply Brief 9 (internal quo\u00adtation marks omitted). But sight translation\u2014which Tani\u00adguchi concedes may be charged as \"interpretation\"\u2014may sometimes involve similarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document in advance of a court proceeding.

Ante , at 574.4 Current practice in awarding translation costs, however, has shown that district judges are up to the task of conning awards to translation services necessary to pre\u00adsent or defeat a claim. See Eastman Kodak Co., 713 F. 2d, at 133 (District Court should not award document translation costs \"carte blanche,\" but must determine whether such costs were necessarily incurred).

Courts of appeals, in turn, are capable of reviewing such judgments for abuse of discretion. 4 The Court also observes that \"[t]axable costs are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses.\" Ante , at 573. The tab for unquestionably allowable costs, however, may run high.

C. \u00a7 1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things, has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least ve years, \u00a7 1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) should impute a parent's years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child. That issue arises because a child may enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his parents does\u2014meaning that a parent may satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)(1) or \u00a7 1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not. In In re Escobar , 24 I. & N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien must meet \u00a7 1229b(a)'s requirements on his own. But the Ninth Circuit found the Board's position unreasonable, holding that \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) require imputation. See Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder , 580 F. 3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013. Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with his family in 1989, when he was ve years old. Martinez Gutierrez's father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003. Two years after that, he was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. Admitting the offense, he sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualied for relief because of his father's immi\u00adgration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could not satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)(1) or \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) on his own. Relying on Escobar , the BIA reversed. The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez's petition for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions. Respondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time, his mother had already *Together with No. 10-1543, Holder, Attorney General v. Sawyers, also on certiorari to the same court. 584 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Syllabus resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August 2002, the Gov\u00adernment began removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he could not sat\u00adisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). The BIA afrmed, and Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review. There, he argued that the Board should have counted his mother's years of residency while he was a minor toward \u00a7 1229b(a)(2)'s 7-year continuous-residency requirement. The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the BIA. Held: The BIA's rejection of imputation is based con\u00ad struction of \u00a7 1229b(a). Pp. 591-598. (a) The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)'s requirements on his own, without relying on a parent's years of continuous residence or immigration status. That po\u00adsition prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best. See, e. g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844, and n. 11. The BIA's approach satises this standard. The Board's position is consistent with the statute's text. Section 1229b(a) does not mention\u2014much less require\u2014imputation. Instead, it simply calls for \"the alien\" to meet the prerequisites for cancellation of removal. See \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33). Respondents contend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so, that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy. Pp. 591-592. (b) Neither does the statute's history and context mandate imputa\u00ad tion. Section 1229b(a) replaced former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained a \"lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\" in this \u00a7 1229b(a), \u00a7 212(c) was silent on imputation. But every Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in de\u00adtermining eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, the Board should impute a par\u00adent's years of domicile to his or her child. Based on this history, Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood \u00a7 1229b(a)'s lan\u00adguage to provide for imputation. But in enacting \u00a7 1229b(a), Congress eliminated the very term\u2014\"domicile\"\u2014on which the appeals courts had founded their imputation decisions. And the doctrine of congressional ratication applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without rele\u00advant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349. Cite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 585 Syllabus Nor do the INA's purposes demand imputation. As respondents cor\u00ad rectly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with strong ties to this country. But these are not the INA's only goals, and Congress did not pursue them at all costs. For example, aliens convicted of ag\u00adgravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child. A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly. Pp. 592-594. (c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the Board's position is not entitled to Chevron deference. First, they claim that the Board's approach to \u00a7 1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is incon\u00adsistent with the Board's acceptance of imputation under other, similar provisions that are silent on the matter. See \u00a7\u00a7 1182(k) and 1181(b). But the Board's decision in Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an alien's state of mind, while declining to impute objective conditions or charac\u00adteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233-234, and n. 4. Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration status and place of resi\u00addence. See id., at 233. So the Board's approach to \u00a7 1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward distinction. Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice. But Escobar belies this contention. The Board did explain how \u00a7 1229b(a)'s text supports its no-imputation policy. But the Board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under \u00a7 1229b(a) would create anoma\u00adlies in the statutory scheme. Escobar thus expressed the BIA's view that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation. In making that case, the opin\u00adion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred. Pp. 594-598. No. 10-1542, 411 Fed. Appx. 121; No. 10-1543, 399 Fed. Appx. 313, reversed and remanded. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Leondra R. Kruger argued the cause for petitioner in both cases. On the briefs were Solicitor General Verrilli, As\u00ad586 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court sistant Attorney General West, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, Pratik A.

Timo\u00ad feyev, Stephanos Bibas, and Michael Franquinha. Charles A. Rothfeld argued the cause for respondent in No. 10-1543. With him on the brief were Andrew J. Pincus and Jeffrey A. Meyer. Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court. An immigration statute, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1229b(a), authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien from the United States so long as the alien satises certain crite\u00adria. One of those criteria relates to the length of time an alien has lawfully resided in the United States, and another to the length of time he has held permanent resident status here. We consider whether the Board of Immigration Ap\u00adpeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably conclude that an alien living in this country as a child must meet those require\u00adments on his own, without counting a parent's years of resi\u00addence or immigration status. We hold that the BIA's ap\u00adproach is based on a permissible construction of the statute. I A The immigration laws have long given the Attorney Gen\u00ad eral discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable aliens to remain in the United States. See Judulang v. Holder , 565 U. S. 42, 59 (2011). The Attorney General formerly exercised this authority by virtue of \u00a7 212(c) of the Immi\u00adgration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. Jeffrey T. Green, Charles Roth, and Sarah O'Rourke Schrup led a brief for the National Immigration Justice Center as amicus curiae urging afrmance in both cases. Cite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 587 Opinion of the Court \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.), a provision with some lingering relevance here, see infra, at 7-9. But in 1996, Congress replaced \u00a7 212(c) with \u00a7 1229b(a) (2006 ed.). That new section, appli\u00adcable to the cases before us, provides as follows: \"(a) Cancellation of removal for certain perma\u00adnent residents \"The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014 \"(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for perma\u00ad nent residence for not less than 5 years, \"(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and \"(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated fel\u00ad ony.\" Ibid. Section 1229b(a) thus species the criteria that make an alien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney General. The rst paragraph requires that the alien have held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least ve years. And the second adds that the alien must have lived in the United States for at least seven continuous years after a law\u00adful admission, whether as an LPR or in some other immigra\u00adtion status. 1 (The third paragraph is not at issue in these cases.) The question we consider here is whether, in applying this statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent's years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child. That question arises because a child may enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his parents does. A parent may therefore satisfy the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2), while his or her child, considered 1 The INA denes \"admitted\" as referring to \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration ofcer.\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock of \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien's lawful entry. 588 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court independently, does not. In these circumstances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal? The Ninth Circuit, the rst court of appeals to confront this issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief. See Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013 (2005). Enrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United States illegally in 1985, when he was one year old. Cuevas\u00adGaspar's mother was lawfully admitted to the country in 1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully admitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status. That meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a removable offense in 2002, he could not independently satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)(2)'s requirement of seven consecutive years of residence after a lawful entry. 2 (The parties agreed that he just met \u00a7 1229b(a)(1)'s 5-year status requirement.) The Board deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that account, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unreasonable. Ac\u00adcording to the Court of Appeals, the Board should have \"im\u00adputed\" to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother's years of continuous residence during the time he lived with her as an \"unemanci\u00adpated minor.\" Id., at 1029. That approach, the Ninth Cir\u00ad cuit reasoned, followed from both the INA's \"priorit[ization]\" of familial relations and the Board's \"consistent willingness\" to make imputations from a parent to a child in many areas of immigration law. Id., at 1026. The Board responded by reiterating its opposition to impu\u00ad tation under both relevant paragraphs of \u00a7 1229b(a). In In re Escobar , 24 I. & N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board consid\u00ad 2 The 7-year clock stopped running on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar's of\u00ad fense under a statutory provision known as the \"stop-time\" rule. See \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) (\"For purposes of this section, any period of continuous resi\u00addence . . . in the United States shall be deemed to end . . . when the alien is served a appear . . . or . . . committed an offense . . that renders the alien . United , whichever is earliest\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 589 Opinion of the Court ered whether a child could rely on a parent's period of LPR status to satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)(1)'s 5-year \"disagree[d] of Cuevas-Gaspar , rejecting the Ninth Circuit's understanding of both the stat\u00adute and the Board's prior policies. 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233- 234, and n. 4. Accordingly, the Board announced that it would \"decline to extend\" Cuevas-Gaspar to any case involv\u00ad ing \u00a7 1229b(a)(1), and that it would ignore the decision even as to \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) outside the Ninth Circuit. 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. A year later, in Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec. 599 (2008), the BIA took the nal step: It rejected imputation under \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, maintaining that the court should abandon Cuevas- Gaspar and defer to the Board's intervening reasoned deci\u00ad sion in Escobar . See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 600-601 (citing National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)). The BIA's position on imputation touched off a split in the courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both de\u00adferred to the BIA's approach as a reasonable construction of \u00a7 1229b(a). See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F. 3d 264 (CA3 2008); Deus v. Holder , 591 F. 3d 807 (CA5 2009). But in Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder , 580 F. 3d 1102 (2009), the Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view, declaring the BIA's position unreasonable and requiring imputation under both \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2). See id., at 1103 (\"[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar apply equally to the ve-year permanent residence and the seven-year continu\u00adance residence requirements\" of \u00a7 1229b(a)). B Two cases are before us. In 1989, at the age of ve, re\u00ad spondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the United States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez's father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an 590 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez himself was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was apprehended for smuggling un\u00addocumented aliens across the border. He admitted the of\u00adfense, and sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualied for relief because of his father's immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could not satisfy either \u00a7 1229b(a)(1) or \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) on his own. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10-1542, pp. 20a-22a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar , 430 F. 3d 1013). The BIA reversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand, reafrmed its disposition in an order rely\u00ading on Escobar , see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10-1542, at 5a-6a. The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez's petition for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of the court's contrary decisions. See 411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011). Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time, his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After Sawyers's conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the Government initiated removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he was a few months shy of the seven years of continuous residence required under \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10-1543, p. 13a. (No one doubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status for ve years, as required under \u00a7 1229b(a)(1).) The Board afrmed, relying on its rea\u00adsoning in Escobar . See In re Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec. 26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review, arguing that the Board should have counted his mother's years of residency while he was a minor toward \u00a7 1229b(a)(2)'s 7-year requirement. As in Gutierrez, the Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the BIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010). Cite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 591 Opinion of the Court We granted the Government's petitions for certiorari, 564 U. S. 1066 (2011), consolidated the cases, and now reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgments. II The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)'s requirements on his own, without counting a parent's years of continuous residence or LPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable con\u00adstruction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844, and n. 11 (1984); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre , 526 U. S. 415, 424-425 (1999) (according Chevron deference to the Board's interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA's view on imputation meets that standard, and so need not decide if the statute permits any other construction. The Board's approach is consistent with the statute's text, as even respondents tacitly concede. Section 1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require it. The provision calls for \"the alien\"\u2014not, say, \"the alien or one of his parents\"\u2014to meet the three prerequisites for cancellation of removal. Similarly, several of \u00a7 1229b(a)'s other terms have statutory denitions referring to only a single individ\u00adual. See, e. g., \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A) (\"The terms 'admission' and 'admitted' mean, with respect to an alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 1101(a)(33) (\"The term 'residence' means the place of gen\u00aderal abode; the place of general abode of a person means his principal, actual dwelling\" (emphasis added)). Respondents contend that none of this language \"forecloses\" imputation: They argue that if the Board allowed imputation, \"[t]he alien\" seeking cancellation would \"still have to provision's durational requirements\"\u2014just pursuant to a dif\u00adferent computational rule. Brief for Respondent Martinez Gutierrez in No. 10-1542, p. 16 (hereinafter Martinez Gutier\u00ad592 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court rez Brief); see Brief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10-1543, pp. 11, 15 (hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the Board's history of permitting imputation under similarly \"silent\" statutes supports this construction. Martinez Gu\u00adtierrez Brief 16; see Sawyers Brief 15-16; infra, at 594-596. But even if so\u2014even if the Board could adopt an imputation rule consistent with the statute's text\u2014that would not avail respondents. Taken alone, the language of \u00a7 1229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way\u2014to say that \"the alien\" must meet the statutory conditions independ\u00adently, without relying on a parent's history. For this reason, respondents focus on \u00a7 1229b(a)'s history and context\u2014particularly, the provision's relationship to the INA's former \u00a7 its associated imputation rule. Section 212(c)\u2014\u00a7 1229b(a)'s predecessor\u2014generally allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained a \"lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\" in this country. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.). Like \u00a7 1229b(a), \u00a7 212(c) was silent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third, and Ninth Cir\u00adcuits (the only appellate courts to consider the question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for relief under \u00a7 212(c), the Board should impute a parent's years of domicile to his or her child. See Rosario v. INS, 962 F. 2d 220 (CA2 1992); v. INS, 90 F. 3d 833, 840-842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at common law, a minor's domi\u00adcile was \"the same as that of its parents, since most children are presumed not legally capable of forming the requisite intent to establish their own domicile.\" Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; see Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holy- eld, 490 U. S. 30, 48 (1989) (dening \"domicile\" as \"physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one's intent to remain there\"). So by the time Congress replaced \u00a7 212(c) with \u00a7 1229b(a), the BIA often im\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 593 Opinion of the Court puted a parent's years of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for cancellation of removal. Sawyers argues that against this backdrop, Congress \"would have understood the language it chose [in \u00a7 1229b(a)] to provide for imputation.\" Sawyers Brief 10. But we cannot conclude that Congress ratied an imputa\u00ad tion requirement when it passed \u00a7 1229b(a). As all parties agree, Congress enacted \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve an unrelated question about \u00a7 212(c)'s meaning. See id., at 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner 25. Courts had differed on whether alien's \"seven consecu\u00adtive years\" of alien's obtaining LPR status. See Cuevas-Gaspar , 430 F. 3d, at 1027-1028 (canvassing split). Congress addressed that split by creating two distinct durational conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsection (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an LPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of subsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the acquisition of LPR status. In doing so, Congress eliminated the very term\u2014\"domi\u00adcile\"\u2014on which the appeals courts had founded their imputa\u00adtion decisions. See supra, at 592. That alteration dooms respondents' position, because the doctrine of congressional ratication applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349 (2005). 3 So the 3 Sawyers contends that \u00a7 1229b(a)(2)'s replacement term\u2014\"resided con\u00ad tinuously\"\u2014is immigration context which incorpo\u00ad rates \"an intent component\" and so means the same thing as \"domiciled.\" Sawyers Brief 25-26 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers read \u00a7 1229b(a) as reenacting \u00a7 212(c) without meaningful change. See id., at 25. But even assuming that Congress could ratify judicial deci\u00ad sions based on the term \"domicile\" through a new statute using a synonym for that term, we do not think \"resided continuously\" qualies. The INA denes \"residence\" as a person's \"principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(33) (emphasis added), and 594 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court statutory history here provides no basis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional command in adopting its no-imputation policy. Nor do the INA's purposes demand imputation here, as both respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez, the BIA's approach contradicts that statute's objectives of \"providing relief to aliens with strong ties to the United States\" and \"promoting family unity.\" Martinez Gutierrez Brief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37. We agree\u2014indeed, we have stated\u2014that the goals respondents identify underlie or inform many provisions of immigration law. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 795, n. 6 (1977); INS v. Errico , 385 U. S. 214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA's only goals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth degree. To take one example, \u00a7 1229b(a)'s third paragraph makes aliens con\u00advicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for cancellation of re\u00admoval, regardless of the strength of their family ties. See \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). And more generally\u2014as these very cases show\u2014not every alien who obtains LPR status can immedi\u00adately get the same for her spouse or minor children. See Brief for Petitioner 31-32, and n. 9 (providing program-specic examples). We cannot read a silent statute as re\u00adquiring (not merely allowing) imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly. Respondents' stronger arguments take a different tack\u2014 that we should refuse to defer to the Board's decision even assuming Congress placed the question of imputation in its hands. Respondents offer two main reasons. First, they contend that the Board's approach to \u00a7 1229b(a) cannot be squared with its acceptance of imputation under other, simi\u00adlar statutory provisions. This \"wil[d]\" and \" '[u]nexplained inconsistency,' \" Sawyers asserts, is the very \"paradigm of arbitrary agency action.\" Sawyers Brief 13, 41 (emphasis we nd nothing to suggest that Congress added an intent element, incon\u00ad sistent with that denition, by requiring that the residence have been maintained \"continuously for 7 years.\" Cite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 595 Opinion of the Court deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52-54. Second, they argue that the Board did not appreciate its own discretion over whether to allow imputation. The Board, they say, thought Congress had forbidden imputation, and so did not bring its \" 'experience and expertise to bear' \" on the issue. Id., at 31 (quoting PDK Labs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F. 3d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see Sawyers Brief 38-39. These arguments are not insubstantial, but in the end neither persuades us to deny the Board the usual deference we accord to agency interpretations. Start with the claim of inconsistency. The BIA has in\u00ad deed imputed parental attributes to children under other INA provisions that do not mention the matter. Section 1182(k), for example, enables the Attorney General to let cer\u00adtain inadmissible aliens into the country if he nds \"that inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure.\" Like \u00a7 1229b(a), that provision refers to a single person (\"the immigrant\") and says nothing about imputation. But the BIA has con\u00adsistently imputed a parent's knowledge of inadmissibility (or lack thereof) to a child. See, e. g., Senica v. INS, 16 F. 3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (\"Therefore, the BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief under [\u00a7 1182(k)] because [their mother's] knowledge was A43 968 082, 2007 WL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per curiam); In re Ahmed, No. A41 982 631, 2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17, 2006) (per curiam). Similarly, the Board imputes a parent's abandonment (or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when deter\u00admining whether that child can reenter the country as a \"re\u00adturning resident immigran[t]\" under \u00a7 1181(b). See Matter of Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (holding that a \"voluntary and intended abandonment by the mother is im\u00adputed\" to an unemancipated minor child for purposes of applying \u00a7 1181(b)); Matter of Huang , 19 I. & N. Dec. 749, 596 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court 755-756 (1988) (concluding that a mother and her children abandoned their LPR status based solely on the mother's intent); In re Ali, No. A44 143 723, 2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a child could not have aban\u00addoned his LPR status if his mother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that is so even though neither \u00a7 1181(b) nor any other statutory provision says that the BIA should look to the parent in assessing the child's eligibility for reentry. But Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these di\u00ad vergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an alien's state of mind, while declining to impute objective con\u00additions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233-234, and n. 4. On one side of the line, knowledge of inadmissibil\u00adity is all and only about a mental state. See, e. g., Senica, 16 F. 3d, at 1015; In re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156. Likewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien's \"intention of . . . returning to the United States\" to live as a permanent resi\u00addent, Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec., at 396; the Board thus ex\u00ad plained that imputing abandonment is \"consistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child cannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her own domicile,\" Escobar , 24 I. & N. Dec., at 234, n. 4. And as that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of the former \u00a7 212(c) also in\u00advolved intent and so lent itself to imputation. See Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; supra, at 592. But the 5- and 7-year clocks of \u00a7 1229b(a) fall on the other side of the line, because they hinge not on any state of mind but on the objective facts of immigration status and place of residence. See Escobar , 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233 (\"[W]e nd that residence is differ\u00adent from domicile because no element of sub\u00adjective intent' \" (quoting Cuevas-Gaspar , 430 F. 3d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J., dissenting))). The BIA's varied rulings on imputation thus largely follow from one straightforward distinction. 4 4 Respondents aver that the BIA deviates from this principle in imput\u00ad ing to a child his parent's \" 'rm resettlement' \" in another country, which renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to intent. See Saw\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 583 (2012) 597 Opinion of the Court Similarly, Escobar belies respondents' claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it thought Con\u00ad gress had left it no other choice. The Board, to be sure, did not highlight the statute's gaps or ambiguity; rather, it read \u00a7 1229b(a)'s text to support its conclusion that each alien must personally meet that section's durational requirements. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. But the Board also explained that \"there [was] no precedent\" in its decisions for imputing status or residence, and distinguished those statutory terms, on the ground just explained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status. Id., at 234; see id., at 233-234, and n. 4. And the Board argued that allowing imputation under \u00a7 1229b(a) would create anomalies in administration of the statutory scheme by permitting even those who had not ob\u00adtained LPR status\u2014or could not do so because of a criminal history\u2014to become eligible for cancellation of removal. See id., at 234-235, and n. 5. The Board therefore saw neither a \"logical\" nor a \"legal\" basis for adopting a policy of imputa\u00adtion. Id., at 233. We see nothing in this decision to suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it might have reached a different result if assured it could do so. To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA's view, based on its experience implementing the INA, that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all pointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation. In making that case, the decision reads like a multitude of agency inter\u00adpretations\u2014not the best example, but far from the worst\u2014 yers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the Government denies that it has a \"settled imputation rule\" in that context. Reply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which respondents rely are slender reeds: a 40-year-old ruling by a regional commissioner (not the Board it\u00adself) that considered the conduct of both the parents and the child, see Matter of Ng , 12 I. & N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth Circuit decision imputing a parent's resettlement even though the Board had focused only on the child's actions, see Vang v. INS, 146 F. 3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we cannot conclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let alone one inconsistent with Escobar . 598 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ Opinion of the Court to which we and other courts have routinely deferred. We see no reason not to do so here. Because the Board's re jection of imputation under \u00a7 1229b(a) is \"based on a permissible construction of the stat\u00adute,\" Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, we reverse the Ninth Cir\u00ad cuit's judgments and remand the cases for further proceed\u00adings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 599 Syllabus BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas No. 10-1320. Argued February 22, 2012\u2014Decided May 24, 2012 The State of Arkansas charged petitioner Alex Blueford with capital mur\u00ad der for the death of a 1-year-old child. That charge included the lesser offenses of rst-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. Before the start of deliberations, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: \"If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the rst degree. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of murder in the rst degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter. . . . If you have a reason\u00adable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.\" The court also presented the jury with a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of them. Acquitting on some but not others was not an option. After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could not reach a verdict. The court inquired about the jury's progress on each offense. The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and rst-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial. When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he moved to dismiss the capital and rst-degree murder charges on double jeopardy grounds. The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas afrmed on interlocutory appeal. Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on charges of capital murder and rst-degree murder. Pp. 605610. (a) The jury did not acquit Blueford of capital or rst-degree murder. Blueford contends that the foreperson's report that the jury was unani\u00admous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor. But the re\u00adport was not a nal resolution of anything. When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury's delibera\u00adtions had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the court's instructions pro\u00ad hibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital and rst-degree 600 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Syllabus murder as deliberations continued. The foreperson's report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the nality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses. That same lack of nality undermines Blueford's reliance on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323. In both of those cases, the verdict of the jury was a nal decision; here, the report of the foreperson was not. Pp. 605608. (b) The trial court's declaration of a mistrial was not improper. A trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when \"particular circumstances manifest a necessity\" to declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 690. Blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and rst-degree murder, given the foreperson's report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges. According to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken some action, whether through new partial ver\u00addict forms or other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges. Blueford acknowledges, however, that the trial court's reason for declar\u00ading a mistrial here\u2014that the jury was unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been considered the \"classic basis\" establishing necessity for doing so. Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 509. And this Court has never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. 766, 775. As permitted under Arkansas law, the jury's options in this case were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all. The trial court did not abuse its discre\u00adtion by refusing to add another option\u2014that of acquitting on some of\u00adfenses but not others. Pp. 609610. 2011 Ark. 8, 370 S. W. 3d 496, afrmed.

The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense. The Clause does not, however, bar a second trial if the rst ended in a mistrial. Before the jury concluded deliberations in this case, it reported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of capital murder and rst-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial. All agree that the defendant may be retried on charges of man\u00ad slaughter and negligent homicide. The question is whether he may also be retried on charges of capital and rst-degree murder. *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were led for the Constitutional Accountability Center by Douglas T.

ARKANSAS Opinion of the Court I One-year-old Matthew McFadden, Jr., suffered a severe head injury on November 28, 2007, while home with his mother's boyfriend, Alex Blueford. Despite treatment at a hospital, McFadden died a few days later. The State of Arkansas charged Blueford with capital mur\u00ad der, but waived the death penalty. The State's theory at trial was that Blueford had injured McFadden intentionally, causing the boy's death \"[u]nder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\" Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-101(a)(9)(A) (Supp. 2011). The defense, in con\u00adtrast, portrayed the death as the result of Blueford acciden\u00adtally knocking McFadden onto the ground. The trial court instructed the jury that the charge of capital murder included three lesser offenses: rst-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. In addition to describing these offenses, the court addressed the order in which the jury was to consider them: \"If you have a rea\u00adsonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the rst degree. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of murder in the rst degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.\" App. 51-52. The prosecution commented on these instructions in its closing argument. It told the jury, for example, that \"before you can consider a lesser included of capital murder, you must rst, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\" Id., at 55. The prosecution explained that this was \"not a situation where you just lay everything out here and say, well, we have four choices. Which one does it t the most?\" Id., at 59. Rather, the prosecution emphasized, \"unless all 12 of you agree that this man's actions were not Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 603 Opinion of the Court consistent with capital murder, then and only then would you go down to murder in the rst degree.\" Ibid. After the parties concluded their arguments, the court presented the jury with a set of ve verdict forms, each rep\u00adresenting a possible verdict. There were four separate forms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged offenses: capital murder, rst-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. A fth form allowed the jury to return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford not guilty of any offense. There was no form allowing the jury to acquit on some offenses but not others. As stated in the court's instructions, the jury could either \"nd the defendant guilty of one of these offenses\" or \"acquit him outright.\" Id., at 51. Any verdict\u2014whether to convict on one or to acquit on all\u2014had to be unanimous. A few hours after beginning its deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking \"what happens if we cannot agree on a charge at all.\" Id., at 62. The court called the jury back into the courtroom and issued a so-called \" Allen instruction,\" emphasizing the importance of reaching a verdict. See Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492, 501-502 (1896). The jury then deliberated for a half hour more before sending out a second note, stating that it \"cannot agree on any one charge in this case.\" App. 64. When the court summoned the jury again, the jury foreperson reported that the jury was \"hope\u00adlessly\" deadlocked. Ibid. The court asked the foreperson to disclose the jury's votes on each offense: \"THE COURT: All right. If you have your numbers together, and I don't want names, but if you have your numbers I would like to know what your count was on capital murder. \"JUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous against that. No. \"THE COURT: Okay, on murder in the rst degree? \"JUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous against that. 604 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Opinion of the Court \"THE COURT: \"JUROR NUMBER ONE: negligent homicide? \"JUROR NUMBER ONE: We did not vote on that, sir. \"THE COURT: Did not vote on that. \"JUROR NUMBER ONE: No, sir. We couldn't get past the manslaughter. Were we supposed to go past that? I thought we were supposed to go one at a time.\" Id., at 64-65. Following this exchange, the court gave another Allen in\u00ad struction and sent the jurors back to the jury room. After deliberations resumed, Blueford's counsel asked the court to submit new verdict forms to the jurors, to be completed \"for those counts that they have reached a verdict on.\" Id., at 67. The prosecution objected on the grounds that the jury was \"still deliberating\" and that a verdict of acquittal had to be \"all or nothing.\" Id., at 68. The court denied Blueford's request. To allow for a partial verdict, the court explained, would be \"like changing horses in the middle of the stream,\" given that the jury had already received instructions and verdict forms. Ibid. The court informed counsel that it would declare a mistrial \"if the jury doesn't make a deci\u00adsion.\" Id., at 69. When the jury returned a half hour later, the foreperson stated that they had not reached a verdict. The court de\u00adclared a mistrial and discharged the jury. The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford. He moved to dismiss the capital and rst-degree murder charges on double jeopardy grounds, citing the foreperson's report that the jurors had voted unanimously against guilt on those offenses. The trial court denied the motion, and the Su\u00adpreme Court of Arkansas afrmed on interlocutory appeal. According to the State Supreme Court, the foreperson's re\u00adport had no effect on the State's ability to retry Blueford, because the foreperson \"was not making a formal announce\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 605 Opinion of the Court ment of acquittal\" when she disclosed the jury's votes. 2011 Ark. 8, p. 9, 370 S. W. 3d 496, 501. This was not a case, the court observed, \"where a formal verdict was announced or entered of record.\" Ibid. The court added that the trial court did not err in denying Blueford's request for new ver\u00addict forms that would have allowed the jury to render a par\u00adtial verdict on the charges of capital and rst-degree murder. Blueford sought review in this Court, and we granted cer\u00ad tiorari. 565 U. S. 941 (2011). II The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The Clause \"guar\u00adantees that the State shall not be permitted to make re\u00adpeated attempts to convict the accused, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\" United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 569 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). Blueford contends that the foreperson's report means that he cannot be tried again on charges of capital and rst-degree murder. According to Blueford, the Double Jeop\u00adardy Clause prohibits a second trial on those charges, for two reasons. A Blueford's primary submission is that he cannot be retried for capital and rst-degree murder because the jury actually acquitted him of those offenses. See Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957). The Arkansas Supreme Court noted\u2014and Blueford acknowledges\u2014that no formal judg\u00adment of acquittal was entered in his case. But none was necessary, Blueford maintains, because an acquittal is a mat\u00adter of substance, not form. Quoting from our decision in 606 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Opinion of the Court Martin Linen, supra, at 571, Blueford contends that despite the absence of a formal verdict, a jury's announcement con\u00ad stitutes an acquittal if it \" 'actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.' \" Brief for Petitioner 21. Here, according to Blueford, the foreperson's announcement of the jury's unani\u00admous votes on capital and rst-degree murder represented just that: a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in Blueford's favor. We disagree. The foreperson's report was not a nal reso\u00ad lution of anything. When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury's deliberations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further, even after the foreperson had delivered her report. When they emerged a half hour later, the foreperson stated only that they were unable to reach a verdict. She gave no indication whether it was still the case that all 12 jurors believed Blueford was not guilty of capital or rst-degree murder, that 9 of them believed he was guilty of manslaughter, or that a vote had not been taken on negligent homicide. The fact that deliberations contin\u00adued after the report deprives that report of the nality nec\u00adessary to constitute an acquittal on the murder offenses. Blueford maintains, however, that any possibility that the jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by the instructions given to the jury. Those instructions, he contends, not only required the jury to consider the offenses in order, from greater to lesser, but also prevented it from transitioning from one offense to the next without unani\u00admously\u2014and denitively\u2014resolving the greater offense in his favor. \"A jury is presumed to follow its instructions.\" Weeks v. Angelone , 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000). So, Blueford says, the foreperson's report that the jury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily establishes that the jury had acquitted Blueford of the greater offenses of capital and rst-degree murder. Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 607 Opinion of the Court But even if we assume that the instructions required a unanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser offense\u2014as the State assumes for purposes of this case, see Brief for Respondent 25, n. 3\u2014nothing in the instructions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote. The in\u00adstructions said simply, \"If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of [the greater offense], you will [then] consider the charge of [the lesser offense].\" App. 51-52. The jurors were never told that once they had a rea\u00adsonable doubt, they could not rethink the issue. The jury was free to reconsider a greater offense, even after consider\u00ading a lesser one. 1 A simple example illustrates the point. A jury enters the jury room, having just been given these instructions. The foreperson decides that it would make sense to determine the extent of the jurors' agreement before discussions begin. Accordingly, she conducts a vote on capital murder, and ev\u00aderyone votes against guilt. She does the same for rst-degree murder, and again, everyone votes against guilt. She then calls for a vote on manslaughter, and there is dis\u00adagreement. Only then do the jurors engage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime. While considering the arguments of the other jurors on how the death was caused, one of the jurors starts rethinking his own stance on a greater offense. After reflecting on the evidence, he comes to believe that the defendant did knowingly cause the death\u2014satisfying the denition of rst-degree murder. At 1 In reaching a contrary conclusion, post, at 615 (opinion of Sotomayor , J.), the dissent construes the jury instructions to \"require a jury to complete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a lesser,\" post, at 612 (emphasis added). But no such requirement can be found in the text of the instructions themselves. And the dissent's attempt to glean such a requirement from the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision in Hughes v. State , 347 Ark. 696, 66 S. W. 3d 645 (2002), is unavailing, for that deci\u00ad sion nowhere addresses the issue here\u2014whether a jury can reconsider a greater offense after considering a lesser one. 608 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Opinion of the Court that point, nothing in the instructions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do: revisit a prior vote. \"The very object of the jury system,\" after all, \"is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the ju\u00adrors themselves.\" Allen, 164 U. S., at 501. A single juror's change of mind is all it takes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense. It was therefore possible for Blueford's jury to revisit the offenses of capital and rst-degree murder, notwithstanding its earlier votes. And because of that possibility, the fore\u00adperson's report prior to the end of deliberations lacked the nality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses, quite apart from any requirement that a formal verdict be returned or judgment entered. That same lack of nality undermines Blueford's reliance on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970). In those cases, we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when a defendant, tried for a greater offense and convicted of a lesser included offense, is later retried for the greater offense. See Green, supra, at 190; Price , supra, at 329. Blueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case from Green and Price is that his case involves a deadlock on the lesser in\u00adcluded offense, as opposed to a conviction. In his view, that distinction only favors him, because the Double Jeop\u00adardy Clause should, if anything, afford greater protection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the lesser included offense. Blueford's argument assumes, however, that the votes re\u00ad ported by the foreperson did not change, even though the jury deliberated further after that report. That assumption is unjustied, because the reported votes were, for the rea\u00adsons noted, not nal. Blueford thus overlooks the real dis\u00adtinction between the cases: In Green and Price , the verdict of the jury was a nal decision; here, the report of the fore\u00adperson was not.

S. 599 (2012) 609 Opinion of the Court B Blueford maintains that even if the jury did not acquit him of capital and rst-degree murder, a second trial on those offenses would nonetheless violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the trial court's declaration of a mistrial was improper. Blueford acknowledges that a trial can be discon\u00adtinued without barring a subsequent one for the same of\u00adfense when \"particular circumstances manifest a necessity\" to declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter , 336 U. S. 684, 690 (1949); see also United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824). He also acknowledges that the trial court's reason for declaring a mistrial here\u2014that the jury was unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been considered the \"classic basis\" establishing such a necessity. Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 509 (1978). Blueford therefore accepts that a sec\u00ad ond trial on manslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double jeopardy problem. He contends, however, that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and rst-degree murder, given the foreperson's report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges. Ac\u00adcording to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken \"some action,\" whether through partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges. Reply Brief 11, n. 8. We reject that suggestion. We have never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse\u2014 let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a ver\u00addict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. 766, 775 (2010). 2 As per\u00ad 2 Finding our reliance on Renico \"perplexing,\" the dissent reads that decision to have \"little to say about a trial judge's responsibilities, or this Court's, on direct review.\" Post, at 620-621, n. 4. But Renico's discus\u00ad sion of the applicable legal principles concerns just that, and the dissent in any event does not dispute that we have never required a trial court to consider any particular means of breaking a jury impasse. 610 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting mitted under Arkansas law, the jury's options in this case were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all. The instructions explained those options in plain terms, and the verdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome. There were separate forms to convict on each of the possible offenses, but there was only one form to acquit, and it was to acquit on all of them. When the fore\u00adperson disclosed the jury's votes on capital and rst-degree murder, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refus\u00ading to add another option\u2014that of acquitting on some of\u00adfenses but not others. That, however, is precisely the relief Blueford seeks\u2014relief the Double Jeopardy Clause does not afford him. * * * The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any of\u00ad fense, but it did not acquit him of any either. When the jury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a conse\u00adquence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is Afrmed. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. The Double Jeopardy Clause \"unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal.\" Arizona v. Washing\u00ad ton, 434 U. S. 497, 503 (1978). To implement this rule, our cases have articulated two principles. First, an acquittal oc\u00adcurs if a jury's decision, \"whatever its label, actually repre\u00adsents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571 (1977). Second, a trial judge may not defeat a defendant's entitlement to \"the ver\u00addict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 611 Sotomayor, J., dissenting to his fate\" by declaring a mistrial before deliberations end, absent a defendant's consent or a \" 'manifest necessity' \" to do so. United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 486, 481 (1971) (plurality opinion) (quoting United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824)). Today's decision misapplies these longstanding principles. The Court holds that petitioner Alex Blueford was not ac\u00adquitted of capital or rst-degree murder, even though the forewoman of the Arkansas jury empaneled to try him an\u00adnounced in open court that the jury was \"unanimous against\" convicting Blueford of those crimes. App. 64-65. Nor, the Court concludes, did the Double Jeopardy Clause oblige the trial judge to take any action to give effect to the jury's unambiguous decision before declaring a mistrial as to those offenses. The Court thus grants the State what the Consti\u00adtution withholds: \"the proverbial 'second bite at the apple.' \" Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 17 (1978). I respectfully dissent. I A The bar on retrials following acquittals is \"the most funda\u00ad mental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence.\" Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 571; see, e. g., United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 671 (1896); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentar\u00adies on the Laws of England 329 (1769). This prohibition stops the State, \"with all its resources and power,\" from mounting abusive, harassing reprosecutions, Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957), which subject a defendant to \"embarrassment, expense, anxiety, and insecurity, and the possibility that he may be found guilty even though innocent,\" United States v. DiFrancesco , 449 U. S. 117, 136 (1980). In ascertaining whether an acquittal has occurred, \"form is not to be exalted over substance.\" Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 66 (1978). Rather, we ask whether the 612 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting factnder has made \"a substantive determination that the prosecution has failed to carry its burden.\" Smith v. Massa\u00ad chusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 468 (2005). Jurisdictions have differ\u00adent procedures respecting the announcement of verdicts and the entry of judgments, but that diversity has no constitu\u00adtional signicance. Jeopardy terminates upon a determina\u00adtion, however characterized, that is to prove a defendant's \"factual guilt.\" Smalis v. Pennsylva\u00ad nia, 476 U. S. 140, 144 (1986). Thus, we have treated as ac\u00adquittals a trial judge's directed verdict of not guilty, Smith, 543 U. S., at 468; an appellate reversal of a conviction for insuf\u00ad ciency of the evidence, Burks, 437 U. S., at 10; and, most perti\u00ad nent here, a jury's announcement of a not guilty verdict that was \"not followed by any judgment,\" Ball, 163 U. S., at 671. A straightforward application of that principle sufces to decide this case. Arkansas is a classic \"acquittal-rst\" or \"hard-transition\" jurisdiction. See generally People v. Richardson, 184 P. 3d 755, 764, n. 7 (Colo. 2008). Arkansas' model jury instructions require a jury to complete its delib\u00aderations on a greater offense before it may consider a lesser. 1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d ed. 1994). As a matter of Arkansas law, \"[b]efore it may consider any lesser-included offense, the jury must rst determine that the proof is insufcient to convict on the greater offense. Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit the defendant of the greater offense before considering his or her guilt on the lesser-included offense.\" Hughes v. State , 347 Ark. 696, 706-707, 66 S. W. 3d 645, 651 (2002). 1 Here, the trial judge instructed Blueford's jury to consider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of capital murder to the lesser included offenses of rst-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. The judge told the 1 The State has taken the same position. See Brief for Appellee in Boyd v. State , No. CR 06-973 (Ark.), p. 13 (\"[U]nanimity is the essence of a jury verdict as it pertains to acquitting a defendant of the charged offense and the subsequent consideration of lesser-included offenses\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 613 Sotomayor, J., dissenting jury to proceed past capital murder only upon a unanimous nding of a \"reasonable doubt\" as to that offense\u2014that is, upon an acquittal. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 363 (1970). The State's closing arguments repeated this direc\u00adtive: \"[B]efore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder, you must rst, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\" App. 55. And the forewoman's collo\u00adquy with the judge leaves no doubt that the jury understood the instructions to mandate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman reported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide because the jurors \"couldn't get past the man\u00adslaughter\" count on which they were deadlocked. Id., at 65. In this context, the forewoman's announcement in open court that the jury was \"unanimous against\" conviction on capital and rst-degree murder, id., at 64-65, was an acquit\u00ad tal for double jeopardy purposes. 2 Per Arkansas law, the 2 The jury's acquittals on the murder counts were unsurprising in light of the deciencies in the State's case. For example, Dr. Adam Craig\u2014the medical examiner who autopsied the victim, Matthew McFadden, Jr., and whose testimony was essential to the State's theory of the crime\u2014was not board certied in anatomical pathology, having failed the certication examination ve times. Dr. Craig took only 2 slides of Matthew's brain, not the 10 to 20 called for by prevailing professional standards. He dis\u00admissed Blueford's explanation for Matthew's death\u2014that Blueford acciden\u00adtally knocked Matthew to the floor\u2014on the basis of an outdated paper on child head injuries, acknowledging that he was only \"vaguely aware\" of a more recent, seminal paper that supported Blueford's account. Record 390; see Goldsmith & Plunkett, A Biomechanical Analysis of the Causes of Traumatic Brain Injury in Infants and Children, 25 Am. J. Forensic Med. & Pathology 89 (2004). Blueford's expert pathologist, Dr. Robert Bux, testi\u00aded that Dr. Craig's autopsy was inadequate to establish whether Mat\u00adthew's death was accidental or intentional. And Blueford's expert pedia\u00adtrician, Dr. John Galaznik, testied that the State's theory\u2014that Blueford slammed Matthew into a mattress on the floor\u2014was \"not a likely cause\" of the boy's injuries when assessed in view of current medical literature. Record 766. Even the trial judge observed that the State's proof was \"circumstantial at best,\" and that this was \"probably . . . a lesser included offense case.\" Id., at 610. 614 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting jury's determination of reasonable doubt as to those offenses was an acquittal \"in essence.\" Hughes, 347 Ark., at 707, 66 S. W. 3d, at 651. By deciding that the State \"had failed to come forward with sufcient proof,\" the jury resolved the charges of capital and rst-degree murder adversely to the State. Burks, 437 U. S., at 10. That acquittal cannot be re\u00ad considered without putting Blueford twice in jeopardy. Green and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970), bolster that conclusion. In Green, the jury convicted the defendant on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder with\u00adout returning a verdict on the charged offense of rst-degree murder. This Court concluded that this result was an \"im\u00adplicit acquittal\" on the greater offense of rst-degree murder, barring retrial. 355 U. S., at 190. The defendant \"was forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given the choice between nding him guilty of either rst or second degree murder it chose the latter.\" Ibid.; see also Price , 398 U. S., at 329 (\"[T]his Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that ac\u00adquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser in\u00adcluded offense when the jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the greater charge\" (footnote omitted)). Notably, Green acknowledged that its nding of an \"implicit acquittal\" was an \"assumption,\" because the jury had made no express statement with respect to the greater offense. 355 U. S., at 190-191. Blueford's position is even stronger because his jury was not silent on the murder counts, but announced that it was \"unanimous against\" conviction. And the trial judge spe\u00adcically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter only after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts. Courts in several acquittal-rst jurisdictions have held that a jury's deadlock on a lesser included offense justies the assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater offenses. See State v. Tate , 256 Conn. 262, 283-285, 773 A. 2d 308, 323-324 (2001); Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 615 Sotomayor, J., dissenting Stone v. Superior Ct. of San Diego Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 503, 511- 512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d 809, 815, n. 5 (1982). That assumption is not even necessary here because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal. B The majority holds that the forewoman's announcement was not an acquittal because it \"was not a nal resolution of anything.\" Ante, at 606. In the majority's view, the jury might have revisited its decisions on the murder counts dur\u00ading the 31 minutes of deliberations that followed the fore\u00adwoman's announcement. We cannot know whether the jury did so, the majority reasons, because the jury was discharged without conrming that it remained \"unanimous against\" convicting Blueford of capital and first-degree murder. Ante, at 606-608. 3 Putting to one side the lack of record evidence to support this speculation\u2014by far the more plausible inference is that the jurors spent those 31 minutes attempting to resolve their deadlock on manslaughter\u2014I do not agree that the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when its deliberations re\u00adsumed. \"A verdict of acquittal on the issue of guilt or inno\u00adcence is, of course, absolutely nal.\" Bullington v. Mis\u00ad souri, 451 U. S. 430, 445 (1981). The jury heard instructions and argument that it was required unanimously to acquit on capital and rst-degree murder before it could reach man\u00ad 3 This Court granted certiorari to decide \"[w]hether, if a jury deadlocks on a lesser-included offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars reprosecu\u00ad tion of a greater offense after a jury announces that it has voted against guilt on the greater offense.\" Pet. for Cert. i. The majority resolves the question presented by determining that the forewoman's announcements were not nal, such that Blueford's jury did not necessarily deadlock on the lesser included offense of manslaughter. See ante, at 609, n. 2. In light of that determination, I do not read today's opinion to express any view with respect to the requirements of the Double Jeopardy Clause where a jury does deadlock on a lesser included offense. Cf., e. g., State v. Tate , 256 Conn. 262, 284-285, 773 P. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991). 616 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting slaughter. And as the forewoman's colloquy makes plain, the jury followed those instructions scrupulously. There is no reason to believe that the jury's vote was anything other than a verdict in substance\u2014that is, a \"nal collective deci\u00adsion . . . reached after full deliberation, consideration, and compromise among the individual jurors.\" Harrison v. Gil\u00ad lespie , 640 F. 3d 888, 906 (CA9 2011) (en banc). And when that decision was announced in open court, it became entitled to full double jeopardy protection. See, e. g., Common\u00ad wealth v. Roth, 437 Mass. 777, 796, 776 N. E. 2d 437, 450-451 (2002) (declining to give effect to \" ' \"the verdict received from the lips of the foreman in open court\" ' \" would \"elevate form over substance\"); Stone , 31 Cal. 3d, at 511, 646 P. 2d, at 814-815 (\"[I]n determining what verdict, if any, a jury in\u00adtended to return, the oral declaration of the jurors endorsing the result is the true return of the verdict\" (internal quota\u00adtion marks omitted)); see also, e. g., Dixon v. State , 29 Ark. 165, 171 (1874) (technical defect in verdict \"is of no conse\u00adquence whatever, for the verdict need not be in writing, but may be announced by the foreman of the jury orally\"); State v. Mills, 19 Ark. 476 (1858) (\"The verdict was of no validity until delivered, by the jury, in Court\"). The majority's example of a jury that takes a preliminary vote on greater offenses, advances to the consideration of a lesser, and then returns to a greater, is inapposite. See ante, at 607-608. In the majority's example, the jury has not announced its vote in open court. Moreover, the in\u00adstructions in this case did not contemplate that the jury's deliberations could take the course that the majority imag\u00adines. Arkansas' model instruction requires acquittal as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and the Dou\u00adble Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to nality. Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-rst instruction is to ensure care\u00adful and conclusive deliberation on a greater offense. See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340, 346 (CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-rst instruction avoids \"the danger Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 617 Sotomayor, J., dissenting that the jury will not adequately discharge its duties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will move too quickly to the lesser\"). True, Arkansas' instruction does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does not ex\u00adpressly permit reconsideration either. In any event, noth\u00ading indicates that the jury's announced decisions were tenta\u00adtive, compromises, or mere steps en route to a nal verdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant. See Downum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 738 (1963). The fact that the jury was not given the express option of acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant. See ante, at 603, 609-610. Arkansas law ascribes no signicance to the presence of such options on a verdict form. See Rowland v. State , 263 Ark. 77, 85, 562 S. W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (\"The jury may prepare and present its own form of verdict\"). The lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a judgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of an acquittal for constitutional purposes. See Hudson v. Louisiana, 450 U. S. 40, 41, n. 1 (1981). Finally, the majority's distinction of Green and Price is unavailing. The majority observes that Green and Price , unlike this case, involved nal decisions. Ante, at 608. As I have explained, I view the forewoman's announcements of acquittal in this case as similarly nal. In any event, Green claried that the defendant's \"claim of former jeopardy\" was \"not based on his previous conviction for second degree mur\u00adder but instead on the original jury's refusal to convict him of rst degree murder.\" 355 U. S., at 190, n. 11; accord, id., at 194, n. 14. That is, the jury's silence on the greater of\u00adfense spoke with sufcient clarity to justify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 191; see also Price , 398 U. S., at 329. In light of the fore\u00ad woman's announcement, this is an a fortiori case. In short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an inquiry into the substance of the jury's actions. Blueford's jury had 618 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting the option to convict him of capital and rst-degree murder, but expressly declined to do so. That ought to be the end of the matter. II A Even if the majority were correct that the jury might have reconsidered an acquitted count\u2014a doubtful assumption for the reasons just explained\u2014that would not defeat Blueford's double jeopardy claim. It \"has been long established as an integral part of double jeopardy jurisprudence\" that \"a de\u00adfendant could be put in jeopardy even in a prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an acquittal.\" Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 34 (1978). This rule evolved in response to the \" 'abhorrent' \" practice under the Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and thereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that the Crown's proof might be insufcient. Washington, 434 U. S., at 507-508; see, e. g., Ireland's Case , 7 How. St. Tr. 79, 120 (1678). Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is discharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant consents or there is a \"manifest necessity\" for the discharge. Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins, 90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698). In Perez, this Court explained that \"manifest necessity\" is a high bar: \"[T]he power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\" 9 Wheat., at 580. Since Perez, this Court has not relaxed the showing required. See, e. g., Washing\u00ad ton, 434 U. S., at 506 (requiring a \" 'high degree' \" of neces\u00adsity); Downum, 372 U. S., at 736 (\"imperious necessity\"); see also, e. g., United States v. Coolidge , 25 F. Cas. 622, 623 (No. 14,858) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.) (\"extraordinary and striking circumstances\"). Before declaring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh heavily a \"defendant's valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribu\u00adnal.\" Wade v. Hunter , 336 U. S. 684, 689 (1949). And in Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 619 Sotomayor, J., dissenting light of the historical abuses against which the Double Jeop\u00ad ardy Clause guards, a trial judge must tread with special care where a mistrial would \"help the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going badly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity to convict the accused.\" Gori v. United States, 367 U. S. 364, 369 (1961); see Green, 355 U. S., at 188. A jury's genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes manifest necessity. But in an acquittal-rst jurisdiction, a jury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included offense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a defend\u00ad ant's guilt or innocence on a greater\u2014it has acquitted on the greater. Under Green, that is unquestionably true if the jury convicts on the lesser. See id., at 189. It would be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered less protec\u00adtion to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked on the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all. See Stone , 31 Cal. 3d, at 511-512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d, at 815, n. 5. I would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires a trial judge, in an acquittal-rst jurisdiction, to honor a defendant's request for a partial verdict before de\u00adclaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock. Courts in acquittal-rst jurisdictions have so held. See, e. g., Tate , 256 Conn., at 285-287, 773 A. v. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991); Stone , 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P. 2d, at 820; State v. Pugliese (1980) (per v. 608, 611, 566 P. (1977); Law Ann. \u00a7 310.70 (West 2002). Requiring a partial verdict in an acquittal-rst jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction takes the bitter with the sweet. In general, an acquittal-rst instruction increases the likelihood of con\u00adviction on a greater offense. See People v. Boettcher , 69 N. Y . 2d 174, 182, 505 N. E. 2d 594, 597 (1987). True, such an instruction may also result in deadlock on a greater, pre\u00adventing a State \"from obtaining a conviction on the lesser 620 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting charge that would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus require the expense of a retrial.\" Tsanas, 572 F. 2d, at 346. But a State willing to incur that expense loses nothing by overcharging in an acquittal-rst regime. At worst, the State enjoys a second opportunity to convict, \"with the possi\u00adbility that the earlier 'trial run' will strengthen the prosecu\u00adtion's case.\" Crist, 437 U. S., at 52 (Powell, J., dissenting). If a State wants the benets of requiring a jury to acquit before compromising, it should not be permitted to deprive a defendant of the corresponding benets of having been acquitted. The Double Jeopardy Clause expressly prohibits that outcome. The majority observes that we \"have never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse\u2014 let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a ver\u00addict.\" Ante, at 609 (citing Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. 766, 775 (2010)). That hands-off approach dilutes Perez beyond rec\u00ad ognition. This Court has never excused a trial judge from exercising \"scrupulous\" care before discharging a jury. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality opinion). Rather, we have insisted that a trial judge may not act \"irrationally,\" \"irre\u00adsponsibly,\" or \"precipitately.\" Washington, 434 U. S., at 514-515. Nor have we retreated from the rule that \"re\u00adviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that . . . the trial judge exercised 'sound discretion' in declaring a mistrial.\" Id., at 514 (quoting Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580). 4 4 The majority's reliance on Renico , a habeas corpus case decided under the deferential standard of review prescribed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), is perplexing. As Renico made clear, the question there was \"not whether the trial judge should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it was an abuse of discre\u00adtion for her to have done so\u2014the applicable standard on direct review. The question under AEDPA is instead whether the determination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of discretion was 'an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law.' \" 559 U. S., at 772-773 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)); accord, 559 U. S., at 778, Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 621 Sotomayor, J., dissenting B Even if the Double Jeopardy Clause did not compel that broader rule, the facts of this case conrm that there was no necessity, let alone manifest necessity, for a mistrial. There was no reason for the judge not to have asked the jury, prior to discharge, whether it remained \"unanimous against\" con\u00adviction on capital and rst-degree murder. There would have been no intrusion on the jury's deliberative process. The judge was not required to issue new instructions or ver\u00addict forms, allow new arguments, direct further delibera\u00adtions, or take any other action that might have threatened to coerce the jury. Merely repeating his earlier question would have sufced. Because the judge failed to take even this modest step\u2014or indeed, to explore any alternatives to a mistrial, or even to make an on-the-record nding of manifest necessity\u2014I conclude that there was an abuse of discretion. See, e. g., Jorn, 400 U. S., at 486 (plurality opinion); see also Washington, 434 U. S., at 525 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (mani\u00adfest necessity requires showing \"that there were no mean\u00adingful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or that the trial court scrupulously considered available alternatives and found all wanting but a termination of the proceedings\"). Indeed, the only reason I can divine for the judge's failure to take this modest step is his misperception of Arkansas law with respect to the transitional instruction. After the colloquy with the forewoman, the judge commented at side\u00adbar that the jurors \"haven't even taken a vote on [negligent homicide]. . . . . I mean, under any reasonable circumstances, they would at least take a vote on negligent homicide.\" App. 65- 66. And after the jury retired for the last half hour of delib\u00ad erations, the judge said, \"I don't think they have an under- n. 3. Renico thus has little to say about a trial judge's responsibilities, or this Court's, on direct review. Cf. Cullen v. Pinholster , 563 U. S. 170, 202-203 (2011). 622 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS Sotomayor, J., dissenting standing of really that they don't have to get past every charge unanimously before they can move to the next charge.\" Id., at 69. That misstated Arkansas law as well as the judge's own instructions. The jury was required to reach a unanimous decision on a greater offense before con\u00adsidering a lesser. See supra, at 612. In discharging the jury, the judge said, \"Madam Foreman, there seems to be a lot of confusion on the part . . . of the jury about some of the instructions. And because of the confusion and because of the timeliness and the amount of hours that has gone by without being able to reach a verdict, the Court is going to declare a mistrial.\" App. 69-70. If, as these comments suggest, the judge wrongly believed that the jury was not required to reach unanimity on a greater offense before considering a lesser, then he accorded insufcient nality and weight to the forewoman's earlier an\u00adnouncement of acquittal on capital and rst-degree murder. That mistake of law negates the deference due the judge's decision to declare a mistrial. The judge explained that the jury was being discharged in part based on its \"confusion\" with respect to the instructions, when in fact, the confusion was the judge's. Ibid.; see, e. g., Washington, 434 U. S., at 510, n. 28 (\"If the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the 'sound discretion' entrusted to him, the reason for . . . deference by an appellate court disappears\"); Illinois v. Somerville , 410 U. S. 458, 469 (1973) (critiquing \"erratic\" mistrial inquiry); Gori, 367 U. S., at 371, n. 3 (Doug\u00ad las, J., dissenting) (noting that \"[i]n state cases, a second prosecution has been barred where the jury was discharged through the trial judge's misconstruction of the law,\" and collecting cases). And a trial court \"by denition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\" Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996). * * * At its core, the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the wis\u00ad dom of the founding generation, familiar to \" 'every person Cite as: 566 U. S. 599 (2012) 623 Sotomayor, J., dissenting acquainted with the history of governments,' \" that \" 'state trials have been employed as a formidable engine in the hands of a dominant administration. . . . To prevent this mis\u00adchief the ancient common law . . . provided that one acquittal or conviction should satisfy the law.' \" Ex parte Lange , 18 Wall. 163, 171 (1874) (quoting Commonwealth v. Olds, 15 Ky. 137, 139 (1824)). The Double Jeopardy Clause was enacted \" '[t]o perpetuate this wise rule, so favorable and necessary to the liberty of the citizen in a government like ours.' \" 18 Wall., at 171. This case demonstrates that the threat to in\u00addividual freedom from reprosecutions that favor States and unfairly rescue them from weak cases has not waned with time. Only this Court's vigilance has. I respectfully dissent. 624 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus FREEMAN et al. v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fth circuit No. 10-1042. Argued February 21, 2012\u2014Decided May 24, 2012 The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) provides, as relevant here, that \"[n]o person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service . . . other than for services actually performed.\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 2607(b). Petitioners, three couples who obtained mortgage loans from respondent, led separate state-court actions, alleging that respondent had violated \u00a7 2607(b) by charg\u00ading them fees for which no services were provided in return. After the cases were removed to federal court and consolidated, respondent sought summary judgment, arguing that petitioners' claims were not cognizable under \u00a7 2607(b) because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with another party. The District Court agreed; and because peti\u00adtioners had not alleged any splitting of fees, it granted respondent sum\u00admary judgment. The Fifth Circuit afrmed. Held: In order to establish a violation of \u00a7 2607(b), a plaintiff must demon\u00ad strate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons. Pp. 628-638. (a) Section 2607(b) unambiguously covers only a settlement-service provider's splitting of a fee with one or more other persons; it cannot be understood to reach a single provider's retention of an unearned fee. Pp. 628-635. (1) Section 2607(b) clearly describes two distinct exchanges. First, a \"charge\" is \"made\" to or \"received\" from a consumer by a settlement-service provider. That provider then \"give[s],\" and another person \"accept[s],\" a \"portion, split, or percentage\" of the charge. Con\u00adgress's use of different sets of verbs, with distinct tenses, to distinguish between the consumer-provider transaction and the fee-sharing one would be pointless if, as petitioners contend, the two transactions could be collapsed into one. Their reading\u2014that a settlement-service pro\u00advider can \"make\" a charge and then \"accept\" the portion of the charge consisting of 100 percent\u2014does not avoid collapsing the sequential rela\u00adtionship of the two stages and would destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two (i. e., a giving and accept\u00ad ing). And if the consumer were the person who \"give[s]\" a \"portion, Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 625 Syllabus split, or percentage\" of the charge to the provider who \"accept[s]\" it, consumers would become lawbreakers themselves. Pp. 628-633. (2) The normal usage of the terms \"portion,\" \"split,\" and \"percent\u00ad age\"\u2014which, when referring to a portion or percentage of a whole, usu\u00adally mean less than 100 percent\u2014reinforces the conclusion that \u00a7 2607(b) does not apply where a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer. The meaning is also conrmed by the \"commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis\u2014which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\" United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294. This connotation is not undermined by the canon against surplusage. \"Portion,\" \"split,\" and \"percentage\" may all mean the same thing, but the canon merely favors that interpretation which avoids surplusage, see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. 91, 106-107, and petitioners' interpretation no more achieves that end than the Court's does. Pp. 633-635. (b) Petitioners' arguments in favor of their contrary interpretation are unpersuasive. Section 2607(b), as interpreted here, is not rendered surplusage by \u00a7 2607(a)'s express prohibition of kickbacks, for each subsection reaches conduct that the other does not. RESPA's gen\u00aderal purpose\u2014to protect consumers from \"certain abusive provides no warrant for expanding \u00a7 2607(b)'s prohibition beyond the eld to which it is unambiguously limited: the splitting of fees paid for settlement services. And giving \u00a7 2607(b) its natural meaning would not lead to absurd results. Pp. 635-638. 626 F. 3d 799, afrmed. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Kevin K. Russell argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Thomas C. Goldstein, Amy Howe, Patrick W. Pendley, Stanley P . Baudin, Andr\u00e9 P . LaPlace, Pamela S. Karlan, and Jeffrey L.

S. 624 (2012) 627 Opinion of the Court include \"any service provided in connection with a real es\u00ad tate settlement,\" such as \"title searches, . . . title insurance, services rendered by an attorney, the preparation of docu\u00adments, property surveys, the rendering of credit reports or appraisals, . . . services rendered by a real estate agent or broker, the origination of a federally related mortgage loan [2] . . . , and the handling of closing or settle\u00adment.\" \u00a7 2602(3). Among RESPA's consumer-protection provisions is goal of \"eliminat[ing] . . . kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of certain set\u00adtlement services,\" \u00a7 2601(b)(2). Section 2607(a) provides: \"No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agree\u00adment or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be re\u00adferred to any person.\" The neighboring provision, subsection ( b), adds the following: \"No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or re\u00adceived for the rendering of a real estate settlement serv\u00adice in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.\" These substantive provisions are enforceable through, inter alia, actions for damages brought by consumers of settle\u00ad ment services against \"[a]ny person or persons who violate the prohibitions or limitations\" of \u00a7 2607, with recovery set at an amount equal to three times the charge paid by the plaintiff for the settlement service at issue. \u00a7 2607(d)(2). 2 The statutory denition of \"federally related mortgage loan\" is set forth in \u00a7 2602(1). 628 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court Petitioners in this case are three married couples who ob\u00ad tained mortgage loans from respondent Quicken Loans, Inc. In 2008, they led separate actions in Louisiana state court, alleging, as pertinent here, that respondent had violated \u00a7 2607(b) by charging them fees for which no services were provided. In particular, the Freemans and the Bennetts al\u00adlege that they were charged loan discount fees of $980 and $1,100, respectively, but that respondent did not give them lower interest rates in return. The Smiths' allegations focus on a $575 loan \"processing fee\" and a \"loan origination\" fee of more than $5,100. 3 Respondent removed petitioners' lawsuits to federal court, where the cases were consolidated. Respondent thereafter moved for summary judgment on the ground that petition\u00aders' claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 2607(b) because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with another party. The District Court agreed; and because petitioners did not allege any splitting of fees it granted summary judgment in favor of respondent. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit afrmed. 626 F. 3d 799 (2010). We granted certiorari. 565 U. S. 941 (2011). II The question in this case pertains to the scope of \u00a7 2607(b), which as we have said provides that \"[n]o person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real 3 Respondent maintains that at least the \"loan origination\" fee charged to the Smiths was in fact a mislabeled loan discount fee, like the allegedly unearned fees charged to the Freemans and the Bennetts. Respondent contends that loan discount fees fall outside the scope of \u00a7 2607(b) because they are not fees for settlement services, but rather, as the Eleventh Cir\u00adcuit has held, are part of the pricing of a loan. See Wooten v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 626 F. 3d 1187 (2010). Petitioners dispute this point on the merits and further argue that respondent forfeited the contention in the lower courts. We express no view on this issue. Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 629 Opinion of the Court estate settlement service . . . other than for services actually performed.\" The dispute between the parties boils down to whether this provision prohibits the collection of an un\u00adearned charge by a single settlement-service provider\u2014what we might call an undivided unearned fee\u2014or whether it cov\u00aders only transactions in which a provider shares a part of a settlement-service charge with one or more other persons who did nothing to earn that part. Petitioners' argument that the former interpretation should prevail nds support in a 2001 policy statement issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the agency that was until recently authorized by Congress to \"prescribe such rules and regulations\" and \"to make such interpretations\" as \"may be necessary to achieve the purposes of [RESPA],\" \u00a7 2617(a). 4 That policy state\u00ad ment says that \u00a7 2607(b) \"prohibit[s] any person from giving or accepting any unearned fees, i. e., charges or payments for real estate settlement services other than for goods or facili\u00adties provided or services performed.\" 66 Fed. Reg. 53057 (2001). It \"specically interprets [\u00a7 2607(b)] as not being limited to situations where at least two persons split or share an unearned fee.\" Ibid. More broadly, the policy state\u00ad ment construes \u00a7 2607(b) as authority for regulation of the charges paid by consumers for the provision of settlements. It says that \"a settlement service provider may not mark\u00adup the cost of another provider's services without providing additional settlement services; such payment must be for services that are actual, necessary and distinct.\" Id., at 4 On July 21, 2011, HUD's consumer-protection functions under RESPA were transferred to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1061(b)(7) and (d), 2103- 2104, 2113. That day, the Bureau issued a notice stating that it would enforce HUD's RESPA regulations and that, pending further Bureau ac\u00adtion, it would apply HUD's previously issued ofcial policy statements re\u00adgarding RESPA. 76 Fed. Reg. 43570-43571. 630 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court 53059. Moreover, in addition to facing liability when it col\u00ad lects a fee that is entirely unearned, a provider may also \"be liable under [\u00a7 2607(b)] when it charges a fee that exceeds the reasonable value of goods, facilities, or services pro\u00advided,\" ibid., on the theory that the excess over reasonable value constitutes a \"portion\" of the charge \"other than for services actually performed,\" \u00a7 2607(b). The last mentioned point, however, is manifestly inconsist\u00ad ent with the statute HUD purported to construe. When Congress enacted RESPA in 1974, it included a directive that HUD make a report to Congress within ve years regarding the need for further legislation in the area. See \u00a7 2612(a) (1976 ed.). Among the topics required to be included in the report were \"recommendations on whether Federal regula\u00adtion of the charges for real estate settlement services in federally related mortgage transactions is necessary and de\u00adsirable,\" and, if so, recommendations with regard to what reforms should be adopted. \u00a7 2612(b)(2). The directive for recommendations regarding the desirability of price regula\u00adtion would make no sense if Congress had already resolved the issue\u2014if \u00a7 2607(b) already carried with it authority for HUD to proscribe the collection of unreasonably high fees for settlement services, i. e., to engage in price regulation. No doubt recognizing as much, petitioners do not fully adopt HUD's construction of \u00a7 2607(b). Noting that even those Courts of Appeals which have found \u00a7 2607(b) not to be limited to fee-splitting situations have held that the stat\u00adute does not reach unreasonably high fees, see Kruse v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., 383 F. 3d 49, 56 (CA2 2004); Santiago v. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., 417 F. 3d 384, 387 (CA3 2005); Friedman v. Market Street Mortgage Corp., 520 F. 3d 1289, 1297 (CA11 2008), petitioners acknowledge that the statute does not cover overcharges. They nonetheless embrace HUD's construction of \u00a7 2607(b) insofar as it holds that a provider violates the statute by retaining a fee after providing no services at all in return. In short, petitioners Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 631 Opinion of the Court contend that, by allegedly charging each of them an un\u00ad earned fee, respondent \"accept[ed]\" a \"portion, split, or per\u00adcentage\" of a settlement-service charge (i. e., 100 percent of the charge) \"other than for services actually performed.\" \u00a7 2607(b) (2006 ed.). The parties vigorously dispute whether the position set forth in HUD's 2001 policy statement should be accorded deference under the framework announced by this Court in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\u00ad cil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). We need not resolve that dispute\u2014or address whether, if Chevron deference would otherwise apply, it is eliminated by the policy statement's palpable overreach with regard to price controls. For we conclude that even the more limited position espoused by the policy statement and urged by petitioners \"goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear,\" MCI Telecommunica\u00ad tions Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 229 (1994). In our view, \u00a7 2607(b) unambiguously covers only a settlement-service provider's splitting of a fee with one or more other persons; it cannot be understood to reach a single provider's retention of an unearned fee. 5 By providing that no person \"shall give\" or \"shall accept\" a \"portion, split, or \"charge\" that has been \"made or received,\" \"other than for services actually per\u00adformed,\" \u00a7 2607(b) clearly describes two distinct exchanges. First, a \"charge\" is \"made\" to or \"received\" from a consumer by a settlement-service provider. That provider then \"give[s],\" and another person \"accept[s],\" a \"portion, split, or percentage\" of the charge. Congress's use of different sets of verbs, with distinct tenses, to distinguish between the consumer-provider transaction (the \"charge\" that is \"made 5 Petitioners also contend that the position set forth in the 2001 policy statement is consistent with a HUD regulation, 24 CFR \u00a7 3500.14(c) (2011), and with prior administrative guidance. In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 2607(b) unambiguously forecloses petitioners' position, we have no need to address this issue. 632 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court or received\") and the fee-sharing transaction (the \"portion, split, or percentage\" that is \"give[n]\" or \"accept[ed]\") would be pointless if, as petitioners contend, the two transactions could be collapsed into one. Petitioners try to merge the two stages by arguing that a settlement-service provider can \"make\" a charge (stage one) and then \"accept\" (stage two) the portion of the charge con\u00adsisting of 100 percent. See Reply Brief 6. But then is not the provider also \"receiv[ing]\" the charge at the same time he is \"accept[ing]\" the portion of it? And who \"give[s]\" the portion of the charge consisting of 100 percent? The same provider who \"accept[s]\" it? This reading does not avoid collapsing the sequential relationship of the two stages, and it would simply destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two (i. e., a giving and accepting). Petitioners seek to avoid this consequence, at stage two at least, by saying that the consumer is the person who \"give[s]\" a \"portion, split, or percentage\" of the charge to the provider who \"accept[s]\" it. See Brief for Petitioners 21; Reply Brief 5. But since under this statute it is (so to speak) as accursed to give as to receive, this would make lawbreakers of consumers\u2014the very class for whose benet \u00a7 2607(b) was enacted, see \u00a7 2601. It is no answer to say that a consumer would not face damages liability because a violator is liable only \"to the person or persons charged for the settlement service,\" \u00a7 2607(d)(2), and it would not make sense to render a consumer liable to himself. It is the logi\u00ad cal consequence that a consumer would be liable to himself, not the specter of actual damages liability, which provides strong indication that something in petitioners' interpreta\u00adtion is amiss. At any rate, \u00a7 2607(b) is also enforceable through criminal prosecutions, \u00a7 2607(d)(1), and actions for injunctive relief brought by federal and state regulators, \u00a7 2607(d)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). HUD's 2001 policy statement asserts that Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 633 Opinion of the Court \"HUD is, of course, unlikely to direct any enforcement ac\u00ad tions against consumers for the payment of unearned fees,\" 66 Fed. Reg. 53059, n. 6, but that assurance is cold comfort. Moreover, even assuming (as seems realistic) that the Justice Department would be similarly reluctant to prosecute con\u00adsumers for criminal violations of \u00a7 2607(b), \"prosecutorial dis\u00adcretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to criminal statutes.\" Abuelhawa v. United States, 556 U. S. 816, 823, n. 3 (2009). Nor is the problem of consumer criminal liability solved by petitioners' suggestion that an unstated mens rea re\u00ad quirement be read into the criminal enforcement provision, \u00a7 2607(d)(1) (2006 ed.), see, e. g., Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994). If that would excuse only those con\u00ad sumers who are unaware that they are paying for unearned services, some consumers would remain criminally liable\u2014 those who know that the fee is unearned but decide to pay it anyway, perhaps because the provider's proposal is still the best deal. And if it would immunize all consumers, the statute's criminalization of the entire \"giving\" portion of consumer-provider transactions would make little sense. We nd it virtually unthinkable that Congress would leave it to imputed mens rea to preserve from criminal liability some or all of the class RESPA was designed to protect\u2014 and entirely unthinkable that Congress would have created that strange disposition through language as obscure as that relied upon here. The phrase \"portion, split, or percentage\" reinforces the conclusion that \u00a7 2607(b) does not cover a situation in which a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer. It is certainly true that \"por\u00adtion\" or \"percentage\" can be used to include the entirety, or 100 percent. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 648 (\"portion\"); 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 8348(g) (2006 Supp. IV) (\"percentag[e]\"); 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 8351(b)(2)(B) (2006 ed.) (same); 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1467a(m)(7) (B)(ii)(II) (same). But that is not the normal meaning of 634 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court \"portion\" when one speaks of \"giv[ing]\" or \"accept[ing]\" a portion of the whole, as dictionary denitions uniformly show. 6 Aesop's fable would be just as wryly humorous if the lion's claim to the entirety of the kill he hunted in partner\u00adship with less ferocious animals had been translated into English as the \"lion's portion\" instead of the lion's share. As for \"percentage,\" that word can include 100 percent\u2014or even 300 percent\u2014when it refers to merely a ratable meas\u00adure (\"unemployment claims were up 300 percent\"). 7 But, like \"portion,\" it normally means less than all when referring to a \"percentage\" of a specic whole (\"he demanded a per\u00adcentage of the prots\"). 8 And it is normal usage that, in the absence of contrary indication, governs our interpretation of texts. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. 271, 276 (2009); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer , 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995). In the present statute, that meaning is conrmed by the \"commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis\u2014which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring 6 See, e. g., Webster's New International Dictionary 1924 (2d ed. . .

Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 635 Opinion of the Court words with which it is associated.\" United States v. Wil\u00ad liams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008). For \"portion\" and \"percent\u00ad age\" do not stand in isolation, but are part of a phrase in which they are joined together by the intervening word \"split\"\u2014which, as petitioners acknowledge, Brief for Peti\u00adtioners 19, cannot possibly mean the entirety. We think it clear that, in employing the phrase \"portion, split, or per\u00adcentage,\" Congress sought to invoke the words' common \"core of meaning,\" Graham County Soil and Water Conser\u00ad vation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280, 289, n. 7 (2010), which is to say, a part of a whole. That is so even though the phrase is preceded by \"any\"\u2014a word that, we have observed, has an \" 'expansive meaning,' \" De\u00ad partment of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker , 535 U. S. 125, 131 (2002). Expansive, yes; transformative, no. It can broaden to the maximum, but never change in the least, the clear meaning of the phrase selected by Congress here. Contrary to petitioners' contention, the natural connota\u00ad tion of \"portion, split, or percentage\" is not undermined in this context by our \"general 'reluctan[ce] to treat statutory terms as surplusage.' \" Board of Trustees of Leland Stan\u00ad ford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563 U. S. 776, 788 (2011) (quoting Duncan v. Walker , 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001)). Petitioners rightly point out that under our interpretation \"portion,\" \"split,\" and \"percentage\" all mean the same thing\u2014a perhaps regrettable but not uncommon sort of lawyerly iteration (\"give, grant, bargain, sell, and con\u00advey\"). But the canon against surplusage merely favors that interpretation which avoids surplusage, see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U. S. 91, 106-107 (2011)\u2014and petitioners' interpretation no more achieves that end than ours does. It is impossible to imagine a \"portion\" (even a portion consisting of the entirety) or a \"split\" that is not also a \"percentage.\" Petitioners invoke the presumption against surplusage a second time, urging that if \u00a7 2607(b) is not construed to reach 636 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court undivided unearned fees, it would be rendered \"largely sur\u00ad plusage\" in light of \u00a7 2607(a)'s express prohibition of kick\u00adbacks. Brief for Petitioners 24. Not so. Section 2607(a) prohibits giving or accepting \"any fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding . . . that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service . . . shall be referred to any person.\" That prohibi\u00adtion is at once broader than \u00a7 2607(b)'s (because it applies to the transfer of any \"thing of value,\" rather than to the divid\u00ading of a \"charge\" paid by a consumer) and narrower (because it requires an \"agreement or understanding\" to refer busi\u00adness). Thus, a settlement-service provider who agrees to exchange valuable tickets to a sporting event in return for a referral of business would violate \u00a7 2607(a), but not \u00a7 2607(b). So too a provider who agrees to pay a monetary referral fee that is not tied in any respect to a charge paid by a particular consumer\u2014for instance, a \"retainer\" agreement pursuant to which the provider pays a monthly lump sum in exchange for the recipient's agreement to refer any business that comes his way. By contrast, a settlement-service provider who gives a portion of a charge to another person who has not rendered any services in return would violate \u00a7 2607(b), even if an express referral arrangement does not exist or cannot be shown. In short, each subsection reaches conduct that the other does not; there is no need to adopt petitioners' improbable reading of \u00a7 2607(b) to avoid rendering any por\u00adtion of \u00a7 2607 superfluous. It follows that petitioners can derive no support from \u00a7 2607's caption: \"Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.\" Subsection (a) prohibits certain kickbacks (those agreed to in exchange for referrals) and subsection (b) pro\u00adhibits certain unearned fees (those paid from a part of the charge to the customer). 9 9 The United States, as amicus curiae , raises an additional argument from the statutory context: that coverage of undivided unearned fees in \u00a7 2607(b) can be inferred from the text of \u00a7 2607(d), which sets out penalties Cite as: 566 U. S. 624 (2012) 637 Opinion of the Court Petitioners also appeal to statutory purpose, arguing that a prohibition against the charging of undivided unearned fees would t comfortably with RESPA's stated goal of \"in\u00adsur[ing] that consumers . . . are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive prac\u00adtices,\" \u00a7 2601(a). It bears noting that RESPA's declaration of purpose is by its terms limited to \"certain abusive prac\u00ad tices\"\u2014making the statute an even worse candidate than most for the expansion of limited text by the positing of an unlimited purpose. RESPA's particular language ultimately serves to drive home a broader point: \"[N]o legislation pur\u00adsues its purposes at all costs,\" Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525-526 (1987) (per curiam), and \"[e]very stat\u00ad ute purposes, not only to achieve certain ends, but also to achieve them by particular means,\" Director, Ofce of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Ship\u00ad building & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 136 (1995). Vague notions of statutory purpose provide no warrant for expand\u00ading \u00a7 2607(b)'s prohibition beyond the eld to which it is un\u00adambiguously limited: the splitting of fees paid for settle\u00adment services. Nor is there any merit to petitioners' related contention that \u00a7 2607(b) should not be given its natural meaning be\u00adcause doing so leads to the allegedly absurd result of permit- for the \"person or \u00a7 2607(b). \u00a7 2607(d)(1), (2), and (3) (emphasis added). But Congress's use of the singular \"person\" does not remotely establish that \u00a7 2607(b) can be violated by a single culpa\u00adble actor who accepts an unearned charge from a consumer. In fact, any such inference is negated by the history of \u00a7 2607. When RESPA was rst enacted, \u00a7 2607(d) separately provided for damages liability of \"any person or persons who violate the provisions of subsection (a)\" and of \"any person or persons who violate the provisions of subsection (b).\" \u00a7 2607(d)(2) (1976 ed.). Because \u00a7 2607(a), with its reference to an \"agree\u00adment or understanding,\" has always required two culpable parties for a violation, Congress's use of the phrase \"any person or persons\" in connec\u00adtion with that subsection demonstrates that the phrase does not have the signicance attributed to it by the United States. 638 FREEMAN v. QUICKEN LOANS, INC. Opinion of the Court ting a provider to charge and keep the entirety of a $1,000 unearned fee, while imposing liability if the provider shares even a nickel of a $10 charge with someone else. That result does not strike us as particularly anomalous. Congress may well have concluded that existing remedies, such as state-law fraud actions, were sufcient to deal with the problem of entirely ctitious fees, whereas legislative action was re\u00adquired to deal with the problems posed by kickbacks and fee splitting. In any event, petitioners' reading of the statute leads to an \"absurdity\" of its own: Because \u00a7 2607(b) manifestly can\u00adnot be understood to prohibit unreasonably high fees, see supra, at 630, a service provider could avoid liability by pro\u00ad viding just a dollar's worth of services in exchange for the $1,000 fee. Acknowledging that \u00a7 2607(b)'s coverage is lim\u00adited to fee-splitting transactions at least has the virtue of making it a coherent response to that particular problem, rather than an incoherent response to the broader problem of unreasonably high fees. * * * In order to establish a violation of \u00a7 2607(b), a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons. Because petitioners do not contend that respondent split the challenged charges with anyone else, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of respondent. We therefore afrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2011 639 Syllabus RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC, et al. v. AMALGAMATED BANK certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit No. 11-166. Argued April 23, 2012\u2014Decided May 29, 2012 To nance the purchase of a commercial property and associated renova\u00ad tion and construction costs, petitioners (debtors) obtained a secured loan from an investment fund, for which respondent (Bank) serves as trustee. The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and sought relief under Chap\u00adter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to conrm a \"cramdown\" bankruptcy plan over the Bank's objection. That plan proposed selling substantially all of the debtors' property at an auction, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank. Under the debtors' proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as \"credit\u00adbidding.\" The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors' request, conclud\u00ading that the auction procedures did not comply with \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)'s requirements for cramdown plans. The Seventh Circuit afrmed, hold\u00ad ing that \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid. Held: The debtors may not obtain conrmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank's lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale. Pp. 643-649. (a) A Chapter 11 plan proposed over the objection of a \"class of se\u00ad cured claims\" must meet one of three requirements in order to be deemed \"fair and equitable,\" and therefore conrmable. The secured creditor may retain its lien on the property and receive deferred cash payments, \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)(i); the debtors may sell the property free and clear of the lien, \"subject to section 363(k)\"\u2014which permits the creditor to credit-bid at the sale\u2014and provide the creditor with a lien on the sale proceeds, \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)(ii); or the plan may provide the secured creditor with the \"indubitable equivalent\" of its claim, \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)(iii). Here, the debtors proposed to sell their property free and clear of the Bank's liens and repay the Bank with the sale proceeds, as contemplated by clause (ii). Because the debtors' auction procedures do not permit the Bank to credit-bid, however, the proposed sale cannot satisfy the requirements of clause (ii). The debtors claim their plan can instead 640 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK Syllabus satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with the \"indubitable equiva\u00ad lent\" of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated by the auction. The debtors' reading of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), under which clause (iii) per\u00ad mits precisely what clause (ii) proscribes, is hyperliteral and contrary to common sense. \"[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specic governs the general.\" Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384. Here, where general and specic authorizations exist side by side, the general/specic canon avoids rendering superflu\u00adous a specic provision that is swallowed by the general one. See D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208. As applied to \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), the canon provides that the \"general language\" of clause (iii), \"although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specically dealt with\" in clause (ii). 285 U. S., at 208. Al\u00ad though the canon can be overcome by other textual indications of statu\u00adtory meaning, the debtors point to none here. Pp. 643-647. (b) None of the debtors' objections to this approach is valid. Pp. 647-649. 651 F. 3d 642, afrmed. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Mem\u00ad bers joined, except Kennedy, J., who took no part in the decision of the case. David M.

S. 639 (2012) 641 Opinion of the Court Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court. We consider whether a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan may be conrmed over the objection of a secured creditor pursu\u00ad ant to 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) if the plan provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the creditor's lien, but does not permit the creditor to \"credit-bid\" at the sale. I In 2007, petitioners RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC, and RadLAX Gateway Deck, LLC (hereinafter debtors), pur\u00adchased the Radisson Hotel at Los Angeles International Air\u00adport, together with an adjacent lot on which the debtors planned to build a parking structure. To nance the pur\u00adchase, the renovation of the hotel, and construction of the parking structure, the debtors obtained a $142 million loan from Longview Ultra Construction Loan Investment Fund, for which respondent Amalgamated Bank (hereinafter credi\u00adtor or Bank) serves as trustee. The lenders obtained a blan\u00adket lien on all of the debtors' assets to secure the loan. Completing the parking structure proved more expensive than anticipated, and within two years the debtors had run out of funds and were forced to halt construction. By Au\u00adgust 2009, they owed more than $120 million on the loan, with over $1 million in interest accruing every month and no prospect for obtaining additional funds to complete the proj\u00adect. Both debtors led voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy is implemented according to a \"plan,\" typically proposed by the debtor, which divides claims against the debtor into separate \"classes\" and speci\u00ades the treatment each class will receive. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1123. Generally, a bankruptcy court may conrm a Chap\u00adter 11 plan only if each class of creditors affected by the plan consents. See \u00a7 1129(a)(8). Section 1129(b) creates an exception to that general rule, permitting conrmation of nonconsensual plans\u2014commonly known as \"cramdown\" 642 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK Opinion of the Court plans\u2014if \"the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or inter\u00adests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.\" Section 1129(b)(2)(A), which we review in further depth below, establishes criteria for determining whether a cram-down plan is \"fair and equitable\" with respect to secured claims like the Bank's. In 2010, the RadLAX debtors submitted a Chapter 11 plan to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plan proposed to dissolve the debt\u00adors and to sell substantially all of their assets pursuant to procedures set out in a contemporaneously led \"Sale and Bid Procedures Motion.\" Specically, the debtors sought to auction their assets to the highest bidder, with the initial bid submitted by a \"stalking horse\"\u2014a potential purchaser who was willing to make an advance bid of $47.5 million. 1 The sale proceeds would be used to fund the plan, primarily by repaying the Bank. Of course the Bank itself might wish to obtain the property if the alternative would be receiving auction proceeds that fall short of the property's full value. Under the debtors' proposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as \"credit-bidding.\" Instead, the Bank would be forced to bid cash. Correctly anticipating that the Bank would object to this arrangement, the debtors sought to conrm their plan under the cramdown provisions of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A). The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors' Sale and Bid Procedures Motion, concluding that the proposed auction procedures did not comply with \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)'s require\u00adments for cramdown plans. In re River Road Hotel Part\u00ad ners, LLC , Case No. 09 B 30029 (ND Ill., Oct. 5, 2010), App. 1 In a later proposal, the stalking-horse bid increased to $55 million. The precise amount of the bid is not relevant here. Cite as: 566 U. S. 639 (2012) 643 Opinion of the Court to Pet. for Cert. 40a. The Bankruptcy Court certied an appeal directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That court accepted the certication and afrmed, holding that \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid. River Road Hotel Partners, LLC, et al. v. Amalgamated Bank, 651 F. 3d 642 (2011). We granted certiorari. 565 U. S. 1092 (2011). II A A Chapter 11 plan conrmed over the objection of a \"class of secured claims\" must meet one of three requirements in order to be deemed \"fair and equitable\" with respect to the nonconsenting creditor's claim. The plan must provide: \"(i)(I) that the holders of such claims retain the liens securing such claims, whether the property subject to such liens is retained by the debtor or transferred to another entity, to the extent of the allowed amount of such claims; and (II) that each holder of a claim of such class receive on account of such claim deferred cash pay\u00adments totaling at least the allowed amount of such claim, of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, of at least the value of such holder's interest in the estate's interest in such property; \"(ii) for the sale, subject to section 363(k) of this title, of any property that is subject to the liens securing such claims, free and clear of such liens, with such liens to attach to the proceeds of such sale, and the treatment of such liens on proceeds under clause (i) or (iii) of this subparagraph; or \"(iii) for the realization by such holders of the indubitable equivalent of such claims.\" 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A). Under clause (i), the secured creditor retains its lien on the property and receives deferred cash payments. Under 644 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK Opinion of the Court clause (ii), the property is sold free and clear of the lien, \"subject to section 363(k),\" and the creditor receives a lien on the proceeds of the sale. Section 363(k), in turn, pro\u00advides that \"unless the court for cause orders otherwise the holder of such claim may bid at such sale, and, if the holder of such claim purchases such property, such holder may offset such claim against the purchase price of such property\"\u2014 i. e., the creditor may credit-bid at the sale, up to the amount of its claim. 2 Finally, under clause (iii), the plan provides the secured creditor with the \"indubitable equivalent\" of its claim. The debtors in this case have proposed to sell their prop\u00ad erty free and clear of the Bank's liens, and to repay the Bank using the sale proceeds\u2014precisely, it would seem, the dispo\u00adsition contemplated by clause (ii). Yet since the debtors' proposed auction procedures do not permit the Bank to credit-bid, the proposed sale cannot satisfy the requirements of clause (ii). 3 Recognizing this problem, the debtors in\u00ad stead seek plan conrmation pursuant to clause (iii), which\u2014 unlike clause (ii)\u2014does not expressly foreclose the possibility of a sale without credit-bidding. According to the debtors, their plan can satisfy clause (iii) by ultimately providing the Bank with the \"indubitable equivalent\" of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated by the auction. 2 The ability to credit-bid helps to protect a creditor against the risk that its collateral will be sold at a depressed price. It enables the creditor to purchase the collateral for what it considers the fair market price (up to the amount of its security interest) without committing additional cash to protect the loan. That right is particularly important for the Federal Government, which is frequently a secured creditor in bankruptcy and which often lacks appropriations authority to throw good money after bad in a cash-only bankruptcy auction. 3 Title 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 363(k)\u2014and by extension clause (ii)\u2014provides an ex\u00ad ception to the credit-bidding requirement if \"the court for cause orders otherwise.\" The Bankruptcy Court found that there was no \"cause\" to deny credit-bidding in this case, and the debtors have not appealed that disposition. Cite as: 566 U. S. 639 (2012) 645 Opinion of the Court We nd the debtors' reading of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)\u2014under which clause (iii) permits precisely what clause (ii) pro\u00ad scribes\u2014to be hyperliteral and contrary to common sense. A well established canon of statutory interpretation suc\u00adcinctly captures the problem: \"[I]t is a commonplace of statu\u00adtory construction that the specic governs the general.\" Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384 (1992). That is particularly true where, as in \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), \"Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has de\u00adliberately targeted specic problems with specic solutions.\" Varity Corp. v. Howe , 516 U. S. 489, 519 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also HCSC-Laundry v. United States, 450 U. S. 1, 6 (1981) (per curiam) (the specic governs the gen\u00ad eral \"particularly when the two are interrelated and closely positioned, both in fact being parts of [the same statutory scheme]\"). The general/specic canon is perhaps most frequently ap\u00ad plied to statutes in which a general permission or prohibition is contradicted by a specic prohibition or permission. To eliminate the contradiction, the specic provision is con\u00adstrued as an exception to the general one. See, e. g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550-551 (1974). But the canon has full application as well to statutes such as the one here, in which a general authorization and a more limited, specic authorization exist side by side. There the canon avoids not contradiction but the superfluity of a specic provision that is swallowed by the general one, \"violat[ing] the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall be given to every clause and part of a statute.\" D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). The terms of the specic authorization must be complied with. For example, in the last cited case a provision of the Bankruptcy Act prescribed in great detail the procedures governing the arrest and detention of bank\u00adrupts about to leave the district in order to avoid examina\u00adtion. The Court held that those prescriptions could not be avoided by relying upon a general provision of the Act au\u00ad646 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK Opinion of the Court thorizing bankruptcy courts to \" 'make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those specically provided for as may be necessary for the enforce\u00adment of the provisions of [the] Act.' \" Id., at 206 (quoting Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \u00a7 2(15), 30 Stat. 546). The Court said that \"[g]eneral language of a statutory provision, al\u00adthough broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.\" 285 U. S., at 208. We recently quoted that language approvingly in Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S. 196, 207 (2010). Or as we said in a much earlier case: \"It is an old and familiar rule that, where there is, in the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense, would in\u00adclude what is embraced in the former, the particular en\u00adactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its gen\u00aderal language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment. This rule applies wherever an act contains general provisions and also special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the general provi\u00adsions would include.\" United States v. Chase , 135 U. S. 255, 260 (1890) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, clause (ii) is a detailed provision that spells out the requirements for selling collateral free of liens, while clause (iii) is a broadly worded provision that says nothing about such a sale. The general/specic canon explains that the \"general language\" of clause (iii), \"although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specically dealt with\" in clause (ii). D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc., supra, at 208. Of course the general/specic canon is not an absolute rule, but is merely a strong indication of statutory meaning that can be overcome by textual indications that point in the Cite as: 566 U. S. 639 (2012) 647 Opinion of the Court other direction. The debtors point to no such indication here. One can conceive of a statutory scheme in which the specic provision embraced within a general one is not su\u00adperfluous, because it creates a so-called safe harbor. The debtors effectively contend that that is the case here\u2014clause (iii) (\"indubitable equivalent\") being the general rule, and clauses (i) and (ii) setting forth procedures that will always, ipso facto , establish an \"indubitable equivalent,\" with no need for judicial evaluation. But the structure here would be a surpassingly strange manner of accomplishing that result\u2014which would normally be achieved by setting forth the \"indubitable equivalent\" rule rst (rather than last), and establishing the two safe harbors as provisos to that rule. The structure here suggests, to the contrary, that (i) is the rule for plans under which the creditor's lien remains on the property, (ii) is the rule for plans under which the property is sold free and clear of the creditor's lien, and (iii) is a residual provision covering dispositions under all other plans\u2014for example, one under which the creditor receives the property itself, the \"indubitable equivalent\" of its secured claim. Thus, debtors may not sell their property free of liens under \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) without allowing lienholders to credit-bid, as required by clause (ii). B None of the debtors' objections to this approach is valid. The debtors' principal textual argument is that \u00a7 1129(b) (2)(A) \"unambiguously provides three distinct options for conrming a Chapter 11 plan over the objection of a secured creditor.\" Brief for Petitioners 15 (capitalization and bold typeface removed). With that much we agree; the three clauses of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) are connected by the disjunctive \"or.\" The debtors contend that our interpretation of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) \"transforms 'or' into 'and.' \" Reply Brief for Petitioners 3. But that is not so. The question here is not whether debtors must comply with more than one clause, but rather which one of the three they must satisfy. Debtors 648 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK Opinion of the Court seeking to sell their property free of liens under \u00a7 1129(b) (2)(A) must satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), not the requirements of both clauses (ii) and (iii). The debtors make several arguments against applying the general/specic canon. They contend that clause (ii) is no more specic than clause (iii), because the former provides a procedural protection to secured creditors (credit-bidding) while the latter provides a substantive protection (indubita\u00adble equivalence). As a result, they say, clause (ii) is not \"a limiting subset\" of clause (iii), which (according to their view) application of the general/specic canon requires. Brief for Petitioners 30-31; Reply Brief for Petitioners 5-6. To begin with, we know of no authority for the proposition that the canon is conned to situations in which the entirety of the specic provision is a \"subset\" of the general one. When the conduct at issue falls within the scope of both provisions, the specic presumptively governs, whether or not the spe\u00adcic provision also applies to some conduct that falls outside the general. In any case, we think clause (ii) is entirely a subset. Clause (iii) applies to all cramdown plans, which include all of the plans within the more narrow category de\u00adscribed in clause (ii). 4 That its requirements are \"substan\u00ad tive\" whereas clause (ii)'s are \"procedural\" is quite beside the point. What counts for application of the general/spe\u00adcic canon is not the nature of the provisions' prescriptions but their scope. Finally, the debtors contend that the Court of Appeals con\u00ad flated approval of bid procedures with plan conrmation. Brief for Petitioners 39. They claim the right to pursue their auction now, leaving it for the Bankruptcy Judge to determine, at the conrmation stage, whether the resulting 4 We are speaking here about whether clause (ii) is a subset for purposes of determining whether the canon applies. As we have described earlier, after applying the canon\u2014ex post, so to speak\u2014it ceases to be a subset, governing a situation to which clause (iii) will no longer be deemed applicable. Cite as: 566 U. S. 639 (2012) 649 Opinion of the Court plan (funded by auction proceeds) provides the Bank with the \"indubitable equivalent\" of its secured claim. Under our interpretation of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), however, that approach is simply a nonstarter. As a matter of law, no bid procedures like the ones proposed here could satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), and the distinction between approval of bid procedures and plan conrmation is therefore irrelevant. III The parties debate at some length the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, pre-Code practices, and the merits of credit-bidding. To varying extents, some of those debates also occupied the attention of the Courts of Appeals that considered the question presented here. See, e. g., In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC , 599 F. 3d 298, 314-317 (CA3 2010); id., at 331-337 (Ambro, J., dissenting). But nothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting secured creditors can overcome the specic manner of that protection which the text of \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A) contains. As for pre-Code practices, they can be relevant to the interpretation of an ambiguous text, but we nd no textual ambiguity here. And the pros and cons of credit-bidding are for the consider\u00adation of Congress, not the courts. The Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and sometimes unruly) area of law, and it is our obligation to interpret the Code clearly and predictably using well estab\u00adlished principles of statutory construction. See United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 240-241 (1989). Under that approach, this is an easy case. Because the RadLAX debtors may not obtain conrmation of a Chap\u00adter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank's lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale, we afrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. It is so ordered. Justice Kennedy took no part in the decision of this case. 650 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus COLEMAN, SUPERINTENDENT, STATE COR\u00ad RECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT FAYETTE, et al. v. JOHNSON on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 11-1053. Decided May 29, 2012 Respondent Johnson was convicted by a Pennsylvania jury as an accom\u00ad plice and co-conspirator to murder. After unsuccessfully pressing an insufciency-of-evidence claim on direct appeal and in state postconvic\u00adtion proceedings, Johnson sought federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court denied Johnson's claims, but the Third Circuit reversed and ordered his conviction overturned, holding that the evidence at trial was insufcient to support his conviction under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307. Held: The Third Circuit did not afford due deference to the role of the jury and the Pennsylvania courts in sustaining Johnson's due process challenge. In federal habeas proceedings, Jackson claims are sub\u00ad ject to two layers of judicial deference: First, on direct appeal, a re\u00adviewing court may set aside the jury's verdict on insufciency grounds \"only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury,\" Ca\u00ad vazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, 2; and second, on habeas review, a fed\u00ad eral court may overturn the state court's decision \"only if [it] was 'objectively unreasonable,' \" ibid. Jackson leaves juries with broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence pre\u00adsented at trial, and the deferential federal standard does not permit the Third Circuit's ne-grained fact parsing. Here, the trial testimony convinced the jury that Johnson knew that his co-conspirator was armed and intended to kill the victim and that Johnson helped to usher the victim into an alley to meet his fate. The only question under Jack\u00ad son is whether that nding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable defer\u00adence under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). Once due respect is afforded to the role of the jury and the state courts, the evidence at Johnson's trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson. Certiorari granted; 446 Fed. Appx. 531, reversed and remanded. Cite as: 566 U. S. 650 (2012) 651 Per Curiam Per Curiam. Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an ac\u00ad complice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Wil\u00ad liams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in the early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was afrmed in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court de\u00ad nied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence at trial was insufcient to support Johnson's conviction under the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, \"it is the responsibility of the jury\u2014not the court\u2014to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury's verdict on the ground of insufcient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.\" Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, 2 (2011) (per curiam). And second, on habeas re\u00ad view, \"a federal court may not overturn a state court deci\u00adsion rejecting a sufciency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was 'objectively unreasonable.' \" Ibid. (quoting Re\u00ad nico v. Lett, 559 U. S. 766, 773 (2010)). Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania, we now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below. * * * 652 COLEMAN v. JOHNSON Per Curiam The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed by Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of rst- degree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of the crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was charged as an accomplice and co-conspirator. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2502 (2008) (im\u00adposing accomplice liability for anyone who, \"with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense . . . aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in plan\u00adning or committing it\"); Commonwealth v. Montalvo , 598 Pa. 263, 274, 956 A. 2d 926, 932 (2008) (criminal conspiracy liabil\u00ad ity for anyone who takes an overt act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or commit). At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who testied that she, Johnson, and Walker were \"close friends\" who \"ran the streets together.\" Tr. 213. On the morning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the same resi\u00addence, bought marijuana, and then went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to \"holler at\" Williams about a debt Williams owed. Id., at 217. According to Doubs, Walker and Williams \"were talking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,\" with Walker \"asking [Wil\u00adliams], confronting him, about his money and what's up with the money and why is it taking you so long to give us the money.\" Id., at 217-218. Williams was \"cussing [Walker] out, telling him he'd give it to him when he felt like it and he ain't scared of [Walker].\" Id., at 218. A ght ensued, which ended when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front of the crowd of people that had gathered. After the ght, Doubs testied, Walker \"was mad, because he got beat by a crackhead. . . . He was saying, yo, that crackhead beat me. I'm going to kill that crackhead. I'm going to kill that kid. . . . He was hot. He was heated.\" Id., at 220-221. Johnson was present when Walker made these Cite as: 566 U. S. 650 (2012) 653 Per Curiam statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted the beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Walker \"re\u00adpeated it for a while that I'm going to kill that kid. That kid must think I'm some type of joke. I'm going to kill that kid. Who he think he is[?]\" Id., at 222. Once again, John\u00ad son was present for these statements. Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim, who testied that she was at the Midnight Special Bar on the night of December 14-15, where she saw Walker, John\u00adson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument. Although she could not hear what they were saying, she could tell they were arguing because they were making \"a lot of arm movements.\" Id., at 104. The bouncer soon told them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street because she \"wanted to know what was going on.\" Ibid. Brown ob\u00ad served the three men walking in a single-le line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and Johnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it. Brown fol\u00adlowed the three men to an alleyway, at which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to \"go ahead\" and pass. Id., at 107. Walker then entered the alleyway, followed by Wil\u00adliams, while Johnson remained standing at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley, she heard a loud \"boom,\" caus\u00ading her to run away. Id., at 143. On cross-examination, Brown stated: \"[T]hey walked [Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He walked him in the alley. I heard a boom.\" Ibid. The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testied that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at 12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15. He heard a loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes fleeing. After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey, who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at the time of the murder. He testied that he saw Williams walk\u00ad654 COLEMAN v. JOHNSON Per Curiam ing toward an alleyway with two males and a female, and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered the alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated: \"I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.\" Id., at 189. The jury also heard testimony from police who searched the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun with the barrel missing. A medical examiner who examined Wil\u00adliams' body testied that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest. After the jury convicted Johnson, he led a post-trial mo\u00ad tion arguing that the evidence was insufcient to support his conviction. The court denied his motion, and the Pennsylva\u00adnia Superior Court afrmed the conviction on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726 A. 2d 1079 (1998). After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully sought state postconvic\u00adtion relief. He then led a habeas petition in Federal Dis\u00adtrict Court, which denied his claims. See Johnson v. Mech\u00ad ling, 541 F. Supp. 2d 651 (MD Pa. 2008). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third Circuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his conviction overturned. Under Jackson, evidence is sufcient to support a convic\u00ad tion if, \"after viewing the evidence in the light most favor\u00adable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reason\u00adable doubt.\" 443 U. S., at 319. In light of the testimony at Johnson's trial, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \"[a] trier of fact could reasonably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.\" Johnson v. Mech\u00ad ling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for the notion that \"Johnson shared Walker's intent to kill Williams,\" how\u00adever, the court concluded that was \"mere speculation\" that no rational factnder could accept as true. Ibid. The court stated that \"a reasonable inference is one where the fact inferred is 'more likely than not to flow from the proved fact Cite as: 566 U. S. 650 (2012) 655 Per Curiam on which it is made to depend.' \" Id., at 539-540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland, 452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A. 2d 592, 594 (1973)). In order for a jury's inferences to be per\u00ad missible, the court reasoned, they must \" 'flow from facts and circumstances proven in the record' \" that are \" 'of such vol\u00adume and quality as to overcome the presumption of inno\u00adcence.' \" 446 Fed. Appx., at 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A. 2d 543, 560 (Pa. Super. 2008)). At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what distinguishes a reasoned inference from \"mere speculation.\" Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state law for \"the substantive elements of the criminal offense,\" 443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law. Under the deferential federal standard, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it unduly impinged on the jury's role as factnder. Jackson leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring only that ju\u00adrors \"draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\" Id., at 319. This deferential standard does not per\u00ad mit the type of ne-grained factual parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey's testimony that Williams was \"walked\" and \"forced\" into the alleyway, the court objected that the witnesses did not describe any \"physical action\" supporting the conclusion that force was used. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testimony that \"Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented him from leaving it,\" ibid., the court could see no reasonable basis for the jury's conclusion that Johnson had a specic intent to help kill Williams. That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coer\u00ad cive nature of Johnson and Walker's behavior could be in\u00ad656 COLEMAN v. JOHNSON Per Curiam ferred from other circumstances not involving the direct use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon, and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams after a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-le line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that Johnson may have been pre\u00adpared to prevent Williams from fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the murder. Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker \"ran the streets together,\" and had attempted to collect a debt from Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams re\u00adsisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in the process by giving him a public thrashing with a broomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson's presence that he in\u00adtended to kill Williams. Then, while Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley, where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest. On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The jury in this case was convinced, and the only question under Jackson is whether that nding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson's trial was Cite as: 566 U. S. 650 (2012) 657 Per Curiam not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufcient to convict John\u00ad son as an accomplice and a co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth's petition for certio\u00adrari and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro\u00adceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 658 OCTOBER TERM, 2011 Syllabus REICHLE et al. v. HOWARDS certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 11-262. Argued March 21, 2012\u2014Decided June 4, 2012 Petitioners Reichle and Doyle were members of a Secret Service detail protecting Vice President Richard Cheney while he greeted members of the public at a shopping mall. Agent Doyle overheard respondent Howards, who was speaking into his cell phone, state that he \"was going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he's killed today.\" Doyle and other agents observed Howards enter the line to meet the Vice President, tell the Vice President that his \"policies in Iraq are disgust\u00ading,\" and touch the Vice President's shoulder as the Vice President was leaving. After being briefed by Doyle, Agent Reichle interviewed and then arrested Howards, who was charged with harassment. After that charge was dismissed, Howards brought an action against petitioners and others under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388. Howards claimed that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amend\u00adment, and that the arrest violated the First Amendment because it was made in retaliation for Howards' criticism of the Vice President. Peti\u00adtioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualied immunity, but the Federal District Court denied the motion. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the Fourth Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards, but the court afrmed with regard to the First Amendment claim. In doing so, the court rejected petition\u00aders' argument that, under Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250, probable cause to arrest defeats a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. It concluded instead that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory arrest violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable cause. Held: Petitioners are entitled to qualied immunity because, at the time of Howards' arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a First Amendment vio\u00adlation. Pp. 664670. (a) Courts may grant qualied immunity on the ground that a pur\u00ad ported right was not \"clearly established\" by prior case law. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. To be clearly established, a right must Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 659 Syllabus be \"that every 'reasonable ofcial would [have under\u00ad stood] that what he is doing violates that right.' \" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 741. 664665. (b) The \"clearly established\" standard is not satised here. This Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause; nor was such a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards' ar\u00adrest. P. 665. (c) At that time, Hartman's impact on the Tenth Circuit's precedent was far from clear. Although Hartman's facts involved only a retalia\u00ad tory prosecution, reasonable law enforcement ofcers could have ques\u00adtioned whether its rule also applied to arrests. First, Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly. It resolved a Circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory prosecution claims, but some of the conflicting cases involved both retaliatory prose\u00adcution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no distinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable cause. Second, a reasonable ofcial could have interpreted Hartman's rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Like in retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be avail\u00adable in virtually all retaliatory arrest cases, and the causal link between the defendant's alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff's injury may be tenuous. Finally, decisions from other Circuits in the wake of Hart\u00ad man support the conclusion that, for qualied immunity purposes, it was at least arguable at the time of Howards' arrest that Hartman extended to retaliatory arrests. Pp. 665670. 634 F. 3d 1131, reversed and remanded. Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

This case requires us to decide whether two federal law enforcement agents are immune from suit for allegedly ar\u00adresting a suspect in retaliation for his political speech, when the agents had probable cause to arrest the suspect for com\u00admitting a federal crime. I On June 16, 2006, Vice President Richard Cheney visited a shopping mall in Beaver Creek, Colorado. A Secret Service protective detail accompanied the Vice President. Petition\u00aders Gus Reichle and Dan Doyle were members of that detail. Respondent Steven Howards was also at the mall. He was engaged in a cell phone conversation when he noticed the Vice President greeting members of the public. Agent Doyle overheard Howards say, during this conversation, \" 'I'm going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he's killed today.' \" Brief for Petitioners 4. Agent Doyle told two other agents what he had heard, and the three of them began monitoring Howards more closely. Agent Doyle watched Howards enter the line to meet the Vice President. When Howards approached the Vice Presi\u00ad *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were led for the FBI Agents Association et al. by J. Brett Busby, E. Dee Martin, and Joshua C.

Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 661 Opinion of the Court dent, he told him that his \" 'policies in Iraq are disgusting.' \" Ibid. The Vice President simply thanked Howards and moved along, but Howards touched the Vice President's shoulder as the Vice President departed. 1 Howards then walked away. Several agents observed Howards' encounter with the Vice President. The agents determined that Agent Reichle, who coordinated the protective intelligence team responsible for interviewing individuals suspected of violating the law, should question Howards. Agent Reichle had not person\u00adally heard Howards' comments or seen his contact with the Vice President, but Agent Doyle briefed Agent Reichle on what had happened. Agent Reichle approached Howards, presented his badge and identied himself, and asked to speak with him. How\u00adards refused and attempted to walk away. At that point, Agent Reichle stepped in front of Howards and asked if he had assaulted the Vice President. Pointing his nger at Agent Reichle, Howards denied assaulting the Vice Presi\u00addent and told Agent Reichle, \"if you don't want other people sharing their opinions, you should have him [the Vice Presi\u00addent] avoid public places.\" Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1137 (CA10 2011) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad ted). During this exchange, Agent Reichle also asked How\u00adards whether he had touched the Vice President. Howards falsely denied doing so. After conrming that Agent Doyle had indeed seen Howards touch the Vice President, Reichle arrested Howards. The Secret Service transferred Howards to the custody of the local sheriff's department. Howards was charged by local ofcials with harassment in violation of state law. The charge was eventually dismissed. 1 The parties dispute the manner of the touch. Howards described it as an openhanded pat, while several Secret Service agents described it as a forceful push. This dispute does not affect our analysis. 662 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Opinion of the Court II Howards brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).2 Howards alleged that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Howards also alleged that he was arrested in retaliation for criticizing the Vice President, in violation of the First Amendment. Petitioners Reichle and Doyle moved for summary judg\u00ad ment on the ground that they were entitled to qualied im\u00admunity. The District Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 46-61. On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit afrmed in part and reversed in part. 634 F. 3d 1131. The Court of Appeals held that petitioners enjoyed quali\u00ad ed immunity with respect to Howards' Fourth Amendment claim. The court concluded that petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards for making a materially false state\u00adment to a federal ofcial in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1001 because he falsely denied touching the Vice President. 634 F. 3d, at 1142. Thus, the court concluded that neither How\u00ad ards' arrest nor search incident to the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. 3 Id., at 1142-1143. However, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners qualied immunity from Howards' First Amendment claim. The court rst determined that Howards had established a mate\u00adrial factual dispute regarding whether petitioners were sub\u00adstantially motivated by Howards' speech when they arrested 2 Howards named several Secret Service agents as defendants, but only Agents Reichle and Doyle are petitioners here. We address only those parts of the lower courts' decisions that involve petitioners Reichle and Doyle. 3 Howards does not challenge the Court of Appeals' probable-cause determination. Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 663 Opinion of the Court him. Id., at 1144-1145. The court then rejected petition\u00ad ers' argument that, under this Court's decision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), probable cause to arrest de\u00ad feats a First Amendment claim of retaliatory arrest. The court concluded that Hartman established such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution claims and, therefore, did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable cause. 634 F. 3d, at 1148. Judge Paul Kelly dissented from the court's denial of quali\u00ad ed immunity. He would have held that when Howards was arrested, it was not clearly established that an arrest sup\u00adported by probable cause could violate the First Amend\u00adment. In Judge Kelly's view, Hartman called into serious question the Tenth Circuit's prior precedent on retaliatory arrests. 634 F. 3d, at 1151. He noted that other Circuits had applied Hartman to retaliatory arrests and that there was a \"strong argument\" in favor of doing so. 634 F. 3d, at 1151-1152. We granted certiorari on two questions: whether a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the presence of probable cause to support the arrest, and whether clearly established law at the time of Howards' ar\u00adrest so held. See 565 U. S. 1078 (2011). If the answer to either question is \"no,\" then the agents are entitled to quali\u00aded immunity. We elect to address only the second ques\u00adtion. We conclude that, at the time of Howards' arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by prob\u00adable cause could violate the First Amendment. We, there\u00adfore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying petitioners qualied immunity. 4 4 This Court has recognized an implied cause of action for damages against federal ofcials for Fourth Amendment violations. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). We have never held that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims. See Ash\u00ad croft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 675 (2009) (assuming without deciding that a 664 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Opinion of the Court III Qualied immunity shields government ofcials from civil damages liability unless the ofcial violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 735 (2011). In Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009), we held that courts may grant qualied immunity on the ground that a purported right was not \"clearly estab\u00adlished\" by prior case law, without resolving the often more difcult question whether the purported right exists at all. Id., at 227. This approach comports with our usual reluc\u00ad tance to decide constitutional questions unnecessarily. Id., at 241; see also Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. 692, 705- 706 (2011); al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at 735. To be clearly established, a right must be sufciently clear \"that every 'reasonable ofcial would [have understood] that what he is doing violates that right.' \" Id., at 741 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987)). In other words, \"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\" al-Kidd, supra, at 741. This \"clearly established\" standard protects bal\u00adance between vindication of constitutional rights and govern\u00adment ofcials' effective performance of their duties by ensur\u00ading that ofcials can \" 'reasonably . . . anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages.' \" Anderson, supra, at 639 (quoting Davis v. Scherer , 468 U. S. 183, 195 (1984)). The \"clearly established\" standard is not satised here. This Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by First Amendment free exercise claim is actionable under Bivens); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 368 (1983) (refusing to extend Bivens to a First Amendment speech claim involving federal employment). We need not (and do not) decide here whether Bivens extends to First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims. Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 665 Opinion of the Court probable cause; nor was such a right otherwise clearly estab\u00ad lished at the time of Howards' arrest. A Howards contends that our cases have \" 'settled' \" the rule that, \" 'as a general matter[,] the First Amendment prohibits government ofcials from subjecting an individual to retalia\u00adtory actions' \" for his speech. See Brief for Respondent 39 (quoting Hartman, supra, at 256). But we have previously explained that the right allegedly violated must be estab\u00adlished, \" 'not as a broad general proposition,' \" Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198 (2004) (per curiam), but in a \"par\u00ad ticularized\" sense so that the \"contours\" of the right are clear to a reasonable ofcial, Anderson, supra, at 640. Here, the right in question is not the general right to be free from retaliation for one's speech, but the more specic right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable cause. This Court has never held that there is such a right. 5 B We next consider Tenth Circuit precedent. Assuming, arguendo , that controlling Court of Appeals' authority could be a dispositive source of clearly established law in the cir\u00ad 5 The Court of Appeals' reliance on Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996), was misplaced. There, we held that a trafc stop supported by probable cause did not violate the Fourth Amendment regardless of the ofcer's actual motivations, but we explained that the Equal Protec\u00adtion Clause would prohibit an ofcer from selectively enforcing the trafc laws based on race. Id., at 813. Citing Whren, the Court of Appeals noted that \"[i]t is well established that an act which is lawful under the Fourth Amendment may still violate other provisions of the Constitution.\" Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1149, n. 15 (CA10 2011). But, again, we do not dene clearly established law at such a \"high level of generality.\" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 742 (2011). Whren's dis\u00ad cussion of the Fourteenth Amendment does not indicate, much less \"clearly establish,\" that an arrest supported by probable cause could none\u00adtheless violate the First Amendment. 666 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Opinion of the Court cumstances of this case, the Tenth Circuit's cases do not satisfy the \"clearly established\" standard here. Relying on DeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F. 2d 618 (1990), and Poole v. County of Otero, 271 F. 3d 955 (2001), the Court of Appeals concluded that, at the time of Howards' arrest, its precedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an ar\u00adrest in retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights, irrespective of probable cause. In DeLoach, a case involving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prosecu\u00adtion, the court held that \"[a]n act taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under \u00a7 1983 even if the act, when taken for a different rea\u00adson, would have been proper.\" 922 F. 2d, at 620 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Poole, a subsequent retalia\u00ad tory prosecution case, the court relied on DeLoach for the proposition that a plaintiff's illegal conduct is \"not relevant to his First Amendment claim.\" 271 F. 3d, at 961. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Poole was ab\u00ad rogated by this Court's subsequent decision in Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250, which held that a plaintiff can\u00ad not state a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the First Amendment if the charges were supported by probable cause. But the Court of Appeals determined that Hartman's no-probable-cause requirement did not extend to claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb its prior precedent in DeLoach. Accordingly, the court concluded, \"when Mr. Howards was arrested it was clearly established that an arrest made in retaliation of an individu\u00adal's First Amendment rights is unlawful, even if the arrest is supported by probable cause.\" 634 F. 3d, at 1148. We disagree. At the time of Howards' arrest, Hartman's impact on the Tenth Circuit's precedent governing retalia\u00adtory arrests was far from clear. Although the facts of Hart\u00ad man involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reasonable of\u00ad cers could have questioned whether the rule of Hartman also applied to arrests. Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 667 Opinion of the Court Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly. Hartman resolved a split among the Courts of Appeals about the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits, but some of the conflicting Court of Appeals cases in\u00advolved both an arrest and a prosecution that were alleged to be retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights. See 547 U. S., at 255-256, 259, n. 6 (citing Mozzochi v. Bor\u00ad den, 959 F. 2d 1174 (CA2 1992); Singer v. Fulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F. 3d 110 (CA2 1995); Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F. 3d 252 (CA5 2002); Wood v. Kesler, 323 F. 3d 872 (CA11 2003)). Those cases made no distinction between claims of retalia\u00ad tory arrest and claims of retaliatory prosecution when con\u00adsidering the relevance of probable cause. See Mozzochi, supra, at 1179-1180; Singer, supra, at 120; Keenan, supra, 260; Wood, supra, at 883. Indeed, the close relation\u00ad ship between retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the Tenth Circuit's own decision in DeLoach. DeLoach, too, involved allegations of both retal\u00adiatory arrest and retaliatory prosecution, and the Tenth Circuit analyzed the two claims as one. 922 F. 2d, at 620-621. A reasonable ofcial also could have interpreted Hart\u00ad man's rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Hartman rst observed that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the charges would always be \"available and apt to prove or disprove re\u00adtaliatory causation.\" 547 U. S., at 261. In this Court's view, the presence of probable cause, while not a \"guarantee\" that retaliatory motive did not cause the prosecution, still precluded any prima facie inference that retaliatory motive was the but-for cause of the plaintiff's injury. Id., at 265. This was especially true because, as Hartman next empha\u00ad sized, retaliatory prosecution claims involve particularly attenuated causation between the defendant's alleged retal\u00adiatory animus and the plaintiff's injury. Id., at 259-261. In 668 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Opinion of the Court a retaliatory prosecution case, the key defendant is typically not the prosecutor who made the charging decision that injured the plaintiff, because prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for their decisions to prosecute. Rather, the key defendant is the person who allegedly prompted the pros\u00adecutor's decision. Thus, the intervening decision of the third-party prosecutor widens the causal gap between the defendant's animus and the plaintiff's injury. Id., at 261-263. Like retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the pres\u00ad ence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually every retaliatory arrest case. Such evidence could be thought similarly fatal to a plaintiff's claim that animus caused his arrest, given that retaliatory arrest cases also present a tenuous causal connection between the defendant's alleged animus and the plaintiff's injury. An of\u00adcer might bear animus toward the content of a suspect's speech. But the ofcer may decide to arrest the suspect because his speech provides evidence of a crime or suggests a potential threat. See, e. g., Wayte v. United States, 470 U. S. 598, 612-613 (1985) (noting that letters of protest writ\u00ad ten to the Selective Service, in which the author expressed disagreement with the draft, \"provided strong, perhaps conclusive evidence of the nonregistrant's intent not to comply\u2014one of the elements of the offense\" of willful fail\u00adure to register for the draft). Like retaliatory prosecution cases, then, the connection between alleged animus and in\u00adjury may be weakened in the arrest context by a police of\u00adcer's wholly legitimate consideration of speech. To be sure, we do not suggest that Hartman's rule in fact extends to arrests. Nor do we suggest that every aspect of Hartman's rationale could apply to retaliatory arrests. Hartman concluded that the causal connection in retaliatory prosecution cases is attenuated because those cases necessar\u00adily involve the animus of one person and the injurious action of another, 547 U. S., at 262, but in many retaliatory arrest Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 669 Opinion of the Court cases, it is the ofcer bearing the alleged animus who makes the injurious arrest. Moreover, Hartman noted that, in re\u00ad taliatory prosecution cases, the causal connection between the defendant's animus and the prosecutor's decision is fur\u00adther weakened by the \"presumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial decisionmaking.\" Id., at 263. That pre\u00ad sumption does not apply here. Nonetheless, the fact re\u00admains that, for qualied immunity purposes, at the time of Howards' arrest it was at least arguable that Hartman's rule extended to retaliatory arrests. 6 Decisions from other Federal Courts of Appeals in the wake of Hartman support this assessment. Shortly before Howards' arrest, the Sixth Circuit held that Hartman re\u00ad quired a plaintiff alleging a retaliatory arrest to show that the defendant ofcer lacked probable cause. See Barnes v. Wright, 449 F. 3d 709, 720 (2006) (reasoning that the Hart\u00ad man \"rule sweeps broadly\"). That court's treatment of Hartman conrms that the inapplicability of Hartman to arrests would not have been clear to a reasonable ofcer when Howards was arrested. Moreover, since Howards' ar\u00adrest, additional Courts of Appeals have concluded that Hart\u00ad man's no-probable-cause requirement extends to retaliatory arrests. See, e. g., McCabe v. Parker, 608 F. 3d 1068, 1075 (CA8 2010); Phillips v. Irvin, 222 Fed. Appx. 928, 929 (CA11 2007) (per curiam). As we have previously observed, \"[i]f 6 Howards argues that petitioners violated his clearly established First Amendment right even if Hartman's rule applies equally to retaliatory arrests. According to Howards, Hartman did not hold that a prosecution violates the First Amendment only when it is unsupported by probable cause. Rather, Howards argues, Hartman made probable cause rele\u00ad vant only to a plaintiff 's ability to recover damages for a First Amend\u00adment violation. See Brief for Respondent 37-41. We need not resolve whether Hartman is best read as dening the scope of the First Amend\u00ad ment right or as simply establishing a prerequisite for recovery. Nor need we decide whether that distinction matters. It sufces, for qualied immunity purposes, that the answer would not have been clear to a reason\u00adable ofcial when Howards was arrested. 670 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999). 7 * * * Hartman injected uncertainty into the law governing re\u00ad taliatory arrests, particularly in light of Hartman's rationale and the close relationship between retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims. This uncertainty was only conrmed by subsequent appellate decisions that disagreed over whether the reasoning in Hartman applied similarly to retaliatory arrests. Accordingly, when Howards was arrested it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a First Amendment violation. Peti\u00adtioners Reichle and Doyle are thus entitled to qualied immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or deci\u00ad sion of this case. Justice Ginsburg , with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring in the judgment. Were defendants ordinary law enforcement officers, I would hold that Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250 (2006), does not support their entitlement to qualied immunity. Hart\u00ad man involved a charge of retaliatory prosecution. As the Court explains, the defendant in such a case cannot be 7 Indeed, the Tenth Circuit itself has applied Hartman outside the con\u00ad text of retaliatory prosecution. See McBeth v. Himes, 598 F. 3d 708, 719 (2010) (requiring the absence of probable cause in the context of a claim alleging that government ofcials suspended a business license in retalia\u00adtion for the exercise of First Amendment rights). Cite as: 566 U. S. 658 (2012) 671 Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment the prosecutor who made the decision to pursue charges. See ante, at 667-668; Hartman, 547 U. S., at 262 (noting that prosecutors are \"absolutely immune from liability for the de\u00adcision to prosecute\"). Rather, the defendant will be another government ofcial who, motivated by retaliatory animus, convinced the prosecutor to act. See ibid.; ante, at 667-668. Thus, the \"causal connection [a plaintiff must establish in a retaliatory-prosecution case] is not merely between the re\u00adtaliatory animus of one person and that person's own injuri\u00adous action, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the action of another.\" Hartman, 547 U. S., at 262. This \"distinct problem of causation\" justied the absence\u00ad of-probable-cause requirement we recognized in Hartman. Id., at 263 (Proof of an absence of probable cause to prosecute is needed \"to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent's motive and the prosecutor's action.\"). See also id., at 259 (\"[T]he need to prove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with details specic to retaliatory- prosecution cases, . . . provides the strongest justication for the no-probable-cause requirement.\" (emphasis added)). A similar causation problem will not arise in the typical retaliatory-arrest case. Unlike prosecutors, arresting of\u00adcers are not wholly immune from suit. As a result, a plain\u00adtiff can sue the arresting ofcer directly and need only show that the ofcer (not some other ofcial) acted with a retalia\u00adtory motive. Because, in the usual retaliatory-arrest case, there is no gap to bridge between one government ofcial's animus and a second government ofcial's action, Hartman's no-probable-cause requirement is inapplicable. Nevertheless, I concur in the Court's judgment. Ofcers assigned to protect public ofcials must make singularly swift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the person they are guarding is in jeopardy. In performing that pro\u00adtective function, they rightly take into account words spoken to, or in the proximity of, the person whose safety is their charge. Whatever the views of Secret Service Agents 672 REICHLE v. HOWARDS Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment Reichle and Doyle on the administration's policies in Iraq, they were dutybound to take the content of Howards' state\u00adments into account in determining whether he posed an im\u00admediate threat to the Vice President's physical security. Retaliatory animus cannot be inferred from the assessment they made in that regard. If rational, that assessment should not expose them to claims for civil damages. Cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3056(d) (knowingly and willfully resisting federal law enforcement agent engaged in protective function is pun\u00adishable by ne (up to $1,000) and imprisonment (up to one year)); \u00a7 1751(e) (assaulting President or Vice President is a crime punishable by ne and imprisonment up to ten years). OCTOBER TERM, 2011 673 Syllabus ARMOUR et al. v. CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, et al. certiorari to the supreme court of indiana No. 11-161. Argued February 29, 2012\u2014Decided June 4, 2012 For decades, Indianapolis (City) funded sewer projects using Indiana's Barrett Law, which permitted cities to apportion a public improvement project's costs equally among all abutting lots. Under that system, a city would create an initial assessment, dividing the total estimated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary adjustments. Upon a project's completion, the city would issue a nal lot-by-lot assessment. Lot owners could elect to pay the assessment in a lump sum or over time in installments. After the City completed the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Project, it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment obli\u00adgations. Of the 180 affected homeowners, 38 elected to pay the lump sum. The following year, the City abandoned Barrett Law nancing and adopted the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which nanced projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering individual owner's sewer-connection costs. In implementing STEP, the City's Board of Public Works enacted a resolution forgiving all assessment amounts still owed pursuant to Barrett Law nancing. Homeowners who had paid the Brisbane/Manning Project lump sum received no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay in installments were under no obligation to make further payments. The 38 homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the City for a re\u00ad fund, but the City denied the request. Thirty-one of these homeowners brought suit in Indiana state court claiming, in relevant part, that the City's refusal violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause. The trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners, and the State Court of Appeals afrmed. The Indiana Supreme Court reversed, hold\u00ading that the City's distinction between those who had already paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing nancial hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources. Held: The City had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 680-688. (a) The City's classication does not involve a fundamental right or suspect classication. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320. Its 674 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Syllabus subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial. See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152. It is a tax classi\u00ad cation. See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 547. And no one claims that the City has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new residents. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor , 472 U. S. 612. Hence, the City's distinction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as \"there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classication,\" FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313, and the \" 'burden is on the one attacking the [classication] to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,' \" Heller, supra, at 320. Pp. 680-681. (b) Administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a tax-related dis\u00ad tinction, see, e. g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511-512, and the City's decision to stop collecting outstanding Bar\u00adrett Law debts nds rational support in the City's administrative concerns. After the City switched to the STEP system, any decision to continue Barrett Law debt collection could have proved complex and expensive. It would have meant maintaining an administrative system for years to come to collect debts arising out of 20-plus different con\u00adstruction projects built over the course of a decade, involving monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible need to main\u00adtain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action. The rationality of the City's distinction draws further support from the nature of the line-drawing choices that confronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding further adminis\u00adtrative costs, namely, the cost of processing refunds. And limiting refunds only to Brisbane/Manning homeowners would have led to com\u00adplaints of unfairness, while expanding refunds to the apparently thou\u00adsands of other Barrett Law project homeowners would have involved an even greater administrative burden. Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the City drew\u2014distinguishing past payments from future obligations\u2014is well known to the law. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 108(a)(1)(E). Pp. 682-684. (c) Petitioners' contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Whether nancial hardship is a factor supporting rationality need not be consid\u00ad ered here, since the City's administrative concerns are sufcient to show a rational basis for its distinction. Petitioners propose other forgive\u00adness systems that they argue are superior to the City's system, but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the City be rational. Petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considerations. Here it Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 675 Opinion of the Court was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums for years to come. Petitioners have not shown that the administrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classication. Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difcult for the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence. The one exception, Allegheny Pitts\u00ad burgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336, is distin\u00ad guishable. Pp. 684-688. 946 N. E. 2d 553, afrmed.

The Barrett Law also permitted those lot owners to pay either imme\u00addiately in the form of a lump sum or over time in install\u00adments. In 2005, the city of Indianapolis (Indianapolis or City) adopted a new assessment and payment method, the \"STEP\" plan, and it forgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had not yet paid. A group of lot owners who had already paid their entire Barrett Law assessment in a lump sum believe that the City should have provided them with equivalent refunds. And we must decide whether the City's refusal to do so unconstitutionally discriminates against them in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1. We hold that the City had a rational basis for distinguishing between those lot owners who had already paid their share of project costs and those who had not. And we conclude that there is no equal protection violation. I A Beginning in 1889, Indiana's Barrett Law permitted cities to pay for public improvements, such as sewage projects, by \"apportion[ing]\" the costs of a project \"equally among all abutting lands or lots.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-39-15(b)(3) (2011); see Town Council of New Harmony v. Parker , 726 N. E. 2d 1217, 1227, n. 13 (Ind. 2000) (project's beneciaries pay its costs). When a city built a Barrett Law project, the city's public works board would create an initial lot-owner assess\u00adment by \"dividing the estimated total cost of the sewage works by the total number of lots.\" \u00a7 36-9-39-16(a). It might then adjust an individual assessment downward if the lot would benet less than would others. \u00a7 36-9-39-17(b). Upon completion of the project, the board would issue a nal lot-by-lot assessment. The Barrett Law permitted lot owners to pay the assess\u00ad ment either in a single lump sum or over time in installment Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 677 Opinion of the Court payments (with interest). The City would collect install\u00ad ment payments \"in the same manner as other taxes.\" \u00a7 36-9-37-6. The Barrett Law authorized 10-, 20-, or 30\u00adyear installment plans. \u00a7 36-9-37-8.5(a). Until fully paid, an assessment would constitute a lien against the property, permitting the city to initiate foreclosure proceedings in case of a default. \u00a7\u00a7 36-9-37-9(b), -22. For several decades, Indianapolis used the Barrett Law system to fund sewer projects. See, e. g., Conley v. Brum\u00ad mit, 92 Ind. App. 620, 621, 176 N. E. 880, 881 (1931) (in banc). But in 2005, the City adopted a new system, called the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which nanced projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering individual lot own\u00aders' sewer-connection costs. By that time, the City had con\u00adstructed more than 40 Barrett Law projects. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a. We are told that installment-paying lot owners still owed money in respect to 24 of those projects. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 16-17, n. 3 (citing City's Response to Plaintiff's Brief on Damages, Record in Cox v. Indianapo\u00ad lis, No. 1:09-cv-0435 (SD Ind.), Doc. 98-1 (Exh. A)). In re\u00adspect to 21 of the 24, some installment payments had not yet fallen due; in respect to the other 3, those who owed money were in default. Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, n. 3. B This case concerns one of the 24 still-open Barrett Law projects, namely, the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Project. The Brisbane/Manning Project began in 2001. It connected about 180 homes to the City's sewage system. Construction was completed in 2003. The Indianapolis Board of Public Works (Board) held an assessment hear\u00ading in June 2004. And in July 2004, the Board sent the 180 affected homeowners a formal notice of their payment obligations. The notice made clear that each homeowner could pay the entire assessment\u2014$9,278 per property\u2014in a lump sum or 678 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Opinion of the Court in installments, which would include interest at a 3.5% an\u00ad nual rate. Under an installment plan, payments would amount to $77.27 per month for 10 years; $38.66 per month for 20 years; or $25.77 per month for 30 years. In the event, 38 homeowners chose to pay up front; 47 chose the 10-year plan; 27 chose the 20-year plan; and 68 chose the 30-year plan. And in the rst year each homeowner paid the amount due ($9,278 upfront; $927.80 under the 10-year plan; plan, or $309.27 under the 30-year plan). App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a. The next year, however, the City decided to abandon the Barrett Law method of nancing. It thought that the Bar\u00ad rett Law's lot-by-lot payments had become too burdensome for many homeowners to pay, discouraging changes from less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems. See id., at 4a-5a. (For example, homes helped by the Brisbane/ Manning Project, at a cost of more than $9,000 each, were then valued at $120,000 to $270,000. App. 67.) The City's new STEP method of nancing would charge each connect\u00ading lot owner a flat $2,500 fee and make up the difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all lot owners citywide. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, n. 5. On October 31, 2005, the City enacted an ordinance imple\u00ad menting its decision. In December, the Board enacted a fur\u00adther resolution, Resolution 101, which, as part of the transi\u00adtion, would \"forgive all assessment amounts . . . established pursuant to the Barrett Law Funding for Municipal Sewer programs due and owing from the date of November 1, 2005 forward.\" App. 72 (emphasis added). In its preamble, the resolution said that the Barrett Law \"may present nancial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic sys\u00adtems\"; it pointed out that the City was transitioning to the new STEP method of nancing; and it said that the STEP method was based upon a nancial model that had \"consid\u00adered the current assessments being made by participants in Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 679 Opinion of the Court active Barrett Law projects\" as well as future projects. Id., at 71-72. The upshot was that those who still owed Barrett Law assessments would not have to make further payments but those who had already paid their assessments would not receive refunds. This meant that homeowners who had paid the full $9,278 Brisbane/Manning Project assessment in a lump sum the preceding year would receive no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay the assessment in installments, and had paid a total of $309.27, $463.90, or $927.80, would be under no obligation to make further payments. In February 2006, the 38 homeowners who had paid the full Brisbane/Manning Project assessment asked the City for a partial refund (in an amount equal to the smallest forgiven Brisbane/Manning installment debt, apparently $8,062). The City denied the request in part because \"[r]efunding payments made in your project area, or any portion of the payments, would establish a precedent of unfair and inequi\u00adtable treatment to all other property owners who have also paid Barrett Law assessments . . . and while [the Novem\u00adber 1, 2005, cutoff date] might seem arbitrary to you, it is essential for the City to establish this date and move forward with the new funding approach.\" Id., at 50-51. C Thirty-one of the thirty-eight Brisbane/Manning Project lump-sum homeowners brought this lawsuit in Indiana state court seeking a refund of about $8,000 each. They claimed in relevant part that the City's refusal to provide them with refunds at the same time that the City forgave the outstanding project debts of other Brisbane/Manning homeowners violated the Federal Constitution's Equal Pro\u00adtection Clause, Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1; see also Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. The trial court granted summary judg\u00adment in their favor. The State Court of Appeals afrmed that judgment. 918 N. E. 2d 401 (2009). But the Indiana 680 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Opinion of the Court Supreme Court reversed. 946 N. E. 2d 553 (2011). In its view, the City's distinction between those who had already paid their Barrett Law assessments and those who had not was \"rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief for property owners experiencing nancial hardship, establishing a clear transi\u00adtion from [the] Barrett Law to STEP, and preserving its lim\u00adited resources.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a. We granted certiorari to consider the equal protection question. And we now afrm the Indiana Supreme Court. II A As long as the City's distinction has a rational basis, that distinction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. This Court has long held that \"a classication neither involv\u00ading fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\" Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320 (1993); cf. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155, 165-166 (1897). We have made clear in analogous contexts that, where \"ordinary commercial transactions\" are at issue, rational basis review requires def\u00aderence to reasonable underlying legislative judgments. United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938) (due process); see also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam) (equal protection). And we have repeatedly pointed out that \"[ l]egislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax statutes.\" Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 547 (1983); see also Fitzgerald v. Racing Assn. of Central Iowa, 539 U. S. 103, 107-108 (2003); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11 (1992); Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973); Madden v. Kentucky , 309 U. S. 83, 87-88 (1940); Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 681 Opinion of the Court Citizens' Telephone Co. of Grand Rapids v. Fuller , 229 U. S. 322, 329 (1913). Indianapolis' classication involves neither a \"fundamental right\" nor a \"suspect\" classication. Its subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial. It is a tax classica\u00adtion. And no one here claims that Indianapolis has discrimi\u00adnated against out-of-state commerce or new residents. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor , 472 U. S. 612 (1985); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985); Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982). Hence, this case falls directly within the scope of our precedents holding such a law constitutionally valid if \"there is a plausible policy reason for the classica\u00adtion, the legislative facts on which the classication is appar\u00adently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classication to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\" Nordlinger , supra, at 11 (citations omitted). And it falls within the scope of our precedents holding that there is such a plausible reason if \"there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classication.\" FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993); see also Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78 (1911). Moreover, analogous precedent warns us that we are not to \"pronounc[e]\" this classication \"unconstitutional unless in the light of the facts made known or generally assumed it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators.\" Carolene Products Co., supra, at 152 (due process claim). Further, because the clas\u00ad sication is presumed constitutional, the \" 'burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.' \" Heller , supra, at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen, supra, at 364). 682 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Opinion of the Court B In our view, Indianapolis' classication has a rational basis. Ordinarily, administrative considerations can justify a tax- related distinction. See, e. g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511-512 (1937) (tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight employees rational in light of the \"[a]dministrative convenience and expense\" involved); see also Lehnhausen, supra, at 365 (comparing administra\u00ad tive cost of taxing corporations versus individuals); Madden, supra, at 90 (comparing administrative cost of taxing depos\u00ad its in local banks versus those elsewhere). And the City's decision to stop collecting outstanding Barrett Law debts nds rational support in related administrative concerns. The City had decided to switch to the STEP system. After that change, to continue Barrett Law unpaid-debt col\u00adlection could have proved complex and expensive. It would have meant maintaining an administrative system that for years to come would have had to collect debts arising out of 20-plus different construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action. The City, for example, would have had to maintain its Bar\u00adrett Law operation within the City Controller's Ofce, keep les on old, small, installment-plan debts, and (a City ofcial says) possibly spend hundreds of thousands of dollars keep\u00ading computerized debt-tracking systems current. See Brief for International City/County Management Association et al. as Amici Curiae 13, n. 12 (citing Afdavit of Charles White \u00b613, Record in Cox, Doc. No. 57-3). Unlike the collection system prior to abandonment, the City would not have added any new Barrett Law installment-plan debtors. And that fact means that it would have had to spread the xed admin\u00adistrative costs of collection over an ever-declining number of debtors, thereby continuously increasing the per-debtor cost of collection. Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 683 Opinion of the Court Consistent with these facts, the director of the City's De\u00ad partment of Public Works later explained that the City decided to forgive outstanding debt in part because \"[t]he administrative costs to service and process remaining bal\u00adances on Barrett Law accounts long past the transition to the STEP program would not benet the taxpayers\" and would defeat the purpose of the transition. App. 76. The four other members of the Board have said the same. See Afdavit of Gregory Taylor \u00b66, Record in Cox, Doc. No. 57- 5; Roger Brown ibid., Doc. No. 57-8. The rationality of the City's distinction draws further sup\u00ad port from the nature of the line-drawing choices that con\u00ad fronted it. To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding yet further administrative costs, namely, the cost of processing refunds. At the same time, to have tried to limit the City's costs and lost revenues by limiting forgiveness (or refund) rules to Brisbane/Manning homeown\u00aders alone would have led those involved in other Barrett Law projects to have justiably complained about unfairness. Yet to have granted refunds (as well as providing forgive\u00adness) to all those involved in all Barrett Law projects (there were more than 40 projects) or in all open projects (there were more than 20) would have involved even greater administrative burden. The City could not just \"cut . . . checks,\" post, at 691 (Roberts, C. J., dissenting), without taking funding from other programs or nding additional revenue. If, instead, the City had tried to keep the amount of revenue it lost constant (a rational goal) but spread it evenly among the apparently thousands of homeowners in\u00advolved in any of the Barrett Law projects, the result would have been yet smaller individual payments, even more likely to have been too small to justify the administrative expense. Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the City drew\u2014distinguish\u00ad684 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Opinion of the Court ing past payments from future obligations\u2014is a line well known to the law. Sometimes such a line takes the form of an amnesty program, involving, say, mortgage pay\u00adments, taxes, or parking tickets. E. g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 108(a) (1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal income tax provision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income newly for\u00adgiven home mortgage debt); United States v. Martin, 523 F. 3d 281, 284 (CA4 2008) (tax amnesty program whereby State newly forgave penalties and liabilities if taxpayer sat\u00adised debt); Horn v. Chicago , 860 F. 2d 700, 704, n. 9 (CA7 1988) (city parking ticket amnesty program whereby out\u00adstanding tickets could be newly settled for a fraction of amount specied). This kind of line is consistent with the distinction that the law often makes between actions pre\u00adviously taken and those yet to come. C Petitioners' contrary arguments are not sufficient to change our conclusion. Petitioners point out that the Indi\u00adana Supreme Court also listed a different consideration, namely, \"nancial hardship,\" as one of the factors supporting rationality. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a. They refer to the City's resolution that said that the Barrett Law \"may pre\u00adsent nancial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems.\" App. 71. And they argue that the tax distinction before us would not necessarily favor low-income homeowners. We need not consider this argument, however, for the ad\u00ad ministrative considerations we have mentioned are sufcient to show a rational basis for the City's distinction. The Indi\u00adana Supreme Court wrote that the City's classication was \"rationally related\" in part \"to its legitimate interests in re\u00ad ducing its administrative costs. \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a (emphasis added). The record of the City's proceedings is consistent with that determination. See App. 72 (when de\u00adCite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 685 Opinion of the Court veloping transition, the City \"considered the current assess\u00ad ments being made by participants in active Barrett Law projects\"). In any event, a legislature need not \"actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classication.\" Nordlinger , 505 U. S., at 15; see also Fitz\u00ad gerald, 539 U. S., at 108 (similar). Rather, the \"burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\" Madden, 309 U. S., at 88; see Heller , 509 U. S., at 320 (same); Lehn\u00ad hausen, 410 U. S., at 364 (same); see also Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 530 (1959) (upholding state tax classication resting \"upon a state of facts that rea\u00ad sonably can be conceived\" as creating a rational distinction). Petitioners have not \"negative[d]\" the Indiana Supreme Court's rst listed justication, namely, the administrative concerns we have discussed. Petitioners go on to propose various other forgiveness sys\u00ad tems that would have included refunds for at least some of those who had already paid in full. They argue that those systems are superior to the system that the City chose. We have discussed those, and other possible, systems earlier. Supra, at 682-683. Each has advantages and disadvan\u00ad tages. But even if petitioners have found a superior system, the Constitution does not require the City to draw the per\u00adfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line it might have drawn. It requires only that the line actually drawn be a rational line. And for the reasons we have set forth in Part II-B, supra, we believe that the line the City drew here is rational. Petitioners further argue that administrative considera\u00ad tions alone should not justify a tax distinction, lest a city arbitrarily allocate taxes among a few citizens while forgiv\u00ading many similarly situated citizens on the ground that it is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people than from many. Brief for Petitioners 45. Petitioners are right that administrative considerations could not justify such an 686 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Opinion of the Court unfair system. But that is not because administrative con\u00ad siderations can never justify tax differences (any more than they can always do so). The question is whether reducing those expenses, in the particular circumstances, provides a rational basis justifying the tax difference in question. In this case, \"in the light of the facts made known or gen\u00ad erally assumed,\" Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S., at 152, it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund system onto the City's forgiveness decision could have (for example) im\u00adposed an administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums (say, $25 per month) for years. As we have said, supra, at 682-684, it is rational for the City to draw a line that avoids that burden. Petitioners, who are the ones \"attacking the legislative arrangement,\" have the burden of showing that the circumstances are otherwise, i. e., that the administrative burden is too insubstantial to justify the clas\u00adsication. That they have not done. Finally, petitioners point to precedent that in their view makes it more difcult than we have said for the City to show a \"rational basis.\" With but one exception, however, the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence. E. g., Hooper v. Berna\u00ad lillo County Assessor , 472 U. S. 612 (state tax preference distinguishing between long-term and short-term resident veterans); Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (state use tax that burdened out-of-state car buyers who moved in state); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (state law that taxed out-of-state insurance companies at a higher rate than in-state companies); Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (state dividend distribution system that favored long\u00adterm residents). But those circumstances are not present here. The exception consists of Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). The Court there took into account a State Constitution and re\u00adlated laws that required equal valuation of equally valuable Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 687 Opinion of the Court property. Id., at 345. It considered the constitutionality of a county tax assessor's practice (over a period of many years) of determining property values as of the time of the prop\u00aderty's last sale; that practice meant highly unequal valua\u00adtions for two identical properties that were sold years or decades apart. Id., at 341. The Court rst found that the assessor's practice was not rationally related to the county's avowed purpose of assessing properties equally at true cur\u00adrent value because of the intentional systemic discrepancies the practice created. Id., at 343-344. The Court then noted that, in light of the State Constitution and related laws requiring equal valuation, there could be no other rational basis for the practice. Id., at 344-345. Therefore, the Court held, the assessor's discriminatory policy violated the Federal Constitution's insistence upon \"equal protection of the law.\" Id., at 346. Petitioners argue that the City's refusal to add refunds to its forgiveness decision is similar, for it constitutes a refusal to apply \"equally\" an Indiana state law that says that the costs of a Barrett Law project shall be equally \"appor\u00adtioned.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-39-15(b)(3). In other words, petitioners say that even if the City's decision might other\u00adwise be related to a rational purpose, state law (as in Alle\u00ad gheny) makes this the rare case where the facts preclude any rational basis for the City's decision other than to comply with the state mandate of equality. Allegheny, however, involved a clear state-law require\u00ad ment clearly and dramatically violated. Indeed, we have described Allegheny as \"the rare case where the facts pre\u00ad cluded\" any alternative reading of state law and thus any alternative rational basis. Nordlinger , supra, at 16. Here, the City followed state law by apportioning the cost of its Barrett Law projects equally. State law says nothing about forgiveness, how to design a forgiveness program, or whether or when rational distinctions in doing so are permit\u00ad ted. To adopt petitioners' view would risk transforming 688 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Roberts, C. J., dissenting ordinary violations of ordinary state tax law into violations of the Federal Constitution. * * * For these reasons, we conclude that the City has not vio\u00ad lated the Federal Equal Protection Clause. And the Indiana Supreme Court's similar judgment is Afrmed. Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Alito join, dissenting. Twenty-three years ago, we released a succinct and unani\u00ad mous opinion striking down a property tax scheme in West Virginia on the ground that it clearly violated the Equal Pro\u00adtection Clause. Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commis\u00ad sion of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989). In Allegheny Pittsburgh, we held that a county failed to comport with equal protection requirements when it assessed property taxes primarily on the basis of purchase price, with no appro\u00adpriate adjustments over time. The result was that new property owners were assessed at \"roughly 8 to 35 times\" the rate of those who had owned their property longer. Id., at 344. We found such a \"gross disparit[y]\" in tax levels could not be justied in a state system that demanded that \"taxation . . . be equal and uniform.\" Id., at 338; W. Va. Const., Art. X, \u00a7 1. The case afrmed the commonsense proposition that the Equal Protection Clause is violated by state action that deprives a citizen of even \"rough equality in tax treatment,\" when state law itself specically provides that all the affected taxpayers are in the same category for tax purposes. 488 U. S., at 343; see Hillsborough v. Crom\u00ad well, 326 U. S. 620, 623 (1946) (\"The equal protection clause . . . protects the individual from state action which selects him out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not imposed on others of the same class\"). Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 689 Roberts, C. J., dissenting In this case, the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Proj\u00ad ect allowed 180 property owners to have their homes hooked up to the city of Indianapolis's (City) sewer system under the State's Barrett Law. That law requires sewer costs to \"be primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-39-15(b)(3) (2011). In the case of Brisbane/Manning, the cost came to $9,278 for each property owner. Some of the property owners\u2014petitioners here\u2014 paid the full $9,278 up front. Others elected the option of paying in installments. Shortly after hookup, the City switched to a new nancing system and decided to forgive the hookup debts of those paying on an installment plan. The City refused, however, to refund any portion of the pay\u00adments made by their identically situated neighbors who had already paid the full amount due. The result was that while petitioners each paid the City $9,278 for their hookups, more than half their neighbors paid less than $500 for the same improvement\u2014some as little as $309.27. Another quarter paid less than $1,000. Petitioners thus paid between 10 and 30 times as much for their sewer hookups as their neighbors. In seeking to justify this gross disparity, the City ex\u00ad plained that it was presented with three choices: First, it could have continued to collect the installment plan pay\u00adments of those who had not yet settled their debts under the old system. Second, it could have forgiven all those debts and given equivalent refunds to those who had made lump-sum payments up front. Or third, it could have forgiven the future payments and not refunded payments that had al\u00adready been made. The rst two choices had the benet of complying with state law, treating all of Indianapolis's citi\u00adzens equally, and comporting with the Constitution. The City chose the third option. And what did the City believe was sufcient to justify a system that would effectively charge petitioners 30 times more than their neighbors for the same service\u2014when state 690 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Roberts, C. J., dissenting law promised equal treatment? Two things: the desire to avoid administrative hassle and the \"scal[ ] challeng[e]\" of giving back money it wanted to keep. Brief for Respond\u00adents 35-36. I cannot agree that those reasons pass constitu\u00adtional muster, even under rational basis review. The City argues that either of the other options for tran\u00ad sitioning away from the Barrett Law would have been \"immensely difcult from an administrative standpoint.\" Id., at 36. The Court accepts this rationale, observing that \"[o]rdinarily, administrative considerations can justify a tax-related distinction.\" Ante , at 682. The cases the Court cites, however, stand only for the proposition that a legisla\u00ad ture crafting a tax scheme may take administrative concerns into consideration when creating classes of taxable entities that may be taxed differently. See, e. g., Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973) (a State may \"draw lines that treat one class of individuals or entities differently from the others\"); Madden v. Kentucky , 309 U. S. 83, 87 (1940) (referring to the \"broad discretion as to classi\u00adcation possessed by a legislature\"); Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 510-511 (1937) (discussing permissible considerations for the legislature in establishing a tax scheme). Here, however, Indiana's tax scheme explicitly provides that costs will \"be primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-39-15(b)(3) (emphasis added). The legislature has therefore decreed that all abutting landowners are within the same class. We have never before held that administrative burdens justify grossly disparate tax treatment of those the State has pro\u00advided should be treated alike. Indeed, in Allegheny Pitts\u00ad burgh the county argued that its unequal assessments were based on \"[a]dministrative cost[ ]\" concerns, to no avail. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 1988, No. 87-1303, p. 22. The reason we have rejected this argument is obvious: The Equal Protection Clause does not provide that no State shall \"deny Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 691 Roberts, C. J., dissenting to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, unless it's too much of a bother.\" Even if the Court were inclined to decide that adminis\u00ad trative burdens alone may sometimes justify grossly dispar\u00adate treatment of members of the same class, this would hardly be the case to do that. The City claims it cannot issue refunds because the process would be too difcult, re\u00adquiring that it pore over records of old projects to determine which homeowners had overpaid and by how much. Brief for Respondents 36. But holding that the City must refund petitioners' overpayments would not mean that it has to refund overpayments in every Barrett Law project. The Equal Protection Clause is concerned with \"gross\" disparity in taxing. Because the Brisbane/Manning Project was initi\u00adated shortly before the Barrett Law transition, the disparity between what petitioners paid in comparison to their install\u00adment plan neighbors was dramatic. Not so with respect to, for example, a project initiated 10 years earlier, because for those projects even installment plan payers will have largely satised their debts, resulting in far less signicant disparities. To the extent a ruling for petitioners would require issuing refunds to others who overpaid under the Barrett Law, I think the City workers are up to the task. The City has in fact already produced records showing exactly how much each lump-sum payer overpaid in every active Barrett Law project\u2014to the penny. Record in Cox v. Indianapolis, No. 1:09-cv-0435 (SD Ind.), Doc. 98-1 (Exh. A). What the City employees would need to do, therefore, is cut the checks and mail them out. Certainly the job need not involve the complicated proce\u00ad dure the Court describes in an attempt to bolster its adminis\u00adtrative convenience argument. Under the Court's view the City would apparently continue to accept monthly payments from installment plan homeowners in order to gradually repay the money it owes to those who paid in a lump sum. 692 ARMOUR v. INDIANAPOLIS Roberts, C. J., dissenting Ante , at 683, 686. But this approach was never dreamt of by the City itself. See Brief for Respondents 18 (setting out City's \"three basic [transition] options,\" none of which involved the Court's gradual refund scheme). The Court suggests that the City's administrative conven\u00ad ience argument is one with which the law is comfortable. The Court compares the City's decision to forgive the install\u00adment balances to the sort of parking ticket and mortgage payment amnesty programs that currently abound. Ante , at 683. This analogy is misplaced: Amnesty programs are designed to entice those who are unlikely ever to pay their debts to come forward and pay at least a portion of what they owe. It is not administrative convenience alone that justies such schemes. In a sense, these schemes help rem\u00adedy payment inequities by prompting those who would pay nothing to pay at least some of their fair share. The same cannot be said of the City's system. The Court is willing to concede that \"administrative con\u00ad siderations could not justify . . system\" in which \"a city arbitrarily allocate[s] taxes among a few citizens while forgiving many similarly situated citizens on the ground that it is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people than from many.\" Ante , at 685-686. Cold comfort, that. If the quoted language does not accurately describe this case, I am not sure what it would reach. The Court wisely does not embrace the City's alternative argument that the unequal tax burden is justied because \"it would have been scally challenging to issue refunds.\" Brief for Respondents 35. \"Fiscally challenging \" gives euphemism a bad name. The City's claim that it has already spent petitioners' money is hardly worth a response, and the City recognizes as much when it admits it could provide refunds to petitioners by \"arrang[ing] for payments from non-Barrett Law sources.\" Id., at 36. One cannot evade returning money to its rightful owner by the simple expedi\u00adent of spending it. The \"scal challenge\" justication seems particularly inappropriate in this case, as the City\u2014with an Cite as: 566 U. S. 673 (2012) 693 Roberts, C. J., dissenting annual budget of approximately $900 million\u2014admits that the cost of refunding all of petitioners' money would be ap\u00adproximately $300,000. Adopted 2012 Budget for the Consol\u00adidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County (Oct. 17, 2011), p. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, 58. Equally unconvincing is the Court's attempt to distinguish Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court claims that case was dif\u00adferent because it involved \"a clear state-law requirement clearly and dramatically violated.\" Ante , at 687. Nothing less is at stake here. Indiana law requires that the costs of sewer projects be \"apportioned equally among all abutting lands.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-39-15(b)(3). The City has instead apportioned the costs of the Brisbane/Manning Project such that petitioners paid between 10 and 30 times as much as their neighbors. Worse still, it has done so in order to avoid administrative hassle and save a bit of money. To para\u00adphrase A Man for All Seasons: \"It prots a city nothing to give up treating its citizens equally for the whole world . . . but for $300,000?\" See R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, act II, p. 158 (1st Vintage Int'l ed. 1990). Our precedents do not ask for much from government in this area\u2014only \"rough equality in tax treatment.\" Alle\u00ad gheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 343. The Court reminds us that Allegheny Pittsburgh is a \"rare case.\" Ante, at 687. It is and should be; we give great leeway to taxing authori\u00adties in this area, for good and sufcient reasons. But every generation or so a case comes along when this Court needs to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection Clause is to retain any force in this context. Allegheny Pittsburgh was such a case; so is this one. Indiana law promised neighbor\u00ading homeowners that they would be treated equally when it came to paying for sewer hookups. The City then ended up charging some homeowners 30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same hookups. The equal protection vio\u00adlation is plain. I would accordingly reverse the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, and respectfully dissent from the Court's decision to do otherwise. Reporter's Note The next page is purposely numbered 901.

Accompanying these rules are excerpts from the report of the Judicial Conference of the United States containing the Committee Notes submitted to the Court for its consider\u00adation pursuant to Section 331 of Title 28, United States Code. The Supreme Court recommitted proposed amend\u00adments to Rules 5(d) and 58 of the Federal Rules of Crim\u00adinal Procedure to the Advisory Committee for further consideration. Sincerely, (Signed) John G. Roberts, Jr. Chief Justice of the United States 1054 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES APRIL 23, 2012 Ordered: 1. That the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure be, and they hereby are, amended by including therein amendments to Criminal Rules 5 and 15, and new Rule 37. [See infra, pp. 1057-1059.] 2. That the foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2012, and shall govern in all proceedings thereafter commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending. 3.

Initial appearance. . . . . . (c) Place district. . . . . . (4) Procedure for persons extradited to the United States.\u2014If the defendant is surrendered to the United States in accordance with a request for the defendant's extradition, the initial appearance must be in the district (or one of the districts) where the offense is charged. . . Defendant's presence. (1) custody.\u2014Except as authorized by Rule 15(c)(3), the ofcer who has custody of the defendant must produce the defendant at the deposition and keep the defendant in the witness's presence during the examina\u00adtion, unless the defendant: (A) waives in writing the right to be present; or (B) persists in disruptive conduct justifying exclusion after being warned by the court that disruptive conduct will result in the defendant's exclusion. (2) Defendant not in custody.\u2014Except as authorized by Rule 15(c)(3), a defendant who is not in custody has the right upon request to be present at the deposition, subject to any conditions imposed by the court. If the govern\u00adment tenders the defendant's expenses as provided in Rule 15(d) but the defendant still fails to appear, the defend\u00adant\u2014absent good cause\u2014waives both the right to appear 1057 1058 R ULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE and any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based on that right. (3) Taking depositions outside the United States with\u00ad out the defendant's presence.\u2014The deposition of a witness who is outside the United States may be taken without the defendant's presence if the court makes case-specic ndings of all the following: (A) the witness's testimony could provide substantial proof of a material fact in a felony prosecution; (B) there is a substantial likelihood that the witness's attendance at trial cannot be obtained; (C) the witness's presence for a deposition in the United States cannot be obtained; (D) the defendant cannot be present because: (i) the country where the witness is located will not permit the defendant to attend the deposition; (ii) for an in-custody defendant, secure transporta\u00ad tion and continuing custody cannot be assured at the witness's location; or (iii) for an out-of-custody defendant, no reasonable conditions will assure an appearance at the deposition or at trial or sentencing; and (E) the defendant can meaningfully participate in the deposition through reasonable means. . . . order author\u00ad izing a deposition to be taken under this rule does not deter\u00ad mine its admissibility. A party may use all or part of a deposition as provided by the Federal Rules of Evidence. . . . . . Rule 37. Indicative ruling on a motion for relief that is barred by a pending appeal. (a) Relief pending appeal.\u2014If a timely motion is made for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 1059 (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the mo\u00ad tion raises a substantial issue. (b) Notice to the court of appeals.\u2014The movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Ap\u00ad pellate Procedure 12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substan\u00adtial issue. (c) Remand.\u2014The district court may decide the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose. . . . . . IN D E X ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY FROM SUIT . See Civil Rights Act of 1871, 1.

S. C. \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A), when plan provides for sale of collateral free and clear of Bank's lien, but does not permit Bank to \"credit-bid\" at sale. RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, p. 639. 2. Chapter 12\u2014Postpetition farm sale\u2014Federal income tax liability\u2014 Reorganization plan.\u2014Federal income tax liability resulting from a Chap\u00adter 12 bankruptcy petitioner's postpetition farm sale is not \"incurred by the estate\" under 11 U.

C. \u00a7 1983 as a witness who testies at trial. Rehberg v. Paulk, p. 356. 2. Private attorney temporarily retained by city\u2014Qualied immunity from suit.\u2014A private individual temporarily retained by government to carry out its work\u2014here, a private attorney engaged by a city\u2014is entitled to seek qualied immunity from suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Filarsky v. Delia, p. 377. 3. Secret Service agents\u2014Qualied immunity claim of retaliatory ar\u00ad rest for political speech.\u2014Petitioner Secret Service agents are entitled to qualied immunity from this 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 suit with respect to re\u00adspondent's claim that he was arrested in retaliation for his political speech, when law at time of arrest did not clearly establish that an arrest sup\u00adported by probable cause could violate First Amendment. Reichle v. Howards, p. 658. CLEAN WATER ACT. Environmental Protection Agency compliance order\u2014Clean Water Act violation\u2014Administrative Procedure Act challenge.\u2014 Sacketts may bring a civil action under APA to challenge an EPA compliance order asserting that their residential lot is subject to Clean Water Act and that they have violated provisions of that Act.

Jury instruction on capital murder, rst-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide\u2014Mistrial after jury deadlock\u2014Reprosecution for capital and rst-degree murder.\u2014Where a jury was instructed that it could either convict Blueford of capital murder, rst-degree murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide or acquit him of all, and where a mistrial was declared after jury reported that it was deadlocked on man\u00adslaughter but had voted against guilt on capital and rst-degree murder, Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar reprosecution of Blueford on capital and rst-degree murder charges. Blueford v. Arkansas, p. 599. INDEX 1063 CONST ITUTIONAL LAW\u2014Continued. II. Equal Protection of the Laws. Financing public improvement projects\u2014Rational basis for forgiving unpaid assessments while issuing no refunds.\u2014Where Indianapolis adopted a new method for nancing public improvement projects, enacted a resolution forgiving assessment amounts still owed by some homeowners for past projects, and refused to issue refunds to homeowners who had already paid their full assessments, city's administrative concerns pro\u00advided a rational basis for distinguishing between two groups and thus did not violate Equal Protection Clause. Armour v. Indianapolis, p. 673. III. Right to Counsel. 1. Effective assistance\u2014Counsel's duty to communicate plea offer.\u2014 Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to con\u00ad sideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected; defense counsel has duty to communicate formal plea offers with favorable terms and condi\u00adtions; defendants must demonstrate a reasonable probability that they would have accepted a lapsed or rejected offer and that plea would have been entered even if prosecution had discretion to cancel it or trial court had discretion to refuse to accept it. Missouri v. Frye, p. 133. 2. Effective assistance\u2014Counsel's ineffective plea offer advice.\u2014 Where counsel's ineffective advice led to a plea offer's rejection, and where prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must show that but for that advice, there is a reasonable probability that an offer would have been presented to court, that court would have accepted its terms, and that conviction, sentence, or both would have been less severe than under actual judgment and sentence imposed; any remedy must neutralize taint of a constitutional violation, but must not grant a windfall to defendant or needlessly squander resources State properly invested in prosecution. Lafler v. Cooper, p. 156. IV. Searches and Seizures. Search of newly jailed arrestees for contraband\u2014Close visual inspec\u00ad tion while undressed.\u2014 County jails' policy that newly admitted arrestees undergo a close visual inspection while undressed struck a reasonable bal\u00ad ance between inmate privacy and institutions' needs; thus, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not require an exception for persons who have been arrested for minor offenses and have given corrections ofcers no reason to suspect that they are concealing contraband. Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, p. 318. V. Separation of Powers. Political question doctrine\u2014Judicial review\u2014Secretary of State's stat\u00ad utory discretion\u2014United States citizen born in Jerusalem.\u2014Political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of constitutionality of 1064 INDEX CONST ITUTIONAL LAW\u2014Continued. \u00a7 214(d) of Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, which directs Secretary of State, upon request by or for a United States citizen born in Jerusalem, to record place of birth as Israel for purposes of regis\u00adtration of birth, certication of nationality, or issuance of a passport. Zi\u00advotofsky v. Clinton, p. 189. VI. States' Immunity from Suit. Self-care provision of Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.\u2014Fourth Circuit's judgment that self-care provision of Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2612(a) (1)(D), did not abrogate States' immunity from suits alleging violations of that provision is afrmed. Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Md., p. 30. CONSUMER PROTECTION . See Real Estate Settlement Proce\u00ad dures Act. CONTRABAND SEARCHES. See Constitutional Law, IV . COUNTERCLAIMS. See Patents, 1. COURT INTERPRETERS ACT. \"[C]ompensation of interpreters\"\u2014Costs awardable to prevailing par\u00ad ties\u2014Document translation costs.\u2014 Because \"interpreter\" ordinarily means someone who translates orally from one language to another, cate\u00ad gory \"compensation of interpreters,\" which is among costs that may be awarded under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920 to prevailing parties in federal-court law\u00adsuits, does not include cost of document translation. Taniguchi v. Kan Pacic Saipan, Ltd., p. 560. \"CRAMDOWN\" PLANS.

Forfeited timeliness defense\u2014Courts of appeals' authority to raise on own initiative\u2014State's waiver of statute of limitations defense.\u2014 Federal courts of appeals, like district courts, have authority\u2014though not obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited timeliness defense to a habeas petition on 1066 INDEX HABEAS CORPUS\u2014Continued. their own initiative in exceptional cases; but Tenth Circuit abused its dis\u00ad cretion when it dismissed Wood's petition as untimely after State deliber\u00adately waived its statute of limitations defense. Wood v. Milyard, p. 463. 2. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel\u2014State-law limitation to initial-review collateral proceeding\u2014Procedural default.\u2014Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims may only be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, not on direct review, a proce\u00addural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those claims if, in initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. Martinez v. Ryan, p. 1. 3. Sufciency of evidence\u2014Due process\u2014Jury's inferences from trial evidence.\u2014Evidence at Johnson's trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 319, which leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from trial evidence and does not permit type of ne-grained factual parsing in which Third Circuit engaged.

C. \u00a7 1229b(a)\u2014which authorizes Attorney General to cancel removal of an alien who meets a 5-year LPR status requirement or a 7-year continuous-residency requirement\u2014is based on a permissible construction of \u00a7 1229b(a). Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez, p. 583. 2. Permanent resident status\u2014Felony conviction.\u2014Impact of Var\u00ad telas' brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, but by legal regime in force at time of Vartelas' 1994 felony convic\u00adtion.
