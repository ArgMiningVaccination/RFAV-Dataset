We are prepared to work hard during the next five years to execute our Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan, which is strategic, realistic and designed to produce measurable results. Nearly 1,000 people across the region participated in developing our plan, and we will stand together to transform the Southern Tier and bring about an advanced economy of the future. Throughout the planning process, we have built strong synergies among individuals, target industries, academia, the nonprofit sector and government. With this solid foundation of connections and relationships, the Southern Tier is poised to move forward immediately. The URI investment of $500 million will leverage more than $2.5 billion in private investment, create more than 10,200 jobs and have an overall economic impact of $3.4 billion in the next five years. We will revitalize distressed communities, make our mark as a region of innovation, attract foreign investment and increase exports, leverage our natural resources, strengthen our industries ranging from advanced manufacturing to agriculture to tourism, and change our image. By 2020 we expect the Southern Tier will be recognized for its innovation, highly trained workforce, strong communities and high-paying jobs. At the same time, we recognize the importance of reaching across regional boundaries to tap expertise and collaborate on opportunities that will enhance the economy of the entire state. W e also have made certain that programs, services and jobs will be available to everyone who wants to be part of the Southern Tier's workforce and overall economic success. On behalf of the Southern Tier, we thank Governor Cuomo for his vision and the opportunity to compete for an Upstate Revitalization Initiative award.

Introduction and Executive Summary Introduction Picture a place with a reasonable cost of living and incredible natural beauty. Think of communities where you may run into your neighbor at the coffee shop \u2014 or while cheering at a professional sporting event. Add world-renowned institutions of higher education and residents known for their capacity to innovate. Now put all these advantages at the intersection of major highways and rivers, with easy access to half of the North American population. That's the Southern Tier. We're not blind to the challenges that lie ahead. Our region has struggled with declining population, an aging workforce, the loss of several major employers and two epic floods in just the past decade. But today the Southern Tier is at a tipping point. With an Upstate Revitalization Initiative investment of $500 million from New York State, we will capitalize on our many assets and overcome these obstacles to create an advanced economy. With this plan, we will build the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem to lift up the region's most distressed urban area, transform the food and agriculture industry to capitalize on the Southern Tier's natural resources, invest in the advanced manufacturing industry to infuse innovation at every level of our region's largest employer and, finally, promote the Southern Tier's innovative culture to attract tourists, foreign investment and entrepreneurs while encouraging residents to become regional ambassadors. We will aggressively implement our plan to create the ideal conditions for economic growth by leveraging more than $2.5 billion in private investment, creating more than 10,200 jobs and having an overall economic impact of more than $3.4 billion in the next five years. Building on a strong foundation of target industries, higher education institutions, the nonprofit sector and government agencies, the Southern Tier will take a collaborative approach to attract talent and investment for the development of industry clusters, especially advanced manufacturing, healthcare, food and agriculture and tourism. Our focus will be on increasing the size, quality and prosperity of the region's workforce through new business creation based on high-technology discoveries and other entrepreneurial activities, while ensuring healthy communities and protecting the region's natural beauty and resources. This plan represents months of research and public engagement, with deep dives into the demographics and economics of the Southern Tier as well as input from industry and academic leaders, experts in their fields and nearly 1,000 residents. When the initiatives laid out in this plan have been realized, the Southern Tier will no longer be just a region in upstate New York. It will be a hotbed of vigorous business growth and development and a destination for the next generations of the nation's best and brightest talent. Students drive the economy by living, learning and playing in the Southern Tier, and have the potential to contribute to the economy by joining the workforce or starting businesses.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 5 Our plan is transformational Builds on the Southern Tier's assets Commits to job creationFocuses on cluster industries with high wagesInvests in anchor firms and supply chain businessesAchieves regional connectivity Fosters collaboration \u2014 locally and inter-regionallyLeverages private-sector investment Delivers workforce development, with a focus on hard-to-place workersAttracts talentAchieves global impact: exports, foreign investment and foreign spendingReinvests in communitiesCreates lasting public-private partnershipsPositions the region for long-term sustainability The Southern Tier is ready to go!

Leveraging the global reach and strengths of Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, together with the region's natural assets and strong private sector investment, a strategic mix of projects will transform and grow agriculture and food production, processing and distribution across the region, while also strengthening links to growing tourism and manufacturing industries. Strategy 1. Develop and deploy new technologies to transition the Southern Tier from being a highly seasonal, occasional provider of food products to a reliable source of supply for the East Coast. 2. Promote and leverage existing and new support structures for growers and producers in the region, including the $30 million Southern Tier Agricultural Economic Development Initiative, to help expand farms and increase their profitability . 3. Increase the diversity of and access to food processing facilities around the region, including slaughterhouses, meatpacking and poultry processing facilities, dairy processing facilities and aseptic packaging facilities for vegetables. 4. Leverage our location at the crossroads of upstate New York via the creation of a \"food hub\" network that facilitates market connections and distribution of food products for production centers in regions across the state. 5. Pioneer workforce development programs designed to bolster food and agriculture industries. 6. Advance New York State initiatives, including Opportunity Agenda, Veterans Initiative, Southern Tier Agriculture Initiative, Global NY, Start-Up NY, NYSTAR and Cleaner Greener. Outcomes and measurable impact n URI investment: $100,000,000 n Leveraged investment: $525,000,000 n Economic impact: $645,750,000 n Job creation: 2,800 n A 30% increase in the five-year average of invention disclosures and patent applications related to agriculture technology and plant science n 250 hard-to-place workers trained and placed n Increase average annual food and agriculture wage from $50,491 to $55,541 by 2020 n 15% increase in regional output ($) of crops (compared to a minimum of a 3% increase among the Southern Tier counties in the past five years) n 5% increase in regional output ($) of animal products (compared to a 2% decrease in the past five years) n Three additional key crops with more than 6% produced in New York State n Protecting or expanding farmland Transform the Food and Agriculture Industry Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 13Game-changing investments n Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University n Southern Tier Agriculture and Food Development Cooperative n Southern Tier Agriculture Development Fund, which will provide support to pioneering workforce development programs, with a focus on regional residents, hard-to-place workers and veterans n Southern Tier Agriculture Education Fund n Beef and Cattle Research Program n Groundswell Farmer Incubator Capacity Improvement and Regional Expansion n Basic infrastructure projects necessary to support expansion of food processing facilities such as the W averly WWTF update to support the expansion of Leprino Cheese and the Village of Walton Biogas Project to support Kraft Food n New construction or expansion of processing facilities for dairy , value-added foods, slaughter and meat packing, aseptic packaging and ultra-premium wine and beverages n Investments in crop production such as the V ineyard Reclamation and Replacement Program n Network of distribution hubs 14 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanPromote the Southern Tier's Innovative Culture Goal The Southern Tier will be a well-recognized and highly desirable place to learn, visit, live and grow a business because the region's distinct combination of educational strength, culture, innovation, leisure-related industries and natural resources creates a lifestyle that couples the convenience of larger cities with opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle surrounded by natural beauty. Strategy 1. Develop and implement a regional branding and promotion program that will serve as a unifying theme to promote the region' s quality of life and capacity for innovation, and ignite a fierce community pride that compels residents to be regional ambassadors. Use the region-wide branding program as an umbrella for sub-brands focused on: Building local pride Promoting the region to alumni of the region' s academic institutions, attracting them back to the region's beauty, affordability and diversity W orkforce recruitment, particularly in advanced manufacturing Promoting key initiatives such as the region' s food and agriculture and advanced manufacturing industries, and authentic communities and tourism destinations 2. Strengthen the region' s tourism and community assets and use them to promote the region to visitors, prospective talent and investors. 3. Attract young talent via college towns and small towns. This includes strengthening the college town corridor that winds through the region and retaining more graduates of the region's world-class academic institutions, which attract more than 60,000 students each year. 4. Advance commercialization of technology by maximizing innovation and intellectual capital among private-sector and academic institutions. 5. Attract and nurture a critical mass of entrepreneurs by promoting the commercialization of research from the region' s sources of innovation, retaining the brightest college graduates and providing an entrepreneurial ecosystem including incubators, seed capital, support services and attractive communities. 6. Advance New York State initiatives, including Hot Spots, Global, NY, Veterans Initiative, NY Rising, Opportunity Agenda, 76 West, NYSTAR, Cleaner Greener and Brownfield Redevelopment.

Situation Analysis Regional overview The Southern Tier's 6,260 square miles lie in the southern portion of Western New York, including the eight counties of Broome, Chemung, Chenango, Delaware, Schuyler , Steuben, Tioga and Tompkins. The region is largely rural, though it's also home to a number of urban centers, including the tri-city area of Binghamton, Johnson City and Endicott and the cities of Corning, Elmira, Hornell, Ithaca and Norwich. The Southern Tier and its urban centers are centrally positioned; the upstate cities of Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse can all be reached in a three-hour drive, and New York City is less than a four-hour drive away for most Southern Tier residents. SteubenSchuyler BinghamtonNorwich 17 The Southern Tier is home to more than 650,000 residents, a population that has remained steady since 2000 as there have been increases at the state and national levels (4.1% and 13.3%, respectively, between 2000 and 2014). All counties in the region experienced a decline in population since 2000 with the exception of Tompkins County, which grew by 8.5%. Schuyler County lost the highest proportion of residents: 3.9% between 2000 and 2014. A third of the region's population lives in Broome County, followed by 16% in Tompkins County and 15% in Steuben County. Broome County owes its high proportion to the more than 200,600 residents of Greater Binghamton. Other areas with high concentrations of residents include Steuben County with 99,000 residents (Hornell and Corning are major cities), Chemung County with 88,800 residents (Elmira is the major city) and Tompkins County with 102,300 residents (Ithaca is the major urban area). Southern Tier20 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanUnderstanding our challenges and opportunities through research and public engagement The Southern Tier embarked on a data-driven process as the Upstate Revitalization Initiative took shape. We examined figures ranging from employment trends to poverty rates. We conducted detailed industry cluster analyses. We examined strengths in emerging technologies, the effectiveness of workforce programs, ways to employ smart energy and smart growth as well as opportunities to extend our global reach. Data couldn't tell the whole story, though. We needed to go to the source: local communities, business leaders, academic institutions and workforce development organizations, to name only a few. During 90 work sessions and meetings, 975 participants shared their insights and gave suggestions for transforming the region's economy. The result was an in-depth understanding of the region's unique challenges and opportunities. After months of analysis, meetings and discussion, we had a clear picture of those sectors of the economy that will be essential to the region's future as well as the leading indicators that show the potential for growth and renewal with investment from the Upstate Revitalization Initiative. The Southern Tier is poised for transformation. We are optimistic about our future. Natural resources Crossroads Diverse economy Vibrant, healthy communities Academic powerhouses Histor y of innovation Entrepreneurial attitude Global reach Manufacturing prowess Public-private partnerships T ourism destinations Intellectual capital Leadership Ripe for renewal through URI investmentSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 21 What challenges do we face? An aging population. The Southern Tier has an increasingly older population, which has important implications for the economy and creates gaps in essential workforce fields. The number of residents ages 60-79 increased by 18% between 2000 and 2013, compared to 17% in New York State as a whole. The population of residents age 80 and older also increased, by 14% in the Southern Tier and 22% in the state. In the next 10 years, these populations are expected to rise 15% and 6%, respectively, compared to a decline of 3% in the total Southern Tier population (Cornell PAD Projections). Coupled with losses to younger populations (-11% in residents 20 and under and -5% in residents 20-39), this demographic shift creates challenges for the region. Movement out of the region. In every year since 2001, residents have migrated out of the Southern Tier. In 2014, the region lost 3.9% of its residents, with the highest outward migration in Chemung, Tioga and Steuben counties (8.4%, 6.9% and 6.9%, respectively). Low household income: The median household income in New York State is $58,003. The average of county median household incomes in the Southern Tier region is $48,093, 18.7% lower. In the Southern Tier, Chenango has the lowest median household income ($43,941), followed by Delaware ($44,470) and Broome ($45,958). High portion of income spent on rent. Compared with 34% in 2000, 43% of the Southern Tier's residents spent more than a third of their monthly income on rent in 2013 (ACS 09-13). Students make up a high proportion of renters in the region. High rents in the areas with the most students (Broome County and Tompkins County) can deter graduates from remaining in the region. High concentrations of poverty in distressed communities. Several distressed Southern Tier communities have seen population decline by 1-5% since the 2000 Census. Binghamton has the highest portion of residents below the poverty line, but all of the region's distressed communities have large fractions of residents living in poverty and median household incomes far lower than the state median of $58,003.Source: American Community Survey, 2009-2013 Southern Tier population by age group Source: Cornell PAD Average Southern Tier migration (annual)22 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanOld housing stock. More than a third of the region's housing stock was built before 1939. In some areas, this proportion is even higher; 71% of housing in Hornell, 61% in Norwich, 38% in Corning and 40% in Elmira was built before 1939. In Binghamton, 53% of housing was built before 1939 and less than 5% was built since 2000 (ACS 09-13). Just 6% of the Southern Tier's housing was built since 2000. Quality of housing is important to young families and Millennials, and a lack of adequate and affordable ownership and renting options can deter job-seekers from moving here. Vulnerable and hard-to-place workers. There were 60,965 residents living in poverty in the Southern Tier in 2013, with an average labor force participation rate of 46%, just below the 49% at the state level. The average unemployment rate among those living in poverty was 26%, compared to an unemployment rate of 8% for all socio-economic groups. Broome County and Tompkins County had the largest number of individuals living below the poverty line, 19,531 and 14,300, with unemployment rates of 29% and 11% among this population, respectively. However, Tioga County and Chenango County have the highest rates of unemployment among those living in poverty, 36% and 31%. This compares to the statewide rate of 30%.Source: U.S. Census Bureau 99 New YorkAlbanySyracuseRochester Buffalo Hornell Endicott Johnson City Hornell $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Distressed communitiesSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 23Our region is home to more than 26,500 veterans, and 7,306 were unemployed in 2013, yielding an unemployment rate of more than 30% in the Southern Tier. Veteran unemployment is more pronounced in rural areas and lower in urban areas; in Binghamton, Ithaca, Corning and Elmira, veteran unemployment was 11% or lower (ACS 09-13). A shrinking labor force. Since 2000, the Southern Tier lost 6% of its labor force, even as the state and nation saw growth of 5% and 9%, respectively. Every county in the region, with the exception of Tompkins, lost labor force during this period. Broome and Chemung lost the most, 10%, followed by Delaware, Schuyler and Tioga, with 9% loss each. As the labor force declines, it inhibits the ability of firms to fill available or new positions, and thus constrains economic growth. Employment is down in key industries of strength. Manufacturing, a bedrock of the Southern Tier economy, has lost 35% in employment since 2000. Though still the second-largest employment sector behind healthcare, this loss reflects the larger national shift away from production and toward service industries as economic drivers. Long-term job loss. The region has lost more than 16,000 jobs since 2000, with a loss of more than 3,900 just since 2009. The Southern Tier lagged behind statewide job growth, as state jobs have increased by 6% since 2000. Greater Binghamton lost the most jobs, more than 12,500 and 16% of all current jobs, since 2000. Chenango, Schuyler and Tompkins were the only counties to gain jobs during the decade, with Tompkins contributing a net increase of 2,150 jobs (NYS DOL). Lower average wage than the state. The average wage in the Southern Tier was just over $43,700 in 2014, an 8% increase from 2010. However, this was below the New York State average wage of $65,900. An additional challenge is that of the top five industries by employment in the Southern Tier, only two had average wages above the state (manufacturing and educational services). While the cost of living is lower in the Southern Tier than other parts of the state, the lower average wage earned for occupations in the Southern Tier is a barrier to attracting talent from outside of the state. Lower average wages in key population centers. The average wage in Binghamton across all industries was just over $40,400 in 2014 \u2014 below the average wage for the region and far below the average for the state. Elmira's average wage was on par with the regional average. Corning had the highest average wage of all the metropolitan areas at $51,400, while Ithaca had an average wage of $47,700. Competitive wages are essential for attracting talent and population, and represent an even more critical need for the Southern Tier's urban areas (QCEW, 2014).

Talent and workforce A highly educated population. More than half of the region's population have at least some college experience, 56%, similar to the state's 58% (ACS 09-13). However, a smaller proportion of Southern Tier residents had less than high school diploma (11%) in 2013 compared to the state (15%). This represents a five-point increase from 2000, and with a six-point increase in the proportion of residents with some college experience, indicates that the Southern Tier is on an upward trajectory. Highest proportion of students and graduates in the state. About 13% of Southern Tier residents are undergraduate or graduate students, above the statewide level of 10.2%. Due to the presence of Binghamton University, Cornell University, Corning Community College, Elmira College, Ithaca College, SUNY Broome, SUNY Delhi and Tompkins-Cortland Community College, the Southern Tier is home to 4.5% of all students enrolled in the state, yet just 3.4% of the total population (Census Bureau, 2013). Students drive the economy by living, learning and playing in the Southern Tier, and have the potential to contribute to the economy by joining the workforce or starting businesses. Increasing diversity. The Southern Tier is not as racially diverse as New York State, with 90% white residents compared to 66% at the state level. However, since 2000, the number of white residents in the Southern Tier has declined by 3%, and populations of African-American and other racial/ethnic groups have increased by 24% and 30%, respectively , leading to a more culturally diverse population (ACS 09-13). Economic indicators Movement into the region for select age groups. Chenango, Delaware, Tioga and Tompkins counties all experienced slight growth in the number of residents under the age of 20 moving into the region from a different state, likely a reflection of the healthy higher education industry. However, Chemung and Tioga also experienced growth in the number of adults in the 20-39 and 40-59 age groups moving from other states, and Tompkins had an increase of 1.6 percentage points in the number of 20- to 39-year-olds moving from abroad (Census Bureau, 2013). This shift may be an early indication that the loss of young people experienced by the region during the past few decades may be counteracted by movement into the region. Movement into distressed areas. Chemung and Steuben counties, including the metro areas of Corning and Elmira, saw 2.3% of their total populations move from out of state, second only to Tompkins County in the region and above the regional average. Though the populations in Hornell and Norwich are small, relatively large proportions of select age groups are relocating to these cities from other counties or outside the state. In Hornell, 6.2% of 20- to 39-year-olds moved from a different county in New York, and 9.7% did the same in Norwich \u2014 the highest proportions other areas in the Southern Tier. In addition, 5.9% of Norwich residents ages 20-39 moved there from out of state, second only to Ithaca' s Source: U.S. Census BureauSouthern Tier proportion of residents moved from different stateSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 258% in the region. Binghamton and the surrounding area continues to struggle in attracting population, with proportions of residents from other counties and other states lower than the regional average (ACS 09-13). Unemployment down in post-recession years. The Southern Tier's unemployment rate, at 6.1% in 2014, is slightly below state and national unemployment rates (6.3% and 6.2%, respectively). This is down from a 14-year high of 8.4% in 2010, at the height of the recession. All counties in the region have an unemployment rate between 6% and 7%, though Tompkins County had a lower unemployment rate at 4.3% in 2014 (NYS DOL). Employment in service-related industries is rising. Between 2000 and 2014, employment in healthcare, arts and entertainment, and hospitality increased by 16%, 17% and 18%, respectively. The two latter industries support the growing tourism industry in the Southern Tier. Other industries also expanded employment, including company management (7%), other services (10%) and agriculture (13%). Even though wages in these industries remain below the Southern Tier average (the highest average wage in the above industries is $40,800 in healthcare, below the regional average of $43,714) (NYS DOL), expanded employment opportunities drive economic growth and are balanced by the lower cost of living. The region has strong industry clusters in manufacturing and agriculture. Manufacturing is an area of strength for the Southern Tier in terms of institutional knowledge and employment, and contributes more than $2 billion to the region in payroll each year (QCEW, 2014). Moreover, manufacturing had one of the highest average wages in the Southern Tier at $61,800 in 2014, 41% above the regional average of $43,700. Manufacturing employs the second-highest number of residents in the Southern Tier, making up 13% of total workers in the region (above the 5% and 9% for the state and nation). The location quotient for manufacturing is 2.5, indicating a concentration of manufacturing in the regional economy. In subsets of the manufacturing industry, location quotients are higher; transportation equipment manufacturing has a location quotient of nearly 9, illustrating a long history of success in the region thanks to companies such as Corning Incorporated, Raymond Corporation, Borg Warner, Lockheed Martin and Dresser-Rand. Manufacturing accounts for the most exports out of the region, more than $11.6 billion in 2013 (EMSI), nearly a third of total regional exports. The manufacturing industry boasts high annual wages at $60,862 in the overall advanced manufacturing industry; and $73,800 in the transportation equipment manufacturing cluster. Agriculture is one of America's most profitable industries. The Southern Tier is home to more than 6,600 farms and possesses agricultural assets ranging from Cornell' s commitment to Source: NYS DOL Unemployment rate (2000-14) High-growth, high-wage industries (2009-13)26 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planthe industry in Cornell Cooperative Extension to the thriving dairy industry to unparalleled access to water. These advantages have allowed for growth in the region's agriculture and food manufacturing industries. Employment in food manufacturing has grown 41% since 2009 with more than 1,000 net new jobs, while the food processing cluster increased employment by 18% over the same time period (UBRI). The location quotient for agriculture and forestry is 1.9, indicating a strong presence in the economy, and food manufacturing contributes nearly $4 billion in exports to the regional economy, while crop and animal exports contribute over $830 million (EMSI). The eight counties of the Southern Tier regularly rank in the top 10 counties across the state for crop production, and they sold more than $165 million in crops in 2012 (Agriculture Census, 2012). This strong agricultural base feeds into other key food and agriculture industries of the Southern Tier including, but not limited to, dairy, organics, premium beverage processing and value-added food processing. Overall, the agriculture and food system produces $5.2 billion in output for the Southern Tier, or 9.5% of the region's total economy. Gross regional production is on the rise, with an estimated increase in gross regional product of nearly 15% between 2011 and 2013. In 2013, the total gross regional product was $28.2 billion (EMSI, 2013), and it stood at $27.3 billion in 2012. Despite losses to the high-export manufacturing industry, the region is expanding economically. Increase in number of small private firms. The increase in small firms compared to a decrease in large firms is an indicator of the strength of small business in the Southern Tier, as well as the growing and healthy entrepreneurial community. In the years since the recession, the Southern Tier has seen a net increase of 186 in the number of private firms. Net firm growth between 2009 and 2014 varied by county; Broome, Schuyler , Steuben, Chenango, and Delaware lost firms (QCEW, 2014).

I-88 cuts across the eastern portion of the region and up to Albany, I-99 connects the region with population centers in Pennsylvania. On the western end of the Southern Tier Region is I-390, an important corridor to Rochester, Buffalo and in particular the Canadian markets. On the eastern end of the region, Binghamton serves as a gateway to New York City and the East Coast via Route 17. The region is also home to rail exchanges. This transportation infrastructure allows products manufactured in the Southern Tier to ship to markets outside of the region, and facilitates intra- and inter-region travel. Tourism destination The Southern Tier attracts more tourists every year. From the Corning Museum of Glass, which enjoys an estimated 450,000 visits a year and $12.4 million in visitor revenue, to the Watkins Glen Racetrack and the waterfalls of Ithaca, the region has a lot to offer tourists. In addition, the Southern Tier is the southern gateway to the Finger Lakes, which attract thousands of visitors annually to the wineries, breweries, distilleries, water sporting activities, natural attractions and beautiful waterfront communities on Cayuga, Seneca and Keuka lakes. Visitor spending reached $.87 billion in 2013, representing an 18% rise from where it was two years earlier \u2014 notably more than the 12% increase reported across upstate, and on par with New York State's 18% increase. The region is also home to more than 60,000 college students, who have a link to the region's tourism industry via the many visitors who come to drop off students, attend campus events such as family weekends and homecomings and to tour schools. By better connecting these students, their families and college visitors to tourism opportunities in the region, the Southern Tier has the potential to increase its tourism revenue dramatically.

As the URI plan was developed, the Southern Tier closely consulted those communities that are distressed as a result of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and the summer floods of 2013. Each initiative in the plan provides an opportunity for these communities to benefit from both the NYRCR program, as well as the dynamic changes expected to occur in the Southern Tier with an infusion of URI funding. The targeted communities include the following: n T ioga County: The Town of Nichols, Village of Nichols, Town of Owego, Village of Owego and Town of Tioga n Broome County: The City of Binghamton, Town of Union, Town of Conklin, Town of Vestal, Village of Johnson City and Village of Endicott n Delaware County: The Villages of Sidney and Margaretville Brownfield opportunity areas: Southern Tier REDC Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA): There are eight BOAs in the Southern Tier. During the URI planning process, serious consideration was given to ways the region could advance the BOA plans to transform properties that contribute to blight into catalysts for community revitalization, particularly in Elmira, Norwich, Binghamton and Johnson City . Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 29Strong innovative culture The research, teaching, training and networking resources of the region's higher educational institutions, especially Cornell University, Binghamton University, Ithaca College, Elmira College, Corning Community College, SUNY Broome, Tompkins Cortland Community College and SUNY Delhi, represent a powerful engine that can accelerate the Southern Tier's innovation economy. The region's colleges and universities, which educate more than 60,000 students annually and graduate more than 17,500 students each year , employ more than 4,100 faculty members. The region's innovative performance has grown, with higher levels of R&D, more patents, and more STEM graduates. Per capita R&D spending is up nearly 50% since 2000, though it has dipped slightly since 2010. Patents are also growing, up 24% since 2000. Meanwhile, 34% of graduates in the region are awarded a STEM degree \u2014 up from 22% in 2000 and 31% in 2010. The Southern Tier has an innovation index of 104.2, as compared to New York State at 98.5. This is attributed to world-class research universities such as Cornell and Binghamton, as well as private sector businesses with strong R&D activity such as Corning Incorporated and Lockheed Martin. This is further exemplified by the 1,732 utility patents filed between 2009 and 2013, and R&D expenditures of $922.4 million during the same period. Since the Southern Tier Startup Alliance (Hot Spot) began programming in 2014, more than 3,100 entrepreneurs have attended networking, presentations and workshops at one of the alliance's partner incubators. As the two newest incubators (Rev: Ithaca Startup Works and IncubatorWorks in Elmira/Horseheads) grow and as the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator opens, the number of entrepreneurs in the region is also expected to rise. The Southern Tier has a robust innovative culture, with levels of R&D, patents and STEM graduates that surpass the national average.30 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan Innovative culture Source: Reference USA; NYS Department of Labor, UB Regional InstituteSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 31Section III. Vision and Initiatives Southern Tier's overall vision Building on a strong foundation of existing businesses and higher education institutions, the Southern Tier uses a collaborative approach to leverage its globally competitive advantages to attract talent and investment for the development of industry clusters. Our focus will be on increasing the size and prosperity of the region's workforce through new business creation based on high-technology discoveries and other entrepreneurship activities, while ensuring healthy communities and protecting the region's natural beauty and resources. Vision for the Southern Tier's Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan The Southern Tier will no longer be just a region in upstate New York. The Upstate Revitalization Initiative award will be the spark that ignites the Southern Tier to once again become a hotbed of innovation and vigorous business growth and a destination for the next generations of the nation's best and brightest talent. Strategies to Increase Regional Wealth Build the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem The Greater Binghamton Area will be a destination for talent and new business development. Revitalized urban centers and transformed neighborhoods will maintain the area's legacy and position it as a major gateway, with strengths in advanced manufacturing, healthcare and high-technology development. Invest in the Advanced Manufacturing Industry A focus on advanced manufacturing and the transportation sector will result in the Southern Tier being recognized as a destination for manufacturing business development, distinguished by its concentration of multi-national anchor companies, advanced infrastructure to support innovation and technology, rich education and research resources, specialized skilled workforce and vibrant communities. Transform the Food and Agriculture Industry The Southern Tier will be a world-recognized leader in agriculture technology and serve as a key food supplier for the East Coast of the United States. A strategic mix of projects will transform and grow agriculture and food production, processing and distribution across the region, while also strengthening links to growing tourism and manufacturing industries. Promote the Southern Tier's Innovative Culture The Southern Tier will be a well-recognized and highly desirable place to learn, visit, live and grow a business because the region's distinct combination of educational strength, culture, innovation, leisure-related industries and natural resources creates a lifestyle that couples the convenience of larger cities with opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle surrounded by natural beauty. 32 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanVulnerable and hard-to-place workers The Great Recession, compounded by the Southern Tier's slow economic turnaround, has been particularly difficult for hard-to-place workers, ranging from veterans to those in an impoverished financial and social situation. The Southern Tier recognizes that this is a critically important issue, and is magnified in the more distressed communities throughout the region. As described in the Situation Analysis, there were 60,965 Southern Tier residents living in poverty in 2013, with an average labor force participation rate of 46%, just below the 49% at the state level. The average unemployment rate among those living in poverty was 26%, compared to an unemployment rate of 8% for all socioeconomic groups. Our region is home to more than 26,500 veterans, of whom 30% are unemployed. This is predominantly in rural areas, which is an important factor as we consider the importance of the agriculture industry in the Southern Tier. We don't believe a one-size-fits-all approach can be applied to the unemployed, underemployed and hard-to-place workers throughout the region. Rather, we have planned for a multi-pronged approach to engage hard-to-place workers based on geographic location, demand, traditional training and placement programs, links with academic and civic organizations and unique job training opportunities based on particular industry sectors. Throughout the four initiatives presented in this URI plan, there are specific activities described that will involve the hard-to-place worker in the Southern Tier's economic revitalization. Below is a summary of such activities. More detail is provided in each of the four initiatives. Overall activities to be integrated across initiatives: n SUNY Broome, Tompkins Cortland Community College, Corning Community College and SUNY Delhi have expertise in providing training required by local employers, and as a result of the URI planning process are working even closer together to develop specialized programs in high-growth areas to help ensure a workforce that' s in sync with the needs of companies throughout the region. n The BOCES and VESID offices throughout the region will be engaged in an even more active way by joining with the private sector to sponsor job fairs and training programs across the region that are focused on low-income and disabled residents as well as veterans. Raymond Corp. already employs this successful approach and it will be duplicated. Specifically , the company participates in job fairs for the homeless and works closely with VESID to assist in the development of job skills for the disabled. n V eterans affairs offices at each SUNY campus, which provide assistance to veterans in the college environment. SUNY Broome's Manufacturing Technology Lab exemplifies the regional community colleges' dedication to workforce development. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 33Build the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem: The Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will focus on reversing outmigration, training hard-to-place workers and attracting talent to rebuild its urban communities. There are three major activities that will focus on workforce training for hard-to-place workers: n The Salvation Army Job Training Center will be a game-changing project in the heart of the most impoverished section of Binghamton's urban core. In this new facility, the Salvation Army will provide life skills and job training programs that have been successful in the Central New York region. n Services for recent immigrants will be provided through the American Civic Association, which assists immigrants in their acculturation to America and offers English lessons. n SUNY Broome is well positioned to provide specialized training programs in high growth, high-wage \"technician\" occupations that complement \u2014 and of fer entry into \u2014 the more advanced and highly technical opportunities proposed, particularly in healthcare and advanced manufacturing. SUNY Broome will provide basic technical skills needed in manufacturing such as blueprint reading, as well as \"soft skill\" training. The college' s plans also call for new programs that support the innovation economy. A histological technician certificate program will soon be launched, as will a certificate program for physical therapy aides. A new associate degree in manufacturing technology has been designed in response to local labor market demands. Programs in energy technology, mechatronics and aircraft maintenance also are in development. In addition, SUNY Broome will work with local employers to provide on-the-job-training to complement this basic skills training. SUNY Broome also will undertake another unique approach by building \"laddered credential-certification-degree\" options for the hard-to-place worker . Invest in the Advanced Manufacturing Industry: A significant challenge to the growth of advanced manufacturing in the Southern Tier is the inability of the sector to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled college graduates. The exodus of college graduates is among the region's most pressing economic problems. There is a particular interest in employing the veteran in the advanced manufacturing industry . The following will be undertaken to train, recruit and place veterans and other hard-to-place workers. n T o better and more efficiently match employers with community college, college and university graduates of manufacturing-related programs, a consortium of colleges in the Southern Tier plans to undertake the creation of a central digital repository of prospective jobs and internships. This consortium, SUNY Broome, SUNY Delhi and Binghamton University, will create a pilot that may be scalable across the Southern Tier and New York State. Integrating manufacturers, colleges and students into a consistently updated repository will make the process of linking students and graduates with employment and internship options transparent, efficient and timely , a win-win for employers, graduates and the Southern Tier. n SUNY Broome will develop a Specialized Technician Training Opportunities Program that leverages synergies among academia, target industries and workforce development systems. Training will be linked to stated needs of regional companies and input from SUNY Broome's Workforce Development Advisory Board. Job skills training will emphasize basic skills, special needs and sustainable/green practices 34 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planin manufacturing. The program will offer stand-alone certificates recognized by local employers, and therefore, hard-to-place workers will be more likely to participate in and complete training programs that bolster their hiring qualifications. n The Southern Tier Small Manufacturing Competitiveness Fund is designed for new and existing small manufacturing companies (less than 20 employees) to allow them to innovate, adapt, increase productivity and efficiency to remain competitive in the global marketplace, and to create employment opportunities for local hard-to-place workers. The fund will target business growth in areas with the highest concentration of impoverished persons; specifically target census tracks in Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Endicott, Hornell, Johnson City and Norwich; as well as rural areas identified in Chenango County, Delaware, Steuben, and Tioga County. n The Advanced Rail Technology Center project in Hornell will provide job opportunities for hard-to-place workers, including veterans and low-income residents, and promote inclusive growth by using the manufacturing district as a platform to redevelop adjoining distressed neighborhoods. It will create educational, employment and other opportunities in Hornell. n Raymond Corporation is among the largest employers in the region with 1,400 workers and it routinely engages in a variety of employment creation opportunity activities for the hard-to-place worker , such as participating in a job fair for the homeless and assisting in the development of job skills for the disabled through VESID. The Southern Tier recognizes the importance of engaging the hard-to-place worker in its future economy, and we must work hard continue placing an emphasis on hands-on training provided by both the private companies, community colleges, BOCES and other workforce development programs. Transform the Food and Agriculture Industry: n The Southern Tier Agriculture Development Fund will provide support to pioneering workforce development programs, with a focus on regional residents, hard-to-place workers and veterans. The fund will sponsor training programs for farmers. It will also support innovative and high-growth food and agriculture industries such as beef feeder cattle, wine-making, controlled environment agriculture, renewable energy , veterinary care, processing and agri-tourism. Jobs in these industries on average have higher wages than traditional farming (most near or above the regional average of $46,000), and provide opportunities for regional residents, including veterans and low-income residents. n The Energy W orkforce Development Program will work with researchers, companies and workers to cultivate a skilled workforce versed in using new technologies developed through existing state programs run through NYSERDA, as well as 76West. The project will prioritize training for hard-to-place workers and will be synergistic with the Cornell Controlled Environment Training Program.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 35Section IV. Process and Guiding Principles Our approach The region as a whole came together with an unprecedented level of energy , creativity and diversity. Our approach to developing the Southern Tier's Upstate Revitalization Plan was based on six guiding precepts. n Consider the Southern Tier as a whole, the sum of its strengths and competitive advantages and the dynamics that will drive innovation and transformation. n Look deep and objectively to confront established thinking and face our challenges head-on, understanding that creative tensions must occur in order for new ideas to emerge. n Have the foresight and courage to embrace the opportunities that are within our grasp and view them through a new set of lenses. n Unabashedly and boldly undertake a set of initiatives that will forever transform the Southern T ier. n Understand the importance of natural resources, place, talent and innovation in the planning process. n Build lasting bonds to sustain the expected change by bringing together the right people, academic institutions, private and not-for-profit organizations and municipal leaders to drive transformation and reshape the Southern Tier's future. Guiding principles The Southern Tier's Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan will be: 1. Driven by one vision and embrace strategic initiatives that build the region' s economy without regard to political boundaries. 2. V isionary, transformational, measurable and self-sustaining on a long-term basis. 3. Clearly linked to the key strategic objectives and measures for success set forth in the Southern Tier strategic economic development plan. 4. A set of initiatives that leverage our world-class assets such as Cornell and Binghamton universities, industry leaders in manufacturing and commercialization of technology, tourism destinations, agriculture and more. 5. Identify meaningful ways for the Southern Tier to continue to be supportive of other state-wide economic development initiatives such as Smart Growth, Complete Streets, Start-Up NY, Hot Spots, Global NY, Opportunity Agenda, Veteran's Initiative, SUNY 2020, Cleaner Greener, NY Rising, Industry Cluster Program, Southern Tier Agriculture Initiative, 76 West, NY-BEST and Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) Redevelopment plan.36 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanPhilosophy Our objective was to develop a dynamic plan that would maximize the innovation and intellectual capital of our private-sector and academic institutions, advance commercialization of technology, leverage private investment, engage in meaningful public-private sector partnerships, value and promote entrepreneurship at all levels and directly support the expansion of our industry drivers with a highly skilled workforce, physical infrastructure and vibrant communities. Maximize intellectual capital: It has been nearly 70 years since Vannevar Bush articulated the importance of research and development to the growth of the economy , a belief that was later expanded by many economists to include the development of new knowledge. Knowledge, they said, is as important as labor and capital, and generates 5-80 percent of all economic growth. The Southern Tier has a rich history and passion for innovation and technology, and our region's academic institutions and corporations are havens of knowledge. Our primary source of innovation for the future will be bold ideas that are implemented in the marketplace as a new product or in an organization as a new process or system. The research, teaching, training, clinical study, testing and networking resources of private companies such as Corning Incorporated and Lockheed Martin, together with Cornell University and Binghamton University and our healthcare institutions, collectively represent a powerful engine that can accelerate the region's innovation economy. Innovation at the local level: Innovation can begin at the community level and penetrate many aspects of our daily life. Actions can be taken at the local level to measure, support and develop an innovation community. At the same time, we cannot lose sight of the importance of diversity, tolerance, vibrancy and entrepreneurship at the local level that focuses on small business development, Main Street revitalization, historic preservation and the local creative economy. This approach assumes that all businesses and organizations have the opportunity and capability to be innovative, not just those driven by or dependent upon science and technology . Furthermore, workforce strategies, especially tactics designed to attract Millennials, young professionals and young families, align directly with these innovation strategies. Find a place that supports the creative and innovative economy, and you will find young people. They are attracted by the type of work, by the culture and by the quality of life. Meaningful public-private partnerships: Only by working together will the Southern Tier be successful in bringing about real change that is transformational and lasting. It is true that in Southern Tier's economy there is not adequate private capital to pay the high price of assembling and preparing appropriate sites for redevelopment, investing in basic infrastructure to support business expansion and planning for the workforce of the future. Simultaneously , local governments cannot bear the costs of public infrastructure and facilities so important to creating the environment businesses need to attract talent. Joint endeavors in all of the proposed initiatives will bring new knowledge to the marketplace whether that is in advanced manufacturing, new agricultural technologies, entrepreneurial activities or promoting our region through tourism. Such partnerships also will be essential if we are serious about undertaking revitalization of our aged downtowns and waterfronts, and converting obsolete or underutilized land to more productive uses. History has shown us that without such partnerships such projects frequently are too economically and physically complex.The research, teaching, training, clinical study, testing and networking resources of private companies, together with universities and our healthcare institutions, represent a powerful engine that can accelerate the region's innovation economy. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 37 Elements of a vibrant community Career opportunities Strong central cores Access to goods and services Multi-modal transportation options Affordable housing High-quality healthcare Education Recreational assets Natural resources Business conditionsElements of a vibrant community Career opportunities Strong central coresAccess to goods and services Multi-modal transportation options Affordable housing High-quality healthcare EducationRecreational assetsNatural resourcesBusiness conditionsBuilding on natural assets: One of the Southern Tier's greatest assets is its water, with rivers such as the Chemung, Cohocton, Canisteo, Susquehanna, Chenango, Delaware and Tioughnioga running through and the Finger Lakes of Keuka, Seneca and Cayuga in the northern portion of the region. The region sits at the confluence of a number of watersheds, including the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (the largest in the nation), New York City Watershed and the Great Lakes Watershed. In a time when many other states in the U.S. are battling drought, the Southern Tier's water makes it unique and poised to fill gaps in agricultural production. Value of entrepreneurship: We identified opportunities for innovation in the social and technological realms, and sought out best practices on how to leverage university and corporate R&D assets to encourage and support innovation and entrepreneurship. The region will create and sustain a culture that will attract young people and support the successful commercialization of new products and services, leading to job creation. Return of vibrancy to our communities: Quality of life is critically important to the private sector. Our human capital and institutional resources will ultimately depend on having vibrant urban cores. Vibrant communities have the capacity to improve perceptions of the region; without them private investment, new residents, innovation and entrepreneurship will be difficult to capture. Therefore, we must create attractive public realms that celebrate our heritage, and that simultaneously speak to our walkable communities and availability and diversity in housing. Workforce: Workforce and economic development are interdependent. The demographics of the Southern Tier point to the necessity of attracting new, younger workers and their families to the area, while the availability of jobs is a primary driver in their location decisions. The Southern Tier has the competitive advantage of attracting more than 60,000 students to its outstanding higher education institutions each year. As these students graduate, we are poised to keep them in our region to work at thriving businesses or start one of their own. Also framing the issue are the preferences of Millennials, who demand a community and lifestyle that includes robust cultural assets, vibrant downtown and community life, walkability and public transportation. Upstate New York appeals because of the abundant natural areas and recreation opportunities, but rural areas across the country are also facing the same issues of retaining/attracting workers where these other items are concerned. Therefore, this task will also be closely aligned with the need to reflect a dynamic culture. On the employer side of the equation, business owners are concerned about the availability of skilled labor, with middle-level or advanced skills in the science, engineering, technology and mathematics disciplines, as well as appropriate soft skills. Therefore, it is not enough to retain and attract young people; the employers and the region more broadly must retain and attract educated, skilled, young people.38 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanPublic engagement We understood the plan would need to evolve from the contributions of groups throughout the region that shared STREDC's vision, were informed about the council's strategic objectives and priorities and were committed to generating ideas that would produce significant and measurable return on investment by New York State, as well as local private- and public-sector partners. More than 975 individuals participated in 90 work group sessions, WebEx sessions, small group meetings and surveys. All meetings were driven by the same agenda, which focused on how the Southern Tier could use its assets and \"innovation cultivators\" to harness opportunities, accelerate public/private investment, create job opportunities, advance regional competitiveness and create the magnetism to draw and keep young, skilled workforce participants. Ideas also were collected through more than 100 white papers submitted for consideration.The focus continued to be on development of initiatives that would form the framework for the Southern Tier's URI Plan; that is, strategies that would fill voids in the region's innovation infrastructure and guide the region's future. Stakeholders from throughout the Southern Tier agreed that the contours of a URI \"action plan\" would need to: 1. Capture and exploit the region's existing innovation drivers; specifically, our world- class universities and major corporations that have the capacity to infuse emerging technologies to advance key industry sectors 2. Leverage existing resources; particularly our natural resources 3. Strengthen the workforce and pursue talent4. Create a dynamic community infrastructure and culture5. Create an innovative and creative culture that will be a magnet for business recruitment, entrepreneurs and young talent After agreeing on a preliminary group of four initiatives, the Regional Council sought the opinion of the broader public via an online survey. More than 500 people participated and there was strong support for each of the four initiatives. n Build the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem Initiative: 83% n Invest in the Advanced Manufacturing Industry: 86% n T ransform the Food and Agriculture Industry: 89% n Promote the Southern T ier's Innovative Culture: 88%During this plan's collaborative development, more than 975 people participated in work group sessions, WebEx sessions, small group meetings and surveys. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 39Decision-making process The council reviewed the proposed initiatives and projects, subjected them to the test described below, and revised them as necessary, so they would incorporate more potent and attractive features. Criteria for selection of initiatives based on expected outcomes Maximize leveraged funds; specifically, 5:1 ratio of private/local to New York State. Direct contribution to the Southern Tier's net increase in wealth and evidence that the associated jobs are wealth generating; that is, pay more than regional average by job category or profession. Note that attention must be paid to unemployed, underemployed and hard-to-place workers (veterans, convicted felons, etc.). Measurable outcomes that will gain national attention such as creation of jobs with competitive salaries and exciting career tracks, private investment in business expansion and new business development that outpaces the national average, renewed entrepreneurial spirit, expansion and development of major destinations for leisure and recreation, and revitalized civic and cultural centers that are attractive to a young and talented workforce. High-impact results that contribute to an enhanced image and compelling message that the Southern Tier offers a dynamic and competitive business environment: highly qualified and talented pool of workers, infrastructure capacity, intellectual capital, innovation and technology acceleration, state-of-the-art shovel-ready sites and effective public-private partnerships. Direct link or support of other NYS economic development programs and initiatives such as Start-Up NY, regional Hot Spot and Smart Growth with elements such as climate change disaster preparedness and response, energy efficiency and sustainability. Position industry sectors to expand and capture domestic and global markets. Position and promote the region's quality of life, particularly as an appealing and desirable place to live and work for young and highly qualified workers because it offers an attractive work-life balance, affordable cost of living and growth opportunities. Identify opportunities to include vacant or underutilized New York State properties. Demonstrate \"readiness\" as evidenced by such factors as involvement and investment by universities and colleges, commitment of private-sector investment, public-private partnerships, organizational structure to administer the initiative, etc. Questions with which to \"test\" the proposed game-changing investments and projects were: Do the projects align or fit within an ecosystem of any emerging vital initiatives? Do the projects achieve the highest possible leverage for the users? Do they fit well with the emerging social and technological context? Under what circumstances are the projects economically viable, e.g. market demand, subsidy, redistribution of existing resources in a new way? Do the projects offer a good fit with the strategic capability of the region as it is or could be? Are there potential investors, anchors, champions for the project, and if so, under what circumstances? 40 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanSection V.

Greater Binghamton' s three unique downtown districts \u2014 Endicott, Johnson City and Binghamton \u2014 have been united for more than a century by common waterways, transportation networks, anchor institutions, commerce, government and social services. Once known as the \"Valley of Opportunity,\" this area has a rich history of innovation and global business development led by IBM, Endicott-Johnson and Link. The demise of Endicott-Johnson and the departure of IBM left Greater Binghamton with high unemployment and blighted industrial properties. But their legacy also lies in strong cultural institutions, pioneering research and education in health sciences and engineering at Binghamton University, organizations such as the Southern Tier Start-up Alliance, a strong healthcare sector and globally competitive companies. Evidence of the impact of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Leo can be seen in all three communities in the Innovation Ecosystem, which are designated NY Rising Reconstruction Communities. Despite the significant redevelopment that has taken place since 2012, much more work is needed to restore Binghamton, Johnson City and Endicott so they can once again be vibrant communities. A fresh approach to economic revitalization, one that builds on the Brookings Institution's Innovation District concept, will help Greater Binghamton capitalize on its assets in higher education, healthcare and advanced manufacturing. The model articulated by Brookings calls for leading-edge anchor institutions and companies to cluster and connect with start-ups, business incubators and accelerators. Greater Binghamton's physically compact and Susquehanna River Chenango River 17 17 $ $ $$$ $$ $ The three iDistricts in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem are strategically located in the most highly distressed areas to address the challenges of declining population, unemployment, poverty and blight. Greater Binghamton44 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plantransit-accessible communities will offer mixed-use housing, office and retail to support the anticipated business growth and influx of talent. City of Binghamton iDistrict: The Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator, set to open in 2016, will drive the City of Binghamton iDistrict. Binghamton University and its partners are building this facility with space for research, education and entrepreneurship. The incubator and its firms, focused on alternative energy, electronics and health, will spark a tech innovation culture in the city and connect that Binghamton neighborhood to retail, real estate, arts and government activities throughout the region. Signature investments for mixed-use housing, waterfront development, business development projects such as a food business accelerator and hub teamed with SUNY Broome and Cornell University, Triple Cities Makerspace and the LUMA Projection-Computer Mapping Inc. will further cultivate the innovation district. Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict: The Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park will drive the Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict, a cohesive community of academic and healthcare anchor institutions, healthcare-related businesses, cultural amenities and residents. Interprofessional education, enhanced healthcare, internationally recognized research initiatives and opportunities for biotech industry will be signatures of this iDistrict. The park will set the stage for collaborative relationships with partners focused on research, education and training. The Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park will enable the translation of health sciences-based research into opportunities for pharmaceutical product development and other healthcare applications.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 45Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict: The Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict will be driven by the new Flexible Printed Electronics Technology and Industrial 3D Printing Centers and major anchors such as BAE Systems. The Endicott iDistrict will establish Greater Binghamton as the preeminent place for flexible hybrid electronics and manufacturing with thin, flexible-glass technology. Establishing a shared hub for advanced manufacturing technology accessible at lower cost than what companies can afford to provide alone creates a value proposition for companies to establish operations in Endicott. Companies such as National Pipe and Plastics already have announced plans to relocate to Endicott. The commercial and cultural attributes of the community, designed in the pre-suburban era, will attract new employees and residents. Transform Greater Binghamton Fund: Municipal governments and economic development organizations will respond to consumer demand and stimulate additional private investment with the Transform Greater Binghamton Fund, which will support high-density development in Greater Binghamton's urban communities. Private developers plan to convert old warehouses in Johnson City into mixed-use housing, new businesses are blooming in Binghamton and tech start-ups are focusing on vacant industrial spaces in Endicott. Invest in advanced manufacturing, healthcare and STEM education: Proposed investments in regional strengths in advanced manufacturing, healthcare and STEM education are in line with national areas of economic importance. Greater Binghamton is the proud birthplace of technological innovations that have transformed the world, including virtual reality and flight simulation. The region continues to be a leader in transportation, electronics and aerospace manufacturing. We will build upon our system of hospitals and the growth in healthcare jobs that has helped to offset our loss of manufacturing jobs. By training students in STEM fields, we will prepare the workforce of the future. There is a buzz, a recognition that Greater Binghamton is on the rise and it is time to invest in our economic and cultural amenities. For instance, Modern Marketing Concepts (MMC) recently announced that it will transform a 42-acre corporate office complex in Greater Binghamton that was the home of Link Flight Simulation. The complex, which has been vacant for more than 20 years, will house an expansion of MMC and other businesses. MMC expects to add 600 new employees. We have many entities at the table, working on strategies to leverage New York State's Upstate Revitalization Initiative and provide the 5:1 match necessary to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity. Binghamton University, economic development agencies and the private sector have the knowledge, relationships and creativity as well as the continued capacity to cultivate these attributes into the future to drive long-lasting, sustainable change in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem. The Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will reverse outmigration and attract talent to rebuild attractive urban communities that are a cultural hub for the Southern Tier. Greater Binghamton will be a national leader in integrative healthcare. The diversified, advanced manufacturing industry will be flexible and nimble. The Southern Tier's Opportunity Agenda will be advanced with help for distressed communities and hard-to-place workers. There is a buzz, a recognition that Greater Binghamton is on the rise and it is time to invest in our economic and cultural amenities.46 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanFoundation for economic growth in Greater Binghamton Leading indicators and national trends Tomorrow's growth can be found in healthcare, advanced manufacturing and STEM education. Healthcare: Healthcare is among the fastest-growing sectors of our nation's economy with more than $2 trillion spent annually. The coming decade is certain to see advances in areas ranging from personalized medicine to medical device development. Healthcare expenditures make up 18% of the GNP, and this share is projected to rise sharply, with projections of 34% by 2040 1. Healthcare is also one of the fastest-growing occupations2 and among the best paid.3 The Southern Tier Regional Economic Development Council has identified healthcare as a strategic priority for our region, noting that the integration of healthcare providers, higher education and cutting-edge technology is a \"catalytic, collaborative, comprehensive and competitive strategy to transform the Southern Tier.\" 4 Healthcare and social assistance had the largest job gains in any sector from 2005-2010 across the Southern Tier. According to the New York State Department of Labor, there were 2,900 jobs added in the Southern Tier during this period, more than twice that of government, the second-largest sector of growth. The long-term projections for job increase from 2008-2018 for the Southern Tier in healthcare and social assistance is 6,640, with an additional 4,520 jobs in educational services 5. Advanced manufacturing: In addition to healthcare, manufacturing is a dominant force in the Southern Tier. It's the largest export industry in the region at $11.6 billion annually, with nearly a third of all exports. With 34,000 workers, manufacturing remains the third-largest employment sector in the Southern Tier economy. Advanced manufacturing has been identified by the federal government as key for the future for American competitiveness in the global marketplace. 6 Expected worldwide revenues from the advanced sectors of additive manufacturing and 3D printing industry will reach $12.8 billion by 2018.7 According to Wohlers Report 2014, the industry grew to an estimated $3.07 billion in 2013. By 2020, Wohlers Associates forecasts revenues from products and services in the industry to exceed $21 billion. This will be driven by expanded use of the technology for the production of parts that go into final products, with opportunities for production applications orders of magnitude larger than the current usage focused on modeling and prototyping. Jobs in the 3D printing industry are expanding at an explosive rate. Forbes magazine reported that \"35% of all job ads for engineers prioritized 3D printing and additive manufacturing as the most sought-after skill,\" the number of job ads citing 3D printing and manufacturing skills grew 103% year over year from 2013 to 2014 and these jobs are well paid. 8 STEM education: As the region and the country strive to take advantage of these trends in healthcare and manufacturing, a workforce with a strong education in science, technology , engineering and math (STEM) will be vital. STEM occupations are growing almost twice as fast as non-STEM occupations, and they offer higher wages than other jobs. 9 In the Southern Tier, the median annual salary in STEM careers is $65,900, more than 86% higher than the median of all workers in the Southern Tier. 10 The U.S. Department of Education projects rapid job growth in biomedical engineering, health sciences and software development. However , employers say there are not enough qualified workers to fill jobs that require STEM talent.11 In Greater Binghamton, public and private institutions of higher education will work with private industry to bridge this gap. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 47The rise of innovation districts in Greater Binghamton Greater Binghamton's communities have a history of being vital downtown spaces where people live, work, shop and innovate. Unique attributes define our place \u2014 the ethnic heritage of our residents, the Susquehanna and Chenango rivers, the legacies of great companies and products that were built here, and the presence of Binghamton University , which has grown dramatically in size and reputation during the past two decades. The Brookings Institution's adept capture of the new geography of innovation in America resonates with us because we can see the sparks of rebirth in downtown Binghamton that entrepreneurs have brought and residents have responded to enthusiastically . 12 We can also see the patterns of deterioration that arise when industry pulls out of downtowns, as has happened in Endicott and Johnson City. We want to move away from the \"geography of nowhere\" that comes from suburban sprawl, which James Kunstler decried more than 20 years ago 13, and embrace the \"cityness\" of our region \u2014 how our built environment reflects our desires, values and dreams.14 We are inspired by Jane Jacobs' insights into the role that local economy, mixed-use development, diversity and bottom-up planning play in the maintenance of functioning urban ecosystems 15 and the detangling of wealth generation and poverty creation that can often go hand-in-hand in development.16 Greater Binghamton is poised to take a major step forward with URI and leveraged investments in transformative civic infrastructure and targeted, signature projects. The U.S. Economic Development Administration's Innovation Index gives the eight-county Southern Tier region a score of 102.2, which is better than the state (98.5) and the nation (by definition 100). However, if you look at Broome County and adjacent Tioga County, Greater Binghamton's index jumps to 109.1. Greater Binghamton is poised to take a step forward with URI and leveraged investments in transformative civic infrastructure and targeted, signature projects.48 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanIn terms of human capital, Greater Binghamton achieves a score of 1 15 (vs. 97.3 for the state). Elevated levels of higher educational attainment and high-tech employment drive this impressive rating. With a score of 127.6 for productivity and employment, Greater Binghamton is well above the state (106.9). Greater Binghamton also boasts a remarkable number of patents per worker \u2014 an almost 250% higher clip than nationally and statewide. Economic assets/innovation drivers Higher education: The research, teaching, training, clinical study, testing and networking resources of the higher educational institutions in the Southern Tier, notably Binghamton University, Cornell University, Ithaca College, Elmira College, Corning Community College, SUNY Broome and SUNY Delhi, are available to the start-ups, established companies and government agencies in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem. Collectively, they represent a powerful engine that can accelerate the region's innovation economy by inventing engineering processes and material sets; investing in fundamental research that will pave the way for drug discovery and development; creating and applying analytics of needs, trends and service-delivery outcomes; by shaping, delivering and evaluating workforce development training programs; by providing physical space, workflow and workfloor designs and networking reach to and through alumni and sources of capital in support of company formations and expansions, product-line additions and competitiveness. The direct and associated expenditures of Binghamton University alone resulted in an impact of more than $1 billion on Broome and Tioga counties in 2013-14, supporting an additional 6,000 full- and part-time jobs beyond the university' s 5,000-member workforce. The 9,000 Binghamton University undergraduate and graduate students who live off-campus spent more than $124.5 million dollars on rent, food, utilities, transportation and other goods and services. The Association of American Public and Land-grant Universities recently designated Binghamton University an Innovation and Economic Prosperity University . In 2007, the university took a significant step in \"de-anchoring\" itself from its suburban V estal campus by opening the University Downtown Center in Binghamton. It has further invested in facilities in the iDistricts, including the Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing in Endicott (2005), the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator in Binghamton (2016) and the School of Pharmacy and Pharmacological Sciences in Johnson City (2017). The university's presence in the communities is reinforced through programs and personnel of the Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Partnerships, the Small Business Development Center and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Center. Binghamton University is consistently ranked among the top 50 public universities in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. Healthcare sector: Greater Binghamton has a growing, specialized healthcare sector with a geographically extended clientele. Healthcare employs 37,103 people, nearly 12% of the Southern Tier's workforce. 17 United Health Services (UHS) and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital serve as healthcare anchors. Wilson Memorial Regional Medical Center, in Johnson City's Health and Cultural District, is UHS' largest facility with 300 beds. Wilson, a teaching hospital with acute-care specialties and high-tech diagnostics, is the regional trauma center. Encompassing an area that exceeds three village blocks, it is a destination for hundreds of employees, patients and visitors on a 24-hour basis. The adjacent private medical practices and ancillary services add to the number of people and vehicles that come into the heart of Johnson City for health employment and appointments. The Wilson campus has expanded over the years, and new construction continues. Wilson provides clinical placements for Binghamton University and SUNY Broome students and opportunities for faculty collaboration. Greater Binghamton boasts a remarkable number of patents per worker \u2014 an almost 250% higher clip than nationally and statewide.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 49Advanced manufacturing: Globally competitive manufacturing firms focused on high-tech materials and high-value electronics for the commercial, defense and aerospace industry continue as a dominant feature in the Southern Tier economy. Already at Endicott's Huron Campus are leading firms such as BAE Systems, an international defense and aerospace business, and i3 Corporation, which focuses on design and manufacture of high-complexity , high-performance, high-value printed circuit boards, fabrication and assembly , semiconductor packaging, systems integration, advanced laboratory services and contract R&D. In addition to these two companies in Endicott, 11 miles to the west in Owego is a major Lockheed Martin facility. Through Binghamton University's Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging Center, a New York State Center of Excellence, there is an extended global network of manufacturers large and small that have ties to the Endicott area. In the Southern Tier there are Corning Inc., Raymond Corporation, Amphenol and Unison Industries. Within New York State are General Electric, IBM, Ioxus, Custom Electronics and others. Significant national partners include Microsoft and the Mayo Clinic. On a global scale, partners include Samsung, Lumin Dynamics and LG Electronics. Innovation cultivators: Greater Binghamton has a number of well-regarded workforce development institutions as well as a network of resources for cultivating innovation, ranging from informal start-up networking groups to long-established municipal agencies. State University of New York resources in the Southern Tier include Binghamton University, SUNY Broome, SUNY Delhi, Tompkins Cortland Community College and Corning Community College, all of which provide affordable access to higher education. The community colleges in particular are adept at anticipating and responding to diverse individual, community and global needs for lifelong educational opportunities. In Greater Binghamton, SUNY Broome offers workforce training programs for local industry, teaching basic and advanced manufacturing skills to students about to enter the workforce, as well as providing enhanced skills and skills refreshment for experienced workers. SUNY Broome supports the Greater Binghamton innovation ecosystem through investments and programs such as the planned transformation of the historic Carnegie Library in downtown Binghamton into a hospitality center. The college also will construct and equip a student incubator, the SUNY Bridge to Entrepreneurial Excellence (or \"SUNY-BEE\") in the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator. The Broome County Industrial Development Agency (recently renamed The Agency) and the Broome County Local Development Corporation make, spur and syndicate capital investments. They also manage corporate parks and real estate. The Binghamton Local Development Corporation provides low-interest microenterprise, \"Main Street\" fa\u00e7ade and revolving fund loans. The Broome County Land Bank Corporation has the authority to acquire, hold, manage, develop, market and sell distressed, vacant, abandoned (including brownfield) and underutilized properties. As Greater Binghamton's start-up scene heats up, several groups are helping entrepreneurs connect with each other and with services in the region. The Southern Tier Startup Alliance, a state-designated Innovation Hot Spot, brings together the contributions of incubators and entrepreneurial support structures. The Entrepreneurs Alliance, founded in 2015, aims to establish a mentoring and referral network in Greater Binghamton that allows for \"creative collisions\" between participants, thereby fostering ideas, innovation and growth. Triple Cities Makerspace has tools and equipment for wood- and metal-working that can be used for prototyping as well as 3D-printers. And the Alliance for Manufacturing & Technology, a NYSTAR- and U.S. Department of Commerce-funded non-profit, helps small- and mid-size manufacturers and high-tech startups. 50 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe Three iDistricts City of Binghamton iDistrict The City of Binghamton iDistrict is the commerce center of the Greater Binghamton area. Binghamton University has received federal funding and a previous CF A award to undertake the construction of the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator. With the 2016 opening of the incubator, an anchor in the region's Hot Spot program, this iDistrict will become home to start-ups, re-locations and spin-off companies, investors and corporate \"skunkworks\" teams involved in the commercialization of new ideas, business models and technologies emanating from Binghamton University and other regional innovation powerhouses. These dynamics, enhanced with URI and other investments, will result in Binghamton becoming a magnet for young professionals and entrepreneurs looking for an innovative environment in an attractive and exciting urban core. Binghamton's renewal is urgent. It is the most highly distressed urban center in the Southern Tier. Based on 2013 Census estimates, the city's population of 46,975 has decreased 1% from the 2000 Census. A third of the residents are living below the poverty level. More than half of the unemployed population is living in poverty. The median household income, $30,978, is significantly lower than the state's $58,003. The per capita income is $20,576. We are already seeing significant signs of transformation, and the city has upped its game in terms of nurturing a restaurant and arts scene and working with the private sector to upgrade housing offerings for students and permanent residents. Binghamton's recent designation by The American Institute for Economic Research and Business Insider as a top-20 College Town reflects an improving ability to attract students and stem brain drain. Binghamton University's enrollment growth, coupled with the opening of the University Downtown Center in Binghamton. Since the construction of the Binghamton University Downtown Center, private developers have announced and constructed $108 million in new housing in downtown Binghamton. That is nearly 460 new residential units and more than 1,130 beds at seven locations. This investment has spurred the opening of 10 new restaurants, seven of which have outdoor seating, and two craft breweries to serve the influx of students and young professionals. Numerous redevelopment projects are under way such as the demolition of a former hotel at 50 Front Street making way for a private-sector investment in a new market-rate, mixed-use development. Innovation at all levels will be supported as the Binghamton iDistrict is realized. The Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator, combined with other state programs such as Start-Up NY and 76 West, will continue to stimulate leveraged investments to make the city a hub of commerce and government as well as a driving force for innovation in the region. Organizations and groups providing business and legal services, mentoring and educational programs and funding resources will locate in the incubator or engage clients and other companies there. The objective is to provide coaching, programming and The Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator, funded by federal and previous CFA awards, will be capable of attracting client companies from across the nation and internationally. It will include specialized laboratories and other features associated with industry-based R&D, including testing, evaluation and prototyping, a high-bay area and a co-working space. The facility will also house SUNY Broome's new Bridge to Entrepreneurial Excellence (SUNY-BEE) program.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 51 Binghamton University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, a SUNY 2020 project, will be a key element of the Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park.networking opportunities to a wide swath of entrepreneurs and early-stage and innovation- oriented businesses that improve their odds of commercial success. URI and other leveraged investments planned will focus on development of state-of-the-art commercial spaces in adaptively re-used historic commercial buildings, live-work spaces for entrepreneurs such as One North Depot, market rate housing for young professionals, and improvements to the cityscape, including public spaces, entertainment, riverfront revitalization, parking and transportation upgrades. In turn, retail, services and entertainment offerings catering to the tastes of the creative and design professionals will pop up, creating a secondary wave of employment growth and economic activity in Binghamton. There also will be a focus on workforce training for hard-to-place workers in the newly constructed Salvation Army Job Training Center. Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict The Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict will be a strong and cohesive community of academic and healthcare anchor institutions, healthcare-related businesses, cultural amenities and residents. It builds on the $60 million SUNY 2020 investment to construct Binghamton University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. With URI and private investment, we will transform a highly distressed urban core into a magnet that will provide the Southern Tier with interprofessional education, enhanced healthcare, internationally recognized research and opportunities for healthcare-based, high-tech industry. The centerpiece of the iDistrict is the Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park (\"The Park\"), which will rejuvenate the New York State recognized Endicott-Johnson Brownfield Opportunity Area by bringing together the resources of Binghamton University's new School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Decker School of Nursing, SUNY Broome, Wilson Memorial Regional Medical Center and Lourdes Hospital. The Park will enable the translation of health sciences-based research from academic laboratories into opportunities for pharmaceutical product development and other healthcare applications. It will attract entrepreneurs who will access Start-Up NY and other economic development resources to develop technologies, products and services for health sciences-based markets. The iDistrict will also assist in development of shovel-ready former brownfield sites for biotech companies that move to Johnson City. At the proposed Center for Applied Regenerative Medicine, researchers will explore new treatments for those with chronic conditions ranging from osteoarthritis to autism spectrum disorders. This fast-growing field, dominated by companies and academic institutions in North America, presents a new area in which Greater Binghamton can do the type of collaborative research for which it is known. The regenerative medicine market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 23% between 2014 and 2020, expanding from $16.4 billion to $67.5 billion 18. The proposed Binghamton Bio Foundry will enable the commercial development and pilot production of prosthetics, implants, tissues and organs through 3D printing technologies. The Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University , outlined 52 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planin the Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Initiative section of this plan, may collaborate with Binghamton University's new School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The iDistrict will also benefit from the proximity of the Institute for Child Development, an internationally known provider of programs to children challenged by autism spectrum, developmental and learning disorders. SUNY Broome is well positioned to market specialized training programs in high growth, high-wage \"technician\" occupations that complement \u2014 and offer entry into \u2014 the more advanced and highly technical opportunities proposed for the iDistrict. With a presence at The Park, SUNY Broome will work with Binghamton University and partners to recruit and retain trainees, especially hard-to-place workers; develop on-the-job-training and build laddered credential-certification-degree options. The Johnson City iDistrict also is part of the Broome County Endicott Johnson Industrial Corridor, which includes a 230-acre BoA area centered in the Village of Johnson City. The Brownfield Opportunity Area plan for this area calls for neighborhood revitalization, as well as health, cultural and educational assets, including Wilson Memorial Regional Medical Center, the Goodwill Theatre and the future Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, to be constructed in the heart of the BOA. The cultural aspect of the iDistrict will be anchored by the Goodwill Theatre. This performing arts complex will accommodate a range of cultural and theater performances and will be home to a professional equity company, encouraging lively, inspired exchange among theater and performance professionals and arts innovation within the Southern Tier. Several elements of the Johnson City iDistrict are in place and ready to go: The Village of Johnson City has completed a major, $475,000 Main Street revitalization program and has adopted the Health and Cultural District designation as part of its plan. This designation will provide strategic planning to foster neighborhood-building amenities. The heart of the village is a New York State Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA), which gives priority in state grant review and tax incentives for brownfield redevelopment. In addition, Binghamton University will build its School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences' $60 million facility at 96 Corliss Avenue, a former brownfield. The university has also acquired another brownfield site at 48 Corliss Avenue and plans to renovate the 90,000-square-foot historic facility to house its Decker School of Nursing as well as its academic and industry partners. In addition, the university plans to locate an elder care center in the iDistrict, funded with a $1.5 million private endowment. Infrastructure improvements will continue with The Agency's purchase of 10 acres at 59 Lester Avenue and commitment of $4.5 million to redevelop the existing structure and entire site to accommodate future commercial development and companies seeking to develop research collaborations in the health sciences with Binghamton University . Regan Development has announced the purchase of 135-139 Baldwin Street. It plans to convert this former Endicott-Johnson factory brownfield site into the Century Sunrise mixed-use development project. Finally, the U.S. Air Force is providing $17.3 million to demolish the former Johnson City home of BAE, which was abandoned following the 201 1 flood. The Agency has plans for mixed-use development on the site. Johnson City is ripe for renewal. More than 13.8% of the village' s families live below the poverty line; per capita income for all households is $21,666, compared with $32,382 for New York State. 19 Healthcare accounted for a growth in 1,400 positions, or 41%, from 2001 to 2014, while all other industries in the village collectively declined by 1,200 jobs, or 14.3%.20 The iDistrict will accelerate growth in healthcare by supporting research and development; by increasing access to applied research and facilities for new product and process development; and by preparing a skilled workforce.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 53The Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict provides a coordinated plan and new resources to drive the revitalization of Johnson City and the advanced economy of the Southern Tier. Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict The Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict will be home to the new Flexible Printed Electronics Technology Center; the Industrial 3D Printing Center for Design, Visualization, and Manufacturing; the Microgrid Energy Pilot Plant; and the Hybrid Powertrain Test Center. Strategic investments in these centers will provide firms in Endicott and beyond with critical infrastructure to increase advanced manufacturing and professional technical employment in the Southern Tier. The centers will accelerate access to advanced manufacturing processes and equipment, giving local companies a \"first to market\" competitive advantage. In addition, the Endicott iDistrict will establish Greater Binghamton as the first and preeminent location for the development of flexible hybrid electronics and thin, flexible-glass technology . The iDistrict also will promote the transformation of a blighted industrial district. The former site of IBM Endicott, now the Huron Campus, sits between the commercial core of Endicott \u2014 Washington Avenue \u2014 and a Little Italy district that is testimony to the Italian immigrants who once worked at Endicott-Johnson shoe factories. Today, this former manufacturing hub has a population of 13,291. In 2013 estimates, 21% of Endicott residents live below the poverty line. Of the population 16 and older, 34.6% of the unemployed population is below the poverty line. The median household income is $32,599, 56% lower than the state' s median. The per capita income is $20,623. The innovation driver for the Endicott iDistrict will be the expansion of Binghamton University's Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing (CAMM), part of the Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging Center, on the Huron Campus. In late August 2015, the CAMM was announced as the leader of the New York node of a $75 million initiative focused on further development of flexible hybrid electronics. The funding from the U.S. Department of Defense to the national Flex Tech Alliance, of which Binghamton University is a founding member, gives the CAMM endorsement as a leader in this innovative R&D sector and elevates the CAMM to national prominence. The Endicott iDistrict will create the design, visualization and manufacturing infrastructure needed for disruptive technologies in alignment with the Southern Tier Advanced Manufacturing initiative. While the Huron Campus is host to manufacturing firms such as BAE Systems, i3 Electronics and Incodema Inc. (in planning), the majority of the former industrial site is unoccupied. It is beginning to suffer neglect, but it still could be restored into premier manufacturing space. The objective is to coordinate with the Advanced Manufacturing Initiative to strengthen and expand these existing businesses, building on the Southern Tier's transportation, medicine, energy and glass and ceramics industries to populate and re-purpose the former IBM plant. As well-paying jobs return to the Huron Campus, Washington Avenue's commercial district will be revitalized and Little Italy will attract additional Italian-themed eateries due to increased consumer demand, the proximity of daytime workers and increase in discretionary income for local residents. This iDistrict builds on expertise at Binghamton University and its industrial and academic partners. For example, planned equipment donations from Corning Incorporated will allow commercialization of product manufacturing with thin, flexible Willow \u00ae glass technology. A major aspect of these initiatives is the application and advancement of cutting-edge technologies for 3D printing, roll-to-roll manufacturing technologies for glass, polymers and 54 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planmetals and computer-aided engineering for product design, visualization and testing. The Flexible Printed Electronics Technology Center and the Industrial 3D Printing Center focus on the emerging area known as additive manufacturing, which deposits material to form finished (or near-finished) artifacts using metals, composites, glass, ceramics and high-performance polymers. 3D printing creates products in aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and other industries impossible to achieve using traditional methods. A number of bedrock Southern Tier companies have expressed interest in the Industrial 3D Printing Center, including Corning Inc., Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Raymond Corp., General Electric and i3 Electronics. We also plan a pilot facility for development and testing of microgrids, energy storage, energy conversion and energy control technologies in partnership with regional businesses. For example, Lockheed Martin is developing a biomass waste-to-energy system; its process generates \"syngas\" that can be a basis for energy generation or for other purposes such as manufacture of synthetic fuel or plastics. Local companies are working in the supercapacitor and battery area as well. The Microgrid Pilot Plant will enable manufacturers to mature their product offerings in a testbed environment, attracting investment capital and customers. The Hybrid Powertrain Test Center will enable the Southern Tier to become a leader in medium and heavy-duty powertrain development. Cummins Inc. in Jamestown develops engines and engine technologies. Lockheed Martin in Owego has been a key player in military vehicle development. Corning Inc. has developed engine aftertreatment technologies for years. These corporate leaders, along with BAE Systems, have spent millions on engine and powertrain technologies. With federal vehicle greenhouse gas regulations to be announced in 2016, and the possible national adoption of California' s carbon cap and trade rules, this test center is essential for growth of the local transportation equipment industry . Finally, as part of the iDistrict Initiative, the Broome County Department of Planning will develop a strategic plan for cultural and housing enhancement in Endicott. The plan will address the aging and deteriorated housing stock, recommend fa\u00e7ade and streetscape improvements along the Main Street Corridor and Washington Avenue retail core, and create a conceptual reuse plan for the former Endicott Forging site, a cleaned-up brownfield in the heart of the iDistrict. The houses are sturdy and fundamentally sound, but need updating of mechanical systems, improvements for energy efficiency and interior and exterior renovation. They can then again serve their original function: affordable, attractive housing for workers. The Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict will capitalize on the expertise of Binghamton University and its partners, including Corning Incorporated, creator of thin, flexible Willow \u00ae glass technology.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 55Physical and networking assets that link the iDistricts Greater Binghamton has always functioned as one area. The foundational, connective elements of our innovation ecosystem are a common workforce, its housing stock, transportation network and county government. Community organizations, institutions such as schools and churches, cultural and commercial events provide the social fabric of the area. The iDistricts will provide the economic diversification needed to sustain local employment. The economic impact from the entrepreneurship we cultivate across Greater Binghamton will cascade across the area, and we will pay close attention to the maintenance and enhancement of the physical, virtual and social networks that will sustain innovation. It's easy to move throughout Greater Binghamton. Interstate 86 and Route 434 make east- west travel fast. Broome County Transit provides a network of buses. It is more difficult, however, for pedestrians and cyclists to get around. To address this challenge, we propose a Route 434 greenway: a pedestrian and bicycle trail along the Susquehanna River that will link Binghamton University's main campus with the Binghamton iDistrict. The greenway will promote healthy lifestyles, provide residents a practical alternative to car and bus transportation and enhance community appreciation of our natural environment. As reflected in Binghamton Metropolitan Transportation Studies since 1999, additional segments can be extended eastward to connect to Johnson City and Endicott. In the virtual world, broadband is an enabling infrastructure critical to recruiting, retaining and promoting expansions of businesses competitive in the international, Internet economy . It has been shown to boost enterprise productivity, allow knowledge workers to engage and improve performance of emergency services. The Southern Tier Network, based in Corning, manages a fiber-optic backbone. New York State awarded the Southern Tier Network $5 million in REDC Round 3 to expand the fiber ring into Tioga and Broome counties, and work is currently underway. The digital network will enable data-intensive users in the iDistricts, such as design and engineering houses, cutting edge health care, advanced manufacturing companies and research institutes, to send and receive large files at fast speeds. Such infrastructure will one day enable a 3D bio foundry in Johnson City to process tissue profiles received from dozens of hospitals and doctors' offices, and in turn organize logistics for next-day delivery. The people, companies, educational institutions and government service providers interacting within the iDistricts will use high-speed fiber to expand connections throughout Greater Binghamton, regionally and nationally . Multiple organizations have a part to play in building connections throughout the innovation ecosystem. Binghamton University and SUNY Broome link faculty and students to companies, entrepreneurs, government representatives, nonprofits and service providers. Already, company representatives sit on academic and research center advisory boards, take advantage of multiuser facilities and engage student teams. These mutually beneficial activities will further develop in each of the iDistricts and will be accelerated by targeted URI projects. The Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator in Binghamton will provide space and programming to encourage conversations among entrepreneurs, interns, prospective hires, The iDistricts will provide the economic diversification needed to sustain local employment. 56 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planprofessional service providers, technical experts, business counselors, university and government representatives, investors and strategic partners. Binghamton University' s Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Partnerships collaborates with organizations throughout the region and state. Regular events, from Start-Up Suite Mixers and informal LinkedIn meetups to regional business plan competitions, also foster networking and innovation. Our iDistricts are not built upon a single strength, but rather on the synergy of strengths in infrastructure, human capital and academic and industrial expertise. Greater Binghamton, which has reinvented itself several times over its history, stands ready for a new future. Private investment The Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem initiative will achieve 5-to-1 private sector investment via: n Private company investment in building facilities for commercializing drug discovery research n Private investment in translational research projects through direct investment and funding via collaborative research projects n Private company job and wage growth in new and existing health sciences and engineering fields n Contributions made by the educational institutions in the region Inter-regional collaboration Binghamton University will collaborate with SUNY Upstate Medical University in the Central NY region on development of the university's proposed Center for Regenerative Medicine and Bio Foundry in the Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict. In addition, there will be inter-regional collaboration between Binghamton University' s proposed centers for Industrial 3D Printing and Flexible Printed Electronics, in the Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict, and academic institutions and corporations in other regions such as Clarkson University in the North Country, RIT and Xerox in the Finger Lakes region and Alfred University in Western New York. The CAMM's expanding portfolio involves extensive national and state-wide collaboration with firms such as Corning and GE in product development and manufacturing, as well as Cornell University, SUNY Upstate Medical University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 57Signature projects The $20,000,000 Transform Greater Binghamton Fund will offer low-interest loans and grants for streetscape improvements, bike and pedestrian amenities, fa\u00e7ade improvements, select demolitions, housing rehabilitation and development of model smart homes within the iDistricts. Binghamton iDistrict Route 434 Greenway - Bike Trail: A pedestrian and bicycle trail between the University Downtown Center in Binghamton and Binghamton University in Vestal, with the route connecting a school, a park and residential neighborhoods. The project will complete a critical link in the Two River Greenway trail that spans two counties and seven municipalities. 7 Hawley Street: The Binghamton Urban Renewal Agency project entails the construction of market-rate residential housing and commercial space downtown combined with a public parking garage in downtown Binghamton. Collier Street Commons: With one of the main public parking structures in Binghamton nearing the end of its useful life, there are plans to demolish the ramp and replace it with mixed-use, market-rate residential and commercial space combined with a public parking garage. City Center Lofts: $2.5 million private project to develop a 20,000-square-foot property at 73 Court Street, Binghamton, into luxury housing above street-level commercial space.Waterfront Revitalization: The City of Binghamton adopted a waterfront revitalization plan in 2005 that targets riverfront development, open space and environmental preservation, infrastructure efficiency improvements and flood-damage mitigation. Following two \"100-year floods\" during the past decade, the city will continue to pursue funding for projects that can prevent flood damage and loss of life. The Salvation Army Binghamton Job Training Center: The Salvation Army will consolidate its facility at 127 Washington Street and East Side Thrift Store and Adult Rehabilitation Center in a new complex at 530-532 State Street, Binghamton. The $8 million project will provide 18,000 square feet of indoor space for job training and skills development. One North Depot Apartments: One North Depot will adapt and re-use a 59,000-square- foot, historically significant structure and provide affordable commercial storefront space and shared work space for entrepreneurs in the urban core of Binghamton, NY . Through a live/ work program, tenants are able to start new businesses or operate existing entrepreneurial enterprises out of the lower levels of the building, and affordably live in loft apartments on the upper floors. Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park : An anchor is the Healthcare Education and Simulation Facility at 48 Corliss Avenue. This project involves placement of Binghamton University's Decker School of Nursing, research labs and potential new programs in public health and nutrition. Additional space will be available for clinical and educational partners and biopharmaceutical company partners, community programming and additional partners. This facility will be adjacent to Binghamton University's new $60 million LEED Platinum School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at 96 Corliss Avenue, being funded by SUNY 2020 and expected to be under construction in 2016.58 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe Goodwill Theatre Inc.: Complete the stabilization of the 1899 Municipal Building Central Fire Station (Firehouse) at 48 Willow Street and the 1920 Goodwill Theatre building at 36 Willow Street in Johnson City. This will prepare both buildings to be connected by a new Community Hub building that will be the linchpin of a Cultural Complex. JC Century Sunrise Redevelopment: Regan Development will purchase 135-139 Baldwin Street and convert this former Endicott-Johnson factory brownfield site into housing and commercial space. 59 Lester Avenue Redevelopment: The Agency will take the lead on redevelopment of a 10-acre site at 59 Lester Ave. A $4.5 million commitment is in hand to redevelop the parcel, which will result in new office and commercial space for The Agency, the Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce and other businesses. The Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict Flexible Printed Electronics Center and Industrial 3D Printing Center: The first phase of the Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict will secure and renovate space for these centers. This $25 million project includes $5 million in requested funds and $20 million in matching funds from the Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Initiative. Endicott iDistrict Revitalization Plan: A downtown revitalization plan will be developed, with a focus on the Washington Avenue and North Street commercial districts, and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Signature projects that are under development Biopharmaceutical Hub: The Biopharmaceutical Hub will bring together expertise in academic and industry-led research and product development, in partnership with economic development resources, to advance the region's leadership in pharmaceutical product development. Funds will accelerate research into smart drugs and drug-delivery systems and prepare brownfields and neglected industrial areas as shovel-ready sites for biotech partners. The Goodwill Theatre will be the cornerstone of a cultural complex in Johnson City.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 59Center for Applied Regenerative Medicine: The Center for Applied Regenerative Medicine will bring together academic and clinical research expertise in stem cells, 3D tissue and organ printing, cell reprogramming and human genome editing, advanced biomaterials, robotics and more to regenerate missing capabilities for those with chronic conditions ranging from osteoarthritis to autism spectrum disorders and brain trauma. Binghamton Bio Foundry: 3D printing is revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered; for example, progressive dental practices can now use a 3D printer for in-office, on-demand, personalized manufacturing of crowns and bridges. Medical researchers are exploring 3D printing for external prosthetics, too. A Bio Foundry would capitalize on these innovations to enable the commercial development and pilot production of prosthetics, implants, tissues and organs through advanced bio-manufacturing (3-D printing) technologies. Hybrid Powertrain Test Center: Transportation equipment manufacturing is a key element of the Southern Tier economy. Hybrid powertrain technology may have applications wherever heavy objects need to be started, stopped, lifted and lowered (e.g., elevators, cranes, light rail). Microgrid Energy Generation, Storage and Conversion Pilot Plant: A pilot facility for development and testing of microgrids, energy storage, energy conversion and energy control technologies. This project will use the Endicott municipal electric system as the distribution system in a microgrid pilot facility, and construct green energy generation and storage systems in partnership with regional businesses. The Binghamton Bio Foundry will enable the commercial development and pilot production of prosthetics, implants, tissues and organs through 3D printing technologies.60 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanInnovation and the advanced economy The Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will help build an advanced economy in the Southern Tier. URI investments will foster a culture of business development within the region, capitalizing on the new technologies and knowledge creation. The expected job growth in educational services, healthcare, engineering and advanced manufacturing will provide wages above the regional median wage of $32,440. In the three iDistricts, URI investments will support and develop start-up firms, research facilities, academic institutions and other organizations that emphasize creative ideas and technologies. For example, the Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict is part of the overall Advanced Industries strategy. The disruptive technology assistance centers will aid manufacturing sectors that are on the rise and relevant to the already-established nexus of transportation products, components and control systems in the Southern Tier. One to two decades ago, it was still common for corporations to invest in technology for the long term; this has become exceptional. Consortia that share research infrastructure and efforts across multiple companies can lift American industries. Flagship examples of this are the National Network of Manufacturing Initiatives that establish Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation. These institutes perform pre-competitive research that benefits all members immediately and the broader industry eventually. Our proposed disruptive technology assistance centers are modeled on this concept. Manufacturing jobs, and in particular advanced manufacturing jobs, pay better than typical local wages. Job creation rests on company growth, including the ability to protect market share and to export goods and services. Company growth rests on superior competitiveness. By teaming academic researchers with industry partners, the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will ensure that Southern Tier firms are able to compete in a changing economy.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 61Superior competitiveness relies on creating better customer value, greater responsiveness and lower costs. Our new disruptive technology centers will assist companies in creating, prototyping and commercializing better products more quickly and economically . They will give companies access to expertise and infrastructure that they can't af ford on their own. The Binghamton University Center of Excellence's track record proves that businesses can be engaged with academia in practical ways that provide large returns on investment. New York state companies that partner with the center note that it has delivered $1.1 billion of economic impact and helped to create or retain more than 1,900 jobs during the past 20 years. The consortium model is successful in connecting private and academic knowledge and skills to perform pre-competitive research. The proposed Endicott iDistrict centers are modeled after this approach. They focus on additional technology areas with significant potential for service growth to industry. We are not proposing to build new industries; rather, the Southern Tier has a well-established industry centered on transportation and smart energy products, components and controls. We propose to provide enablers for continued growth of companies in this industry and to ease entry of additional players in the region. The major companies in the Southern Tier's industry cluster are already international players, some being foreign-owned and representing foreign investment, and all having significant exports. Strengthening the local supply chain that works with these companies will increase exports. Our larger companies that leverage the disruptive technology centers will have reduced cost for their own product innovation, perform well in their corporate contexts and attract additional investment from their foreign ownership. By coupling the Endicott iDistrict with the downtown Binghamton incubator and competitive federal and state R&D challenges, technology transfer programs and tax incentives, such as Start-Up NY, we will attract and nurture startup ventures, including those launched by faculty or graduates opting to stay in the region and potentially companies from outside our region as well. One of our greatest resources, which has been insufficiently tapped to date, is our population of STEM students. This includes the significant human capital represented by international graduate students, who tend to return to their home countries or go to work for corporations willing to address their work visa needs. By teaming academic researchers with industry partners, the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will ensure that industries in the Southern Tier are able to adapt, modernize and compete in a changing landscape. Global economy The organizations that will benefit from the creation of the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will develop new technologies that will be sought after on a global scale. This will increase exports as Southern Tier businesses enter established and new markets. While the specific products for export may be unknown at this time, the market for innovative products in the biomedical industry and the advanced manufacturing industry cuts across all markets. \"Exports are a growing and substantial part of the U.S. economy, accounting for 13.8 percent of our nation's GDP. According to a study published by the Institute for International Economics, U.S. companies that export grow faster and are nearly 8.5 percent less likely to go out of business than non-exporting companies .\" 21By teaming academic researchers with industry partners, the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will ensure that industries in the Southern Tier are able to adapt, modernize and compete in a changing landscape.62 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe pharmaceutical industry, for example, has experienced rapid growth in the past several years. The global pharmaceuticals market is worth $300 billion a year, a figure expected to rise to $400 billion within three years. 22 \"The opportunity in biopharmaceuticals is big and growing too rapidly to ignore. Today, biopharmaceuticals generate global revenues of $163 billion, making up about 20 percent of the pharma market. It's by far the fastest-growing part of the industry: biopharma's current annual growth rate of more than 8 percent is double that of conventional pharma, and growth is expected to continue at that rate for the foreseeable future.\" 23 The marketplace for these products is not bound by geography. These organizations will be reaching out to new markets around the world, thereby increasing exports and foreign investment. The Endicott iDistrict projects will increase global exports by providing tools and technology for companies to compete in the global marketplace more quickly and economically . The advanced manufacturing technologies that are subject of the iDistrict are in growing global demand. The URI investment in the iDistricts will support research, research infrastructure and shovel-ready site development that will facilitate the growth of a strong base in advanced manufacturing and health sciences by bringing academia, industry and other partners together with opportunities for company relocation. Start-up firms will have access to incubation facilities, Start-Up NY resources and entrepreneurial programming. Sustainability Binghamton University, one of the main drivers in all three of the iDistricts, has a history of generating economic impact. Locating pharmacy and nursing students, along with faculty and staff, in Johnson City will create long-lasting and sustained economic impact. In addition, the plan is to engage in a promotion plan focused on retaining university graduates in the region. Binghamton University has a track record of retaining roughly a quarter of its graduates in the region. The focus in Endicott is business creation and growth through advanced manufacturing technologies. In the short term, the impact is enabling access to critical equipment and manufacturing technologies beyond companies' current capabilities. As the ecosystem develops, a critical mass of manufacturers, supply chain, educators and workforce developers will be established, and the neighborhoods of Endicott will be uplifted. Success begets success, and as jobs are created, opportunities for the community are created, increasing the attractiveness of Endicott as a place to live and do business. Within the three iDistricts, there will be four R&D entities that will have a solid academic- private partnership structure. They include the Center for Applied Regenerative Medicine and Bio Foundry in the Johnson City Health and Science Innovation Park and the Industrial 3D Printing Center and Flexible Printed Electronics Center in the Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict. These high-technology R&D and assistance efforts have been selected for their enduring value. The performance metrics for them will measure the ongoing vitality of the efforts, and leaders of these initiatives will use these metrics to adjust course as necessary . These centers will be modeled after the structure of successful, sustainable industry-university research consortia at universities across the country, including Binghamton University's Center of Excellence in Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging (S 3IP). No single source of money sustains these research centers. Rather, a successful model across the country is to establish a diverse mix of membership fees, contracted research from industry Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 63and federal sponsors (e.g., NIH, NIST, NSF, DoE, AFRL, ONR), work-for-hire for industry (e.g., analytical lab work) and university infrastructure investment in support of faculty research capability to provide long-term, ongoing operations. While we intend to attract work from our region and beyond, the centers will offer several value propositions to keep the fruit of the relationship local to New York State. First, we will work closely with the Start-Up NY program; second, offering access to infrastructure that would be otherwise unaffordable raises the opportunity cost of moving away; third, by emphasizing a strongly interactive, customer-centric partnership, the centers will offer partners expediency and economy that is difficult to match in a long-distance relationship; fourth, by emphasizing the local university talent pipelines, and ensuring that the Southern Tier is a preferred region for retaining those graduates, employers will find it advantageous to remain in the Southern Tier. The Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem will promote sustainability on the community level by following smart growth principles. These include: fostering strong, sustainable businesses in community centers; strengthening and direct development toward existing communities; fostering distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place; creating walkable neighborhoods; taking advantage of green building design; creating a range of housing opportunities and choices; and mixed land uses. This sustainability throughout Greater Binghamton will be both stimulated and sustained by the Greater Binghamton Fund. As a loan fund, it will be evergreen and repayment to the fund will replenish the capital and be available for future investments. Workforce development and hard-to-place workers Hard-to-place workers will require special attention so that they can thrive in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem. Our strategy includes: n W orkforce training through SUNY Broome to prepare people to enter the industrial workforce. Its aim is to provide basic technical skills needed in manufacturing such as blueprint reading, as well as \"soft skill\" training. n Boosting services from the Salvation Army, which will offer life skills training for people in Binghamton's most economically depressed neighborhood. n Services for recent immigrants through the American Civic Association, which assists immigrants in their acculturation to America and offers English lessons. n V eterans affairs offices at each SUNY campus, which provide assistance for veterans in the college environment. SUNY Broome, Tompkins Cortland Community College, Corning Community College and SUNY Delhi have expertise in providing training required by local employers. New specialized programs in high-growth areas will help to ensure a workforce that' s in sync with the needs of companies throughout the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem. SUNY Broome's plans already call for new programs that support the innovation economy . A histological technician certificate program will soon be launched, as will a certificate program for physical therapy aides. A new associate degree in manufacturing technology has been designed in response to local labor market demands. Programs in energy technology, mechatronics and aircraft maintenance are in development.64 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanPerformance measures n Jobs created n Leveraged investment n Median household income n Poverty rates n Housing vacancy statistics n Housing unit statistics n New business filings n Reduced commercial vacancy rates n Binghamton University research expenditures n Patents filed by region n Companies locating to region n Companies expanding in region n Economic impact as reported by companies, including employment multipliers n Number of Start-Up NY companies established n Number of iDistrict partner companies n SBIRs and STTRs awardedRegional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Plan Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem $117M URI Investment Binghamton iDistrict Initiative-wide Projects Johnson City Health & Cultural iDistrictEndicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrictBinghamton iDistrict Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator start-up spin-offs Downtown revitalization projects such as 7 Hawley Street, One North Depot and Collier Street Commons Salvation Army Job Training CenterRoute 434 Greenway ProjectWaterfront RevitalizationThe Greater Binghamton Fund for Commercial and Residential Revitalization SUNY Broome Workforce Training Programs Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Park School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Decker School of Nursing Center for Regenerative Medicine Bio Foundry Goodwill Theatre cultural facilitiesCentury Sunrise Development and other mixed-use projects Demolition and redevelopment of sitesRedevelopment of a 10-acre site at 59 Lester Avenue Main Street and community revitalization projectsFlexible Printed Electronics Center Industrial 3D Printing Center Endicott iDistrict Revitalization PlanMicrogrid Pilot ProjectHybrid Powertrain Test TrackInvestments in business and industryOrganizational structureSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 65 Year 1: Examples of Projects Ready to Go Binghamton iDistrict Lackawanna Train Station Revitalization Bates Troy Expansion7 Hawley Street Mixed Use DevelopmentRoute 434 Greenway ProjectSalvation Army Job Training CenterCity Center LoftsCity of Binghamton Waterfront Development Project Planning Johnson City Health and Cultural iDistrict Renovation of 48 Corliss Avenue: Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park Century Sunrise mixed-use development projectGoodwill Theatre Phase 2Redevelopment of 59 Lester Avenue 10-acre site: Southern Tier Health Sciences and Technology Innovation Park Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict Relocation of National Pipe and Plastic to Endicott Industrial 3D Printing CenterDowntown Endicott Revitalization Plan Overall The Transform Greater Binghamton Fund: Year 1SUNY Broome Specialized Technician Training Program 66 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanEndnotes 1 https://www .whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/TheEconomicCaseforHealthCareReform/ 2 http:// www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.t04.htm 3 http:// www.healthcaresalaryonline.com/healthcare-salary-list.html 4 The Southern Tier's Approach to Economic Growth, Regional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier, 2011. 5 The Southern Tier's Approach to Economic Growth, Regional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier, 2011. 6 President' s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. 2011.

That means if the U.S. is serious about promoting a recovery in manufacturing, it will stop measuring success by the number of people employed in the sector and start supporting technological advancements that make factories more productive, competitive and innovative.\" Goal A focus on advanced manufacturing and the transportation sector will result in the Southern Tier being recognized as a destination for manufacturing business development, distinguished by its concentration of multi-national anchor companies, advanced infrastructure to support innovation and technology, rich education and research resources, specialized skilled workforce, vibrant communities and strengths in advanced robotics, advanced materials, autonomous vehicles and unmanned aircraft, secure electronics, 3D printing, renewable energy and energy storage. Strategy We will power the growth and development of the advanced manufacturing industry, with a particular focus on the transportation equipment cluster, through: 1. High Levels of R&D and Commitment to Innovation in Emerging Technologies 2. Continuously Recharging the Skills Pipeline and Attracting STEM Workers 3.

Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 69Strategy This initiative will encourage the private sector, academic institutions and communities to work collaboratively to develop, discover, repurpose and connect to stimulate private investment, create jobs and increase export activity. This strategy also is closely linked to the Southern Tier's industry cluster plan, which is focused on the Transportation Products, Components and Systems Controls manufacturing industry cluster. Based on an in-depth understanding of what it will take to advance the Southern Tier's manufacturing industry, we will undertake an aggressive, three-pronged, inter-related approach to strengthening the region's manufacturing industry with a particular focus on the Advanced Transportation Product, Components and System Controls sector. 1. Supportive ecosystem to stimulate private investment. Significant investments ranging from basic infrastructure, to state-of-the-art equipment, to the community support systems essential to attracting and retaining young talent are critical to advancing the region's manufacturing industry. This supportive ecosystem together with commercialization of technology will stimulate the private-sector investments that are essential to increasing competitiveness in the global economy . 2. Commitment to innovation and infusion of technology. The Southern Tier has a manufacturing mentality and understands that the profitability of individual companies depends on manufacturing efficiency, technical expertise and product quality. In order to sustain the Southern Tier's competitive edge in advanced manufacturing, there must be a continued commitment to internal corporate R&D as well as relationships with research universities to leverage existing strengths focused on the infusion of emerging technologies and commercialization of new innovations. 3. Human capital. The Southern Tier expects to see a resurgence in manufacturing through more highly skilled, niche manufacturing operations that require a technically savvy workforce. Whether manufacturers are seeking to develop new products, enter new markets or improve overall productivity, their workforce will be key to their ability to remain competitive and achieve their goals. The Southern Tier can become \"best in class\" with strategic investments that anticipate and meet future workforce needs, forge increased engagement between students and industry that inspire and better prepare the next generation to pursue careers in advanced manufacturing, transform the role of the schools in high-poverty areas to contribute to a culture shift in perceptions about education and work, and train adult incumbent and unemployed workers in workforce readiness. This must be accompanied with aggressive messaging about the value of these jobs given the significant \"replacement demand\" that will be generated by retirements in the next five years.70 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe Southern Tier's strength in advanced manufacturing Understanding the dynamics at the national and state levels provided an important framework to look closely within the Southern Tier Region to determine whether advanced manufacturing could continue its historic dominance and be a driving factor in creating an advanced economy. The Project Team conducted an in-depth assessment of the various manufacturing clusters in the Southern Tier to select the cluster with the greatest potential for growth and opportunity to create jobs with high wages. This selection was based on industry performance in terms of size of the industry relative to all industries, historic and projected employment growth, wages, supply chain, concentration (as measured by location quotient) and multiplier ef fect. Our analysis also included leading indicators, national and global market dynamics and opportunities for infusion of technology and business expansion. The composite analysis led us to conclude that the Southern Tier continues to have significant strength in manufacturing and a particular strength in the transportation equipment manufacturing sector. Manufacturing is a dominant force in the Southern Tier, and is the largest export industry in the region at $11.6 billion annually, representing nearly a third of all the region's exports. It also has the strongest location quotient at 2.54. With 34,000 workers, manufacturing remains the third-largest employment sector in the Southern Tier economy, following government and education/health services. Although the overall manufacturing industry saw a loss of 127 manufacturing businesses (17%) in the period 2000-2012, and a 33% loss of jobs between 2000 and 2013, several new and exciting dynamics are influencing the future of manufacturing. The Southern Tier excels in the design, manufacture and assembly of products ranging from auto-making to high-speed rail to aerospace. Focusing on the transportation equipment manufacturing cluster provides us with a unique niche and an opportunity to increase jobs, private-sector investment, foreign investment and global exports. There are more than 70 firms involved as lead companies or members of the supply chain in the Southern Tier's Advanced Transportation Product, Components and System Controls design manufacturing sector. Major corporate leaders include multi-national firms such as Corning Incorporated, Hilliard, CAF USA Railway Solutions (Spain), Raymond Corporation (Japan [Toyota Industries Corp.]), BAE Systems (Britain), Alstom S.A. (France), Borg Warner, Dresser-Rand, GE, Lockheed Martin and Unison. This sector employs more than 11,000 workers with an average annual wage of $74,235. It generates $4 billion in exports annually, representing an increase of 44% in export value growth between 2009 and 2012. The strength of this industry section also is demonstrated by its multiplier ef fect of 2.46 and location quotient (LQ) of 8.968 \u2014 exponentially higher than the LQs of any of the region' s other industry clusters. There is a significant level of synergy across this sector, with at least one multi-national corporation or conglomerate involved in the advanced transportation equipment manufacturing sector in seven of the region's eight counties. Focusing on the transportation equipment manufacturing cluster provides us with a unique niche and an opportunity to increase jobs, private-sector investment, foreign investment and global exports.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 71 SteubenSchuyler 17Advanced manufacturing companies in the Southern Tier Advanced Transportation Products, Components and System Controls Cluster Borg-Warner Mores TechThermIncodema3DInnovative DynamicsC&D Assembly Stork H&EStandard HydrogenTompkins County Raymond GE Aviation Norwich Aero Binghamton Greene (B&G) Trucking Inc.Service Machine & Co.

Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanUnderstanding the industry National trends The Brookings Institution says that \"advanced industries represent a sizable economic anchor for the U.S. economy and have led the post-recession employment recovery . Modest in size, the sector packs a massive economic punch. As an employer and source of economic activity the advanced industry sector plays a major role in the U.S. economy . As of 2013, the nation's 50 advanced industries were expanding at a rate of 5.4% annually and employed 12.3 million U.S. workers. That amounts to about 9 percent of total U.S. employment. And yet, even with this modest employment base, U.S. advanced industries produce $2.7 trillion in value added annually \u2014 17 percent of all U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). That is more than any other sector, including healthcare, finance, or real estate. At the same time, the sector employs 80 percent of the nation's engineers; performs 90 percent of private-sector R&D; generates approximately 85 percent of all U.S. patents; and accounts for 60 percent of U.S. exports. Advanced industries also support unusually extensive supply chains and other forms of ancillary economic activity.\" The Brookings Institution analyzed the advanced industries across the country and reported in March 2015 that the 50 industries in this sector represent the chief anchor of America's economy. From 1980 to 2013, advanced industries expanded at a rate of 5.4 percent annually \u2014 30 percent faster than the economy as a whole. \"The success of the nation's advanced industries is a prerequisite for future broadly shared prosperity in the United States.\" 24 The advanced industries sector Source: The Brookings InstitutionManufacturing Aerospace products and parts Agriculture, construction and mining machinery Aluminum production and processing Audio and video equipmentBasic chemicalsClay productsCommercial and service industry machinery Communications equipmentComputers and peripheral equipment Electric lighting equipmentElectrical equipmentEngines, turbines and power trans.

The report makes the case that \"America's advanced industries are a critical anchor of national prosperity. Business leaders, government and the civil sector need to work together in new ways to augment their vitality .\" In addition, advanced industries provide high-quality economic opportunities for workers. Workers in advanced industries are extraordinarily productive and generate some $210,000 in annual value added per worker compared with $101,000, on average, outside advanced industries. Even workers with lower levels of education can earn salaries in advanced industries that far exceed their peers in other industries. In this regard, the sector is in fact accessible: More than half of the sector's workers possess less than a bachelor's degree. On the national scene, the Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Sector is seeing a revival in employment and business development. March 2015 April 2015 May 2015 June 2015 Employment, all employees (in thousand; seasonally adjusted) 1,603.7 1,604.9 1,608.4 1,608.0 3.0% 3.9% 2.3%Employment and wages also are on the uptick.

Southern Tier's advanced manufacturing industryAmong the 35 Advanced Industries in the manufacturing sector identified by the Brookings Institution, the Southern Tier excels in eight. Most of these are clustered in the Transportation Products, Components and Control Systems sector such as Aerospace Products and Parts; Commercial and Service Industry Machinery; Computers and Peripheral Equipment; Engines, Turbines, and Power Transit Equipment; Navigation, Measurement, and Control Instruments; General Purpose Machinery; and Transportation Equipment. According to the New York State Department of Labor, the Southern Tier's manufacturing industry employs 13.3% of all workers in the region; which is above the statewide average of 5.1% and national average of 9.0%. More specifically, the Southern Tier's advanced manufacturing industry employs more than 27,000 laborers (80% of the region' s 34,000 manufacturing workers) with an average annual salary of $60,862. This is 41% above the average of all other industries in the region ($43,177). It also is high in comparison to the national average of $44,888. In terms of exports, the Southern Tier's advanced manufacturing industry leads all other clusters in the region with exports valued at nearly $12 billion, or equivalent to 32% of the entire region's exports. Despite the Southern Tier having lost 2,058 (5.7%) manufacturing jobs in the past four years, there has been a net gain of 197 in just the past year; and wages continue to exceed other occupations in the region. Even when manufacturing's relative size in the economy is diminished, advanced manufacturing continues to make outsized contributions in exports, productivity growth, R&D and broader initiatives. 25 311 Food Manufacturing 3,363 $47,663 312 Beverage and T obacco Product Manufacturing 497 $30,141 316 Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing N/A N/A 321 W ood Product Manufacturing 975 $40,990 322 Paper Manufacturing 462 $50,307 324 Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing 179 $50,457 325 Chemical Manufacturing 1,287 $63,813 326 Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing 596 $41,129 327 Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing 2,106 $64,686 332 Product Manufacturing 2,746 $46,705 333 Machinery Manufacturing 4,289 $59,617 334 Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturi ng 8,391 $84,350 335 Electrical Equipment, Appliance, 1,189 $46,737 Component Manufacturing 336 T ransportation Equipment Manufacturing 3,939 $63,203 337 Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing 933 $38,951 339 Miscellaneous Manufacturing 1,281 $46,9132012 NAICS Title Employment A verage Annual NAICS Code (2014 Q3) W age (2014) Source: NYS DOLSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 75Total $36,561,047,172 Manufacturing $1 1,672,728,615 Government $9,263,334,581 Educational Services $2,174,210,224 Health Care and Social Assistance $1,810,966,251 Professional, Scientific, and T echnical Services $1,320,577,833 Manufacturing 2.544 Agriculture, forestry , fishing and hunting 1.905 Educational services 1.789 Utilities 1.209 Retail trade 1.090 Accommodation and food services 1.010 Health care and social assistance 0.903 Other services, except public administration 0.857 Construction 0.852 Administrative and waste services 0.827 T ransportation and warehousing 0.764 Wholesale trade 0.755 Arts, entertainment, and recreation 0.634 Management of companies and enterprises 0.623 Information 0.557 Professional and technical services 0.542 Finance and insurance 0.477 Real estate and rental and leasing 0.473Source: NYS DOL Source: NYS DOL Manufacturing also dominates the Southern Tier's global export activity with annual exports more than $36 billion. As compared to other clusters in the Southern Tier, the location quotient is the highest for the manufacturing industry at 2.544. Industry Exports (2013) Industry Location quotient (2014 Q3)76 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanCritical mass in the Southern Tier's advanced transportation equipment manufacturing sector The Brookings Institution recommends a focus on cultivating advanced industries with strong regional industry clusters based on local specializations, as well as those with high-value export potential. These industries are characterized by high levels of research and development and a heavy reliance on workers with science, technology , engineering and math (STEM) skills. Based on further local analysis, it was determined that within the Southern Tier's manufacturing industry there is particular strength in the Advanced Transportation Products, Components and System Controls sector. Within the Southern Tier's top 20 industries by location quotient, 12 are manufacturing industries, and several are directly linked to the Advanced Transportation Equipment Manufacturing sector. 3271 Clay Product and Refractory Manufacturing 644 8.66 31 15 Dairy Product Manufacturing 2,014 7.80 3272 Glass and Gla ss Product Manufacturing 1,032 6.62 3345 Navigational, M easuring, Electro medical, & Control Inst ruments Manufacturing 4,545 6.21 61 13 Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools 17,967 5.05 3339 Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing 2,490 5.03 3344 Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component M anufacturing 2,950 4.25 3372 Office Furnitur e (including Fixtures) 4.21 3332 Industrial Machinery Manufacturing 661 3.22 6239 Other Residential Care Facilities 964 3.22 2123 Nonmetallic Mineral Mining and Quarrying 501 3.03 321 1 Sawmills and Wood Preservation 517 2.97 71 12 Spectator Sports 783 2.97 3341 Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing 800 2.60 8133 Social Advocacy Organizations 951 2.49 5417 Scientific Research and Development Services 3,016 2.47 3353 Electrical Equipment Manufacturing 677 2.46 ehicle Parts Manufacturing 2,364 2.35 3254 Pharmaceutica l and Medicine Manufacturing 1,128 2.12 6243 V ocational Rehabilitation Services 1,378 2.1 1NAICS Industry 2014 2014 Industry Code Employment Location quotient Source: Economic Modeling Specialists Intl.

Supportive ecosystem Stimulating private-sector investments to increase competitiveness in the global economy New dynamics in the global and domestic economies affect the Southern Tier and the ability of its manufacturing sector to attract foreign investment and increased global exports. Opportunity: transportation and environmental sustainability Both U.S. and global energy and transportation policies have been steadily shifting toward reforms that will rebuild and strengthen the national and global economies, and promote energy independence that is environmentally friendly and provides af fordable and dependable transportation options. \"New technologies have the potential to make our roads and transit systems safer , greener and more efficient,\" according to Gregory Winfree, the administrator of the Department of Transportation's Research and Innovative Technology Administration. \"We are working hard to ensure that these technologies can be integrated safely into our existing system.\" 26 Bus rapid transit and light rail will play an important role in the multi-modal future of cities of all sizes in the United States and around the world. Many U.S. urban areas already have begun to move away from reliance on cars toward multi-modal transportation systems that use buses, light-rail trains and protected bike lanes to increase efficiency , reduce commute times, reduce urban sprawl and promote smart growth and focus on sustainability . Major projects planned throughout the country in the next decade will cause a marked increase in demand for advanced transportation manufacturing, and the Southern Tier's transportation sector has the potential to be a player with its leading multi-national companies. BAE Systems in Endicott already has taken the lead, along with several partners, to build a fuel cell bus that blends energy from a fuel cell and electric power , providing a zero- emissions vehicle with improved fuel economy. Energy efficiency in large vehicles such as trucks also is a major global issue being addressed by Southern Tier companies. In 2013-15, Corning Incorporated responded to China's clean air diesel regulations and Europe Euro VI regulations with clean air diesel products. Corning Incorporated's expansion of its Heavy Duty Diesel facility in Erwin is a prime example of the application of next-generation technology and advanced manufacturing to advance the region's transportation industry. Opportunity: U.S. transportation policy and market forces Former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has gone so far as to say that an influx in the demand for passenger railways \"is coming ... there's simply no stopping it.\" Momentum is building for public transit as population density increases congestion in cities across America; our nation's two largest demographic groups, Millennials and seniors, both increasingly want to live in vibrant, accessible cities that are served by public transit. For them, high-quality mobility has become a quality-of-life issue that is driving investments in passenger rail. Amtrak services alone have jumped 44% in the past 10 years, according the U.S. Department of Transportation. According to Amtrak and the International Union of Railways, there is recurring purchase of 500 new metro cars per year, and numerous new commuter rail system projects are in the works. These new projects can be found throughout the country in places such as Atlanta, Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 79Charlotte, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, San Antonio and St. Louis. However, the two most significant projects are Amtrak's proposed updating of the Northeast Corridor to allow for next-generation high-speed rail, costing a 2010 estimate of $117 billion, and Amtrak's planned high-speed rail line between Washington, D.C., and Boston, which would cost a 2012 estimate of $151 billion and take more than 25 years to design and build. In March 2015, Congress approved a bill to authorize continued spending on Amtrak. The measure calls for spending $1.4 billion for the passenger carrier in each of the next four years \u2014 no more than now, but a lot more than the zero level that some conservatives wanted. It's not only the government that is in the business of high-speed rail, but also the private sector. A good example is the All Aboard Florida private passenger service from Miami to Orlando. The Southern Tier's I-86 Corridor is home to three of the leading rail design and manufacturing companies in the world, including Alstom Transportation Inc. in Hornell (France), CAF USA in Elmira (Spain) and Bombardier (Canada) in Kanona. Alstom is preparing to undertake a $130 million expansion in Hornell to design and produce the high-speed train from Boston to Washington, D.C. The Bombardier facility in Kanona is a center of expertise for rail vehicle overhaul and refurbishment for all types of passenger rail cars and has plans for expansion as contracts increase. Hornell is strategically and uniquely positioned to benefit from the current and future investment in passenger rail that will occur in the Northeastern United States, the metropolitan New York area and across the country. The skilled workforce there has a history of focusing on the rail industry for five generations, supplying vital engineering, manufacturing and servicing needs of rail vehicles for more than 160 years. Rail engineering and manufacturing is a highly specialized, technical and industrial activity . Due to Hornell's long history of rail activity, it possess both the skilled workforce and the vital cluster of supplier activity, with almost 200 suppliers in New York State and the surrounding area, that are required to be successful in the rail industry over the long term. That's why Alstom Transportation Inc. has identified Hornell as a potential site for its Advance Rail Technology Center to launch the global introduction of its next generation of AVELIA high speed trains for the United States and the rest of the world. Growth in the Southern Tier not only will occur in the larger companies such as Alstom, but also among the small to medium-sized companies that have developed a niche in national and regional global supply chains. These companies succeed because they are value-add with a focus on quality. Businesses such as Gray Manufacturing, ATM, EPX, TTA, Mercury Aircraft and more are gearing up for expansion of their facilities, new equipment acquisition and new hiring projected at 250 in the next two years. An example is TTA in Hornell, which is planning a $2 million expansion project and will add 25 new jobs in 2016.The Southern Tier's I-86 Corridor is home to three of the leading rail design and manufacturing companies in the world.80 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanRevitalizing the aged manufacturing communities Quality of life will be a major driver in attracting scientists, engineers and the skilled workers to those communities that support advanced manufacturing. The Southern Tier's manufacturing towns that continue to show signs of aging by their old housing stocks, tired commercial districts, and overall aged infrastructure include Elmira, Corning, Hornell and Norwich. Business leaders are looking beyond office space when deciding where to locate their companies, and they recognize that in order to attract a workforce they need to of fer their employees more than a good salary. Appropriate housing and vibrant downtowns are prerequisites for many such workers. Professionals are putting greater weight on work-life balance and activities outside the office. Ensuring these quality-of life attributes, such as housing variety , out-the-door recreation options, education and schools, cultural amenities and proximity to goods and services is increasingly important \u2014 not just to employers but to all community stakeholders concerned with cultivating an innovation ecosystem. Increasingly, the creative economy is synonymous with and supports the attraction of young professionals that will comprise an innovation district. I-86 Innovation Corridor For these reasons, it is imperative that the Southern Tier focus on revitalization of its Aged Manufacturing Communities, with a special need to put a magnifying glass on the I-86 Corridor. The corridor extends between Elmira and Corning, and has the highest concentration of advanced manufacturing and transportation equipment manufacturing companies in the Southern Tier Region. The I-86 Corridor is well positioned to see dynamic change and revitalization with an aggressive strategic action plan that was adopted in July 2015. The corridor has a combined population of nearly 90,000, and is home to major corporations such as Corning Incorporated, CAF USA, DeMet's Candies, Dresser-Rand, Hilliard Corporation, Anchor Glass, Emhart Glass, Hardinge, World Kitchen, Synthes and more. Both the cities of Corning and Elmira exceed the estimated New York State poverty rate for families. Despite having a Fortune 500 company in the heart of the city and the revitalization of Market Street, the city of Corning also contains several pockets of poverty . The city of Elmira has pockets of poverty as high as 47% and per capital income as low as $17,699. During the next few years, the I-86 Corridor, is expected to feel the impact of the expansion of companies such as Corning Incorporated, the Hilliard Corporation, DeMet' s Candy, Dresser- Rand, Anchor Glass, Emhart Glass and Bombardier in nearby Kanona. In addition, the new Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Elmira will be creating new jobs. Cumulatively , there are a projected 600+ jobs to be added in the I-86 Corridor in the next five years. I-86 Innovation CorridorSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 81Major investments are being planned by several anchor companies that have significant export activity such as the Hilliard Corporation. A world leader in motion control and filtration technologies with 630 local employees, it exports products to 60 countries. Another example of growth is DeMet's Candy Co., a foreign-owned company with a planned expansion of $29 million. Also expanding is Elmira's Anchor Glass Corporation, which has plans to improve its manufacturing capacity with a private-sector investment of $19.2 million. Game-changing investments State-of-the Art Advanced Manufacturing Plant, Broome County: A major company proposes to invest $150 million to construct a new value-added manufacturing facility in Broome County, resulting in creation of 600 high-paying jobs. The facility will be state-of-the-art, employing new energy technologies such as combined heat and power systems along with other energy-efficiency measures, with the goal of becoming New York's leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy technology in the manufacturing sector . The company will offer employment and training to veterans and hard-to-place workers, including the long-term unemployed and ex-offenders. Company products are expected to be sold and shipped in the United States and all over the world. Southern Tier Small Manufacturing Competitiveness Fund: The project establishes a $1.5 million low-interest loan fund for new and existing small manufacturing companies (fewer than 20 employees) to allow them to innovate, adapt, increase productivity and efficiency to remain competitive in the global marketplace, and to create employment opportunities for local hard-to-place workers. The fund will target business growth in areas with the highest concentration of impoverished persons; specifically target census tracks in Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Endicott, Hornell, Johnson City and Norwich; as well as rural areas identified in Chenango County, Delaware, Steuben, and Tioga County. The project also will focus on incorporating the global marketing, foreign trade and foreign investment activity goals of the Southern Tier's Global NY Plan by providing these small businesses with the ability to access affordable capital to enable them to compete in both the regional and global marketplaces. Raymond Manufacturing Center of Excellence: The Raymond Manufacturing Center of Excellence, with associated Employee Development and Wellness Center, is designed to enhance and maintain Raymond's standing as a preeminent global manufacturer. The project involves new construction and building renovations at both its V illage of Greene facility and Town of Greene facilities, and addition of employee training equipment and production machinery and equipment. The Village of Greene facility will also receive a turning lane off of Route 12 into the facility to accommodate the increase in employees , during the next five years. Corning Community Health and Education Complex in the City of Corning: The Corning Community Health & Education Complex is focused on the redevelopment of the former Corning Hospital site into a mixed-use commercial and residential development complex. New York State Corning city Elmira city Families 4,637,549 1 otal % below T otal % below Total % below poverty poverty poverty 82 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe project is a collaboration of the Guthrie Corning Hospital, Riedman-Purcell Development, City of Corning, Corning Community College and Steuben County Industrial Development Agency. The complex will provide market-rate housing to meet growing demand by young professionals employed by companies such as Corning Incorporated and Dresser-Rand; it will also be a focal point for workforce development training. Corning Community College's signature registered nursing program and other health science programs will be located in the new 21,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility. Refresh Elmira Downtown Revitalization Program: Elmira's quality of life and economy cannot be improved without strategically addressing key blighted, vacant and underutilized properties, improving the aesthetics of downtown and capitalizing on assets such as the Chemung River. The combination of business and academic institution expansions will impact the demand for housing, cultural and social amenities and access to business and technologies resources. Examples of projects in Elmira's revitalization strategy include: n Redevelop Main Street and W ater Street into a commercial, retail and residential hub. Examples include the Werdenberg building renovation and West Water Street Redevelopment Project. n Redevelopment of the former Federal Building for mixed use. In addition, federal funding has been secured for the North Main Street Cultural Corridor , a $4.2 million project expected to start construction in 2017. Planned development includes a reconstruction and streetscape project to tie the cultural connector from W . 2nd Street to W . Water (NHS) project. A $1.2 million project using National Highway System (NHS) funding is anticipated in 2018 for West Water Street. The city also is completing an application for Federal Highway System (FHS) funding for a rehabilitation project on Main Street Bridge for a $1.4 million project in 2017. The Chemung River Development and Lake Street Pedestrian Bridge Renovation also are being planned. Another driving force in the revitalization of downtown Elmira is the expansion of two colleges into the downtown core. This is synergistic with the strategies identified in the Promote the Southern Tier's Innovative Culture Initiative, described later in this plan. The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine recently announced plans to establish a campus in Elmira for the training of primary care physicians beginning in fall 2016. Initially there will be 80 medical students, growing to more than 300 in the next five years. Simultaneously , Elmira College will expand its athletic programs off-campus, with plans to use The Arena facility in downtown Elmira. Both of these plans will result in a major infusion of young talent and investments in housing and revitalized space for retail and commercial services. The city is finalizing its master plan, which will include these initiatives. Chenango Rural Energy Access: The project is the construction of an 18-mile long natural gas distribution line from the Constitution Pipeline in the Town of Bainbridge to the Raymond Corporation plant in the Village of Greene. The distribution line will provide lower- The manufacturing industry employs more than 34,000 Southern Tier residents.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 83cost, domestically produced, abundant, clean-burning natural gas to Raymond Corporation, providing significant energy cost savings, and securing 1,400 jobs. Advanced Rail Technology Center in Hornell: This project leverages significant foreign investment of $100 million by Alstom Transportation Inc. in facilities to design and manufacture a high-speed train that would serve the Northeast Corridor from W ashington, D.C., to Boston and next-generation design of high-speed trains that Alstom would use as its global high-speed solution for the rest of the world. The rail industry is traditionally a GDP+ growth business, but this project is different. High-speed projects around the world have been proven to capture national public attention. This project will position the Southern Tier as a world leader in next-generation passenger rail and transit. It will also substantially increase foreign investment in the region, attract world-class engineering and technical workers to the Southern Tier and simultaneously change the character of the Hornell area. The initiative will provide job opportunities for hard-to-place workers, including veterans and low-income residents, and promote inclusive growth by using the manufacturing district as a platform to redevelop adjoining distressed neighborhoods. It will create educational, employment and other opportunities in Hornell. The project is expected to result in 500 new jobs, plus 250 additional jobs created in the supply chain. Proposed project components include: n Repurpose former industrial space into a high-tech engineering design center for the high-speed transit industry , to include a workforce training area. n Infrastructure improvements at the complex entrances and in the rail yards n Start-Up NY site for rehabilitation of Plant #3, to include an incubator for suppliers, especially WMBE, and a high-tech engineering design center for Alstom and universities to engage in technology transfer. Alstom Transportation Inc. plans a $130 million expansion in Hornell to design and produce the high-speed train for use on the Boston-to-Washington corridor. 84 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanExamples of other projects: Downtown Hornell Revitalization: Mixed-use developments in Hornell's urban core include advancing the Fairlawn development and upper-floor residential development. These are essential for the growing number of young professionals, including engineers and contract administrators. Specific tasks to be completed include the use of \"Smart City\" technology for infrastructure development and increasing the connectivity from neighborhoods to jobs via sidewalk and bike paths. Expansion of TTA/Transitair: TTA/Transitair Systems is a direct supply chain company for the transportation industry and provides support to other transit-related companies in the region, including Alstom, Bombardier and CAF. It is in a highly distressed section of Hornell. Expansion of this railcar overhaul truck assembly company will allow it to be competitive in the rail industry. 3D Metrology: Incodema3D plans to take a new product for the aerospace industry from a prototype to fully certifying it to be ready for full-scale production. Incodema 3D is working with Cornell and Binghamton universities on this project, which consists of analyzing, testing and certifying metal printed parts. Cameron Manufacturing Expansion: Cameron intends to purchase an additional facility that would be 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to accommodate expansion. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 85Strategy 2. Investing in innovation and emerging technologies ...a new future is needed for the region, one that is focused on innovation... Why? According to the Brookings Institution, \"Innovation remains the only lasting source of advantage for firms and places in the advanced industry sector, yet its speed and complexity are ratcheting up and demanding new strategies. Accordingly, both the private and public sectors need to radically rethink their technology development strategies. Lead actors in firms and government each need to ramp up the scale of their innovation efforts and reconsider the formats through which they conduct them. More R&D conducted within new, more open or networked innovation models will be necessary in the coming years.\" The capacity for innovation and ability to infuse emerging technologies are key competitive advantages as well as critical needs for the Southern Tier's advanced manufacturers. Based on the Annual Survey of Manufacturers, we know that businesses involved in transportation equipment and machinery are an important part of global innovation. This is apparent among Southern Tier manufacturers such as Corning Incorporated, Lockheed Martin, Dresser-Rand, Raymond Corporation, Alstom, Borg Warner and more. The nature of their products requires them to be both labor and R&D intense, demanding a constant infusion of technologies to remain competitive. 27 We believe the McKinsey Global Institute's forecast for the role of manufacturing in the global environment also will hold true for the Southern Tier because \"a strong pipeline of innovations in materials, information technology, production processes and manufacturing operations will give manufacturers the opportunity to design and build new kinds of products, reinvent existing ones and bring renewed dynamism to the sector.\" 28 Industry leaders in the Southern Tier say that the future of advanced manufacturing in the region will be focused on integrating emerging technologies into the design and manufacturing processes, particularly in electronics packaging and control systems, as well as energy storage. There is an expectation that investments in 3D printing, advanced materials and ongoing R&D with their academic partners will be critical factors for these companies to maintain a competitive edge. This is further emphasized in a recent report from the Brookings Institution, which notes: \"Already under way, the shift is being powered by three key technology developments. The first is the Internet of Things, in which embedded sensors transmit information from machine to machine, allowing them to work together and identify maintenance problems before a breakdown occurs. The second is advanced manufacturing, which includes 3-D printing, new materials and the 'digital thread,' where companies use very accurate digital models to guide all stages of product development, speeding the time to market and improving quality . Finally, there is distributed innovation, in which crowdsourcing is used to find radical solutions to technical challenges much more quickly and cheaply than with traditional in-house research and development.\" 29 The Southern Tier has powerful resources to advance several of these technologies, and specifically apply four of them to the advanced manufacturing sector with a focus on manufacturing processes and systems.Source: PriceWaterhouseCoopers, \"Breakthrough Innovation and Growth: 2013 Innovation Survey.\" 86 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe McKinsey Global Institute has identified 12 disruptive technologies that it forecasts will transform life, business and the global economy and will have the greatest potential to drive substantial economic impact and disruption by 2025. The Southern Tier's private-sector R&D and universities have nationally recognized prowess in five of these disruptive technologies, and will apply them to strengthening the advanced manufacturing industry . They include the Internet of Things and mobile Internet, energy storage, 3D printing, flexible electronics, advanced materials and renewable energy. Opportunities to advance emerging technologies in the Southern Tier \"Astonishing new technologies \u2014 ranging from advanced robotics and '3-D printing' to the 'digitization of everything' \u2014 are provoking genuine excitement even as they make it hard to see where things are going.\" Brookings Institution. America's Advanced Industries: What They Are, Where They Are, and Why They Matter. February 3, 2015. The Southern Tier's businesses have an opportunity to increase their competitiveness and global exports with groundbreaking research and innovative strategies being introduced by Binghamton and Cornell universities, together with private-sector R&D by international corporate leaders. Internet of Things and Mobile Internet The Internet of Things and mobile Internet will become more present in transportation information systems and networks, with initiatives like Next Gen and e-enabled aircraft in aviation, positive train control for railroads and transit and connected and automated technologies for cars, trucks and buses. 30 The growing issue of cyber security is a threat to all systems that use embedded software/firmware systems, particularly those in the most complex military aerospace and ground systems, commercial aerospace equipment, rail and road transportation systems and industrial products all over the world. The country's information systems and networks face new cyber threats, and these transformational changes will demand and enable new approaches to transportation security and resilience. 31 General Keith Alexander, chief of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, said the United States saw a 17-fold increase in cyber-attacks between 2009 and 2012. In addition, individuals are being targeted by increasingly sophisticated, coordinated attacks to conduct identity theft or to use individuals' computers to attack others. 32 As described in the White House's Strategic Plan for the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Program (2011a), a thorough understanding of cyber security vulnerabilities is needed to treat the causes of cyber security problems. As stated in a report prepared for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \"According to various estimates, cyber security threats and attacks cost U.S. companies tens of billions of dollars a year in direct costs \u2014 spending on proactive and reactive cyber security technologies and activities\u2014and likely much more in indirect costs, including the loss of intellectual property, service or product quality degradations, and reputational or customer loss. Although the total magnitude of these costs is unknown, the news media are replete with evidence that attests to the substantial impact inadequate cyber security has on companies and individuals.\" 33 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 87An issue for U.S. companies is the cost effectiveness of independently developing the technology platforms, resulting in a delay of new products and services to address the situation. Simultaneously, new technologies are being introduced in transportation so rapidly that the impact on the security and resilience of the overall system is not always well understood. Given the Southern Tier's identification as a transportation industry cluster, investment in an information security technology support ecosystem is essential to its continued growth and vitality. Information security technology for transportation is readily transferable to other critical domains such as energy, medicine, finance and industrial process control. An initial focus on the transportation industry cluster will give rise to additional industry work in these other sectors. As the number, complexity and potential impact of cyber threats continue to grow, increased academic-private R&D partnerships are crucial to the security of our nation's transportation infrastructure. In industry, the leaders in cybersecurity for mobile systems are in the defense aerospace industry. The Southern Tier is home to Lockheed Martin's Owego plant, which develops and manufactures avionics, control systems and computers for military helicopter and fixed wing aircraft, as well as BAE Systems, which develops and manufactures similar articles for military and commercial aircraft, as well as for hybrid buses and trucks. The capabilities, experiences and in-place supply chain relationships of these two entities will feature prominently in the Southern Tier's initiative, providing a jump start on progress and providing a natural flow to other participating companies in the Southern Tier's transportation advanced manufacturing industry cluster. Binghamton University has extensive credentials in cybersecurity research and teaching. In particular, the university is addressing cybersecurity of the control systems of U.S. Navy ships; this work applies directly to control systems for other vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses and automobiles. In addition, the university performs cybersecurity research for the U.S. Air Force Research Lab in Rome, as it has for over a decade, addressing security of Air Force control systems. Cornell University similarly has a well-established program of research and teaching in cybersecurity, addressing fundamental problems of security and reliability of the global critical computing infrastructure. Of note is its NSF-funded TRUST Science and Technology Center, and individual faculty member involvement in cybersecurity advisory boards to DARP A, DoD and Microsoft. The proposed approaches will be academic-private sector partnerships based on a mutual understanding that smart and connected systems can enhance transportation system resilience. Southern Tier and other New York State companies that would benefit or be partners in the center include BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Universal Instruments, Raymond Corporation, Alstom Transportation, Corning Incorporated, NYSEG, L-3 Communications, i3 Electronics and GE Aviation.Southern Tier businesses will increase their competitiveness and global exports by leveraging R&D from regional universities and the private sector.88 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanEnergy storage and harvesting There is a world-wide demand to find and use renewable energy sources. According to a recent analysis, \"Energy storage technology has great potential to improve electric power grids, to enable growth in renewable electricity generation, and to provide alternatives to oil-derived fuels in the nation's transportation sector.\" 34 Specifically, there is expected to be demand for application of energy storage in mass transportation vehicles, including light rail and buses. The Southern Tier's manufacturing sector and academic partners understand that the economy of the future will be fueled by environmentally sound practices and commercialization of technologies ranging from innovations in batteries and fuel cells to environmental sensors and power-aware computing. \"Energy storage products are the key to pervasive hybridization and electrification of transportation, from automobiles and buses to trucks and trains.\" (NYBEST, 2012). The Southern Tier is well positioned to gain a competitive edge in its transportation equipment supply chain with the commercialization of these technologies. For example, Binghamton University is a national leader in energy storage R&D. The NorthEast Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), an effort led by Binghamton University, includes as partners Rutgers University, Argonne National Laboratory, Cambridge University, MIT, the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of California at San Diego. The center, funded by the Department of Energy, supports basic research in the design of the next generation of lithium-ion batteries, which requires the development of new chemistries and the fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical processes that occur in these complex systems. 3D printing 3D printing will be a key factor in the future of advanced manufacturing by significantly reducing the cost of creating parts; however, technology has not yet allowed that to happen. 35 Currently, it's a smaller niche in the engineering and scientific community due to the high cost and commitment of technology development. The Binghamton University EPIC 3D Printing Center in the Endicott iDistrict will be an important tool in advancing the transportation equipment manufacturing sector in terms of production of components. Introduction of this emerging technology also creates an opportunity for the Southern Tier to develop a workforce with a unique skill set that's likely to be in high demand. This technology, according to almost all projections, will become commercialized and begin to establish itself as a staple of the marketplace. The Southern Tier is in a prime position to take advantage of this. Advanced materials Corning Incorporated is a global leader in advanced materials, and its powerful internal R&D is enhanced through collaboration with Alfred, Binghamton and Cornell Universities. Corning ceramic substrates launched a global clean-air movement, taking billions of tons of harmful pollutants out of vehicle exhaust. As Corning makes thin glass for consumer electronics, these same innovations are being applied to vehicle design. The tough, lightweight alternatives Corning offers for windows and sunroofs can help significantly lower the weight of a car \u2014 which, in turn, can improve fuel efficiency . Corning also is a player in dashboard touchscreens, colorful aesthetic outlines, and next-generation speakers are other high-end, glass-enabled features that automakers are beginning to Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 89incorporate in their designs. Corning's advanced materials also are used in aerospace and military vehicles, and the company's advanced materials are used in missile domes and telescope mirrors and lenses. Game-changing investment to increase R&D and infusion of technology The Southern Tier intends to embrace these technologies and make strategic investments in emerging technology centers and projects that will provide the transportation manufacturing sector, including large and small companies, with access to technology that is on the forefront of industrialization and commercialization. It is important to note the synergy between this initiative and the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem, where the Endicott iDistrict will have a focus on advanced manufacturing in the fields of 3D printing and advanced materials. In addition, Binghamton University's national leadership role in the field of Energy Storage and Harvesting will be critically important to advancing the Southern Tier's transportation industry cluster. Ongoing investments in R&D and start-up companies focused on advanced manufacturing, particularly transportation equipment design and manufacturing: The Southern Tier recognized that in the highly competitive global marketplace of advanced manufacturing and transportation products, innovation among the large multi-national companies alone is not enough to generate greater exports and create high paying jobs. There needs to be a continuous channel of new ideas, new business development and new job growth among start-up companies. For these reasons, the Southern Tier REDC will continue to support investment in spin-off companies, small firms in the supply chain that are investing in R&D, and start-up companies. This effort will dovetail with the Southern Tier Start-up Alliance (Regional Hot Spot), as well as leverage existing programs such as Start-Up NY, NY-BEST and 76West. Battery Dry Room for the NorthEast Center for Chemical Energy Storage: NECCES is designing the next generation of lithium-ion batteries for transportation and to enable renewable energy. NECCES, affiliated with Binghamton University's Center of Excellence, The NorthEast Center for Chemical Energy Storage at Binghamton University is a national leader in energy storage R&D. 90 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planis partnering with Corning Incorporated, BAE Systems, GE, and Raymond Corporation to develop new materials and devices for the transportation industry . The project involves creation of a battery dry room, which is an essential component for manufacturers to build and test systems where the results will be reliable and reproducible. The I-86 Corridor Center for Technology Infusion and High-Tech Engineering Design: The center, in the I-86 Innovation Corridor, will advance technologies for the Transportation Products, Components and Control Systems manufacturing sector. A consortium of corporations will operate the center and share in the pre-competitive research, as well as undertake proprietary research projects. The center will have its own multi-disciplinary researchers, working in collaboration with Binghamton and Alfred universities. The Southern Tier will assume a national leadership role in Secure Electronics and IoT Cybersecurity; and it requires that hardware and software be addressed. To this end, two game-changing projects are proposed: the Secure Electronics and Advanced Manufacturing Project, centered on developing and producing electronic processing hardware for the transportation industry with features supporting information security; and the Center for Transportation IoT Cybersecurity, addressing information security from the perspective of the software embedded in transportation system components and control hardware. Secure Electronics and Advanced Manufacturing Project: This project will advance the Southern Tier's manufacturing leadership for electronics hardware capable of providing secure processing solutions to address security concerns requiring cybersecurity and trusted systems, anti-tamper, anti-counterfeit and trusted manufacturing capabilities. It addresses mandates from government agencies such as DoD and growing demand from private companies in the transportation sector for secure hardware. The need for the highest level of secure electronic processor hardware technology is fundamental to a wide range of transportation equipment. The need originated in military systems and now extends to the control systems for commercial aerospace, ground transportation, energy and industrial process equipment. Secure processors provide the hardware foundation for cybersecurity in these systems. The Southern Tier is well positioned to fill the demand for protected electronic processing hardware with its R&D activities and capacity for commercialization of technology for electronics packaging, embedded systems, advanced processors and production of integrated systems. Lockheed Martin will take the lead in a collaborative project involving partners such as Binghamton University' s S 3IP, the U.S. Air Force Research Lab in Rome (Mohawk Valley Region), SUNY Polytechnic (both the Quad C campus in the Mohawk Valley Region and Albany campus in the Capital Region), and potentially companies such as BAE Systems in the Southern Tier and General Electric and Global Foundries in the Capital Region. Binghamton University will draw additional academic institutions such as Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester Region) and Clarkson University (North Country Region) active in electronics packaging and advanced materials. This team will be the nucleus growing into a critical mass of corporate leaders and supply chain companies positioning New York State as a force in the global competition to manufacture secure processing products. There is synergy with existing resources and proposed projects in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem Initiatives; in particular with Binghamton University' s proposed EPIC 3D Printing Center and the Center for Flexible Printed Electronics in the Endicott iDistrict. These centers will focus on advanced design, visualization and manufacture and commercialization of new products for the Advanced Transportation Products, Components and Control Systems manufacturing industry.These projects will position New York State as a force in the global competition to manufacture secure processing products.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 91The Center for Transportation IoT Cybersecurity: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the name given to the rapidly advancing vision of automated communication between equipment and autonomous decision making occurring without human instigation or mediation. Ensuring that this can be done in a trustworthy manner, safe from idle or nefarious interference, is an urgent issue and is growing in importance as transportation equipment becomes increasingly sophisticated, networked, autonomous and, therefore, increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attack. To do so depends, in part, on secure electronics processing hardware. Security of the IoT depends on security of the software comprising operating systems, communications and applications. Transportation equipment by its nature will depend on the mobile Internet, raising its own unique vulnerabilities. Software cybersecurity must ensure that transportation components, systems and controls are safe from unauthorized access, that information is not disclosed beyond the authorization of requestors, that the software is operating as intended with the influence of agents such as viruses or malware, that actions by the system are traceable and auditable and that unauthorized inputs, commands and modifications are not accepted. Manufacturers in the transportation industry cluster will produce some of the necessary hardware and software, but a significant portion will be procured from the supply chain; the end producers must integrate hardware and software components, build in appropriate software cybersecurity features to prevent, detect, resist and correct the ef fects of cyberattack, assuring the security and proper operation of the equipment and systems they produce. The Transportation IoT Cybersecurity Center will provide laboratories and technical equipment to support multi-company pre-competitive research on a shared cost basis to achieve this (similar to the university-industry consortium model used at Binghamton University's S 3IP). The center will allow for development and exchange of advanced ideas addressing fundamental needs of the companies it serves, complemented by research and company-specific development carried out by the center research staf f. The center will provide state-of-the-art software development infrastructure and tools, particularly benefiting small to medium companies with low-cost access to world-class infrastructure. The center laboratories will provide for testing of systems under simulated cyberattacks in a closed setting to provide security performance assurance. Binghamton University will take the lead on organizing the center , bringing to bear its longstanding experience in computer science and computer engineering as applied to software security system architectures. BAE Systems has expressed particular interest in secure embedded software and will be a lead partner in the initiative. Academic partners are expected to include Cornell University (Southern Tier Region) and Syracuse University (Central New York Region). The U.S. Air Force Research Lab in Rome is the USAF lead for information security; the existing partnership between Binghamton and AFRL will be leveraged to guide the center's development as well.92 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanStrategy 3. Human capital The Southern Tier's Advanced Manufacturing sector provides high-quality economic opportunities for workers with an annual compensation that is more than double the national average wage. Most important, the opportunity to earn such wages is not isolated to engineers and those with professional degrees as more than half of the sector 's workforce has less than a bachelor's degree, thus allowing the hard-to-place worker an entry into this workforce. Companies throughout the region \u2014 regardless of size \u2014 recognize that a highly skilled, qualified workforce is critical to their long-term success. There are several labor-supply challenges that make it difficult for employers to find qualified workers, which af fects their competitive position. A rapidly aging workforce. Like much of the state, the median age of the region's population is over 40. Approximately 25% of all manufacturing jobs across the region are held by workers 55 and older. This issue is magnified in the I-86 Corridor, where 22% of the population is over 60 years and the overall labor force will shrink by 12.6% (~42,000 people) by 2030. The University at Buffalo Regional Institute reports that \"without strong career pipelines, employers in certain industries (manufacturing, etc.) may struggle to fill vacancies, as younger workers are typically finding work in other sectors.\" Shrinking pool of qualified workers ... both now and in the future. Globalization and technological changes are rapidly, increasing the education requirements of the sector. The region has several effective training programs such as SUNY Delhi's Mechatronics degree in manufacturing processes with a focus on 3D printing, electrical instrumentation and controls. In addition, there are programs available through CSS Workforce NY, Greater Southern Tier BOCES, regional hub of the Empire State STEM Learning Network, SUNY Broome and Corning Community College programs. The region's P-TECH programs are critical to meeting the demand for STEM workers, such as the planned I-86 Corridor P-TECH program being led by Corning Incorporated, Corning Community College and BOCES. Negative attitude toward manufacturing jobs. The Manufacturing Institute recently released The Skills Gap in U.S. Manufacturing 2015 and Beyond Report, which confirms that there is a significant shortage of talent in U.S. manufacturing. 36 Among executives interviewed, 84% agree there is a talent shortage and six out of 10 reported that open skilled production positions are unfilled due to talent shortage, despite increasing wages. Between 2004 and 2012, the U.S. manufacturing industry lost $9 billion to $25 billion per year of output because of open positions that went unfilled. 37 It is forecasted that the skills gap is widening, and during the next decade nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will need to be filled. Based on the industry survey , 78% of companies agree that the talent shortage at all levels will impact their ability to implement new Southern Tier companies recognize that a highly skilled, qualified workforce is critical to their long-term success.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 93technologies and increase productivity, as well as innovate, develop new products and grow exports. Retaining college graduates. A significant challenge to the growth of advanced manufacturing in New York's Southern Tier is the inability of the sector to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled college graduates, particularly in STEM fields. Data suggest an inability of the Southern Tier to recruit and retain an educated, skilled workforce. The exodus of college graduates is among the region's most pressing economic problems. There is synergy between this project and the Promoting the Innovative Culture Initiative. Focus on hard-to-place workers. The Southern Tier recognizes the importance of engaging the hard-to-place worker in its future manufacturing economy, and we must work hard to continue placing an emphasis on hands-on training provided by private companies, NYS Workforce Investment Boards, community colleges, BOCES, VESID and other workforce development entities. There are several specific activities described in this initiative that are focused on the hard-to- place worker, and many have a direct focus on veterans. These include: n A consortium of colleges in the Southern Tier plans to undertake the creation of a central digital repository of prospective jobs and internships that will make the process of linking students and graduates with employment and internship options transparent, efficient and timely. n SUNY Broome will develop a Specialized Technician Training Opportunities Program, which will offer stand-alone certificates recognized by local employers, making it easier for hard-to-place workers to connect to real jobs. n The Southern Tier Small Manufacturing Competitiveness Fund will give preference to businesses in distressed communities and also have a requirement to hire hard-to-place workers. n The Advanced Rail Technology Center project in Hornell will provide job opportunities for hard-to-place workers, including veterans and low-income residents. n Raymond Corporation' s employee recruitment activities focused on hard-to-place workers will serve as a model on a regional basis. Specifically, the company routinely engages in a variety of employment creation opportunity activities for the hard-to-place worker, such as participating in a job fair for the homeless and assisting in the development of job skills for the disabled through VESID. Game-changing investments to recharge the skills pipeline \"Characterized by high levels of R&D and a heavy reliance on STEM workers, advanced industries power U.S. economic growth and development.\" 38 The bottom line is that a strong workforce is essential for sustainability and growth; no workforce means no manufacturing, and no manufacturing means no economy . The Southern Tier must focus on attracting more qualified workers with different and more technical skill sets to ensure the future competitiveness of the sector. Steps need to be taken to expose young people to career opportunities, engage the existing workforce in technical skills training and aggressively recruit new talent at all levels ranging from scientists and engineers to the highly skilled hourly worker. Online Job and Internship Repository: A significant challenge to the growth of advanced manufacturing in the Southern Tier is the inability of the sector to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled college graduates. The exodus of college graduates is among the region's most 94 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planpressing economic problems. To better and more efficiently match employers with graduates of manufacturing-related programs, a consortium of colleges in the Southern Tier plans to explore the creation of a central digital repository of prospective jobs and internships. This consortium, SUNY Broome, SUNY Delhi and Binghamton University, will create a pilot that may be scalable across the Southern Tier and New York State. Integrating manufacturers, colleges and students into a consistently updated repository will make the process of linking students and graduates with employment and internship options transparent, efficient and timely, a win-win for employers, graduates and the Southern Tier. Southern Tier Manufacturing Workforce Awareness and Recruitment Promotion Program: This project will be a subset of the branding program as outlined in the Promoting the Southern Tier Innovative Culture Initiative. Specialized Technician Training Opportunities Program: This project leverages synergies among academia, target industries and workforce development systems. Training is linked to stated needs of regional companies and input from SUNY Broome's Workforce Development Advisory Board. Job skills training will emphasize basic skills, special needs and sustainable/green practices in manufacturing. By expanding academic pathways that allow students to obtain four-year degrees at SUNY Broome and other regional colleges including SUNY Delhi, more of the students will be motivated to stay in the region. Also, by offering stand- alone certificates recognized by local employers, hard-to-place workers will be more likely to participate in and complete training programs that bolster their hiring qualifications. Global impact Investments will be made in major anchor businesses to strengthen their competitive positioning and grow exports. Examples include Upstate Shredding, Hilliard Corporation, Lockheed Martin and Anchor Glass. Investments also will be made in foreign-owned companies to stimulate their increased investment in cutting-edge equipment, expansion of facilities to accommodate increased production capacity, and increased workforce. These include companies such as DeMet's Candy, BAE Systems, Raymond Corporation, Alstom and more. Sustainability A key element of this initiative is building long-lasting and productive partnerships between the business and academic communities to strengthen each businesses' competitive edge by providing state-of-the-art equipment and infusing emerging technologies. This initiative calls for development of two R&D centers; that is, the Center for IoT Cybersecurity and the Center for Technology Infusion. Both are regionally oriented and focused on the region's greatest strength; that is, the design and manufacture of transportation products, components and system controls. Both centers will have the same funding and organizational structure, and will be modeled after the structure of successful, sustainable industry/university research consortia used at numerous universities across the country, including S 3IP at Binghamton University. No single source of money sustains these research centers. This successful model involves a diverse mix of membership fees, contracted research from industry and federal sponsors (e.g., NIH, NIST, NSF, DoE, AFRL, ONR), work-for-hire for industry (e.g., analytical lab work) and university infrastructure investment in support of faculty research capability to provide long-term ongoing operations. URI investments will provide the initial stand up and operating funds required to launch the centers. The corporate sector will participate with a commitment of $2 million in membership fees and $15-$20 million of countable in-house company investments. Binghamton University will be the lead and anchor for the centers. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 95While we intend to attract work from our region and beyond, the centers will of fer several value propositions to keep the fruit of the relationship in New York State. First, we will work closely with the Start-Up NY program; second, offering access to infrastructure that would be otherwise unaffordable raises the opportunity cost of moving away; third, by emphasizing a strongly interactive, customer-centric partnership the centers will of fer partners expediency and economy that is difficult to match in a long-distance relationship; fourth, by emphasizing the local university talent pipelines, and ensuring that the Southern Tier is a preferred region for retaining those graduates, employers will find it advantageous to remain local. Inter-regional collaboration Binghamton University, Cornell University and Corning Incorporated will be collaborating with Alfred University in the Western NY Region (WNY) on the application of advanced materials research in the design and manufacture of transportation products and components. There is an existing inter-regional relationship, and Alfred University's Center for High-temperature Characterization Laboratory and Center for Advanced Ceramics Technology have agreed to continue its partnership for this initiative; as well as Clarkson University' s Center for Advanced Materials Processing in the North Country. There also will be collaboration with the Central NY, Mohawk Valley and Capital Regions in the areas of secure electronics hardware R&D and cybersecurity software R&D; particularly with Lockheed Martin, Binghamton University and Cornell University of the Southern Tier working in collaboration with private companies such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, the U.S. Air Force Research Lab in Rome and SUNY IT, Quad C, both in the Mohawk Valley Region; the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering in the Capital Region and Syracuse University in Central NY. In addition, the Southern Tier is involved in the NSF-funded TRUST Science and Technology Center, and individual faculty members from Cornell and Binghamton are involved in cybersecurity advisory boards to DARP A, DoD and Microsoft. The NorthEast Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), an ef fort led by Binghamton University, includes as partners Rutgers University, Argonne National Laboratory, Cambridge University, MIT, the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of California at San Diego. The center, funded by the Department of Energy, supports basic research in the design of the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. Also in the field of energy storage are opportunities for collaboration Cornell University Fuel Cell research program. Existing inter-regional collaborations in the field of advanced materials will be enhanced. These include collaborations among Corning Incorporated, Binghamton University' s Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing Center, Cornell University's Center for Materials Research, together with Alfred University's Center for High-temperature Characterization Laboratory and Center for Advanced Ceramics Technology in the Western NY Region. There is synergy with existing resources and proposed projects described in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem Initiative; in particular with Binghamton University' s proposed EPIC 3D Printing Center and the Center for Flexible Printed Electronics in the Endicott Advanced Manufacturing iDistrict. These centers will focus on advanced design, visualization and manufacture and commercialization of new products for the Advanced Transportation Products, Components and Control Systems manufacturing industry, which offers the opportunity for continued collaboration with Xerox Corporation in the Finger Lakes region, as well universities and companies such as Clarkson in the Central NY and the North Country regions. 96 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanOrganizational structure Regional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Plan Advanced Manufacturing Initiative $183M URI Investment Advanced Manufacturing EcosystemInnovation and Infusion of Emerging Technologies Recharge the Skills Pipeline and Attract STEM WorkersStrengthen competitive positioning and grow global exports of anchor companies Southern Tier Small Manufacturing Competitiveness Fund to build manufacturing base Grow and strengthen supply chain Infrastructure improvements to enhance advanced manufacturing capacity Basic infrastructure improvements to accommodate growth and expansion of anchors and supply chain Revitalization of manufacturing industry support communities, including Corning, Elmira, Hornell, NorwichSecure Electronics and Advanced Manufacturing Project I-86 Corridor Center for Technology InfusionCenter for Transportation IoT CybersecurityNortheast Center for Chemical Energy StorageInvestment in R&D and start-up companies Online job and internship repository Southern Tier Manufacturing Workforce Awareness and Recruitment Promotion Program (subset of regional branding) Workforce training programs at SUNY Delhi, Corning Community College, SUNY Broome Manufacturing Skills Development Center and private sector Performance measures n Southern Tier is recognized as a leader in advanced manufacturing, particularly in transportation products, components and system controls n Southern Tier is recognized as a leader in cybersecurity in the transportation industry cluster n Job creation: 3,300 new jobs n Private-sector investment of $915 million n Economic impact of $1 ,162,575,000 n Increase annual exports in the region' s manufacturing from $11.6 billion to $15 billion n Achieve an average annual wage of $65,000 in the region' s manufacturing industry and $80,000 in the transportation equipment sector during the next five years n National recognition for commercialization of R&D n Increase in workforce training n Revitalize the communities that are the support structure for the manufacturing industry in terms of repurposing vacant downtown buildings, reduced vacancies in commercial spaces.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 97 Year 1: Examples of Projects Ready to Go Raymond Manufacturing Center of Excellence Advanced Rail Technology Center in HornellSecure Electronics and Advanced Manufacturing ProjectUpstate Shredding Media PlantCorning Community Health and Education ComplexElmira College and LECOM Driving Elmira RefreshLeatherstocking Natural Gas Line (construction of 18-mile natural gas distribution line)Cameron Manufacturing 300,000 square foot expansionTransit Air ExpansionAnchor Glass Container Mfg.

A strategic mix of projects will transform and grow agriculture and food production, processing and distribution across the region, while also strengthening links to growing tourism and manufacturing industries. Strategy 1. Develop and deploy new technologies to transition the Southern Tier from being a highly seasonal, occasional provider of food products to a reliable source of supply for the East Coast. 2. Promote and leverage existing and new support structures for growers and producers in the region, including the $30 million Southern Tier Agricultural Economic Development Initiative, to help expand farms and increase their profitability . 3. Increase the diversity of and access to food processing facilities around the region, including slaughterhouses, meatpacking and poultry processing facilities, dairy processing facilities and aseptic packaging facilities for vegetables. 4. Leverage our location at the crossroads of upstate New York via the creation of a \"food hub\" network that facilitates market connections and distribution of food products for production centers in regions across the state. 5. Pioneer workforce development programs designed to bolster food and agriculture industries. 6. Advance New York State initiatives, including Opportunity Agenda, Veterans Initiative, Southern Tier Agriculture Initiative, Global NY, Start-Up NY, NYSTAR and Cleaner Greener.

In the Southern Tier, food and agriculture industries play a diverse and critical role in the economy , with key sub-industries ranging from traditional crop production to organic production and from winemaking to world-class yogurt production. The eight counties of the Southern Tier regularly rank in the top 10 counties across the state for crop production, and they sold more than $165 million in crops in 2012 (Agriculture Census, 2012). This represents cultivation of just over 1.1 million acres across the region, more than 5,600 farms and more than 9,000 full- and part-time farm operators (UBRI, Agriculture Census 2012). This strong agricultural base feeds into other key food and agriculture industries of the Southern Tier including, but not limited to, dairy, organics, premium beverage processing and value-added food processing. The dairy industry, driven by demand for yogurt nationwide, produces more than $500 million annually in milk sales and dairy product manufacturing for the region, and employs over 500 residents. The organic industry is also growing in the Southern Tier, where the number of organic operations and farms has tripled since 2002. The number of premium beverage firms (winemakers, craft brewers, distilleries) has increased by 17 firms since 2004, and contributes $4.5 million to the regional economy each year . The food-manufacturing sector boasts relatively high wages of $47,663 a year , and the value- added food industry is one the fastest growing in the Southern Tier, with an 18% increase in jobs since 2009 and just under $430 million in annual output. These diverse industries are representative of the potential for growth in agriculture and food in the Southern Tier. Overall, the agriculture and food system produces $5.2 billion in output for the Southern Tier, or 9.5% of the region's total economy. These sectors make up 11.5% of the total regional employment with 45,000 jobs (including food service), and produce $2.1 billion annually in value-added (inputs subtracted from total output) for the Southern Tier economy. The value- added as a percentage of the economy is 6.8%, higher than the New York State's 4.3%, illustrating that these industries drive economic growth in the Southern Tier (Schmit, 2012). Agriculture and food industries in New York State have output multipliers of between 1.79 and 1.98, meaning that each dollar spent in these sectors generates nearly an additional dollar of activity in the overall economy. The food manufacturing sector has a high employment multiplier of 3.17, indicating that for every job created in food manufacturing three additional jobs are generated elsewhere. The food manufacturing multiplier is one of the highest in the state when compared across all industries (Schmit, 2012). Southern Tier output by industry Source: Schmit, 2012102 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanOpportunity for transformation Why food and agriculture for the Southern Tier? Our assets in agriculture are strong and unique. According to a 2012 survey of food manufacturers in New York State, the top five criteria for selecting a location included: quality of college/university research and assistance, proximity of consumer markets, quality of communication infrastructure, the region's overall quality of life and state branding/promotional activities (Schmit, 2012). The Southern Tier is well positioned to meet these criteria: n Home to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, ranked in the top 2 in the world as a college and first in plant sciences (QS W orld University Rankings, US News) n Sits at the crossroads of rail lines and major interstates, giving us access to distribution n Within 500 miles of more than 1 15 million consumers (freemaptools.com) n 5,621 farms, second only to the Finger Lakes among regions in New Y ork State n An abundance of fresh water , which will become increasingly important as other regions of the country continue to struggle with drought The regional trend in food production and distribution already has great momentum. Between 2009 and 2013 the food manufacturing sector gained more than 1,000 jobs in the Southern Tier, more than any other industry. The food processing cluster, or geographic concentration of related food industries, showed an 18% increase in jobs between 201 1 and 2013 (UBRI, 2015). An in-depth study conducted in Steuben County in 2015 reinforces the opportunity to use the food and agriculture industry to grow the region's economic base. The Steuben County planning effort resulted in a strategy to support local farmers and agriculture-related businesses in their efforts to create value-added products and promote the processing, marketing and distribution of the county's farm goods. The plan created a road map to attract and develop new agriculture-related enterprises involved in the production, storage, distribution and processing of agri-based products and services. The work also identified catalyst projects that would take advantage of the county' s vibrant economic base, including a USDA-certified slaughterhouse, a local food enterprise center and commercial kitchen, vodka distillery and local malt house to support the growing beer and spirits industry. The United States is facing food production challenges. California traditionally produces more than 50% of key crops in the U.S. such as broccoli, lettuce, spinach, carrots, peaches and strawberries. The drought that began in 2012 has degraded California's ability to continue this rate of production, losing $1 billion from the agriculture economy and more than 7,500 agriculture jobs just in 2014 (UBRI Deep Dive). Even as other regions in the United States continue to experience drought, the New York environment will become warmer and wetter, with a projected increase of 6 degrees in temperature and 12% increase in rainfall by 2050 (NYSERDA, 2014). The Southern Tier has an opportunity to fill gaps in production in other parts of the country that lose the natural resources necessary for high levels of agricultural production. Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, UB Regional InstituteSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 103 What are the strategies for capitalizing on these opportunities? First, we will develop and deploy agricultural technologies \u2014 extending the growing season through controlled environment agriculture (CEA) such as greenhouses, high tunnels and hydroponics while also leveraging new advances in plant science and renewable energy . These technologies will transform the Southern Tier and other regions of New York from being a highly seasonal provider of food products to a reliable source of supply for the East Coast. To enable this vision, we will pioneer the use of clean energy technologies to reduce the cost of controlled environment agriculture production, 75% of which is attributed to energy costs. Through plant metabolomics, we will support industrial processes, a vigorous startup environment and the development of a pharmaceutical cluster in the Southern Tier. This also provides synergy with Binghamton University's new pharmacy school in the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem. Second, we will promote and leverage existing and new support structures for growers and producers in the region, including the already approved and funded $30 million Southern Tier Agricultural Economic Development Initiative, to help expand farms and increase their profitability. We will complement this growth with workforce development programs to help educate future farmers and renew an aging farmer population, targeted at young, veteran, immigrant and low-income workers. Third, we will increase the diversity of and access to food processing facilities around the region. Without slaughterhouses, meatpacking and poultry processing facilities, dairy processing facilities and aggregation and packaging facilities for horticultural crops, farmers are held back from increasing their production. Just as the explosion of the yogurt business helped grow New York State's dairy processing industry into the largest in the nation and to drive the dairy production industry to be the third largest in the nation, food processing is a critical link in the chain. Fourth, we will facilitate distribution of raw and value-added products by leveraging our location at the crossroads of upstate New York and within a day's drive to a third of the U.S. population. Distribution will be increased within and outside of the Southern Tier via the creation of a \"food hub\" network. This network will manage market connections and collaboration among regional distribution hub facilities and between New York State regions\u2014 providing a framework for producers statewide to sell and value-added processors, wholesalers and retailers to buy product in market-sized quantities. Technology104 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanACHIEVING THE VISION OF TRANSFORMATION Strategy 1: Technology The region's strength in agricultural innovation exemplified by Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences provides an unprecedented opportunity to increase volume and continuity in production with advances in plant science technology, controlled environment agriculture and renewable energy. Investment in these areas will not only increase the region's market share in New York State and throughout the East Coast, but also deploy new technology across the state via CALS' existing statewide network. This investment will contribute well-paying jobs to the local economy and exports out of the region. Plant science and controlled environment agriculture Revolutionary new tools, exemplified by genomics and big data, are transforming our ability to drive a pipeline for better plants that are sustainably grown and serve the East Coast market. In turn, closer connections with consumers, food industry practitioners, nutritionists, agronomists and climate experts provide new targets for crop improvement. Advances in fundamental plant biology and synthetic biology open new opportunities for plants to produce useful compounds (from pharmaceuticals to plastics) and gain new capabilities for improving our environment. These developments create opportunities for new businesses and the ability to enhance existing ones. A key asset in plant sciences is Cornell University, home to the top-ranked plant science program in the world. Cornell's School of Integrative Plant Science (SIPS), the affiliated Cornell University, home to the top-ranked plant science program in the world, provides unrivaled depth and breadth in plant science R&D. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 105Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Science (BTI) and Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health (USDA-ARS) provide depth and breadth in plant science research and development that is unrivaled. SIPS was launched by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in June 2014 to provide a unifying framework for five disciplines with interrelated activities: horticulture, plant biology, plant breeding and genetics, plant pathology and plant-microbe biology, and soil and crop sciences. SIPS and about 100 researchers expended $51.9M to conduct plant-related research during fiscal year 13-14. Sixty to 70 plant varieties, cultivars or germplasm generated by SIPS researchers are licensed annually and approximately 65 plant intellectual property disclosures are made annually . Researchers at BTI expended $9.5M on plant research in the last fiscal year. Research conducted at BTI resulted in 40 technology transfer and collaborative industry agreements, 29 patent applications (10 in U.S. and 19 international) and seven invention disclosures in 2014. Both SIPS and BTI are supported by the New York State Food Venture Center and the Kevin M. McGovern Family Center for Venture Development in Life Sciences, both of which incubate and support plant-related businesses. A key inhibitor of agricultural growth in the Southern Tier is the short growing season; most fruits and vegetables in New York State have a growing season of five months or less. For example, field-grown strawberries have a harvest season of two months in New York, compared to a harvest season of seven months in California (New York Department of Agriculture, California Grown). Greenhouses, high tunnels and other forms of controlled environment agriculture can double the length of the season, enabling the continuity necessary to capture larger markets. As demand for local produce increases to $7 billion in the U.S. (ICP , 2015), the need for continuity in the supply chain will also increase demand for controlled environment produce from $3 billion to $4 billion by 2020 (Rabobank, 2013). According to the U.S. Census of Agriculture, New York State was home to 435 controlled environment facilities in 2012 that produced a total of $27.4 million in vegetables. This represents a 54% increase from 2007. In the Southern Tier, there were 39 controlled environment facilities, making up 9% of the New York total, compared to 19 facilities in 2007. Southern Tier facilities produced $0.63 million in vegetables in 2012, a 14% increase from 2007. This upward trajectory, coupled with improved processing and distribution capacity, access to water and proximity to unparalleled agricultural research facilities, makes the Southern Tier a natural location for a national controlled environment agriculture hub. Technology developed in the Southern Tier will be deployed to other regions in New York and the nation, spurring year-round production and decreasing dependency on a small number of production centers. Steps have already been made toward this goal, and the Food and Agriculture Initiative seeks to leverage these actions. For example, the Greenhouse Lighting and Systems Engineering (GLASE) project led by Cornell University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute seeks to reduce energy costs and the carbon footprint of greenhouses by building upon the investment of local, national and international partners (including NYSERDA, General Electric, Epistar and Price Chopper). The Food and Agriculture Initiative will support projects that improve plant production efficiency and continuity in the Southern Tier and that catalyze new business growth via technology transfer with a focus on boosting the controlled environment agriculture market. Projects may include applied plant science research that enables greater production yield, business profitability, integration of plant science research and controlled environment agriculture, partnering with private investors to build CEA facilities, and the creation of businesses based on state-of-the-art plant science technology.106 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanRenewable energy The success of controlled environment agriculture in our region is closely tied to advances in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Seasonally produced food in New York State high tunnels, such as tomatoes, lettuce, spinach and strawberries, requires between four and nine times more energy than year-round imports (Albright and de Villiers, 2008). This is because controlled environment production in New York has higher electricity and heat costs during the winter. Seventy-five percent of all costs associated with running a controlled environment facility can be attributed to energy, and of that, 95% is related to heating and lighting. In order to make controlled environment agriculture viable in the Southern Tier, it is essential to lower the cost of energy related to running these facilities year-round. The most common forms of fuel used to power controlled environment facilities are electricity and natural gas (Albright and de Villiers, 2008), and profitability of facilities thus depends heavily on market price of these fuels. In 2007, the dollar amount of energy needed to produce one pound of lettuce ranged from $0.28 to $0.73 depending on the growing method (supplementary light and carbon dioxide control). Energy prices were similar for the other crops studied by Albright and de Villiers. In the next 25 years, industrial electricity prices are expected to grow by 22% and natural gas by over 90%, while transportation energy is expected to cost an average of 16% more across all fuel types (U.S. Energy Information Administration, Energy Outlook 2015). These projections indicate that current methods of producing and importing food products will get more expensive, and that there is opportunity for the Southern Tier to supply New York State and other metro areas with lower-cost regionally produced food. The future of CEA will be highly profitable for the Southern Tier if key advances can reduce the energy costs of year-round production. Using local and renewable energy sources not tied to growing fuel costs, including LED lighting, anaerobic digestion, earth source heat, biomass energy, microgrid systems, solar and wind will also be important (see Appendix for more information). The Food and Agriculture Initiative will support projects that elevate the Southern Tier as a pioneer in renewable and sustainable energy. Projects may include applied research linked to increased efficiency and production ability, integration of energy technology into existing facilities (electricity and natural gas, any new technologies), and the creation of a knowledgeable and skilled renewable energy workforce. Game-changing investments The Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University will rapidly advance new agricultural production technologies, demonstrate these technologies at a commercial level, provide a facility where entrepreneurs can test new practices and provide opportunities for private companies to locate adjacent to Cornell facilities and scientists. The center will consist of expanded capabilities in existing facilities as well as new facilities next to Cornell University. It will have controlled environment facilities, a facility for rapidly phenotyping plants, expanded capacity for plant transformation and for studying plant metabolomics and the capacity for businesses to test concepts and methods. Technologies such as lights, solar panels, glass systems and controls designed to enable controlled environment agriculture (CEA) in northern climates will be developed and evaluated. The center will foster partnerships between regional educational institutions that include Cornell University and Binghamton University and manufacturers with strengths in To make controlled environment agriculture viable in the Southern Tier, we must lower the cost of running these facilities year-round.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 107glass and greenhouse materials (Corning Inc.), and will leverage existing private company commitment to CEA through GLASE. A primary goal of the center will be to advance controlled environment agriculture in the Southern Tier. Technology, innovation and business development needed to do so include the following: form factor and growing systems, lighting, control systems, plants, nutrients, energy and private partnerships and business development (see Appendix for more details). The project has a total project cost of approximately $20 million over five years, with non-URI funding from Cornell University, the Boyce Thompson Plant Science Institute, the NY Farm Viability Institute, GLASE and private companies. Additional project examples The Beef and Cattle Research Program will leverage existing investment in beef research through the Cornell Cooperative Extension and the Cornell University Ruminant Center (CURC) to improve the efficiency and quality of beef production in the Southern Tier, New York State and the nation. Local actors in the beef industry including JBS, Pineland Farms Natural Meats and Gratitude Railroad will provide private investment in research, with supplemental funds from pharmaceutical and mineral companies also working in this area. The Earth Source Heat project will capitalize on Cornell University's research to make the Southern Tier a leader in biomass and geothermal energy production, particularly as it applies to agriculture. This initiative will stimulate regional agricultural business in its pilot stage as a supplier of energy and heat to controlled environment agriculture facilities. Other related areas, such as geology, engineering and food processing, will also benefit. Demand for dairy products has risen by 113% since 2001, driven in part by the popularity of Greek yogurt.108 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanStrategy 2: Production Production of raw products is the base upon which growth in the food and agriculture industries stand. Investing in projects that will increase production of the goods needed to create value-added products and commodity sales, including vegetables, grains and meat, will drive meaningful growth in the Southern Tier. Innovations in the production and sale of raw goods themselves also have significant potential to transform the economy of the Southern Tier, especially as traditional hotbeds of agricultural production lose market share due to weather and natural resource scarcity. This trend is illustrated by the drought in California, where 17,000 jobs and $2.1 billion have been lost by the agriculture industry in 2014-15 (UBRI Deep Dive). The drought in California has important implications for food production in New York and across the United States. California produces between 60% and 100% of most key U.S. crops, including broccoli, carrots, lettuce, peppers, spinach, grapes, strawberries and peaches. New York, by contrast, requires just 6% of total national product to feed its upstate population, but currently meets that threshold for only about six crops (beans, cabbage, squash, apples, sweet corn and onion) \u2014 relying on other regions to provide staple crops (UBRI). As prices for crops imported from California continue to rise (beans, tomatoes, kale, grapes and lettuce have all increased in price per unit since 2010), importing staple crops will become more expensive even as technology makes local production less expensive. The Southern Tier already has a strong legacy for production of food and forage land. Out of 62 New York counties Steuben County ranks in the top 10 for forage land, corn for grain and silage, oats, cattle, pigs, sheep and horses, and even ranks 6th and 15th among national counties (3,000+) for oat and forage land respectively. Schuyler County ranks 6th in the state and 51st in the country for grape acreage with 1,335 acres used in the county . California is expected to scale back on production of corn, rice and forage land. As these crops use the most water at least economic return (UBRI), the Southern Tier is positioned to scale up production of these crops. The following production sectors are areas where the Southern Tier has particular strength or opportunity for growth: Produce and vegetables: Most crops consumed by New York residents are grown outside of New York State, with 50% or more of key crops produced in California. As the drought in the West continues to stifle production for traditional agriculture powerhouse states, the Southern Tier has an opportunity to scale up production to meet demand for food products both within the state and throughout the Northeast (see Appendix for more information). Beef and cattle: Global demand and prices for beef have risen in recent years, putting pressure on suppliers of feeder calves. The Southern Tier is ideally positioned to grow the beef industry due to nearly 200,000 acres of vacant agriculture land and a central location for distribution. Investing in the beef industry in the Southern Tier will add jobs to farm operations, as well as in support industries such as veterinary, dairy, feed supply and lenders. Organic: The Southern Tier has a unique opportunity to become a hub of organic products, because the smaller farm size is more conducive to the organic supply chain than larger operations found in other parts of the country. The national market for organic food products is expected to clear $45 billion in 2015, with organic fruits and vegetables dominating despite growth in the organic meat, fish and poultry markets. National demand for organic products is expected to grow by 14% between 2014 and 2018 (U.S. Organic Food Market Forecast & Opportunities, 2014-18). The region is already expanding to meet this demand; in 2012 the Southern Tier was home to 148 organic operations and 167 organic farms, with total sales Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 109 Production of selected fruits and vegetables in NYS and California, 2014 Source: USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service, UB Regional InstituteProduction of 0% does not necessarily mean there is no production but that production levels are negligible, as compared to national levels produced.110 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Planof just over $12 million (USDA Census of Agriculture). This represents a tripling in the number of organic operations in the Southern Tier since 2002. Workforce development and training are essential in order to capitalize on these opportunities. This is of particular importance as farm operators get older. The average age of a farm operator approached 55 in 2012 in New York State. In the Southern Tier, the average age of a farm operator was higher at 58 in 2012, while the number of farm operators has declined 1% since 2007. In addition to supporting farmer education and training programs, there is also need for development in critical support areas of production, including: veterinary programs, animal care programs, controlled environment agriculture technicians and processing technicians. There is the opportunity for the region to take advantage of existing capacity and expertise in Cornell' s Small Farms Program, the network of Cornell Cooperative Extensions, Corning Community College, SUNY Broome, SUNY Delhi and the burgeoning Groundswell Farmer Incubator program targeting immigrants, veterans and vulnerable workers. The Food and Agriculture Initiative also will support projects that increase capacity for production, including innovation in production efficiency. Projects may include research to improve production of fruits, vegetables and grain, investments in production capacity of farms and facilities, and workforce development. These investments will leverage New York State's commitment to agriculture through the $30 million Southern Tier Agriculture Fund by augmenting capacity improvements with workforce development, research and market development. Game-changing investments: The Southern Tier Agriculture Development Fund (STAD-F) will include loan funds, loan guarantees and direct public capital investments with private match with the goal of bridging the funding gap for farmers who invest in CEA technology. Partners will include local and national financial institutions. Vineyard Reclamation and Replacement Program in several counties, including Schuyler, Steuben and Tompkins. There is a shortage of vinifera grapes in the region, which is preventing wineries from increasing production to meet demand. It is projected that each 25,000-case winery results in 15-20 full-time, year-round jobs and up to an additional 30 part-time, seasonal positions. The Ag Micro project, in Delaware County, is a continuation of a successful program designed to aid in growth and sustainability of agriculturally focused small business in Delaware County through provision of general business education and small business grants to offset expenses relating to start-up and/or expansion efforts. The Groundswell Farmer Incubator Capacity Improvement and Regional Expansion will increase the Groundswell Farmer Incubator's ability to provide workforce training, business development and entrepreneurial support to vulnerable workers interested in pursuing agricultural careers. Groundswell targets new Americans, low-income residents and Average age of farm operator by county Source: USDA Agriculture Census, 2012Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 111previously incarcerated individuals, and provides training for careers in food and agriculture professions. Groundswell seeks funding to develop a training farm at its current location and expand its offerings beyond Tompkins County, building upon its track record of assisting more than 60 residents in securing agricultural careers since opening in 2010. The Southern Tier Agriculture Education Fund will provide support to pioneering workforce development programs that bolster food and agriculture industries. It will be managed by the Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Development Cooperative. The Southern Tier Agriculture Education Fund will sponsor training programs for farmers, and will also support innovative and high-growth food and agriculture industries such as beef feeder cattle, wine-making, controlled environment agriculture, renewable energy, veterinary care, processing and agri-tourism. Jobs in these industries on average have higher wages than traditional farming (most near or above the regional average of $46,000), and provide opportunities for regional residents, including veterans and low-income residents. The fund will be seeded in the amount of $1 million per year, or $5 million over five years \u2014 with all projects required to serve 25% hard-to-place Southern Tier residents and a conservative target of 200 total participants per year. Examples of education programs include: In the Beef Industry Certificate Program, participants will complete a 12- to 15-month program with lecture and hands-on training in the areas of grass feeding, leasing land for grazing, contract negotiation and business structure. The Viticulture NYS Certified Apprenticeship Program will address the need for skilled labor in wineries, identified as a significant barrier to future growth for the entire industry. For example, Schuyler County Partnership for Economic Development is working with wineries and local colleges to create New York State Certified Apprenticeship Programs modeled after similar apprenticeships in California and Europe. The Controlled Environment Training Program will cultivate a semi-skilled workforce to complement growth in the controlled environment industry. The training program will leverage investment in the Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University and existing expertise in workforce development via the Small Farms Program, resulting in a workforce that is skilled in using controlled environment technology to produce crops. The program will be tailored to local workers, including veterans and low-income individuals. The Urban Agriculture Module, proposed at the Willow Avenue location for Cornell Cooperative Extension Tompkins County in Ithaca, will provide training opportunities in aquaponics, hydroponics and controlled environment agriculture for youths and low-income households. These facilities will be used in connection with the Youth Farm project, Food Dignity project (a food security and business development ef fort organized and operated by low-income households throughout the county), Groundswell Training Center for new farmers and Community Gardening programs. The Energy Workforce Development Program will work with researchers, companies and workers to cultivate a skilled workforce versed in using new technologies developed through existing state programs run through NYSERDA, as well as 76W est. The project will prioritize training for hard-to-place workers and will be synergistic with the Controlled Environment Training Program.112 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanAnimal food manufacturing $928,784 Grain and oilseed milling $69,650,276 Sugar and confectionery $18,380,218 Fruit and vegetable preserving $7,155,444 Dairy product manufacturing $268,560,792 Animal slaughtering and processing $29,296,189 Seafood product preparation $1,1 11,616 Bakeries and tortilla $2,289,557 Other food manufacturing manufacturing $6,966,423 T otal Southern Tier $429,520,21 1Strategy 3: Processing A survey of processing firms conducted by Cornell's Dyson School researchers found that firms in upstate New York sell more than 70% of product to locations in upstate New York, with just 10% of sales attributed to downstate, about 22% to other states and about 2% exported (Schmit, 2012). Exports of food and beverage products manufactured in the United States have increased by 26% since 2009, reaching $63 billion in total exports and overtaking agricultural exports for the first time in 2013. National sub-industries with the largest growth in exports include craft beer and dairy, the latter of which had $6.6 billion in exports in 2013 (Food Processing, 2014). This data suggests that with increased capacity there's an opportunity for upstate processors to expand market share within the state, nationally and internationally. State-wide food and beverage manufacturing in particular has grown at a faster rate than manufacturing as a whole (18% growth compared to 11% since 1997), and has lost a smaller proportion of jobs. Individual processing firms report average three-year revenue growth at 5.6%, and 37% of firms in 2009 expected to increase staffing, despite the economic recession (Schmit, 2012). In the Southern Tier, there are about 200 employer firms in the food and beverage manufacturing sectors, with an additional 90 non-employer firms (non-employer firms contribute sales and output, but don't have employees). Of the sub-sectors within food manufacturing, dairy contributes the most output, at about $268 million per year . The second- largest production sector is grain and oilseed milling, which includes rice, flour , malt, corn, oil and breakfast cereal production. Beverage manufacturing, with 36 firms (the same as dairy), produces almost $7 million in output. The Southern Tier has particular opportunities to support processing capacity in a number of sectors, including the following (more information in Appendix): Value-added processing: Value-added processing is a $25 million industry in the Southern Tier, with the majority of product shipped out of the region. Perishable food manufacturing, snack food manufacturing and miscellaneous food manufacturing all add about two jobs to the economy for every job created, and for every sale dollar, have a multiplier of $1.50 in sales throughout the economy (EMSI, 2015). However, nascent and mid-size value-added companies often face challenges related to reaching regional economies of scale, complying with safety regulations, navigating the distribution system and creating viable business plans. The Food and Agriculture Initiative will address these challenges by investing in projects that support value-added food companies. Premium beverage processing: The Southern Tier is home to a growing premium beverage industry that includes liquors, spirits, wine and beer. Schuyler County is the fourth-ranked county in the state for the number of wineries (NYS Wine and Grape Foundation). The total number of beverage firms in the region has increased 85% in the past decade, and in 2013 alcohol manufacturing produced more than $4.5 million for the region. The Food Sector Output Source: Business Patterns, 2013Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 113and Agriculture Initiative will support growth in this industry by connecting small and start- up companies with processing/packaging resources that maximize profit in the premium beverage industry, including the construction of regional facilities to enhance capacity. In particular, a centralized location for wine production, warehousing and distribution is needed. Slaughter and meat packing: In 2012, the Southern Tier had almost 3,000 cattle on feed for slaughter, with over 30,000 hogs, 18,500 chickens and 1,000 turkeys sold for slaughter (USDA Census, 2012). The lack of nearby slaughter options, coupled with the small size of most livestock operations in the Southern Tier and reluctance of slaughter/meatpacking facilities to take small orders, creates difficulty for these operations to find local slaughter facilities. The Food and Agriculture Initiative will support projects that increase slaughter and meat packing capacity in the Southern Tier including but not limited to exploring options for mobile slaughter facilities that come to farms rather than moving animals to a centralized processing facility. Dairy processing: The number of dairy cows has leveled off during the past five years at just over 600,000, yet production has increased 10.2% (Harvest New York, 2015). Dairy manufacturing also has one of the highest job multipliers at 5.6, and nearly 500 employees in the Southern Tier. Demand for dairy products has risen by 113% since 2001, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, driven in part by the rise of Greek yogurt (2,500% increase in sales between 2006 and 2011). Aseptic processing and packaging: Aseptic packaging refers to a process of sterilization that allows food products to be shipped and stored in sterile containers (most often paper or plastic). Aseptic packaging is one of the fastest-growing food-processing industries globally, increasing by about 9% annually since 2010 with a projected global market of about $35 billion in 2015 (Freedonia Group). In the United States, aseptic packaging has grown about 8% annually to reach a $5 billion market. The Food and Agriculture initiative will support the development of new aseptic processing facilities, as well as facilitate connections between farmers, aseptic packagers and consumers. The Southern Tier is home to a growing premium beverage industry that includes liquors, spirits, wine and beer. 114 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanGame-changing investments All In Meats is spearheading the construction of a USDA-Certified Slaughterhouse in Chenango County, scheduled for 2016-17. The project cost will include the purchase of property and construction of USDA-certified meat processing packaging and cook-chill food hub facilities that will serve multiple counties in the Southern Tier and the Central Region of New York. The project has a total cost of $20 million, and projects job growth at 65-76 in beef cow operations and about 15 in poultry operations. Private investment will be secured from private equity investors, financial institutions (NBT and Key Bank), as well as funds from the Development Chenango Corporation. The Ultra Premium Beverage Center, to be undertaken by Three Leaf Partners of California and located in the Schuyler County Business Park, will address logistic issues related to the production and export of ultra-premium wines. This facility is modeled after those in California that reduce overhead costs, storage and shipping expenses of independent wineries. Phase 1, to be undertaken in 2016, involves construction of a 20,000-square-foot facility and will employ 20 people. The Binghamton Food and Beverage Business Incubator (BFBBI) was created as a nonprofit partnership of the City of Binghamton, Binghamton Local Development Corp., Broome County, SUNY Broome, Binghamton University, Cornell University/CCE and the Salvation Army. In the next five years, BFBBI will grow capacity to include mixing/packaging, vegetable processing, baking/chip production and beverage/liquid processing and production. It also is working toward the relocation of Healthy Brands, a 12-product line company into a formerly vacant 100,000-square-foot building in Binghamton's downtown. BFBBI will partner with the Salvation Army to provide jobs and workforce development opportunities to Binghamton's most vulnerable residents. Funds from URI will leverage funding from FEMA as well as an investment from the City of Binghamton and the Broome County Industrial Development Agency. The Village of Walton Anaerobic Digester project will use waste from the Kraft Foods plant to produce biogas energy. Ithaca Hummus plans a $7-$10 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility with the capacity to produce hummus for every grocery store on the East Coast by 2018. The company is housed in the Finger Lakes Fresh Foodhub. The new project would increase the company's revenue potential by a factor of 10. The company anticipates employing more than 50 people over five years. Other project examples Premium Beverage Processing and Production Facilities such as the Ithaca Beer Canning Line Expansion, the Hopshire Farm and Brewery Expansion, the Steuben V odka Distillery and a local malt house in Steuben County to support the growing beer industry . The Agriculture Development Center in Broome County will include a Taste of NY Market, Gallery Kitchen, classroom/learning area for workforce training programs, NYS Agriculture and Markets Milk Lab and lease space for NYS Farm Bureau, Northeast Organic Farming Association and the Broome County Farm Bureau. The Virtual Community Kitchen will provide an online portal for the identification and reservation of community kitchen space, primarily benefiting food entrepreneurs. The Commercial Kitchen Expansion, Test Caf\u00e9 proposes an expansion to existing commercial kitchens in Tompkins County that will include a \"Test Caf\u00e9\" for entrepreneurs.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 115The Kirkside Park Community Kitchen in the Town of Roxbury will enable area farms, local bakers and artisanal food producers to prepare and package their goods for resale in a certified kitchen space. Steuben County local food enterprise center and commercial kitchen.A Regional Food Processing and Production Center that will support small to mid-scale value-added food producers and increase regional production of value-added products. The Piggery Slaughter Expansion project and a USDA-certified Slaughterhouse in Steuben County.Continued investment in the Southern Tier Rural Initiative Fund , a successful regional fund established with Round 1 CFA funding in 2012. The fund provides start-up and expansion capital funds to rural and forest-based businesses through low-interest revolving loan funds. Projects include yogurt processing facilities, dairy farms, breweries, hops farms, vineyards, wineries, pork and poultry production and wood products.116 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanStrategy 4: Distribution Facilitating the distribution of product from the field or kitchen to consumers is an essential step to improving the food and agriculture economy in the Southern Tier. The region envisions serving as a key aggregation and distribution center given its proximity to key East Coast markets (notably, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.), not only for the Southern Tier, but also for production that originates across New York State. The Southern Tier's existing expertise in advanced transportation manufacturing positions it well to take advantage of innovation in cost-effective transportation of food products. The Food and Agriculture Initiative will enhance distribution opportunities for farmers and food manufacturers across the state by creating a food hub organization that facilitates cost-effective transportation options, aggregation efforts, branding and connections with agri-tourism. In a 2013 nationwide survey of food hubs and producers, 39% of producers associated with food hubs hired more people, 47% increased acreage and 37% extended their growing season (National Food Hub Survey, 2013). The following are functions of the food hub, designed to improve distribution of product out of New York State while catalyzing production and processing within the Southern Tier and other regions. n T ransportation. Identify and invest in transportation alternatives that leverage the Southern Tier's existing transportation infrastructure and support increased distribution of product in a cost-effective manner, working within food hub market channels. n Wholesale Distribution. In 2012, the wholesale food industry in New York produced $321 million in value-added output and employed 2,756 individuals (Schmit, 2012). New York State food manufacturers, or value-added producers, sell about 23% of their Facilitating the distribution of products from the field or kitchen to consumers is an essential step to improving the region's food and agriculture economy.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 117product to wholesalers/aggregators, compared to 38% of sales directly to customers and 21% to retailers (However, this result is somewhat skewed due to the makeup of survey respondents. Most survey respondents were smaller food processing firms, which are more likely to sell directly to consumers than larger food processing firms). The Food and Agriculture initiative will support both the construction and rehabilitation of wholesale facilities across the Southern Tier, as well as facilitate virtual aggregation/wholesale efforts through the Southern Tier Agriculture and Food Development Cooperative. Wholesale facilities will include refrigerated, dry , and hyperbaric storage options to ensure the quality of product delivered both within and outside New York State. n Market Making. Creating the market for local food products involves cultivating connections with local small to mid-size farms, value-added food and beverage processors and consumers, which includes restaurants, grocery stores, caterers, schools and hospitals. The Southern Tier will leverage digital tools to connect small and mid-size producers with restaurants and consumers. n Branding. In addition to having access to cost-ef fective shipping and sale methods, it is important that Southern Tier food producers cultivate a well-known and reputable brand for food and beverages products grown or manufactured in the region. The development and maintenance of the Food and Agriculture sub-brand will be a component of the regional branding project proposed in the Promoting the Southern Tier Innovative Culture initiative. Game-changing investments The Southern Tier Agriculture and Food Development Cooperative will leverage the network of Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) across all New York State regions and within nearly all counties to create a food hub that will target four key areas: technology implementation and advancement; distribution; market/business development; and workforce development. It will catalyze the creation of a large number of well-paying jobs in technology-driven agriculture fields, support the expansion of current producer operations and increase the likelihood of success of new agriculture-related businesses as well as hasten the velocity of growth of existing businesses. The cooperative will have the following functions: n T echnology Implementation and Advancement. Identify controlled environment sites and developers, attract and execute private investment contracts and coordinate with existing commercialization leadership in the region to deploy , manufacture and export new agriculture technologies. n Distribution. Identify distribution facility (hub) sites and developers, create a network of existing distribution facilities and manage aggregation ef forts on the ground and online. Connect and leverage the Southern Tier brand, working with agri-tourism groups to elevate regional food products. n Market/Business Development. Function as a \"market maker ,\" linking producers with value-added processors and distributors/aggregators, ensuring that producers are linked into sources of demand to \"pull\" production from farms into the supply chain. n W orkforce Development. Cultivate and coordinate comprehensive training programs that support increases in production at all points in the supply chain via the Southern Tier Agriculture Education Fund. 118 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe Cooperative budget will support a central staff housed in CCE, as well as programmatic staff throughout the region and in centers of workforce development programs (CCC, SUNY Delhi, SUNY Broome). The budget also encompasses network management costs associated with aggregation efforts, as well as development costs associated with creating a web-based aggregation/distribution portal. Most food hubs (including two of the most successful, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture in Iowa and the Michigan Center for Regional Food Systems) have operating budgets of approximately $2 million per year. Because the Southern Tier Cooperative takes advantage of already existing infrastructure, the proposed project has no capital expense and a projected annual budget of about $1 million ($5 million over five years), with the total budget matched by employee salaries, space leased/provided by CCE, regional product sold and other services provided by partners. A Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Branding will be developed as a sub-brand of the Promote the Southern Tier Innovative Culture Initiative. Other possible projects The Southern Tier Agri-Mall will bring together local farmers, artists, restaurants and craft brewers in a one-stop facility that promotes Southern Tier-branded products, thereby offering a year-round opportunity for agriculture vendors to increase profits. The rural Ag Mall in Brattleboro, Vermont (population 12,046), went from 18 to 32 vendors in five years, showing that agriculture malls can be successful in rural settings similar to the Southern Tier. The capital expenditure for outfitting or building the Agri-Mall is likely to be about $2 million, with an initial scoping study to be conducted by the Southern Tier Development Cooperative to assess possible locations. Electric-powered Refrigerated Transportation, leveraging renewable energy technology to enhance distribution of crops and value-added products. Southern Tier Food Distribution Center in Broome County, either at the Conklin Industrial Park or in Kirkwood at the Industrial Park. Both of these locations are owned and operated by the Broome County Industrial Development Agency. Southern Tier Food Distribution Center Potential sites at the Broome Corporate Park and Kirkwood Industrial ParkSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 119Private investment The food and agriculture initiative will achieve 5-to-1 private sector investment via: n Private company investment in building facilities for food and agriculture production, processing, packaging, distribution, food manufacturing and regional slaughterhouse/ meatpacking. n Private investment in translational research projects through direct investment and funding via collaborative research projects (i.e., plant science and controlled environment agriculture). n Private company job and wage growth in new processing, production and distribution facilities. n Private company job and wage growth in existing farms and facilities due to increases in production and distribution capacity . n Contributions made by the educational institutions in the region, including Cornell University , Cornell Cooperative Extension, Binghamton University, SUNY Broome and Tompkins Cortland Community College. n Financial institution and bank programs that provide low-interest loans and revolving funds for food and agriculture projects. Examples of these programs include loans made by Tompkins County Area Development to support food entrepreneurs and the Dairy Revolving Fund in Chenango County. n Federal funds to support food/agriculture facilities, workforce development and renewable energy , including USDA investment in the certification of slaughterhouse/ meatpacking facilities, Department of Energy investment in the development of renewable and clean energy resources and Appalachian Regional Commission investment in commercialization and entrepreneurship related to the food bioeconomy . Global economy Technologies developed through the Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University will create and support new agriculture within the Southern Tier as well as in neighboring regions and throughout New York State. They will be key in the Southern Tier's Global NY strategy as foreign investment is attracted in manufacturing and deployment of technology. At the same time, the region's wine industry is attracting foreign investment both in terms of crop development through vineyard reclamation as well as construction of major production facilities. Most significant is the planned Ultra Premium Beverage Center in Schuyler County , which will be undertaken by foreign investors. Another specific example is the aseptic packaging sector of the agriculture industry . As mentioned earlier in this plan, aseptic packaging is one of the fastest-growing food- processing industries globally, increasing by about 9% annually since 2010 with a projected global market of about $35 billion in 2015 (Freedonia Group). The Food and Agriculture Initiative will support the development of aseptic processing facilities, as well as facilitate connections between farmers, aseptic packagers and consumers. The Southern Tier also plans to pursue inter-regional collaborations. In doing so, this upstate New York collective will create a global presence and impact in the industry that no one region could achieve independently.120 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan Cornell University's Teaching Dairy Barn, a state-of-the-art facility, supports the advancement of dairy management in the Southern Tier and beyond. Sustainability The Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University will be the anchor R&D project in the area of new plant development and crop production. It will be sustained using a well-developed and successful model at Cornell University . The center will provide the infrastructure and equipment to advance controlled environment agriculture using existing expertise among Cornell faculty and Cooperative Extension personnel. The investment will allow Cornell scientists to develop the lighting, heating and control systems technology and the plant varieties needed to expand the controlled environment agriculture industry. This innovation and industry growth will allow these scientists to compete more successfully for federal research dollars, and the expanded industry can be tapped to support ongoing research and development work. Patent license revenues will be reinvested into the center. The network of Cornell Cooperative Extension as well as the emphasis on entrepreneurship at Cornell will ensure that developed technologies will be translated into job and economic growth in the region and the state. In addition, the Beef and Cattle Research Program will be an essential part of moving the dairy cluster forward. The initial investment of URI funds to improve pasture infrastructure and support research staff will provide the momentum to continue the investigative work that will support a growing beef industry in the Southern Tier, thus expanding the number of jobs in the field. At Cornell University, dairy unit research efforts are well established; the work there is supported by user fees, grants and/or companies interested in evaluating novel products and management practices. This model will be used to sustain the beef cattle research effort financially beyond the period of the URI funding. Results of the research will be disseminated throughout the region and New York by a well-trained and experienced network of Cornell Cooperative Extension educators working directly with farmers. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 121As a loan fund, the Southern Tier Agriculture Development Fund will have long-term sustainability. The proceeds of the fund will replenish the capital and be available for future loans to ensure continued growth of the Southern Tier's agriculture industry. Inter-regional collaboration In the area of technology development, the Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University will foster partnerships between regional educational institutions that include Cornell University and Binghamton University and manufacturers with strengths in glass and greenhouse materials (Corning Inc.), and will leverage existing private company commitment to CEA through GLASE. As noted above, the Southern Tier is a natural location for a national controlled environment agriculture hub. Technology developed in the Southern Tier will be deployed to other regions in New York and the nation, spurring year-round production and decreasing dependency on a small number of production centers. Steps have already been made toward this goal, and the Food and Agriculture Initiative seeks to build upon these actions. For example, the Greenhouse Lighting and Systems Engineering (GLASE) project led by Cornell University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute seeks to reduce energy costs and the carbon footprint of greenhouses by building upon the investment of local, national and international partners (including NYSERDA, General Electric, Epistar and Price Chopper). The Southern Tier has initiated discussions with the Finger Lakes and Central New York regions regarding an inter-regional collaboration with respect to R&D, education and training, production, processing, marketing and distribution in the overall food and agriculture arena, including the wine and beverage industry. Of particular emphasis will be establishing a partnership with Cornell University, a world leader in agriculture education, research and development, to apply new technologies and methodologies directed toward increasing production and industry efficiencies with regard to growing, harvesting and processing, as well as creating a coordinated and streamlined path for marketing and distribution of ag and food-related products, nationally and internationally. The regions will capitalize on the abundance of land, water and manufacturing locations in upstate New York as well as on a shared distribution network that includes an extensive centralized highway system, rail and deep-water portage. 122 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanRegional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Plan Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Initiative $100M URI Investment Technology Development Led by College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell UniversityEnhanced Support Structures for Existing and New Regional Growers and Producers Increased Access to Regional Processing Facilities Distribution of Raw and Value-added ProductsPlant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at CALS Beef and cattle research programRenewable energy and meat-packing facilities processingPackaging facilities for horticultural cropsPremium beverage production facilitiesValue-added processingAseptic processing and packagingTransportation Wholesale distribution hubsOrganizational structure The Food and Agriculture Initiative will be achieved through the leadership of the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), as well as the development of the Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Cooperative (see signature project description and collaboration with a region-wide branding effort). Note that the Food and Agriculture branding effort will be undertaken as a sub-set of the region-wide Southern Tier Branding and Promotion Program as described in the Promote the Southern Tier Innovative Culture Initiative. Performance measures The success of the Southern Tier Food and Agriculture Initiative will be assessed via key metrics for each strategy area, in addition to job creation, private investment and wealth creation. These metrics are listed below: Note: These metrics are based on sample projects and are subject to changeNumber of new greenhouses Number of new plant science technologies/patentsNumber of new CEA technologies/patentsNumber of technology spin-off companies/jobsNumber of participants in workforce programsPercent of participants in workforce programs who are hard-to-placePercent increase in regional output (crops and livestock)Percent increase in food exported outside regionPercent increase in regional outputPercent increase in food exported outside regionNumber of producers partnering with cooperativePercent increase in wholesale revenue/outputPercent increase in food exported outside regionStrategy area Metric T echnology Production Food and beverage processing DistributionSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 123 Year 1: Examples of Projects Ready to Go Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University: Phase 1 Design DeMet's Candy ExpansionUltra Premium Beverage Center in Schuyler Business Park: Phase 1Vineyard Reclamation and Replacement Program - Year 1USDA Slaughterhouse in Chenango CountyIthaca Beer Company Expansion Hopshire Farm Brewery ExpansionSouthern Tier Agriculture and Food Development Cooperative Southern Tier Agriculture Education Fund Southern Tier Agriculture Development Fund Ag Micro Project in Delaware County (HCR)Groundswell Farmer Incubator Capacity Improvement ProjectVillage of Walton Biogas Project to support Kraft FoodsVillage of Waverly WWTP upgrade to support expansion of Leprino CheeseChicone Cabinet Makers Kirkside Community Kitchen (DOS) 124 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanAppendix Strategy 1: Technology Possible sources of alternative energy for controlled environment agriculture: n LED lighting: LED advancements can increase lighting efficacy by up to 50%, and improve crop yield by at least 15% in conjunction with carbon dioxide optimization. GLASE plans to pioneer LED research and implementation for greenhouses, cutting energy costs and increasing production. n Anaerobic digestion/W aste regenerators: Food product waste makes up 18% of all landfill waste, and has more than 3 times the methane production potential of cattle manure and biosolids (EPA, 2008). Using food waste and agricultural waste in anaerobic digesters would provide energy with reduced costs and, if digesters were sited strategically, heat for CEA facilities. n Earth source heat: Earth source heat takes advantage of existing research in biomass and geothermal energy to extract renewable energy, with the potential to serve 90% of the population in New York and Pennsylvania. The Southern Tier is particularly well suited for earth source heat energy extraction due to the vast amount of untapped natural resources and unique geological formations. Earth source technology is easily adapted to supply heat and energy to greenhouse and food processing facilities. n Biomass energy: Biomass heating in the form of pellets fueling stoves or boilers is a reliable low-cost capital investment, and is becoming available in the Southern T ier. Agricultural or grass pellets need to be used with a boiler design that accommodates the differences in fuel quality and are still considered in the research and development stage in NY State (though in use elsewhere) but their production and use is highly complementary to agricultural and greenhouse waste streams. n Microgrids, smart meters and improved energy distribution systems: Many farms do not have the utility infrastructure to implement solar farms and digesters. Improving grid support and distribution of natural gas will help ensure that farms that deploy renewables can also access year-round supported energy. New smart metering technologies can help farms and processing facilities manage energy loads more efficiently as well as more efficient application of water and fertilizer. n Solar: Integrating solar array technology into new controlled environment structures will defray electricity costs. Corning Inc. is in the process of developing and commercializing this technology. n W ind: Integrating wind turbine technology into new controlled environment structures when the location has a sufficient wind resource can assist with the cost of energy as part of diversified renewable portfolio. Key research and development areas of the Plant Science Innovation and Business Development Center at Cornell University: n Form factor and growing systems: A CEA research and demonstration facility will be constructed at the Center to conduct Near-term research that will lower operating costs and increase yield thereby making CEA facilities more profitable is required. n Lighting: The CEA facility will provide the capacity to optimize the use of LED lighting systems for plants grown in CEA facilities in northern climates. n Control Systems: Small-scale control systems are needed to monitor and regulate lighting, CO2, temperature, nutrients, harvest timing and pest pressure. These should be designed Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 125to incorporate data analytic tools such as optimal control, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to further enhance production of desirable plant characteristics. n Plants: The ability to rapidly transform plants using genomic tools, and to study the small molecules in plants that largely determine the colors, flavors, aromas, antioxidants, vitamins, and many health-promoting properties of food provides a tremendous opportunity for business development. n Nutrients: Improved understanding of plant nutrition will provide a competitive advantage for CEAs in the Southern Tier and this understanding will be developed in the CEA research and extension facility. n Energy: The CEA research and extension facility will have the capacity to evaluate various sources of renewable energy (solar, anaerobic digestion) to reduce costs. n Private partnerships and business development: New businesses will be supported by the network of business incubators in the Southern Tier that collaborate to form the Southern Tier Startup Alliance. In particular: the Southern Tier High Technology Incubator (STHTI) in Binghamton will provide the infrastructure needed for companies focusing on energy , electronics and health with specialized laboratories and other features associated with industry-based R&D, including testing and evaluation and prototyping.; IncubatorW orks in Elmira will offer flexible advanced manufacturing space and support services; the Kevin M. McGovern Family Center for Venture Development in the Life Sciences is dedicated to new life sciences technology startup development and is located on the Cornell campus; the Southern Tier Startup Alliance has proposed a $5 million seed capital fund to provide critically needed \"first money in\" seed capital for regional startups under the guidance of STSA mentors and staff. Strategy 2: Production n Produce and vegetable: In New York State, 23% of the land in use is typically used to grow food. However, much of crop production is in support of the dairy industry with feed items such as corn, oats, and other grains. Corn silage production in New York ranks third in the country with a value of $311 million in 2013. As such, New York State imports much of its produce (fruits, vegetables, and grains) from other states, Canada, and Mexico. As noted above, California has produced over 50% of national demand for crops such as almonds, broccoli, lettuce, carrots, spinach, celery, and peppers. In order for New York to meet demand for food products within the state, it must produce 6% of the national product, or 9% if the NYC metro area is included. To satisfy demand across the Northeast, including the New England states plus Pennsylvania and New Jersey , production would need to increase to 18% of the national product. Currently, New York produces close to 18% in beans and cabbage, and at least 6% in squash, apples, sweet corn, and pumpkin\u2014but nowhere close to the 6% or 18% benchmark for other crops (UBRI Deep Dive). New York has particular strength in fruit production of grapes and apples, with total fruit output valued at $332 million and apples accounting for $233 million of that. Comparatively, market vegetables had a total output of $409 million in 2010. n Beef and cattle: The number of beef cows in New York State is on the rise, reaching nearly 115,000 in 2015 from a recent low of 65,000 in 1991. The Southern Tier had just over 19,000 beef cows in 2012, making up 22% of total New York beef cows. Though dairy cows still outnumber beef cattle 6 to 1 statewide, the number of dairy cows has decreased by 21% over the same time period. This trend is due in part to the finite amount of land appropriate for dairy cows in New York State, but also is influenced by the diminishing ability of traditional beef cow producers elsewhere in the country to supply product due to a lack of available water and competition from grain growers for pasture and hay land. 126 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan According to the USDA Agriculture Census, New York sales of beef cows (including beef cow herd and cattle on feed) came to more than $170 million in 2012, driving direct employment of over 10,000 statewide. Prices for beef have risen in recent years due to stagnant supply of beef cows and a steady demand market, putting pressure on suppliers of feeder calves to produce more. Moreover, global demand for beef is increasing as economies improve and populations consume more meat. Due to 191,177 acres of vacant agriculture land with adequate natural resources, growing demand for beef product, and an upward trajectory in beef cow farming, the beef and cattle industry provides a viable opportunity for the Southern T ier to increase market share. There is specific opportunity in the development of the feeder and stocker industries; stockers are farmers that buy calves from beef cow operators and bring more cattle to feedlots, thus increasing the demand for cow farmers. This in turn increases business flow to meatpackers, feed suppliers, veterinarians, transportation companies, lenders, with the added benefit of supporting the dairy industry via improvements to these resources. Moreover, the stocker occupation is ideal for young people starting out in the agriculture industry, and requires minimal capital investment to start. n Organic: Organic farming is a niche that the Northeast region has embraced; the area has the highest percentage of organic farms nationally. New York State ranks among the top three states by number of organic operations (842 in 2011) and top 10 in acreage of organic crops (158,618 in 2011) (USDA ERS). Organic farming has significantly more associated costs than that of conventional farming; it requires more acreage, more labor , hard to source inputs, and rigorous certification and compliance requirements. In addition, organic animal production and milk production are limited by the amount of organic crops, produce, and pasture available. Farmers can counteract these costs by charging a premium on organic products where local perception of health allows them to do so (Organic Produce, Price Premiums, and Eco-Labeling in U.S. Farmers' Markets). Organic farmers were surveyed regarding the top challenges faced in organic farming, and compliance to organic standards of inputs and certification ranked number one while demand for product did not rank (USDA ERS). Strategy 3: Processing n V alue-added processing: Value-added processing is a $25 million industry in the Southern Tier, with the majority of product shipped out of the region. This does not include cheese manufacturing, which has over $100 million in output (EMSI, 2015). These sectors are growing; 18% between 2009 and 2013. V alue-added food processing also increases sales and jobs in the larger economy . Perishable food manufacturing, snack food manufacturing, and miscellaneous food manufacturing all add about 2 jobs to the economy for every job created, and for every sale dollar, have a multiplier of $1.50 in sales throughout the economy (EMSI, 2015). However , nascent and mid-size value-added companies often face challenges related to reaching regional economies of scale, complying with safety regulations, navigating the distribution system, and creating viable business plans for competing in the growing manufacturing market. The Food and Agriculture Initiative will address these challenges by investing in projects that support value-added food companies. n Premium beverage processing: The Southern Tier is home to a growing premium beverage industry that includes liquors, spirits, wine, and beer . The northernmost county in the region, Schuyler County, is the fourth ranked county in the state for the number of wineries (NYS Wine and Grape Foundation). The total number of beverage firms in the region increased by 17 since 2004, a proportional increase of 85%, and in 2013, alcohol Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 127manufacturing produced over $4.5 million for the region. This momentum is indicative of a larger nation-wide trend toward local wine, spirits, and craft brewing: between 2007 and 2012, consumption increased for spirits (13%), wine (9%) and decreased for beer (-4.3%), though craft beer consumption rose by almost 10% (Beverage Information Group, 2013). The total market size for the alcoholic beverage market is $198 billion in the U.S., and New York accounts for 5% of beer consumption, 8% of wine consumption, and 6% of spirit consumption. The Southern Tier has particular advantages in premium wine production, due to natural resources and low cost of land. Geography in the northern counties of the Southern Tier includes proximity to lakes and sloped land (25-30 degrees); coupled with a cool climate, make these conditions are ideal for growing grapes that traditionally have been grown in Germany and northern France. Growing the already prosperous wine and beer industry in the Southern Tier provides an opportunity for capturing market value as the sector continues to grow nationwide. In addition, growth in these industries catalyzes larger economic growth; every dollar in sales for wineries, breweries, and distilleries returns about 70 cents to the economy , and every new job creates about 3 jobs elsewhere in the economy. The Food and Agriculture Initiative will support growth in this industry by connecting small and start-up companies with processing/packaging resources that maximize profit in the premium beverage industry, including the management and/or construction of facilities to enhance capacity. n Slaughter and meat packing: In 2012, the Southern Tier had almost 3,000 cattle on feed for slaughter, with over 30,000 hogs, 18,500 chickens, and 1,000 turkeys sold for slaughter (USDA Census, 2012). The prevalence of small livestock farms and lack of immediate slaughter options creates difficulty for these operations to find local slaughter facilities. Moreover, just four companies control 80 percent of slaughter in the United States (NPR), and small farm operations can be challenged to find slaughter facilities that will accept business in small numbers (Kelly Young, NY Farm Bureau). This often means that Southern Tier farmers must ship their livestock out of the region for processing, most 100+ miles and as far as Wyalusing and Souderton, Pennsylvania, and often ship back to their local area for sale. n Dairy processing: The number of dairy cows has leveled off over the past five years at just over 600,000, yet production has increased 10.2% (Harvest New York, 2015). Dairy manufacturing also has one of the highest job multipliers at 5.6, and nearly 500 employees in the Southern Tier. Demand for dairy products has risen by 113% since 2001, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, driven in part by the rise of Greek yogurt (2500% increase in sales between 2006 and 2011). n Aseptic processing and packaging: Aseptic packaging refers to a process of sterilization that allows food products to be shipped and stored in sterile containers (most often paper or plastic based). Aseptic packaging is one of the fastest growing food processing industries globally, increasing by about 9% annually since 2010 with a projected global market of about $35 billion in 2015 (Freedonia Group). In the United States, aseptic packaging has grown about 8% annually to reach a $5 billion market. Given the objective of using controlled environment agriculture technologies to extend the growing season and increase regional production as well as the Southern T ier's assets in dairy and premium beverage manufacturing, an aseptic processing facility is a logical step toward becoming an East Coast hub for food and beverage. The Food and Agriculture initiative will support the development of new aseptic processing facilities, as well as facilitate connections between farmers, aseptic packagers and end consumers. 128 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanCitations \"2007 Commodity Flow Survey State Summary: New York.\" Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Strategy 1. Develop and implement a regional branding and promotion program that will serve as a single unifying theme to promote the region' s quality of life and capacity for innovation, and ignite a fierce community pride that compels residents to be regional ambassadors. Use the region-wide branding program as an umbrella for sub-brands focused on Building local pride Promoting the region to alumni of the region' s academic institutions, attracting them back to the region's beauty, affordability and diversity W orkforce recruitment, particularly in advanced manufacturing Promoting key initiatives such as the region' s food and agriculture and advanced manufacturing industries, and authentic communities and tourism destinations 2. Strengthen the region' s tourism and community assets and use them as effective tools to promote the region to visitors, prospective talent and investors 3. Attract young talent via college towns and small towns. This includes strengthening the college town corridor that winds through the region and leveraging the region' s world- class academic institutions, which attract more than 60,000 students each year . 4. Advance commercialization of technology by maximizing innovation and intellectual capital among the private sector and academic institutions. 5. Attract and nurture a critical mass of entrepreneurs by promoting the commercialization of research from the region' s sources of innovation, retaining the brightest college graduates and providing an entrepreneurial ecosystem including incubators, seed capital, support services and attractive communities. 6. Advance New York State initiatives, including Hot Spots, Global, NY, Veterans Initiative, NY Rising, Opportunity Agenda, 76 West, NYSTAR, Cleaner Greener and Brownfield Redevelopment. Outcomes and measurable impact n URI investment: $100,000,000 n Leveraged investment: $500,000,000 n Economic impact: $690,000,000 n Job creation: 1,800Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 131 Game-changing investments n Southern Tier regional branding and promotion program n T ourism Entrepreneurship Incentive Fund n Southern T ier Tourism Institute n T ourism destination, cultural and waterfront development projects n Projects that advance commercialization of technology by maximizing innovation and intellectual capital n Southern Tier Venture Seed Fund n Master/Entrepreneur Main Street and Neighborhood Campus Program n Promotion programs such as Authentic American Experience in Our Downtowns project n Small town and college town community revitalization projects 132 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanACHIEVING THE VISION OF TRANSFORMATION Strategy 1: Branding and tourism marketing to promote the region's culture The Southern Tier's tourism assets range from agri-tourism, wine and beer trails, waterfalls, world-class auto racing and museums, to gliding, fishing and other outdoor recreational activities. Each of these regional assets can be drawn together to build a synergy among destination communities spanning from Steuben County to Delaware County . By knitting these local cultures and experiences into one brand, the Southern Tier will become known as a premier destination for multi-generational families, international visitors and Millennials. Domestic and international travelers are not only amazed by the region' s natural beauty, but are drawn by the diversity of cultural and tourism destinations throughout the region, including: n Corning Museum of Glass, in Steuben County , is the most visited art museum in New York State outside of Manhattan. It is a major driver of the upstate tourism economy with more than 450,000 visits annually. It is among New York State's most popular destinations for international travelers and recently built an international motorcoach entrance to accommodate the increasing number of visitors. n W atkins Glen International Racetrack, in Schuyler County, has 60+ years of road racing traditions. It is home to major NASCAR and SCCA events, as well as one of the nation's premier vintage events, the U.S. Vintage Grand Prix. Recognized as the premier U.S. road racing facility, its events attract several hundreds of thousands of racing fans from around the world each year. n The Roxbury Hotel in Delaware County is becoming a major lodging destination for visitors from NYC and around the world. The hotel was featured in the July 2015 issue of Cathay Pacific's \"Discovery\" in-flight magazine, in a piece titled \"Beyond Hospitality.\" Its lavish and unique rooms have made it a popular destination in the Catskills. Watkins Glen International Racetrack, in Schuyler County, has 60+ years of road racing traditions. It is home to major NASCAR and SCCA events, as well as one of the nation's premier vintage events, the U.S. Vintage Grand Prix. Recognized as the premier U.S. road racing facility, its events attract several hundreds of thousands of racing fans from around the world each year.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 133n T ioga Downs Casino, on I-86 in Tioga County, attracts more than 1.2 million visitors each year with video gambling, live harness racing and a variety of live productions. It also hosts major regional events such as the World Beer Festival and the Summer Concert Series. n The increasing private investment and growing popularity of wineries, breweries and distilleries in Schuyler , Steuben and Tompkins counties continues to be a driving force in the region's tourism industry. The Southern Tier is on its way to becoming a hub and innovative center of a bi-national ultra premium wine, craft beverage and culinary region. n The region' s colleges and universities educate more than 60,000 students annually , and Binghamton University, Cornell University and Ithaca College attract large numbers of prospective students and their families, corporate recruiters, academic visitors and alumni to the Southern Tier each year. A uniform, shared identity will help the Southern Tier generate \"pride of place,\" respect and appreciation for the region. This admiration must evolve, though, from its citizens, who act as ambassadors to visitors and potential young professional and entrepreneurial residents. Through a concerted community effort, we will instill regional pride that compels current residents to be Southern Tier promoters. A recent and highly detailed econometric study into the impacts of tourism-related branding and marketing on cities has revealed significant outcomes. The study, \"Destination Promotion: An Engine for Economic Growth\" was presented at the annual meeting of Destination Cleveland in March 2015. The study was conducted by London-based Oxford Economics, an independent, globally recognized advisory firm that specializes in global forecasting. It analyzed the performance of more than 200 cities during a 23-year period, and it found widespread economic benefits from those actively promoting tourism. This study reflects a correlation between marketing expenditure of destination marketing organizations (DMOs) and long-term economic growth. The Oxford Economics study reinforces the concept that investments in place branding and tourism marketing have impacts far beyond local tourism businesses. Adam Sacks, director of Oxford Economics, noted, \"Statistical analysis over the past two decades shows that destinations with substantial and growing visitor economies have outperformed their peers in the general economy. Cities and States that coordinate destination marketing and economic development are generally better positioned to compete for new investments and corporate relocations.\" Branding success requires a change of attitude within, and between, many organizations. It calls for a collaborative approach and may involve the need to overcome long-held disagreements, silos and turf protection. Managing obstacles, attitudes and processes are major steps toward brand success. Collaboration, networking and integration indicate a strong brand, which is the responsibility of more than the efforts of the tourism or economic development offices alone. Successful place branding includes the people responsible for wayfinding, urban planning, parking, parks, education and business licensing. A collaborative approach toward place branding creates an unprecedented opportunity for an organization to showcase its role as a community and industry leader . The challenge is to sustain this heightened enthusiasm and use it as a catalyst to consolidate the organization' s position as one of the region's most valuable leadership organizations. It's an ideal time to move people beyond internal politics and the outdated opinions.134 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanStrategy 2: Strengthen community and tourism infrastructure Tourism is an expression of the region's culture and brand as well as a key enabler of economic development. It can be an effective tool to promote the Southern Tier's highly desirable quality of life in an effort to attract talent, build a large pool of entrepreneurs, attract investment (particularly foreign direct investment) and build local pride. In an era when technology and innovation are bent toward process management and a reduction of human effort, we have come to realize that among the most valuable resources missing in the Southern Tier are talented professionals and entrepreneurs and private investors. Tourism is an enabler for attracting entrepreneurs and visitors who are captured by an experience and choose to start and locate their careers and businesses within the community. As a result, tourism works in concert with other entrepreneurial enablers \u2014 such as incubators, broadband infrastructure, financing, peer groups and mentors \u2014 to create a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. Numerous reports indicate that young, talented professionals and entrepreneurs consider quality of life among the top priorities in making decisions regarding careers, and tourism is an important tool in introducing them to the region's assets. Continued promotion of the region to visitors, especially Millennials and international markets, could boost the industry's growth and result in reversing the region's brain drain. Entrepreneurs are likely to be influenced by a community's quality of life, which can be exemplified by their tourism experience. Young professionals, in particular, favor locations offering diverse activities \u2014 such as outdoor recreation, arts and cultural attractions \u2014 when deciding where to start their careers. And employees in flexible occupations such as law, finance, insurance, real estate and healthcare are also attracted to destinations because of their amenities, while studies have shown that natural attractions are important to drawing knowledge-based workers. To reach those people on an emotional level, which is where life event decisions (job changes, family moves) are often determined, we must reach potential residents the same way we reach short-term visitors and vacationers: through an effective tourism promotion program based on a strong tourism infrastructure. Attractive communities and well-recognized tourism destinations are important to building local pride. \"In communities across America, attractions such as museums, historic buildings, cultural sites, sports teams, outdoor recreational opportunities, festivals, concerts and other events instill pride among local residents and create a better quality of life. These attractions are important community assets, which not only draw visitors to a region, but also appeal to businesses deciding where to locate a new plant or facility.\" Tourism has been a growth industry in the Southern Tier in recent years, fostered by unique natural assets, top-performing cultural attractions and the burgeoning wine industry . The region's location \u2014 a four-hour drive from residents of two of North America's most important metroplexes, Boston-Washington and Toronto-Montreal \u2014 offers opportunities for further growth. Visitor spending in the Southern Tier grew 18% between 2009 and 2011, outpacing upstate trends. Visitor spending on lodging, food services, transportation, recreation and retail reached $0.87 billion in 2011, representing an 18% rise from where it was two years earlier. Tourism is an expression of the region's culture and brand as well as a key enabler of economic development. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 135While tourism accounts for a comparatively low share of all jobs in the region, employment growth in tourism has outpaced upstate trends, supported by county-level spending on culture and recreation that is on par with the upstate average. Tourism has been a business- and job-creating industry for the region, adding 87 establishments and 700 new jobs (8,700 in 2009 to 9,400 in 2013); however, it represents only 4.4% of all jobs and the average annual wage is only $21,000 as compared to $42,235 among all employment sectors in the region. Between 2009 and 2013, regional jobs in tourism grew 8%, exceeding upstate growth, yet lagged behind the statewide increase of 11%. In New York State, visitor spending on lodging, food services, transportation, recreation and retail reached $87 million in 2011, representing an 18% rise from the previous two years. This is more than the 12% increase reported across upstate New York. While the Southern Tier outperformed all other upstate regions in growing visitor spending during this period, total visitor spending in the region represents a relatively small 6% of total visitor spending across upstate and an even smaller 2% of the statewide total. Visitor spending in the Southern Tier represents net new dollars to the regional economy, supporting and growing jobs, firms and the local tax base, while adding to residents' quality of life. Trends among travelers also are changing. The Travel Industry Association (TIA), in partnership with Gourmet and the International Culinary Tourism Association, conducted a study of leisure travelers in the United States. The study found that a growing number of American leisure travelers engage in learning, interactive and culinary activities while traveling. Culinary travelers are younger, more affluent and better educated than non-culinary travelers and are motivated by a desire for unique experiences. This reinforces tourism and place-making research findings that emphasize unique assets and experiential opportunities as key components of successful community tourism development.

Tourism employment reflects private-sector employment only.Tourism employment, growth and county-level spending benchmarked SOUTHERN TIER UPST ATE NY NYS T ourism As % Total Employment, Employment Growth,2009-13 & Recreation Expenditures $25.94 $26.31 N/A Per Capita, 2013 136 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanStrategy 3: Advance commercialization of technology by maximizing innovation and intellectual capital The Southern Tier has a rich history and passion for innovation and technology, and our region's academic institutions and corporations are havens of knowledge. Our primary source of innovation for the future will be bold ideas that are implemented in the marketplace as a new product or in an organization as a new process or system. There is great potential to advance the commercialization of technology by maximizing the innovation and intellectual capital of our private-sector and academic research institutions. The research, testing and product development resources of private companies such as Corning Incorporated, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Raymond Corporation and Amphenol, together with Cornell University and Binghamton University, collectively represent a powerful engine that can accelerate the region's innovation economy. Given the strength of these innovation leaders in the Southern Tier, the possibilities for new business growth are vast and exciting. A leading example of private-sector R&D is Corning Incorporated, which annually invests $850-900 million in technology development. There are several exciting opportunities for commercialization of the company's research that will transform the world. Other firms in the region, such as Lockheed Martin, continue to be engaged with cutting-edge technology ranging from avionics for military aircraft to mission computers and from electronic warfare systems to advanced electronic manufacturing and cybersecurity . BAE Systems is engaged in R&D in engine controls, in-flight entertainment systems for commercial aircraft and hybrid electric powertrains for buses and trucks. Raymond Corporation is investing in R&D for the commercialization of material handling and automated warehousing systems. Amphenol is undertaking R&D for commercialization of signals, communications and power distribution connectors for the transportation and military systems industries. Cornell University and Binghamton University are premier research institutions in the Southern Tier, and also are key players in the potential for transfer of innovation and commercialization of technology ranging from their role in implementing Start-Up NY to cutting-edge technology of the future. There is an opportunity for the Southern Tier to reach beyond the bounds of the Start-Up NY program and continue to engage in public-private partnerships that have the opportunity to garner national and even global attention for the Southern Tier. For example, Cornell University is uniquely positioned in the Eastern United States to provide technology to existing and new high-tech manufacturing companies in the advanced synchrotron technology industry cluster. The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) is a world leader in synchrotron technology development. CHESS, a federally funded National User Facility, is one of only two such facilities in the United States and just five in the world. Cornell plans to create a public/private partnership by which CHESS would The region will increase entrepreneurship in part by nurturing a vibrant startup ecosystem. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 137transfer these technologies and provide development support to additional Southern Tier companies that could sell the products and services to global customers. Transfer of this technology provides opportunity for new business development employing professionals with high-tech wages. At Binghamton University, the Center for Energy-Smart Electronic Systems, a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC), works in partnership with government, industry and academia to develop systematic methodologies for efficiently operating electronic systems, including data centers, by controlling resources and managing workloads to achieve optimal energy consumption. The center works with 25 industry members, including Facebook, Intel, Bloomberg and IBM, to transfer technologies created on the campus and at its three university partner campuses. Strategy 4: Develop a critical mass of entrepreneurs Young professionals and entrepreneurs play a critical role in driving the future of economic development within their communities. Regardless of the business sector , the power of a thriving pool of entrepreneurs is profound. While technology-related entrepreneurs tend to gain the most publicity, the entrepreneurs operating within industries such as tourism and agriculture also have a larger capacity to significantly catalyze the local economy . A 2011 Kauffman Foundation study (Where Will the Jobs Come From?, Stangler, 2011) showed that from 1980-2005, nearly all net job creation in the United States occurred in firms less than five years old. The data also showed that without startups, net job creation for the American economy would have been negative in all but a handful of years. If one excludes startups, an analysis of the 2007 Census showed that young firms (defined as one to five years old) still accounted for roughly two-thirds of job creation, averaging nearly four new jobs per firm per year. Of the overall 12 million new jobs added in 2007, young firms were responsible for the creation of nearly 8 million of those jobs. The Southern Tier region has outstanding sources of innovation and industry. Entrepreneurship has the capacity to contribute to the reshaping of the Southern Tier's economy, with the potential to generate jobs, introduce new products and services and promote greater upstream and downstream value-chain activities. Therefore, it is of particular importance to nurture entrepreneurship and build a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem. We also know that the Southern Tier must invest in key success factors in order to create a critical mass of entrepreneurs. n Attractive communities n Retaining college and university graduates n V ibrant start-up ecosystem and entrepreneurial community Seed capital Attracting talent and building the entrepreneurial pool Academic and private R&D A vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem creates a virtuous cycle of startup formation Increasing entrepreneurship in the region requires first and foremost nurturing and supporting a vibrant startup ecosystem and entrepreneurial community. A 2014 Kauffman Foundation study identified the strength of the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a critical factor in startup formation and success, and specifically identified links between business incubators and connections between entrepreneurs as critical success factors (Examining the Connections within the Startup Ecosystem: A Case Study of St. Louis, Motoyama & Watkins, 2014). 138 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe Southern Tier Startup Alliance, the region's NYSTAR-designated Innovation Hot Spot, serves as a connecting bridge among its five member business incubators in the region and as a mechanism for interaction and cross-pollination of ideas and best practices among entrepreneurs. There is an opportunity to build on the Southern Tier Startup Alliance, a collaboration of Binghamton University, Cornell University, Corning Incorporated and the Ceramics Corridor Innovation Center, to combine the region's strengths with cutting-edge business incubation, acceleration and entrepreneurship. There is an opportunity to build synergies between this initiative and the Greater Binghamton Innovation Ecosystem with the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator being built in downtown Binghamton, the pilot \"Southern Tier Hardware Accelerator\" program at Rev: Ithaca Startup Works and Incubator Works as an anchor in the I-86 Corridor Innovation Project. In addition, SUNY Broome was recently awarded SUNY 2020 funds to nurture a vibrant start-up community for student-led ventures by expanding on the Entrepreneurial Assistance Program (EAP) and the Certificate in Entrepreneurship. Renovations at the former New York State Inebriate Asylum, also known as \"the Castle,\" could provide another exciting maker space in Binghamton, one where art, design, technology and entrepreneurship come together in new ways. Despite these resources, the Southern Tier's need for increased support continues to be acute. A 2011 study funded by the Economic Development Administration concluded that the Southern Tier \"has a modest amount of high potential startup deal flow, and an opportunity to increase this number dramatically.\" That study noted a lack of \"access to support resources sufficient to capture the potential of current or anticipated deal flow from research and technology commercialization activities.\" The critical gap is in the oft-cited \"Valley of Death\" \u2014 the period nascent companies experience in the incubation phase before market entry. The study states that private investors \"typically invest in companies in the late Demonstrating or Market Entry phases of commercialization to avoid significant technology and product market risk.\" The lack of investment capital at earlier stages of company formation dramatically limits the number of companies in the Incubation phase that can graduate and take of f. \"First money in\" seed capital, deployed through the existing support network of the Southern Tier Startup Alliance, will increase the pace of high-growth startups taking of f in the region and will create a virtuous cycle, attracting new entrepreneurs to join in and broaden and strengthen the community. Seed capital is the engine of startup growth According to a 2011 study conducted by the National Venture Capital Association, investment in venture-backed companies reaches between 0.1% and 0.2% of U.S. gross domestic product each year. However, these companies employed 11% of the total U.S. private-sector workforce and had revenue equal to 21% of the total U.S. GDP. The disparity between venture capital spent and the impact of venture-backed companies illustrates the multiplier effect of venture and angel funds on the U.S. economy. Trends in R&D expenditures, STEM degrees and patents, 2000-13 Source: National Center for Education Statistics; U.S. Patent Office; U.S. Census Bureau, UB Regional InstituteSouthern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 139Venture-backed companies typically fuel innovative industries such as the Internet, biotechnology and clean technology (NVCA, 2011). These companies often were founded on principles of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, and coupled with high-growth potential; these qualities ensure positive trajectories even after the life of venture capitalists involvement. From 2005 to 2015, New York State received 7% of all private venture capital and angel funding in the United States (CBInsights), behind California with 54% and Massachusetts with 10%, but ahead of Texas with 4%. Within New York, 98% of all investment dollars were concentrated in New York City, while the Southern Tier received less than half a percent (CBInsights), or just $472 per capita compared to New York City's $8,410 for the same period. The benefits of venture-backed companies highlight the economic differences in these figures; New York City receives more than 17 times the venture capital than the Southern Tier, also receiving the employment, innovation and wealth benefits associated with venture funding. However, the Southern Tier is home to a far greater proportion of invention-driven startups. The Small Business Innovation Research program is the federal government' s flagship funding program to support high-tech, high-growth companies. Through its SBIR and STTR programs, federal agencies award grant funding through rigorous peer-reviewed competition to companies around the nation. From 2008-2013, the Southern Tier received $77 million in competitive federally funded SBIR and STTR awards, compared to New York City's $113 million. The critical gap is the lack of private investors willing to make the \"first money in\" equity investment in high-growth startups. The Southern Tier has seen successful venture-backed companies and exits, such as Kionix and Binoptics, each of which were SBIR-funded and went on to sell for more than $200 million. These represented the creation of hundreds of high-quality jobs still residing in the Southern Tier. We could have more companies like this if more companies were able to make the transition from federal grant funding to venture capital. For this reason, we propose a $5 million Southern Tier Seed Capital fund, to be administered by the Southern Tier Startup Alliance, leveraging New York State's operating support through the Innovation Hot Spots program and the region' s five business incubators. Building the entrepreneurial pool Young professionals and entrepreneurs play a critical role in driving economic development within their communities. Regardless of the business sector, the power of a thriving pool of entrepreneurs is profound. While technology-related entrepreneurs tend to gain the most publicity, the entrepreneurs operating within the tourism and agriculture industries have a larger capacity to significantly catalyze the local economy. Cultivating this segment of the region's population will become even more urgent in the near future as the region's population and workforce continue to age. Since 2000, the Southern Tier's population has declined slightly (< -1%). The age gap between young adults and retiring workers is substantial. According to the Southern Tier Labor Market Information (LMI) update prepared in May 2015, the number of prime working-age individuals (ages 25-54) in the Southern Tier decreased by 30,030, or 11.2%, between 2000 and 2013. In contrast, the number of individuals ages 55 or older increased by 40,438, or 25.4% over the same period. As the current workforce is nearing retirement, an investment in our native Millennials will be necessary to ensure they possess the skill sets to meet the job requirements of the region' s key innovative industries. Additionally, a strategy that can recruit back to the Southern Tier some of the native sons and daughters who are using their talent elsewhere would pay huge dividends. 140 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe need to nurture entrepreneurship is particularly important, and the Southern Tier has the innovation assets upon which a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem can be built. Over $1.5 billion is collectively spent on research by such leading institutions as Cornell University and Binghamton University, the Ceramics Corridor Innovation Center and Corning Incorporated. More than 4,100 faculty at regional colleges and universities educate more than 51,000 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate students annually, and according to the 2010 Census, more than 76,000 of the region's 658,000 residents hold a bachelor's degree. In addition, the Southern Tier has a disproportionately higher number of college and graduate students in relationship to the base population. We should do everything in our power to retain these individuals in the region. The National Business Incubator Association's statistics show that 87% of incubator graduates in their study remain in business, compared to the 50 - 60% failure rate nationally for startups in their first five years. Of significance is that 84% of incubator graduates stay in the community where they were incubated, and every $1 in incubator investment produces $30 of lifetime tax revenue. Innovation alone cannot advance the region's economy. As Jim Clifton, chairman and CEO of Gallup, notes, \"an innovation is worthless until an entrepreneur creates a business model for it and turns that innovative idea in something customers will buy .\" Strategy 5: Attractive communities are necessary to attract and retain talent Southern Tier colleges and universities are magnets for attracting among the best academic talent in the United States and globally. They also serve as gateways to exposing more than 50,000 domestic and foreign students and their families to the region on an ongoing basis. The history of upstate New York - and the Southern Tier in particular - is one of successful young people using their upward mobility to leave the region rather than growing their talents and their economic impact locally. By definition, leaders of future ventures and their key staff are people who have skills that are in demand and transferable. As long as the narrative of the region is one of malaise and economic weakness, with hollow downtowns and empty storefronts, the region cannot expect its best and brightest and the large number of students that come here for an excellent education to put down roots. The college towns of the Southern Tier \u2014 Greater Binghamton, Elmira-Corning and Ithaca \u2014 represent key attraction points to talented potential future residents and their families. Binghamton and Ithaca have received recognition on \"best college towns\" lists recently . Elmira was selected as the new home for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which is to open in 2016. Ensuring that these towns, the corridors to and between them \u2014 and the college town neighborhoods in them \u2014 are lively, vibrant and attractive places will help provide an alternative narrative to that of upstate malaise and instead have students, their families and friends bringing home the story of a growing, exciting place to learn and live. Focus on retaining college and university graduates The region's colleges and universities attract and graduate more 17,500 students each year. Retaining these young, talented people and aligning them with local employers will be a key to future economic prosperity in the region. The Southern Tier's share of engineering graduates is higher than any other upstate region \u2014 a comparative strength for the area. These graduates can support industries with a high Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 141potential for STEM employment, such as those in advanced manufacturing; especially in target industry sectors such as battery storage and the region's advanced transportation products, components and control systems, which more than doubled in jobs from 2009 to 2013. However, as employment in STEM-intensive industries declined by 10% overall from 2009 to 2013, it will be important to focus on the Advanced Manufacturing Initiative to create the jobs needed to retain these STEM graduates in the region. Game-changing investments Branding and tourism promotionThe Southern Tier will need a single unifying theme to pull the region together. The project will begin with engaging a consulting firm to undertake development of a regional brand with a focus on target markets including local residents, tourists, international travelers, young professionals and entrepreneurs. Key elements should include development of multiple itineraries, encouraging diversity, foreign languages, training, wayfinding and interpretative signage, and unique experiences and assets that set the Southern Tier apart. Transparency, genuineness and community buy-in are critical to the success of a regional brand. It will be important for the Southern Tier to engage a world leader such as Oxford Economics, Longwoods International or Resonance Consultancy, just to name a few examples of place-branding specialists, to explore the impacts that branding and tourism marketing have on the economic diversity and growth of their cities. The Southern Tier \u2014 very early on in the process \u2014 must ensure that there is continuity in understanding, knowledge, energy and support with regard to the determined brand strategy. This means that community branding for the Southern Tier must be established following a highly consultative and transparent process. The brand does not belong to any one person or organization; it must be adopted and owned by the entire Southern Tier. The college towns of the Southern Tier \u2014 Greater Binghamton, Elmira-Corning, Ithaca and Delhi \u2014 represent key attraction points to talented potential future residents and their families.142 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanThe cost for engaging a consultative regional branding firm would range from $250,000- $350,000, depending on how detailed we want the branding recommendations to be. A good firm will also be managing the stakeholders with research, meetings and more; this is not just a consumer survey. The selected firm will provide consultative services; execution would include significant additional costs depending upon which recommendations will be acted upon. Strengthen tourism infrastructure Signature projects: n T ourism Entrepreneur Incentivize Fund (grants and low-interest loan fund) for entrepreneurs investing in tourism venues, including Main Street destinations and assets to increase the length of stay n Southern Tier Tourism Institute to provide specialized training programs (for hospitality workers, business and civic leaders and the community) and offer an \"International Ready\" Certificate n W aterfront development projects on Cayuga, Keuka and Seneca Lakes n Lodging and international tourism destinations such as The Roxbury at Stratton Falls Other sample projects: n SUNY Broome Center for English as a Second Language (ESL) will further stimulate recruitment into other colleges and the region. n LUMA Projection-Computer Mapping Inc. is a successful entrepreneurial start-up founded by Binghamton University alumni who have developed a state-of-the-art computer mapping and entertainment business. With additional resources to invest in LUMA, a projection arts festival, made its debut in September 2015 with seven striking computer animations on five major Binghamton buildings and an audience of several thousand. Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 143production equipment, the company has the potential to deliver its acclaimed LUMA Projection Fest across the state and county, an ideal way to promote the Southern Tier's innovative culture. n Community infrastructure projects to enhance the infrastructure of both our college communities and local Main Streets that connect the region and provide an authentic Americana and Southern Tier experience. n Upgrade tourism destinations such as performing arts, wineries, breweries and distilleries; agri-tourism; museums; sports facilities; hiking/biking trails; scenic byway initiatives and major waterfront development projects n Improve physical infrastructure necessary to build new high-value add tourism products (attractions, culture, sites, information centers, etc.) De velop a critical mass of entrepreneurs Signature projects: n T alent Attraction and Retention Campaign modeled after the Global Entrepreneur in Residence Program at UMass that sponsors entrepreneurs for H1-B visas n Southern Tier Seed Venture Fund n Master /Entrepreneur Main Street and Neighborhood Campus Program in partnership with colleges and universities. Link vacant storefronts with college alums for retail development. n Extension of \"Big Gig\" gigabit to residential areas to enhance marketability of region Other sample projects: n Develop and promote entrepreneurial communities that catalyze connections between entrepreneurs Promote the innovation atmospheres of the college town environments to be vibrant and attractive to talent and supportive of an entrepreneurial attitude. Enhance innovation infrastructure. Examples: makerspaces and passion centers with space for inventors and community centers affiliated with the network of Southern Tier Startup Alliance incubator sites n SUNY Broome's \"Entrepreneur-in-Residence\" program at the \"SUNY BEE\" student incubator in the Southern Tier High-Technology Incubator 144 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative PlanAttractive and vibrant communities Sample projects: n Community revitalization projects in college towns such as the Elmira Refresh downtown revitalization initiative with projects such as the W erdenberg Building Downtown Anchor Project and the Housing Visions Elmira South End Neighborhood Revitalization project. Also included is the Collegetown Redevelopment Project. Other sample projects: n Chain W orks in Ithaca; a redevelopment and rehabilitation of 800,000 square feet of the former Emerson facility in a residential community and manufacturing complex. Sustainability The Southern Tier Seed Capital Fund will be evergreen, so proceeds to the fund from successful companies will replenish the capital and be available for future investments. The fund's fee structure is lean for a fund its size because it leverages the existing business incubation infrastructure in the region, specifically the Southern Tier Startup Alliance and its five member business incubators. Residence in the region will be a requirement for investment by the Southern Tier Seed Capital Fund, and companies that receive seed investment but leave the region will trigger a repayment provision, ensuring that the Southern Tier Seed Capital Fund's capital is used to grow companies in the Southern Tier. The other funds, including the Tourism Entrepreneur Incentivize Fund, also will be self- sustaining with the repayment of loans being used to replenish the capital base of the funds. The Southern Tier Tourism Institute will use URI funding for stand up and initial operations; however, its ongoing operations will be sustained through membership and training fees. Inter-regional collaboration Through the Southern Tier Branding and Promotion projects, we will strengthen collaborations with the Finger Lakes and Central NY regions through joint tourism marketing programs such the various wine trails on Cayuga, Seneca and Keuka Lakes; the Wine Water and Wonder international marketing program; Finger Lakes Wine Country Marketing Association; and the Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance. Collaborations with the Mohawk Valley region also will take place as the Southern Tier continues to work with organizations such as the Catskills Interpretive Center to promote tourism destinations throughout the Catskills. Another example of inter-regional collaboration is in the premium beverage industry as it relates to tourism. The Southern Tier will collaborate with the Finger Lakes and Western NY regions to develop a bi-national ultra-premium wine, craft beverage and culinary region, with the potential to develop the concept of including Canada's Niagara wine region and eventually developing into an international destination.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 145Organizational structure Regional Economic Development Council of the Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Plan Promote the Southern Tier's Innovative Culture $100M URI Investment Strengthen Community and Tourism Assets Advance Commercialization of Technology by Maximizing Innovation and Intellectual CapitalAttract Young Talent via College Towns and Small Towns with the \"Authentic Americana\" CultureRegional Branding and Promotion Program Attract and Nurture Mass of EntrepreneursSouthern Tier Tourism Institute Tourism Entrepreneurship Incentive FundNew and enhanced tourism destination infrastructureWaterfront development projectsSouthern Tier Community Revitalization Fund Private sector and university projects resulting in commercialization of technologyRevitalization of college and small townsFormation of Southern Tier Promotion Alliance Administrative support for overall implementation of URI plan Southern Tier Venture Seed Fund Talent Attraction and Retention CampaignCommunity revitalization projects advancing a live, work, play atmosphere Performance measures Activities undertaken under this initiative will be measured using the following metrics: n Jobs created n Leveraged investment n Expanded tourism industry: new and expanded tourism venues and destinations, employment, visitations and visitor expenditures n Increased number of workers trained in hospitality and related tourism fields n Number of new entrepreneurial ventures n Amount of seed venture funds available n Number of Start-Up NY companies established n Increase in the \"return rate\" and \"stay rate\" of graduates of the region' s higher education institutions n Increase in exports and investment by foreign-owned companies146 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan Year 1: Examples of Projects Ready to Go Southern Tier Branding Program Collegetown Redevelopment Project in Ithaca (Firehouse Capital Project)Finger Lakes Boating MuseumCPSI Biotech Advanced Cell ProcessingSouthern Tier Community Revitalization Program (continued investment)Norwich Best Western Hotel ProjectThe Seed FundRemoval of Watkins Glen WWTP from Seneca Lake waterfront (DEC) eatBING Alliance Authentic American Experience in Our Downtowns Administrative Costs for Plan Implementation: Year 1 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 147Endnotes \"Top Site Selection Factors: Quality of Life Still Matters,\" Area Development Online, November 2011. http://www.areadevelopment.com/siteSelection/November2011/quality-of-life-site-selection-factor- 0011153.shtml \"The Economic Importance of Air Travel in High-Amenity Rural Areas,\" Journal of Rural Studies Vol 25, 2009.

Connectivity Establishing stron g synergies among individuals, target industries, academia, the nonprofit sector and government will be an important part of the formula needed to create the ideal conditions for economic growth in the Southern Tier. Our URI plan is centered on developing connections within and across different industry clusters and geographic areas of the entire region. It also is closely linked to the industry cluster plan adopted by the Southern Tier REDC on September 1, 2015; that is, the Transportation Products, Components and System Controls Manufacturing Industry Plan. In addition to this industry cluster , our plan builds on two additional clusters and builds critical mass in Food & Agriculture and Tourism. 202 Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan Sections Pages The Southern T ier's commitment to sustainability of the transformation brought about by this plan is described throughout the plan.

Workforce development Specific strategies and projects are identified in each initiative to fill vacant or newly created positions, attract talent and enhance the qualifications of our workforce. Hard-to-place workers A key element of workforce development is our plan's approach to hard-to-place workers, with a particular focus on veterans and low-income residents of the distressed communities of Binghamton, Johnson City, Endicott, Elmira, Corning, Norwich and Hornell. Community reinvestment Community rebuilding efforts are necessary in the Southern Tier, particularly in the highly distressed communities of Binghamton, Johnson City, Endicott and Elmira. In addition, community rebuilding is critically important to the manufacturing sector , college and university communities in their ability to attract and retain the best talent and success of tourism destinations, particularly those attracting international visitors.Southern Tier Upstate Revitalization Initiative Plan 203 Sections Pages Section I.
