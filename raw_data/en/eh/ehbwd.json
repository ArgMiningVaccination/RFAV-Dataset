Looking for inspiration? Check out how [Elika Tasker](https://elika.co/), a nutrition and energy coach, gets it done like a boss. How I get it done: Elika Tasker What is your backstory and why did you decide to launch your business? I'm a passionate foodie who discovered I could turn this love into a pursuit of food as medicine. This was important to me as I built my corporate career, then entered the relentless Food & Beverage industry. I was tested in many ways to see if I could create a healthy lifestyle and still enjoy my passions. I believe that true health is physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being and that if we live and behave as close to our ancestral patterns as possible, we can optimise our health. I use this wisdom and experience as a trusted advisor to successful business leaders and entrepreneurs who have neglected their health and I build communities with meaningful connections. How I get it done: Lightning round On a typical morning: I ensure my body gets a good cleanse by drinking one litre of warm water with lemon before meditation and movement. It's important to me to get into nature and get the sunlight in my eyes as early as I can to trigger my circadian rhythm, our biological cycle that communicates to my hormones and affects my energy levels throughout the day. On dealing with self-doubt and criticism: I have one to two people I know I can trust to objectively share with me their thoughts on a challenge I'm struggling to overcome. I also run a women's mastermind which is a powerful way of getting shared ideas. I always work with a coach to ensure I'm challenging my beliefs systems and getting timely course corrections. These qualities have allowed me to have more empowering belief systems. So if I'm criticised I don't see this as a reflection of something I'm doing wrong, and self-doubt I often find is closely followed by fears which I see as a signal for growth. On keeping stress levels low: Meditation, nature, sunshine and play! Meditation has definitely been the most powerful tool in my kit to manage stress. It has given me the pause in challenging moments to reset, it's given me the ability to be present to see what's really happening and not a story I'm attaching. Nature and sunshine are the restorations to my battery - even 30 minutes in nature restores me. Play, usually in the form of dance or catchups with friends gives me the vital hormone boost of serotonin which is great for reducing the damage of stress on my physical and mental wellbeing. On staying motivated and energised: I'm an Energy Coach and find myself the most energetic and motivated in more rooms. One tool that I use is what I practice in my clients' first couple of coaching sessions: I run an energy audit. I want to be clear at all times where I'm leaking energy unnecessarily in my life. By having my own coach I get to have small insights that change everything about my perception of life's challenges and therefore stay motivated. On the advice you'd give your younger self: Look for the things that make you different and do more of this, it's your gift to the world! Some people will love it, others won't, but you will be at peace. On winding down in the evening: I keep as close as I can to electronics off and shift to relaxing activities after 7pm. I found myself recently falling into a Netflix binge and it was a reminder of the impact of watching TV at night has on my energy levels and quality of sleep.
