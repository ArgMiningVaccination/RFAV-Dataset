They have enhanced and shaped our national character with centuries -old traditions that reflect the multiethnic and multi- cultural customs of their community. National Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 to October 15) we recognize the contributions made and the important presence of Hispanic and Latino Americans to the United States and celebrate their heritage and culture. National Hispanic Heritage Month , whose roots go back to 1968, begins each year on September 15, the anniversary of independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatema- la, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize also celebrate their independence days during this period and Columbus Day (D\u00eda de la Raza) is October 12. The term Hispanic or Latino, refers to Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. On the 2010 Census form, people of Spanish, Hispanic and/or Latino origin could identify themselves as Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or \"another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\" Learn More at: http://www.hispanicheritagemonth.gov/about/ PAGE 2 DIVERSITY MATTERS Celebrating with UTHSC Employees !

Different cultures and religions impact individual views of vaccination, and it might be of interest to explore some of these. Roman Catholics, for example, have no objections to vaccines as long as no fetal tissues have been used in their production. Initial- ly they were, but this is no longer the case. The vast majority of churches arising from or following the Protestant movement (list not exhaustive) have no objection to vaccination: Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Church of the Nazarene, and Church of God in Christ. Restoration churches i nclud- ing the Church of Christ and the Disciples of Christ also accept vaccines. The Latter Day Saints (Mormons) strongly support v accines and child health and the majority of the German -Dutch descended Amish/Mennonites do not prohibit vaccines if they are presented well, i.e., for the \"good of the community\". Jehovah's Witnesses have no objection to vaccines, although they do object to blood transfusions/products based on biblical scripture that proscribes \"consumption\" of such. Christian Science groups are variable from group to group. Some st rongly oppose vaccination, cancer chemotherapy, and many types of medical intervention because they rely upon healing via prayer. T he Dutch Reformed Church has refused vaccines since smallpox in the 1800's and continues to do so. In 2013, 1226 members con- tracted measles (rubeola) and 14.4% of these suffered serious complications. The Congregation of Universal Wisdom, which was founded by a chiropractor classifies injections or ingestion of medication as \"sacrilege\" because this, in their estimation, defies \"natural law\". A donation of $75 per family is \"customary\" and membership has been used to avoid vaccination due to \"religious belief\". The Middle East: Judaism and Islam Among the highly insular Ultra -Orthodox Jewish, many are very op- posed to vaccines. The Orthodox Jewish, however, consider it a religious obli- gation, and Jews in general emphasize community over the individual. More liberal Jews see no conflict with vaccination and agree with Muslims on the pork gelatin issue (see below). A number of traditional imams and Islamic religious leaders have been clear in stating that vaccination is in line with the principles of Islam. It is entirely permissible for observant Muslims to obtain vaccines containing pork gelatin because after its extreme processing , it bears little resemblance at all to the original product. It is true, however, that many anti -Western Islamists do not trust Western vaccines and believe that they are designed to render their recipients sterile or have other nefarious purposes. The Taliban is deathly opposed to vaccines for obvious poli tical and possibly other reasons. Religions of the East Although Hinduism does not take a formal position on the practice of vaccination, large countries such as India where the population is as much as 80.5% Hindu have proactively made efforts to attempt to wipe out infectious diseases such as polio through the use of vaccines. Sikhs have apparently made no official statement about the use of vaccines, but have voiced no ob- jection to their use, much as in Jainism, where their use is not prohibited, either. Buddhists, on the other hand, led by the Dalai Lama, have launched drives to boost the numbers of children immunized each year against the crippling polio virus. A study completed in May showed without any trace of a doubt that there was abs olutely no relationship whatsoever between autism, which affects a child's ability to communicate and relate to other people, and vac cines. In conclusion, fear is the enemy that health providers must battle for the welfare of children against measles, mumps and rubella. Many parents apparently have no concept of science, and that is where the struggle for health must be joined. Ratio nal persuasion often does not gain any ground with these individuals. Most have never seen the results of these viral infections and have lost all cultural memory of them. Regardless of their religious persuasion, photographs, in this writer's experience ha ve prov- en most effective. One picture does indeed speak a thousand words, and it does so in a manner that all parents can understan d, regardless of language, culture or religion. Whatever it takes, healthcare providers must get the message out that vaccines are beneficial for all a Professor in the Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences where she teaches Virology, Parasitology, Human Genetics and Research CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF VACCINATION Linda L.

Healthy conflict is constru ctive and a sign of high levels of trust; when individuals are encouraged to bring forth concerns in a respectful manner, innovation an d diver- sity of thought occur. Unhealthy conflict is personal and emotional; it is often marked by name calling, personal attacks, cl iques, and gossip. Reasonability, consideration, and respect are the foundations of civility, and practicing civility can determine whether a conflict becomes healthy or unhealthy. Civility enables one to approach conflicts rationally by focusing on the issues rather than on the people. P.M. Forni, the ci vility expert, promotes listening and refusing to shift responsibility as two rules of considerate behavior, and in like manner, UC Berkeley delineates earnest apologies as one of its rules for workplace civility. According to UC Berkeley, giving earnest apologies c an be achieved by: Stating the specific offense you are apologizing for (instead of being vague about what happened). Stating that you are taking responsibility for what happened (instead of making excuses for your behavior). Focusing only on your actions (instead of adding the criticism \"but YOU also...\"). Saying \"I'm sorry\" (instead of saying everything BUT \"I'm sorry\"). Saying \"I should have...\" (instead of refusing to state the proper actions). Earnest apologies mitigate pride, anger, and other emotions that hamper the honest communication needed to reach a resolution . Both parties must first listen and take responsibility (the first step of conflict resolution) before common goals can be est ablished (the second step of conflict resolution). Civility does not call for the elimination of conflict; it merely calls for individuals to disagree respectfully. Respectful disagree- ments are signs of healthy conflict and are achieved by respecting different perspectives. The role of differing perspectives in con- flict is best illustrated in a Jainism parable in which six blind men were asked to determine what an elephant looked like by feeling different parts of the elephant's body. Conflict erupted as the one who felt the leg said the elephant was like a pillar; the one who felt the trunk said the elephant was like a tree branch; and the others described the elephant as a rope, a hand fan, a wall, and a solid pipe. The story illustrates the Jainism doctrine of Anekntavda, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view (the same principle that influenced Mahatma Gandhi to adopt principles of religious tolerance). Considering the possibility of alternate explanations permits a creative approach to resolving disagreements, and brainstorming (the thir d step of conflict resolution) only occurs once the involved parties have expressed and listened to all sides of the story. Differences are at the heart of conflict, and workplace conflict is inevitable due to the myriad cultures, experiences, and p ersonali- ties that must work together to achieve common goals. Workplace conflict, as in the parable, often results from poor communic ation and incomplete information, and unless these disparities are addressed in a civil manner (with respect, consideration, and re asona- bility), relationships and productivity will suffer substantially. Although workplace conflict is natural, civility helps det ermine whether organizations will grow or atrophy from these inexorable differences. Using Civility to Resolve Conflicts Jenna Fielding Associate Equity Assurance Specialist of The Office of Equity and Diversity Domestic violence affects every American. It thrives when we are silent, but if we take a stand and work together, we can end domestic violence. Throughout the month of October, help raise awareness about domestic violence and join in the efforts to end violence. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we acknowledge the progress made in reducing these shameful crimes, embrace the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse, and recognize that more work remains until every individual is able to live free from fear.

Held each October, National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is a time to celebrate the many and varied contributions of America's workers with disabilities. This year is the 70th anniversary of NDEAM and 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The theme for NDEAM 2015 is \"My Disability Is One Part of Who I Am.\" Signed into law in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is civil rights legislation that works to increase the inclusion of people with disa- bilities in all aspects of community life, including employment. At the U.S. Department of Labor, we are committed to delivering on the promise of the ADA, not only for today's workers with disabilities, but also future gen- erations.

Fifty -four students - most from undergraduate institutions across the State of Tennessee - were selected to participate in this year's program and they were all highly moti- vated as demonstrated by their work over the course of the seven weeks. There were 18 students in Track I and these students were provided the opportunity to work alongside and shadow local practitioners in their area of interest and experience the day -to-day rigors and challenges of a being a healthcare profession- al. We had students working in dental practices, general medicine and specialty clinics, physical and occupational rehabilita- tion clinics, a compounding lab, as well as Methodist -LeBonheur Hospital and the Kaplan -Amonette Department of Dermatol- ogy. These students were required to present a poster at the end of the program showcasing something they learned over the summer or a topic related to that field. Staff from various UTHSC offices judged the students' presentations and the overall winner was Ms. Morgan Stansell for her poster, \"Weird or Unique?\" that focused on Asperger's Syndrome. Track II had the largest number of participants with 23 students. These students were enrolled in a Kaplan test preparation course for the DAT, MCAT, or PCAT designed to help them identify deficiencies they may have in their test -taking abilities and learning skills. Through the Kaplan course and on -site instructors, students were able to focus on content review and test - taking strategies, as well as complete practice questions and a number of full -length practice tests. Each student took a full - length diagnostic test for their specific test and most students improved their overall score on their last full -length practice test. (Additionally, seven students who participated in Track II of the 2014 TIP Program matriculated in August as first -year stu- dents in the Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy.) All 13 students in Track III successfully completed the coursework similar to the first -year curriculum in their respective col- leges and matriculated in August as first -year students in the Colleges of Dentistry, Medicine, and Pharmacy. This is the most rigorous track - dental and medicine students had 102 hours of instructional time and the phar- macy students had 106 hours -but Track III students receive access to Student Academic Sup- port Services and Inclusion (SASSI) to assist them with skills including time management, test - taking strategies, as well as, information about their learning styles that will help them during the TIP program and after beginning their professional program at UTHSC . The students reported overwhelmingly strong satisfaction with the program's ability to help them pursue their career goals in all three tracks; however, there is always room for improvement which will help with future success of the program.
