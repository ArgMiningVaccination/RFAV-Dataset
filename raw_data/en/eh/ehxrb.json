They have been used medicinally, for food preservation, cooking, in religious ceremonies, as pesticides and for many, many other uses. The healing properties of [Essential oils ](http://theoutpostmercantile.com/store/#!/Essential-Oils/c/12133231/offset=0&sort=normal)are of such benefit that until modern times with better extracting methods, only the very rich could afford to have possession of them. Today, even the most modest income families have the availability of these oils at their disposal. Another modern benefit is our understanding of the specific constituents contained in the different oils. We now understand why certain oils are good for a particular issue and we have a clearer understanding of how they work to our benefit. We thought it would be fun to talk about a few of the more common oils and how you can easily bring them into your home and use them safely with your family. In [\"Homeopathy for Mommies\" book](http://theoutpostmercantile.com/store/#!/Homeopathy-Guide-Book/c/12133276/offset=0&sort=normal), pg. 195-197 you'll find some very basic information on the medicinal uses and some of the wonderful healing and anti-bacterial properties of my favorite, \"can't live without\" oils. Also, on our podcast [\"Sprains, Strains, and Breaks\"](http://ultimateradioshow.com/sprains-strains-breaks/) you can hear me talk about some of my experiences with the use of Essential Oils. It's important to understand that not all oils are the same. Quality is key. Organic, Wild crafted, Therapeutic grade, Pure. These are all things to look for. In many combination oils, they will add a carrier oil to dilute the actual essential oil. Also in oils called absolutes, you can end up with less than half quantity of essential oil. So make sure that your oils are Pure, Therapeutic grade and of high quality so that you are getting the full benefits of unadulterated plant oil. Oils are rich in natural constituents from the original plant. Each being unique to God's design and beneficial for a variety of uses. The properties of each oil vary in use per that design and are easily learned by all members of the family. One important thing to mention is that in our store, we do not carry any camphorated essential oils because these oils will cancel up to 90% of all homeopathic remedies when used simultaneously. Some homeopathic doctors feel that a good essential oil containing camphor can interrupt a homeopathic remedy for up to 5 weeks. So we use only oils that are homeopathic compatible. I tell folks that we also avoid mints so that in the event that we need to use the homeopathic remedy, [Arnica](http://theoutpostmercantile.com/store/#!/Arnica-30c/p/61780786), I want to know that it will work. It's a choice. And I like to make sure that everyone understands why sometimes a remedy doesn't work the way it's supposed to. Over the next few weeks, I will be sharing more with you about some of the essential oils and how to use them. I have a few many favorites! But the one oil that everyone should know about is [\"Lavender.\" ](http://theoutpostmercantile.com/store/#!/Or\u00e9mus-Essential-Oil-\u2014-Lavendar/p/46713560)This oil has wonderful antiseptic and anesthetic properties. It can be used internally or externally to kill bacteria, fungus and infections; it can be used undiluted or diluted and does not kill new skin like many over the counter antibiotic creams do. During WWII it is reported that French doctors ran out of antiseptic solution, so they began using pure Lavender oil for surgery. They used it in the incision before stitching the wound and again after, topically, over the wound before bandaging. The reports indicate that there was not even one case of infection in the patients that used the Lavender oil. This is something to note and remember! [ Lavender oil ](http://theoutpostmercantile.com/store/#!/Or\u00e9mus-Essential-Oil-\u2014-Lavendar/p/46713560)can be used directly on canker and mouth sores, teething babies, cuts, bruises, sores, hangnails, oral thrush, vaginitis, and any other area that is in need healing. Lavender is the only disinfectant that I have in my first aid kit and medicine cabinet. I do have some Ever clear alcohol that I use for cleaning instruments and such, but the lavender is what I use to heal. God bless you and "}
