Accreditation of an institution of higher education by NWCCU indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one that has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by NWCCU should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution.

Schleich, PhD President of NUNM Letter from the President | nunm.edu 2 Greetings from the Office of the PresidentNUNM is proud of its longstanding legacy of academic excellence. Founded in 1956, NUNM is the oldest naturopathic medical school in North America. NUNM's reputation for healthcare innovation and leadership grows as new generations of practitioners and healthcare professionals help change the course of health care in the U.S. through their research, exemplary patient care and publications. NUNM offers medical education programming in naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine, and in related health sciences disciplines. This includes 10 exceptional accredited degree programs\u2014eight postgraduate degrees and two undergraduate degrees. NUNM is an international leader in the training of naturopathic primary care physicians and Chinese medicine practitioners. While many graduates go on to clinical practice, they are also researchers, professors, public health educators, and political activists bringing natural medicine to the forefront of the national healthcare system. Students throughout the world come to NUNM for the opportunity to work with a faculty world-renowned for their expertise. NUNM cultivates exceptional curricula that offer medical students a rich combination of classroom study, hands-on research and patient care. In addition to the campus NUNM Health Centers\u2014 Lair Hill, which is the largest natural medicine clinic in Oregon, and NUNM Health Centers\u2014Beaverton, the university has access to more than a dozen local community clinics offering diverse clinical experiences to students. NUNM is home to a collaborative and inspiring learning environment, as well as a vital and groundbreaking research community. Our campus, located in the heart of Portland, Oregon, offers students and faculty the benefits and advantages of city living at its most sustainable within an urban setting infused with natural beauty, culture and social conscience. Breadth and Diversity of Programs NUNM is also known for its rich curricula in a variety of other areas, including research, nutrition, global and mental health, and sports medicine. Our programs are developed with the understanding that education is reinforced through the application of hands-on, interactive learning. Whether it's developing a research study and interviewing focus group participants, or developing whole-food recipes in NUNM's professional teaching kitchen, or conducting fieldwork in underdeveloped countries, our students learn through their direct experiences.Natural Medicine Today Health awareness is making giant strides\u2014and interest in natural medicine and healthy lifestyles is rising significantly. Studies have shown that Americans are seeking more natural health products, alternatives and services than ever before. Natural medicine provides patients a wide variety of beneficial treatment options unavailable to conventional medical practitioners. At the same time, Western medical doctors at hospitals, medical clinics and research centers are opening the doors to naturopathic and Chinese medical practitioners as natural medicine experiences an exciting period of integration into the healthcare system. It is a rapidly growing and evolving field that is serving the escalating need for effective preventive health care for millions of Americans. Natural medicine is known by many names: alternative medicine, integrative medicine, complementary medicine and others. One reason for its many labels is that natural medicine includes a variety of healing modalities. Your education at NUNM may include some or all of the following therapeutic methods, depending on your course of study. Traditional medical systems, such as naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture Mind-body medicine Physical medicine, including hydrotherapy and naturopathic manipulation Botanical medicine and supplements Nutrition counseling Conventional therapies, including pharmaceuticals and minor surgery Mental health counseling Each of these modalities present a tool for the physician to gain a better understanding of patient diagnosis and treatment for health conditions ranging from minor ailments to chronic and acute care. When these modalities are used in conjunction with conventional medicine, they have been called complementary medicine. When used as a substitute for conventional medicine, the same modalities may be called alternative medicine. When a conventional physician and a naturopathic physician work together to create the best healing plan for the patient, it's called integrative medicine. As more people seek combination treatments, future natural medicine practitioners and physicians will need to be knowledgeable about both conventional and natural medicine. Our graduates are able to bridge this gap.NUNM\u2014The Home of Natural Medicine 2017-2018 Course Catalog | The Home of Natural Medicine 3 Summer quarter begins (clinic) 7/3/2017 July 4 holiday (campus & clinics closed) 7/4/2017Summer academic classes begin 7/10/2017 New student institutional orientation 8/3, 8/25, 9/12/2017 (students attend one date)Summer academic classes end 9/1/2017 Labor Day holiday (campus & clinics closed) 9/4/2017New student academic orientation 9/13-14/2017 Summer quarter ends 9/16/2017 Fall quarter begins 9/18/2017 Last day to add or change sections 9/29/2017 Last day to pay tuition & fees 9/29/2017 Late payment fee assessed 10/2/2017 Last day to drop classes 10/13/2017 Veterans Day (campus & clinics closed) 11/10/2017 Clinic holiday I - Thanksgiving week session 11/20-22/2017 Thanksgiving break (no academic classes) 11/20-24/2017 Thanksgiving holiday (campus & clinics closed) 11/23-24/2017 Make up for Veterans Day 12/6/2017 Finals week 12/11-15/2017 Fall quarter ends 12/16/2017 Winter break (no academic classes) 12/17/2017-1/7/2018 Clinic holiday II - Prewinter session 12/18-23/2017 Winter break (campus closed) 12/25-31/2017New Year's Day (campus & clinics closed) 1/1/2018 Clinic holiday III - Post-winter session 1/2-6/2018 Orientation, January admits 1/5/2018 Winter quarter begins 1/8/2018 Martin Luther King Day (campus & clinics closed) 1/15/2018 Last day to add or change sections 1/19/2018 Last day to pay tuition & fees 1/19/2018 Late payment fee assessed 1/22/2018 OSCE 2 & 3 exams 1/26-27/2018 Last day to drop classes 2/2/2018 Make up for Martin Luther King Day 3/29/2018 Finals week 3/26-30/2018 Winter quarter ends 3/31/2018 Spring break (no academic classes) 4/1-8/2018Clinic holiday - Spring break session 4/2-7/2018 Spring quarter begins 4/9/2018 Last day to add or change sections 4/20/2018 Last day to pay tuition & fees 4/20/2018 Late payment fee assessed 4/23/2018 OSCE 1 exams 4/27-28/2018 University Council 5/4/2018 Last day to drop classes 5/4/2018 Memorial Day (campus & clinics closed) 5/28/2018 Make up for Memorial Day 6/18/2018 Finals week 6/25-29/2018 Spring quarter ends 6/30/2018 Commencement 6/30/2018Academic Calendar 2017-2018 Academic Calendar | nunm.edu 4 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Calendar 5 NUNM Campus Situated in the beautiful Pacific Northwest city of Portland, Oregon, National University of Natural Medicine is located near the Willamette River waterfront, close to the heart of the city.

Campus | nunm.edu 8 Scientific Research at NUNM Research is vital to providing a body of evidence- based data to support the practice of natural medicine. NUNM is committed to fully integrating research with existing academic and clinical activities. Faculty members are currently participating in National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) grants from the National Institutes of Health, including collaborations with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), University of Washington, and other biomedical schools or accredited natural medicine schools. While not all physicians and practitioners wish to become researchers, our goal is to train all of our graduates in the critical analysis of research studies so that they may accurately evaluate the quality of medical literature. In addition, learning about case analysis enables graduates to clearly investigate therapeutic results in their practices and share these results via publication in peer-reviewed journals. For those with an interest, there are many opportunities to participate in research at NUNM's Helfgott Research Institute. Helfgott Research Institute Helfgott Research Institute conducts rigorous, high- quality research on the art and science of healing. From basic science studies to clinical trials, Helfgott scientists from the fields of naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicinal herbs and acupuncture, immunology, biostatistics and nutrition apply their expertise to seek out natural medicine therapies that are effective, to discover why they work, and to develop methodologies for studying modalities that may not fall into the traditional biomedical model of research. Established in 2003, Helfgott carries out strong clinical research and supports a diverse set of research projects. In addition to the Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research program, students in NUNM's clinical programs and School of Graduate Studies have opportunities to participate in research during their course of study. Faculty and student research projects are regularly published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. At Helfgott, we believe in collaborative research and make every effort to include conventional biomedical institutions as well as other complementary and alternative medicine institutions in our projects. The Institutes of NUNM Beginning in fall 2012, NUNM embarked on an exciting mission to share its wealth of knowledge about health and wellness with students of all ages and levels of interest within the Portland metro community. Women in Balance Institute Introduced in 2012, NUNM's Women in Balance Institute (WIBI), was the first natural medicine educational association in the nation dedicated to education and research on women's health. The institute's goal is to educate women and the healthcare community about hormones and how they affect a woman's health at each stage of her life. NUNM medical students, working under the supervision of a lead physician, have the opportunity to play a role in women's health education and outreach. Traditional Roots Institute The Traditional Roots Institute launched in spring 2013 with a simple goal: to feed and grow natural medicine's herbal roots. The institute helps bring the people's medicine back to our communities through education and experiential learning. It offers opportunities for all types of healthcare providers to deepen their understanding of herbal medicine and advance their clinical practice. With the guidance of a lead physician, NUNM students help lead herb walks, organize educational events, and publish articles about herbs and their importance to health. Food as Medicine Institute Formally established in 2014, the goal of NUNM's Food as Medicine Institute (FAMI) is to adapt the intensive nutrition training that naturopathic and Chinese medicine students receive during their medical education into meaningful learning opportunities for community members. FAMI naturopathic physicians and NUNM students offer a variety of hands-on learning experiences through community-based nutrition and cooking programs, including the FAME (Food as Medicine Everyday) workshops. FAME is a 12-week series of interactive nutrition classes and whole-food cooking instruction available to families and individuals in the Portland area. Age Wise Institute The mission of NUNM's Age Wise Institute (AWI), announced in 2016, is to change the paradigm of aging by promoting healthy living at every age and sharing wisdom across generations. The institute promotes healthy aging through community-based programs, education and research. Age Wise Institute seeks to support the specialized health needs of our aging population, who are increasingly interested in learning about preventive and integrative health approaches that can aid health and well-being. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Campus 9 Life in Portland, Oregon The City Portland's metropolitan area is home to more than 2 million residents and 95 neighborhoods, each with its own unique style.

The Business Office may deny or rescind a student's eligibility for a promissory note if a student misses the required payment due dates, provides inaccurate or incomplete information, or has a poor credit history. Students are not permitted to register for a quarter until all money owed the university is paid in full from previous quarters. All students who elect to pay their account balances with a credit card (Visa, MasterCard or Discover) will be charged a convenience fee of 3 percent of the amount paid at the time of processing. Payments made by debit card and/or check will not be charged a fee. Credit for courses will not be given until tuition and fees have been paid in full. The Business Office may also block future registration until all debts have been paid in full. Transcripts or diplomas will not be issued to students if they owe the university any money, regardless of the source (e.g., outstanding clinic balances). Students with past due accounts who pay in full with a personal check will have transcripts or diplomas issued to them two weeks after payment. Any adjustments or modifications to the schedule of tuition charges are subject to the approval of the chief financial officer. Summer Quarter Financial Aid Considerations Summer is a non-standard term, and as such, students often find it difficult to enroll in courses that qualify for federal financial aid. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, students must meet the definition of half-time enrollment by enrolling in courses and/or electives that are required for degree completion in their program of enrollment. Students who have met their core and/or maximum number of elective requirements and who choose to enroll in additional summer terms are not eligible for financial aid. Change of Track A change of track requires a signature from the program dean. All change of track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Student Responsibilities 1. Students are responsible for ensuring that charges on their statement are correct and that all tuition for classes, lab fees, and other applicable fees have been applied. It is also the student's responsibility to pay all charges on their account by the due date, whether or not they have received a courtesy paper statement. Financial Policies 2017-2018Financial Policies | nunm.edu 22 If tuition and fees are being paid by parents or relatives on behalf of the student, the university regards this as a private arrangement between the student and the other third party. The university will deal directly with the student regarding the payment of fees or any queries regarding a student statement. 2. Students experiencing financial problems in the payment of any tuition and fees are responsible for contacting the Business Office to make satisfactory arrangements. 3. Students are responsible for keeping NUNM informed of their current contact information, as addressed in Section 3.1 of the student handbook. Students must submit changes to their contact information to the Registrar's Office. 4. Any assessment or judgment against a student for damage to NUNM property, whether arising from a Student Conduct Code proceeding or a court action, shall be considered money due NUNM as if it were tuition. No transcripts or diplomas will be released to the student until the amount due the university has been paid. The Business Office may also block future registration. NOTE: The university is not responsible for any loss of, or damage to, the personal property of a student. Other Expenses Students are required to purchase textbooks and other personal equipment, as well as basic diagnostic equipment for use in courses and clinic. These costs vary from year to year. Tuition and Fee Refund Policies Adding/Dropping Courses Students are responsible for formally withdrawing from classes they wish to drop. Students who fail to formally drop classes during the refund period are responsible for the tuition charges. Please note that fieldwork and cultural immersion trips are subject to a different refund schedule, detailed below. (See add/drop policy in Section 3.12 of the student handbook.) Week of Quarter Tuition Refund Rate First week 100% tuition Second week 75% tuition Third week 50% tuition Fourth week 25% tuition Beyond fourth week No refundExperiential Learning - Tuition and Deposit Refund Policies Many off-campus experiential learning experiences at NUNM require that travel/accommodation/catering arrangements be made well in advance. These include retreats and travel-based (trip) courses. The tuition and fee refund policies for such events differ from those of standard on-campus courses. Tuition will be refunded at the same schedule in Section 9.6 of the handbook if the student withdraws from the institution. Off-Campus Retreat Courses (e.g., qigong, CCM immersion and naturopathic medicine retreats) Students formally dropping a retreat prior to the start of the retreat can get full tuition reimbursement. However, they are not eligible for a retreat fee refund once the term has started. Shan Ren Dao Retreat Students must submit an application for this two-week retreat, and be interviewed and accepted prior to registration. The tuition and retreat fee refunds policy is the same as for other off-campus retreat courses. Travel-Based (Trip) Courses (e.g., global health experience trips, China trip) Students must apply and be accepted to travel-based (trip) courses. Once accepted, they will sign and submit an agreement to be registered for the travel, and are required to reserve their spot with a 50% deposit at the time of registration. The deposit will be charged to the student's NUNM account. The deposit is used to make travel arrangements, including accommodations and other travel-related expenses. The travel deposit may be assessed several months prior to the trip itself. After the travel deposit has been assessed, a student who wishes to drop the trip must submit an add/drop form and is subject to the following refund rates: Deposits for travel-based courses (excluding Shan Ren Dao and off-campus retreats) will be refunded at 100% up to eight (8) weeks prior to the departure date. If the course is dropped within eight (8) weeks of the start date, the deposit is non-refundable. Withdrawing from NUNM If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from the institution, the following policies apply: The application fee, submitted with the initial application for acceptance to NUNM, is nonrefundable.2017-2018 Course Catalog | Financial Policies 23 Academic Fees CCM Initial Exit Exam (CM 996) $125 CCM Clinic Exit Exam Retake (fee each) $75 (payable before Retake can be taken) CCM Makeup Exam with an Excused Absence no charge (written and quizzes) CCM Makeup Lab Exam with an Excused Absence $60 (payable before Makeup can be taken)CCM Remediation Exam or Project (for FR/R grades) $100 (payable before Retake can be taken) Challenge Examination Fee $60 plus 50% of the per credit rate Clinic Private Tutoring (6 weeks) $1,500 Clinic Rotation Change Fee $50 CPR Certification Fee (5 hours) $52 (recertification required every two years) Independent Study Fee equal to one credit hour of tuition rate ND Makeup Exam with an Excused Absence (written and quizzes) no charge ND Makeup Lab Exam with an Excused Absence $100 ND OSCE 1 & 2 Initial Exam (charged to student's account) $185ND OSCE 3 Initial Exam (charged to student's account) $350 ND OSCE 1, 2 & 3 Retake (payable before Retake can be taken) $150ND Remediation (Makeup) Quiz Fee $25 ND Remediation Exam or Project (for FR/R grades) (fee each) $100 (payable before Remediation can be taken) Petition to Deviate $50 each approved submission SGS Remediation Written Exam or Project (for FR/R grades) $100 Undergraduate Makeup Exam with an Excused Absence (quizzes) $25 Lab and Other Fees (All lab fees are nonrefundable) All Cooking and/or Teaching Kitchen Courses (each) $50 BAS 5110L, 5120L, 5130L Structure and Function 5111L, 5121L Clinical Anatomy I-II Lab (each) $85 CLE 716 Clinical Lab Practicum $30 CLE 827 Clinical Skills Enhancement Tutorial $650 CLE 828 ND OSCE Skills Tutorial $350 CLE 5120 6212 Introduction to Clinic $25 CLS 6210T & Rehab Tutorial $25 CLS 6210L Musculoskeletal, Ortho, Exercise Tutorial Therapy and Environmental Medicine Lab $85 The acceptance deposit fee will be forfeited by a student who withdraws after accepting admission, but before attending classes. Calculation of tuition refunds are based on the date the student begins NUNM's withdrawal process. Tuition refunds will first be applied to balances due NUNM. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. Tuition refunds for withdrawing students are calculated according to NUNM's tuition and fee refund policy outlined below: Week of Quarter Tuition Refund Rate First week 100% tuition Second week 90% tuition Third week 80% tuition Fourth week 70% tuition Fifth week 60% tuition Sixth week 50% tuition Beyond sixth week No refund Any refund of tuition and fees resulting from a withdrawal or a reclassification of tuition status must be applied to the recipient's financial aid awards before any payment is made to the student. Tuition refunds are calculated according to NUNM's tuition and fee refund policy. Return of federal Title IV funds is calculated according to Department of Education regulations. (See Financial Aid section for more information.) Students whose accounts were paid-in-full often have a balance due NUNM after withdrawal. The Title IV return of funds policy operates independently of the university's tuition refund policy. It is possible for a withdrawing student to owe NUNM money because aid must be returned to the Title IV program, but the student is not entitled to a refund of institutional charges. Federal regulations for this refund policy allow the university to retain an administrative fee that reduces the institutional charges subject to refund. This fee is 5 percent of total charges, up to a maximum of $100. Furthermore, federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NUNM and who leaves the university for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted by the Financial Aid Office and can be arranged by calling that office.

NUNM participates in federal Title IV aid programs. Federal Title IV aid program availability is outlined in the policies and provisions mandated by the federal government, and currently provides grants, loans and work-study funds to eligible students enrolled in school. Financial aid is available to students enrolled at least half time. NUNM's definition of full-time enrollment in undergraduate programs is 12 credits and half time is 6 credits. All other programs define full time as 11 credits and half time as 5.5 credits, except for those programs identified in the School of Graduate Studies, for which the full-time credit load is defined as 8 credits and half time is 4 credits. All students applying for federal financial aid are required to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This document becomes available each year through the FAFSA website at fafsa.ed.gov. Eligibility for financial aid is determined using a federal methodology formula outlined by the U.S. Department of Education. The financial aid awarding process begins in early spring of each academic year for all students entering in summer term, and late spring for students entering in the fall. Prospective students must have been accepted for enrollment and paid all required fees and deposits at NUNM to receive an official financial aid award package. NUNM's early-bird packaging date is Feb. 15 for need-based aid consideration. Federal Pell, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Oregon Opportunity Grant and federal work-study are considered need-based aid awards and awarded to the highest need students as determined by the U.S. Department of Education. Due to limited funding allocations in these programs, eligible students who apply after the priority deadline date risk losing the opportunity to receive these awards. There are no guarantees; however, those students interested in federal work-study will be placed on a waitlist in the event that funds become available later in the year. Students receiving federal financial aid are required to disclose to the Financial Aid Office all outside resources received on their behalf. These resources will be included and calculated as part of their financial aid award packet, and other aid may be reduced to accommodate any additional resource. To continue to receive financial aid, the student must make satisfactory academic progress, as defined by academic policies, and must be enrolled at least half time to qualify for federal aid. The Financial Aid Office can advise the student about sources of financial aid and budgeting strategies. This office is available as a resource even after the student leaves the university. Alumni may contact the Financial Aid Office for information about lender and servicer contacts, as well as guidance about confidential counseling pertaining to student indebtedness and loan repayment. We want to provide you with clear and concise information about financial aid. Following is a brief overview of federal financial aid deadlines and programs available to eligible students at NUNM. To be considered an \"eligible student,\" you must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least half time at the university. Students who attend NUNM on an F-1 visa (foreign students) are not eligible to participate in federal student aid programs. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) To apply for federal student financial aid, and to apply for many state student aid programs, students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information you provide on your FAFSA determines if you are eligible for financial aid. The federal Title IV school code for NUNM is B07624. The application and other relevant information is located at fafsa.ed.gov. Financial Aid Census Date In accordance with federal regulations, the Financial Aid Office will recalculate federal, state and institutional student aid awards based on enrollment status as of the published census date by the Office of the Registrar, which is the first Monday of the third week of each term: summer, fall, winter and spring. This policy typically coincides with the end of the add/drop period for each semester. All federal, state and institutional aid will be based upon the census date enrollment status. After census date, students cannot request changes to the federal Pell grant and federal work-study (FWS) programs. Changes to Federal Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized and PLUS loan programs are allowed if a student wishes to decrease or decline loan(s) or increase a loan if the student had previously declined a portion of or all of any one of these loans, as long as all other eligibility requirements are met. Eligibility for these federal programs may be affected for those who have had FAFSA information or corrections submitted after the census date. Please note that you must be enrolled full time [at least 12 credit hours for undergraduate and 11 for graduate students (varies by program) ] to receive FSEOG and FWS forms of financial aid, in addition to other types of aid for which you may be eligible. A student whose census date enrollment is less than half time is not eligible for any federal student loans. In this case, the entire loan amount for the term must be returned to the Department of Education. The return of loan funds may create an outstanding balance on a student's NUNM account, and also reduces the outstanding principal balance of the student loan.Financial AidFinancial Aid | nunm.edu 26 Students who drop credits prior to the 10th day of class (the census date) may be required to repay some or all of aid that was disbursed if they do not, at that time, meet the enrollment requirements for the types of aid awarded. Students who add credits after the 10th day of class (the census date) will not be eligible to receive additional financial aid. The Financial Aid Office is not able to adjust all types of aid after the census date. Students experiencing unusual circumstances can request an appointment with the Director of Financial Aid. This policy does not apply to students who withdraw from all courses. Complete withdrawals from the institution are subject to federal, state and institutional refund policies. If students drop classes (or change their class status to audit) after the census date, they may also have future financial aid eligibility issues. Please review the add/drop policies in the student handbook for more information on the requirements to maintain financial aid eligibility. Scholarships Money received from scholarship sources does not have to be repaid. At NUNM there are limited scholarships available for both entering and matriculated students. NUNM matriculated scholarships are administered by the Advancement Office. In order to be assured of full consideration for available scholarships, completed applications for admission and scholarship awards, along with all supporting documentation, must be received in the Admissions or Advancement Offices by the appropriate deadline dates. NUNM anticipates awarding scholarships to both new and returning students enrolled during the academic year. The amount and availability varies for all scholarships from year to year. Scholarship recipients must maintain satisfactory academic progress as a condition for receiving a scholarship. Failure to do so will result in cancellation of the scholarship. This policy applies to both internal and external scholarship funding sources. Admissions Scholarships Decisions on scholarship awards for incoming students are based on a holistic evaluation of the entire application file and are made at the same time admissions decisions are made. Applicants do not need to complete a separate application for these scholarships. Since these awards are given on a rolling basis, the probability of receiving a scholarship decreases for applications received later in the year. As of the end of January, approximately half of the available scholarships have been awarded. For more information about these scholarships, please contact the Admissions Office at 503.552.1660. NUNM Enrolled Student Scholarships All current full-time students in good academic standing are encouraged to apply for student scholarships. Finalists are selected based on a record of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, service to the university and community, dedication to the profession of natural medicine, and a commitment to honoring and celebrating diversity. Scholarship applications are available late in spring term of each year. Selected recipients are announced after spring term and scholarships are awarded evenly over the students' following academic year. Additional criteria may apply. The Office of Advancement operates the university's scholarship program. More information about scholarship availability can be obtained by contacting the vice president of advancement at 503.552.1512. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Financial Aid 27 Grants Pell Grant A federal Pell grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. The federal Pell grant program provides funds to students demonstrating financial need, and are awarded only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Students who will receive federal Pell grants, and have the most financial need, will receive FSEOGs first. The FSEOG does not need to be repaid. Unlike the federal Pell grant program, FSEOG funds are often exhausted before the end of the school year. Interested students should be sure to submit their FAFSA applications as early as possible. Oregon Opportunity Grant The Oregon Opportunity Grant program was created by the Oregon State Legislature to help needy Oregon students to attend Oregon colleges. Oregon residents who attend NUNM may be eligible to receive an Oregon Opportunity Grant. These grants are awarded on the basis of financial need, based upon the information provided on your FAFSA. Students who already have a bachelor's degree are not eligible to receive an Oregon Opportunity Grant. More detailed information regarding the Oregon Opportunity Grant is at oregonstudentaid.gov/oregon-opportunity-grant.aspx. Federal Loans Loans comprise the majority of financial aid at NUNM. Approximately 96 percent of students attending the university find it necessary to borrow some funding while completing their program. However, students should keep in mind that these loans are not designed to meet the total student budget to attend programs at NUNM, and that the money borrowed will have to be repaid with interest. Federal Direct Loan Program National University of Natural Medicine currently processes federal loans through the Federal Direct Loan program, wherein borrowers obtain loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education. Aggregate Graduate Loan Limits for Master's Degree Programs The maximum amount of student education loans is limited federally to $20,500 per nine-month period (academic year), and cannot exceed a maximum borrowing amount of $138,500\u2014of which no more than $65,500 can be in subsidized loans. This aggregate limit includes undergraduate loan debt and applies to students enrolled solely in master's degree programs. Aggregate Undergraduate Loan Limits The maximum aggregate amount of federal loans is limited to students enrolled in an undergraduate degree program. The maximum aggregate amount of DEPENDENT undergraduate loans a student may be eligible for is $31,000\u2014of which no more than $23,000 may be in the form of a subsidized loan. The maximum aggregate amount of INDEPENDENT undergraduate loans a student may be eligible for is $57,500\u2014of which no more than $23,000 may be in the form of a subsidized loan. Students who have received more than their aggregate cap are considered to have been over-awarded, and as such, must resolve the over-award prior to being considered eligible for federal Title IV financial aid. Annual loan limits apply and students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for further information. Types of Federal Loans Ninety-six percent of students attending NUNM find it necessary to receive some form of financial assistance. However, loans comprise the majority of financial aid at NUNM. Student loan borrowers must sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) that details the terms of their agreement with the U.S. Department of Education. As a condition of signing the MPN, the student agrees to restrict use of student loan funds to pay for current year educationally related expenses only, and as such, agrees to immediately repay any loan proceeds that cannot be attributed to educational expenses for attendance, on at least a half-time basis, at NUNM. The amount of education loans available will depend on a student's program(s) of enrollment. The student should keep in mind the amount of loans they choose to borrow and their overall indebtedness, and that the money borrowed will have to be repaid with interest. All students interested in federal loans must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Subsidized Stafford Loans are one of three programs in the Federal Direct Loan program. Subsidized Stafford Loans have both interest and principal payments waived during enrollment (at least half time) periods and during the grace period. Eligibility for this program is based upon need, class level, annual limits and cumulative limits. Only undergraduate students can be awarded subsidized loans. Students who borrow Subsidized Stafford Loans must complete entrance counseling and a Master Promissory Note (MPN). For more information, go to studentloans.gov. Financial Aid | nunm.edu 28 Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are covered under the Federal Direct Loan program. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans have principal payments waived during enrollment (at least half time) and during the grace period. The student borrower must elect to make interest-only payments while attending school or defer payments. Deferred interest payments will be capitalized (added to the principal balance) at repayment. Eligibility for this program is based upon dependent status, class level, and annual and cumulative limits. Student borrowers who elect to borrow both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (if eligible for both) may complete one MPN for both programs. Borrowers who have not completed entrance counseling must do so before completing an MPN. For more information, go to studentloans.gov. Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The PLUS loan program is available to parents of undergraduate students. The PLUS loan program is credit-score based. This loan is limited to the difference between the student's cost of education and the student's financial aid. Parents who want to borrow a PLUS loan must complete a PLUS Loan Certification Request form. If a parent borrower is unable to secure a PLUS loan, the undergraduate dependent student may be eligible for additional unsubsidized loans to help pay for his or her education. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan Program This program is available to students to help offset the cost of their education. This loan is in addition to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan program to fill the gap between any other forms of financial aid the student may receive, and additional money needed for school up to the student's cost of attendance budget. Students should keep in mind that the interest on these loans continues to accrue while enrolled in school, and that the interest rates are generally higher than the Federal Direct Stafford Loan program. A credit check is required and an endorser option may be available. There is no grace period on this loan and repayment begins 60 days after the final loan disbursement; however, students are eligible to request an in-school deferment on this loan. For more information, contact the Financial Aid Office. Alternative Loans Alternative (private) loans are administered and processed by private lending institutions, and are to be used for educational costs after first exhausting potentially more favorable federal and state financial aid options. Contact the Financial Aid Office or visit nunm.edu to search for an alternate loan product through ELMSelect.Exhaust Federal Student Aid Options First Alternative loans are not part of the federal student loan programs, and should only be used in circumstances where you have exhausted all other options in regard to financing your education. It is highly recommended that students apply for financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) prior to seeking an alternative loan. You may be eligible for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Additional information about direct loans can be found by contacting the Financial Aid Office or visiting nunm.edu. Benefits of direct loans over an alternative loan may include lower interest rates and better repayment options. Eligible students who elect to decline participation in the Federal Direct Loan program to borrow an alternative loan must contact the NUNM Financial Aid Office to schedule a counseling session and sign a \"Federal Student Loan Waiver\" form. NUNM Emergency Loans The university provides emergency loan assistance on a short-term basis to students experiencing financial hardship resulting from unexpected emergency situations. A maximum of $500 may be borrowed, and a $10 processing fee is charged for each loan. Emergency loans are considered a loan of last resort and available at the discretion of the director of financial aid to students with an acute immediate need. Additional criteria for this loan is outlined in the application process. Students cannot borrow more than one emergency loan per academic year, cannot borrow this loan in the final term of an academic year, and must have this loan repaid in full prior to the end of the respective term. For more information, students can make an appointment to meet with the director of financial aid for consideration. Emergency Loan Examples: Personal/Family Crisis - a situation or period in which things are very uncertain, difficult or painful; especially a time when action must be taken to avoid complete disaster or breakdown Disaster - an event that causes serious loss, destruction, hardship or death Tragedy - serious illness, financial ruin or fatality Theft - having property stolen, vehicle damage, etc. Student Loan Fund Disbursement Procedures The Financial Aid Office receives the details of student loan fund disbursements in paper and electronic format. The Financial Aid Office is responsible for recording receipt date and fund amounts for each student, verifying 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Financial Aid 29 enrollment status, and certifying the student is not on academic probation. Federal loan disbursements are received at the institution approximately at the start of each term. This detailed information is then forwarded to the Business Office where personnel will verify the total credit hours for each recipient enrolled at the time of disbursement (or when the loan funds received are credited to the student's account). Methodology/Frequency of Student Financial Assistance Disbursements NUNM operates on a quarter system. This system includes summer, fall, winter and spring quarters. Summer is the header term and begins the academic year at NUNM. For financial aid purposes, the academic year begins July 1 and ends June 30 of each year. All financial aid funds are disbursed quarterly through the Business Office. The Business Office applies financial aid funds to a student's account for unpaid tuition and fees at the time funds are received by the institution. If financial aid funds are in excess of tuition and fees, the resulting credit balance will be refunded to the student to use for other education-related expenses. Refund checks that are available at the start of fall/winter/spring terms are distributed by the Business Office staff on the first day of the term. Refund checks that become available after the first day of classes, or at any time during summer term, are placed in student mailboxes. If a student receives financial aid after the term begins, any resulting credit balance will be refunded by the Business Office within 10 business days of receipt of the funds by the institution. The refund check will be placed in the student's mailbox. Credit balances resulting from any other financial activity, such as dropped classes, in the first three weeks of the term will be refunded in week four of the term (after the add/drop period has ended and tuition has become due). Credit balances resulting after week three from any activity other than receipt of financial aid funds will be refunded in weeks six, eight, ten or twelve of the term. Refund checks will be placed in student mailboxes. Professional Judgment Review The U.S. Department of Education gives the director of financial aid the authority to make adjustments to a student's financial aid package in cases involving unusual circumstances through a process known as professional judgment. Students experiencing unusual/unexpected financial circumstances during the academic year can request a meeting with the director of financial aid to request a review. An academic year is defined as a period of enrollment during the current FAFSA year. Students under review are required to act professionally and respond appropriately, and will be required to sign a release to provide specific documentation. The professional judgment review process is solely at the discretion of the director of financial aid, and all outcomes whether approved or denied are final and ineligible for appeal. Change of Program Track and Adding/ Dropping Courses - Effect on Financial Aid Students receiving federal financial aid must provide their Student Status Change form or Add/Drop form, and schedule a meeting with the Financial Aid Office staff to discuss program changes that may affect their eligibility for financial aid. Federal Title IV Refund Procedure Title IV funds are awarded under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws they may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that they were originally scheduled to receive. Students who withdraw from the program before week eight of any quarter may be eligible for a refund. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. If the amount of the refund exceeds the total amount of aid, the excess will be returned to the student. Students whose accounts were paid in full often have a balance owed to NUNM after withdrawal. The Title IV Return of Funds policy operates independently of the university's tuition refund policy. It is possible for a withdrawing student to owe NUNM money because aid must be returned to the Title IV program, but the student is not entitled to a refund of institutional charges. Federal Title IV funds are always returned in the order mandated by the U.S. Department of Education: For graduate-level students, the order is:1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan For undergraduate-level students, the order is:1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan 3. Federal Direct Parent PLUS 4. Pell Grant 5. FSEOGFinancial Aid | nunm.edu 30 The calculation of Title IV funds earned by students has no relationship to their incurred institutional charges. Up through the 60 percent (60%) point in each payment period or period of enrollment, a prorated schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds students have earned at the time of withdrawal. After the 60 percent (60%) point in the payment period or period of enrollment, students earn 100 percent (100%) of the Title IV funds they are scheduled to receive during the period. For a student who withdraws after the 60 percent (60%) point-in-time, there are no unearned funds. However, an institution must still determine whether that student is eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. Federal refund calculations are independent of NUNM's tuition refund policies. NOTE: The federal Title IV refund calculations only apply to withdrawals from all classes. However, if a student changes track and there is an adjustment made to the tuition charges, the Financial Aid Office will recalculate the student's cost of attendance budget for aid eligibility. Federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NUNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted online at studentloans.gov. Additional information may be obtained by contacting the Financial Aid Office. Federal Work-Study Program The federal work-study program (FWSP) provides job opportunities that complement and reinforce our students' educational and career goals. The program is available to students as an alternate resource to earn money to help cover educational expenses. Student employees earn an hourly wage and are paid monthly. Part-time employment while enrolled in school can help make ends meet. However, due to the demands of the programs, students generally find their schedules limit the amount of time they can work to 20 hours per week or less. The Financial Aid Office administers the federal work-study program and maintains an online timesheet database. NUNM has a priority packaging date for need-based aid consideration. Students with demonstrated financial need, and who indicate on the FAFSA application an interest in work-study, are eligible to receive an award. However, due to fund limitations, only those students with the highest need will receive an award. FWSP is a federally subsidized program with a limited allocation. The number of students receiving an award is limited by the program funding received by the university, and is awarded to students as applications are received, until the funding is fully utilized. Allocated funds could be exhausted regardless of whether or not a student applies by the priority deadline.Federal Work-Study Conditions and Limitations The following are mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment, and are summarized as follows: Federal work-study is governed by any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws. Federal work-study must not displace employees or impair existing service contracts. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Federal work-study employees must be paid for all hours worked. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from accepting voluntary services from any person who has been compensated for those worked hours. Students receiving, or eligible to receive, federal work-study funds may not receive institutional student employment funds. The federal work-study program allows students to work on- or off-campus to earn money to be applied to education-related expenses. The FWSP award varies from year to year and is dependent on the total federal allocation received by the institution. Federal work-study jobs include positions such as teaching assistant, grader, library assistant, medicinary support, front desk help, patient coordinator and reading tutor, to name a few. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Financial Aid 31 To view a list of current work-study opportunities, please visit nunm.edu/workstudy. Search all departments to see all jobs posted for the year. Only eligible federal work-study students currently attending NUNM are eligible to apply for these positions. Student Employment Program The student employment program (STEP) provides job opportunities that complement and reinforce our students' educational and career goals. The program is available to students as an alternate resource to earn money to help cover educational expenses. Student employees earn an hourly wage and are paid monthly. STEP operates independently from the federal work-study program. Limited positions exist and students employed by this program are subject to the budgeted funds of the hiring department. Students employed through STEP cannot work under the federal work-study program . Student Employment Conditions and Limitations The following are mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment, and are summarized as follows: Student employment is governed by any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws. Student employment must not displace employees or impair existing service contracts. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Student employees must be paid for all hours worked. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from accepting voluntary services from any person who has been compensated for those worked hours. Student employees are provided with limited funds determined by the hiring department each budget year. Students receiving, or eligible to receive, student employment funds may not receive federal work-study funds. STEP awards are included in the cost of attendance budget as an outside resource and other aid may be reduced. Student Employment Criteria In order to participate in the student employment program (STEP), a student must be an international student, be ineligible for the federal work-study program, or have voluntarily relinquished their FWSP award. NOTE: students missing the financial aid priority deadline or failing to file the FAFSA are not eligible for STEP funds.Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Federal regulations require schools to monitor the academic progress of each applicant for federal financial assistance, and that the institution certify that the applicant is making satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Students who meet SAP requirements maintain their eligibility for federally funded programs. Students must maintain SAP toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as passing all program requirements, maintaining pace of progression to complete their degree, and completing their program of enrollment within the published timeframe. Students who do not meet the minimum standards will find their financial aid eligibility in jeopardy. For a complete explanation of the financial aid SAP policy for both graduate and undergraduate programs, contact the Financial Aid Office. Financial Aid Policy and Drug-Related Convictions Students are ineligible for federal Title IV aid if convicted of an offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs. The period of ineligibility is contingent upon the offense committed and on whether the student is a first-time or repeat offender. (Information on Oregon and federal sanctions, and periods of ineligibility, is available from the Office of Financial Aid and in the student handbook.) Eligibility and Rehabilitation Drug Rehabilitation To restore Title IV eligibility early, students must successfully complete a qualified drug rehabilitation program. This program must conduct two unannounced drug tests and receive, or be qualified to receive, funds directly or indirectly from a federal, state or local government program. Government Program An acceptable government program is one that is administered or recognized by a federal, state or local government agency or court. The drug rehabilitation program must be qualified to receive, or is currently receiving, payment directly or indirectly from a state-licensed insurance company; or administered or recognized by a state-licensed hospital, health clinic or medical doctor.College of Naturopathic Medicine | nunm.edu 32 Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is a patient-centered primary care approach to health care that focuses on restoring and optimizing health. It is a distinct system of health care\u2014an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. Heir to the vitalistic tradition of medicine in the Western world, naturopathic medicine emphasizes the treatment of disease through the stimulation, enhancement and support of the inherent healing power of the body. Methods of treatment are chosen that respect the natural healing process whenever possible. A Brief History: Naturopathic Medicine in the U.S. and NUNM While the framework for naturopathic medicine can be traced back through history to Hippocrates, it was Drs. Benedict and Louisa Lust who brought nature cure medicine from Europe to the United States in 1896 and helped develop the term naturopathy. Benedict Lust is widely known for his historic role in establishing naturopathic medicine in North America. However, it is less well-known that Louisa Lust hired Dr. Lust and financed the first naturopathic college. NUNM honors both Lusts as the architects of naturopathic medicine in North America. By the early 20th century, naturopathic medicine was flourishing throughout the country. Naturopathic doctors were licensed in a majority of states. There were more than 20 naturopathic medical colleges; the most prominent was Lust's American School of Naturopathy in New York City. Naturopathic medical conventions attracted more than 10,000 naturopathic physicians. At the same time, there was strong support for what is now known as conventional allopathic medicine or biomedicine. The Flexner Report of 1910 was commissioned through the Carnegie Foundation as a critical examination of medical education in the United States and Canada. Its goal was to lend credence to the standardization of medical education admissions, licensing and practice. In his report, Abraham Flexner, a high school teacher whose highest degree at the time was a Bachelor of Arts, eschewed all medical approaches that he deemed lacking in scientific research and validity, or did not advocate the use of treatments such as pharmaceutical drugs. Naturopaths, in particular, came under greater scrutiny as the medical profession questioned the viability of naturopathic medicine. Pressure to close naturopathic schools and eliminate the profession began to gain momentum. Naturopathic medicine experienced a precipitous decline in the 1940s and '50s with the emergent rise of pharmaceutical medicine and technological advances. The concept that Flexner introduced, that naturopathic medicine was quackery or charlatanism, became prevalent. Naturopathic licensing was largely discontinued. Schools either complied with the call to eliminate curricula for naturopathy or closed their doors. From NCNM to NUNM As the last naturopathic degree program was terminated at Western States College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy in Portland, Oregon, naturopathic doctors banded together to find a way to save the profession from extinction. NDs from around the country raised money to create a school they would fight to keep open for generations to come. In 1956, Drs. Frank Spaulding, W. Martin Bleything and Charles Stone signed incorporation papers, establishing National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) in Portland, Oregon. From its founding until 1979, NCNM was the only naturopathic medical college in North America. Established by those who began practicing in the 1920s and '30s, NUNM (first known as National College of Naturopathic Medicine, more recently as National College of Natural Medicine, and now as National University of Natural Medicine) has been at the center of the profession for more than 60 years, preserving and extending the legacy of naturopathic medicine by training future physicians. The profession has experienced resurgence and tremendous growth in the past two decades as a health-conscious public has sought alternatives for conditions that conventional medicine has not adequately addressed. This growth is in direct response to the changing needs of our society. The public is demanding a medical model in which the individual plays a more active role in their health and healing process, and doctors want a practice that is more patient-centered and holistic. Today, NUNM is alma mater to thousands of naturopathic physicians. Our graduates practice in a rapidly growing number of U.S. states, territories, Canadian provinces College of Naturopathic Medicine The mission of the College of Naturopathic Medicine is to educate and train physicians in the art, science and research of naturopathic medicine2017-2018 Course Catalog | College of Naturopathic Medicine 33 and foreign countries. Many are nationally acclaimed healthcare experts, as well as successful physicians. Since 1956, when a determined group of NDs launched a new era in naturopathic education, NUNM alumni have carved new pathways in the advancement of the naturopathic profession. This is an exciting time to join the profession and continue making history in the field of naturopathic medicine. Scope of Practice Naturopathic physicians' scope of practice varies by jurisdiction. Many jurisdictions regard NDs as primary care physicians and provide them with a diagnostic and therapeutic scope of practice necessary to offer a wide range of options for their patients. These include general and preventive health care, as well as diagnosis and treatment for acute and chronic conditions. In those jurisdictions in which NDs are not licensed, the scope of practice excludes the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The naturopathic physician is defined by the U.S. Department of Labor as one who: \"Diagnoses, treats and cares for patients, using a system of practice that bases treatment of physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing [the] human body: Utilizes physiological, psychological and mechanical methods, such as air, water, light, heat, earth, phytotherapy, food and herb therapy, psychotherapy, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, minor and orificial surgery, mechanotherapy, naturopathic corrections and manipulation, and natural methods and modalities, together with natural medicines, natural processed foods and herbs and nature's remedies. Excludes major surgery, therapeutic use of X-ray and radium, and use of drugs, except those assimilable substances containing elements or compounds which are components of body tissues and are physiologically compatible to body processes for maintenance of life.\" (However, many states, including Oregon, have broad drug formularies that allow NDs to prescribe drugs.) Licensing and Certification of Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic doctors are legally recognized to practice medicine throughout the United States and U.S. territories, Canada, as well as many other countries. NDs are fully licensed in: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont and Washington. They are also licensed in Washington D.C., the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. In other U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, a varying scope of naturopathic practice may be permitted or protected by court decisions, attorney general opinions or local regulations. It should be noted that the state of Utah requires a one-year residency before licensing NDs. Like other physicians, recently graduated NDs are encouraged to seek additional clinical experience under the supervision of a licensed physician in the form of residencies and mentorships. Efforts to enact licensing laws are underway in several American states, and licensure legislation is in the final stages of consideration in a few states. The best sources of current information about the legal status of naturopathic medicine in a particular area are the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (818 18th St. NW, Suite 250, Washington, DC 20006, or naturopathic.org), state or provincial naturopathic associations, and individual naturopathic physicians practicing in those areas. Currently, all states that license naturopathic physicians require graduation from a residential course of study offered through an institution approved by the examining jurisdiction. NUNM meets all requirements of, and is accredited by, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Completion of the ND degree at NUNM or another CNME-recognized institution qualifies candidates to sit for a licensing examination that every applicant must pass to be licensed. Similarly, NUNM graduates are eligible to sit for examination in Canadian provinces that license naturopathic medicine. While each jurisdiction has its own examination requirements, an increasing number use the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX) as part or all of the required testing.

Systems-Based Practice: Effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of optimal value. The Six Philosophical Principles of Naturopathic Medicine The practice of naturopathic medicine emerges from six principles of healing. These principles are based on the objective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are examined continually in light of scientific analysis. These principles stand as the distinguishing marks of the profession: First Do No Harm primum non nocere Therapeutic actions that are complementary to, and synergistic with, the body's innate healing process reduce harm to patients. Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: Use methods and medicinal substances that minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. Whenever possible, avoid symptom suppression as it can interfere with the healing process. Respect and cooperate with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling.The Healing Power of Nature vis medicatrix naturae The body has the inherent ability to establish, maintain and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent; nature heals through the response of the life force. The physician's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to identify and remove obstacles to health and recovery, and to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Identify and Treat the Cause tolle causam Illness does not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered, and removed or treated, before a person can recover completely from illness. Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of disease; therefore, naturopathic medicine addresses itself primarily to the underlying causes of disease, rather than to the symptoms. Causes may occur on many levels, including physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. The physician must evaluate fundamental underlying causes on all levels, directing treatment at root causes as well as seeking relief of symptoms. Treat the Whole Person in perturbato animo sicut in corpore sanitas esse non potest Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism, involving a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. The physician must treat the whole person by taking all of these factors into account. The harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual is essential to recovery from and prevention of disease, and requires a personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. The Physician as Teacher docere Beyond an accurate diagnosis and appropriate prescription, the physician must work to create a healthy, sensitive interpersonal relationship with the patient. A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inherent therapeutic value. The physician's major role is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for her/his own health. The physician is a catalyst for healthful change, empowering and motivating the patient to assume responsibility. It is the patient, not the doctor, who ultimately creates or accomplishes healing. The physician must strive to inspire optimism as well as understanding. The physician must also make a commitment to her/his personal and spiritual development in order to be a good teacher. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | College of Naturopathic Medicine 35 Prevention principiis obsta: sero medicina curatur The ultimate goal of naturopathic medicine is prevention of disease. This is accomplished through education and promotion of lifestyle habits that foster good health, and through secondary prevention modalities, including those promoted by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease, and counsels patients on methods to avoid further harm and risk. The physician places the greatest emphasis on building health. Because it is difficult to be healthy in an unhealthy world, it is the responsibility of both physician and patient to create a healthier environment in which to live. Diagnostic Techniques NDs are trained in diagnostic techniques, such as physical exam, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging and psychological assessment. NDs endeavor to identify disease states in the context of the individual's overall health. Therapeutic Techniques Naturopathic practice includes the use of any medicinal substances that contain elements which are components of bodily tissues, or can be utilized by the body for the maintenance of life and the repair of tissues. The current scope of practice in Oregon includes minor surgery techniques. \"Scope of practice\" is specifically defined by legislation in the various states and provinces that license or regulate naturopathic medicine, and practice varies significantly among states, provinces and countries. Botanical Medicine: Many plant substances are powerful medicines. Where isolated, chemically derived drugs may address only a single problem, botanical medicines are able to address a variety of problems simultaneously. When properly administered, most botanical medicines can be applied effectively with minimal chance of side effects. Clinical Nutrition: Food is the best medicine and is a cornerstone of naturopathic practice. Many medical conditions can be treated effectively with foods and nutritional supplementation, with fewer complications and side effects. NDs use diet, fasting and nutritional supplementation in their practices. Homeopathic Medicine: Homeopathic medicine is the treatment of disease/symptoms using correctly prescribed, minimal doses of natural substances (plant, animal, mineral), which, if taken in larger doses, would cause disease/symptoms\u2014the acting principle being \"like cures like.\" It promotes the return to health on physical, mental and spiritual levels.Mind-Body Medicine: Mental attitudes and emotional states may influence or even cause physical illness. Counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management, and other therapies are used to help patients heal psychologically. Minor Surgery: Naturopathic physicians perform in-office minor surgery, including repair of superficial wounds and removal of foreign bodies, cysts and other superficial lesions. Naturopathic Natural Childbirth/Midwifery: T rained and licensed naturopathic physicians facilitate natural childbirth in an out-of-hospital setting. They offer prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care using modern diagnostic techniques combined with ancient midwifery wisdom. NUNM offers an elective course sequence resulting in a Natural Childbirth/Midwifery Certificate that allows students to apply for separate licensure in naturopathic natural childbirth. Pharmaceutical Medicine: While naturally derived pharmaceutical drugs have been within the scope of naturopathic practice in Oregon for decades, legislation now allows naturopathic physicians to use most prescription pharmaceutical agents commonly employed in a primary care setting, effective January 2010. Consistent with our conventional counterparts, and depending on the individual licensing laws of each state, naturopathic physicians may utilize a wide formulary of pharmaceutical medications when deemed appropriate for patient care\u2014and always in consideration of our naturopathic principles. Physical Medicine: Naturopathic medicine utilizes therapeutic manipulation of soft tissue, muscles, bones and spine. NDs also use ultrasound, diathermy, exercise, massage, water, heat and cold, and other gentle electrical therapies in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and pain. Parenteral Therapy: Intravenous and intramuscular injections of micronutrients and macronutrients are used for many purposes, from simple nutritional support to detoxification procedures in cases of exposure, and specific treatment of both chronic and acute diseases. Nature Cure: The use of time-honored natural treatments including fresh air, exercise, whole foods and hydrotherapy are important in the naturopathic treatment and prevention of disease. Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine | nunm.edu 36 Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree program at NUNM is an intensive four-year doctoral program that prepares candidates for national (NPLEX) and state licensing examinations, and the general practice of naturopathic medicine. The core (or required) curriculum provides the foundation and skills necessary for naturopathic general practice. First-year classroom studies include the normal structure and function of the body with a solid introduction to naturopathic theory, philosophy, therapeutics and medical systems. Students enter the clinic in an observational capacity and begin preceptorships in the first year. The second- and third-year didactic curriculum focuses on organ system block courses that integrate all aspects of the normal and abnormally functioning system, including pathophysiology, prevention, evaluation and diagnosis of disease. Therapeutic modalities, including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and other natural and pharmacological methods are woven throughout all organ systems courses. All courses highlight cultural competency, ethics, evidence-informed decision-making, medical jurisprudence, naturopathic philosophy, communication skills and professionalism, while emphasizing a whole-system approach to optimal health and wellness. Second-year clinical experience continues with preceptorships and hydrotherapeutics. After the completion of second-year coursework, students are eligible to sit for the NPLEX Part 1 Biomedical Science exam. The third-year clinical curriculum consists of practical training as a secondary intern in a variety of supervised settings, ranging from community-based clinics to the on-campus medical health center. To advance to secondary status, students must pass a clinical proficiency examination, or OSCE 1 (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). The fourth year is focused on clinical training as a primary intern as well as elective coursework. To attain primary status, students must pass the OSCE 2 exam, with a final OSCE examination required for graduation. Because the program is rigorous and the course load heavy, students may apply to complete the ND degree in five rather than four years. In some cases, students may be required to be in the five-year track. Students may take no more than seven years to complete the ND program. While at NUNM, students may undertake any two programs concurrently (e.g., ND/MSOM, ND/MSiMR, MSOM/MScN, etc.). Contact the Office of Admissions for more information. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine 37 ND Course Descriptions Course codes ending in a \"T\" designate tutorial; course codes ending in an \"L\" designate lab.

Individuals interested in practicing naturopathic midwifery in other areas should contact local governing agencies to inquire about requirements. Students must be in good academic standing and may apply for the program in their third year of the naturopathic medicine program after completing CLS 7310 (Reproductive Systems). Although NUNM does not formally offer a clinical component, the College of Naturopathic Medicine can assist with connecting students with qualified preceptors in the community. Students who are interested in a clinical preceptorship will be interviewed by the preceptor. Unfortunately, due to limited available positions, not all students will be offered a clinical rotation. ND Graduate Medical Education (Residency) Program At the end of their accredited naturopathic medical program, NDs can become licensed for practice once they have successfully passed their NPLEX board exams and have completed state licensure requirements. However, postgraduate education and training is highly encouraged. There are increasing opportunities for further clinical education in the form of naturopathic residencies, and NUNM leads the profession\u2014we developed and administer the first and largest graduate medical education program certified by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Currently, residency placement is a highly competitive process. In addition to earning a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from an accredited institution, candidates must demonstrate professionalism, maturity, commitment to serve, excellent clinical abilities, and an aptitude for enhancing their clinical skills. NUNM is committed to assisting the profession in developing an adequate number of residency opportunities to allow the graduates of all accredited naturopathic degree programs to receive the benefits of graduate medical education.

Why? Because we find the classical approach to be exceptionally interesting and effective. The roots of Chinese Medicine extend back thousands of years\u2014to the wisdom and work of sages who understood that human beings are microcosms of the natural world (the macrocosm). They recognized that everything in the material world, including the human body, is a creation and reflection of a higher dimension of reality. Health and harmony can be achieved by living in accordance with the laws of nature, and in alignment with one's own \"Heavenly Nature.\" Deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature, ancient yangsheng (\"nurturing life\") practitioners learned to read the map of that higher reality (the Dao ) as it imprinted in (literally \"in-formed\") the physical realm. The symptoms of disease were not seen as errors to be eradicated, but were instead read as signals of a disharmony that could be resolved to regain the experience of wholeness.It is of immeasurable benefit to the profession that we still have access to the wisdom of the ancients through works referred to as the \"classical texts\" of Chinese medicine. While some consider these texts to be curious museum- worthy artifacts, classically oriented practitioners recognize and honor them as key resources in the essential quest of unlocking the secrets of true health and happiness. But the texts are not easy to decipher\u2014the journey requires a steadfast seriousness of purpose. The combinations of classical Chinese characters comprising these works are rich, etymological word fields having many layers of symbolic meaning. Discerning the depth of meaning contained in even a short passage can require the rhythmic interplay of scholarly inquiry, contemplative practice and ultimately, the illumination of one's direct clinical experience. Therefore, even excellent scholarly translations capture only a fraction of the richness contained in the original language. This is why it is extremely valuable to study with faculty having expertise in the texts, and (if one has the passion for it) to develop one's own capacity to enter the texts directly through the original classical characters. The texts become a doorway to a vast trove of timeless wisdom and knowledge. College of Classical Chinese Medicine The Classical Approach at NUNM Heiner Fruehauf, PhD, LAc, was pursuing scholarship in Sinology (the study of Chinese language, literature and history) when he entered the profession of Chinese medicine through the doorway of his own health challenges. An essential feature of his medical education was lineage-style apprenticeship with renowned experts in Daoist and classical Chinese medicine. When hired by NUNM in 1992, Dr. Fruehauf's mission of developing a unique offering in Chinese medicine was inspired and informed by discussions with his Chinese mentors. Their vision continues to attract a group of like-minded scholar-practitioners from across Asia and the West who are committed to training students excited to explore and embody the richness and power of the classical approach to Chinese medicine. Many have access to knowledge that is not typically taught in any Western language. NUNM offers two CCM programs\u2014the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM). The MSOM is fully nested within the DSOM, with the latter having an additional 48 credits and 582 hours. Students in both programs gain a strong classical orientation to the medicine. A primary goal of the DSOM program is to set graduates firmly on the path of the scholar-practitioner, capable of uncovering ancient knowledge and integrating it into modern-day clinical practice. In addition to learning to read and translate the classical texts, DSOM students gain a more complete understanding of the philosophical, historical and cultural context of the medical texts, and later developments in Chinese medicine based upon these texts. The doctoral curriculum also prepares graduates to more fully embody the knowledge, skills and behaviors required for classical Chinese medicine practitioners to integrate, communicate and collaborate within the biomedicine-based healthcare system.The College of Classical Chinese Medicine is committed to transmitting the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine to cultivate clinical practitioners rooted in the ancient tradition of the medical scholar.College of Classical Chinese Medicine | nunm.edu 58 Overview of the CCM Programs The following provides a year-by-year tour through the CCM programs. All information applies to both the MSOM and DSOM; content that is specific to the DSOM program is noted. Year One: Immersion in the Way of Classical Chinese Medicine Theory/Knowledge Students learn the fundamental theory and principles of Chinese medicine, and become familiar with the historical, philosophical and cultural context in which the many streams of Chinese medicine arose in mainland China. Having gained a solid introduction to the classical roots of the medicine, students then examine the origins and potential strengths and limitations of the modern TCM approach. DSOM: Students receive more extensive training in the historical, philosophical and cultural context of many of the major classical texts of Chinese medicine Skills Students become adept at point location and begin to practice freehand needle insertion. They practice musculoskeletal/myofascial palpation, and begin their training in Chinese medicine diagnostic techniques, including tongue and pulse diagnosis. Students also gain fluency in sensing the flavor, nature and movement of individual Chinese herbs and herb combinations, and develop critical thinking and research literacy skills. Cultivation Students begin a series of nine weekly qigong practicums and weekend retreats, held in ancient forest, mountain and hot springs settings. In these courses, students refine their awareness of qi flow by engaging in the \"nourishing life\" practices of the Jinjing Gong lineage, one of China's authentic alchemical life science traditions. Recognizing that development into a thriving business person is an integral element of cultivation, the business series of courses starts in the first quarter of the program. The goal of this series is to equip students with the knowledge, skills and resources needed to conceptualize, start-up and successfully manage a profitable practice that is personally and professionally rewarding. DSOM: A key component of cultivation training in the DSOM curriculum starts in the first year with the classical texts series of courses. Through the study and acquisition of the classical Chinese language, students develop a form of cognitive capacity that transcends Western rational, dualistic thought. The goal is to engage a way of knowing that will enrich each clinical encounter and enhance clinical outcomes. Another key feature of the DSOM program is a series entitled \"Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries\" (IEI) that is threaded throughout every quarter of the curriculum. These courses have a small group format and emphasize reflective learning, appreciative inquiry, and self-awareness exercises to promote each student's personal engagement with the curriculum and to support their professional development. Through the process, students choose and hone their doctoral capstone topics. In year one of the IEI series, the resources, challenges and unique perspective of each student are explored. A first-year theme is the role of metaphor in medicine, in particular how it relates to Eastern versus Western perspectives on the body. Biomedicine The first-year curriculum has very little emphasis on biomedicine. The goal is to immerse students in the language of Chinese medicine without promoting the natural tendency to translate new learning into the more familiar framework of biomedicine. Clinic In the spring quarter, students are introduced to the practical and philosophical fundamentals of working in the NUNM health centers. Year Two: Exploring How it All Comes Together\u2014Embodiment and Integration Theory/Knowledge Students study classical models of human pathology and expand their knowledge of acupuncture prescription and Chinese herbal formulation. They deepen their understanding of CCM as a macrocosm/microcosm 2017-2018 Course Catalog | College of Classical Chinese Medicine 59 symbol science as they explore the cosmology and symbolism associated with the 12 Chinese organ networks. Skills Students continue to build their hand skills through the acquisition and practice of bodywork and acupuncture tonification and dispersion techniques. They are introduced to the art of medicinal food preparation, and to classical methods of herb processing. Cultivation The qigong and business series continue, and a practitioner cultivation course promotes self-reflection and increased awareness of personal resources and challenges. DSOM: In the second year of the classical texts series, students translate the Shanghanlun and Jingui Yaol\u00fce . The information gleaned from the texts supports the concurrent study of pathology and herbal formulation. The theme of the second-year IEI series is \"awareness of awareness.\" Biomedicine The biomedicine series starts in the second year. The foundation gained in the first year of the program provides students with the background needed to integrate biomedical knowledge into the more expansive framework of CCM. This approach is in conscious contrast to the modern trend of interpreting Chinese medicine from within the material confines of the biomedical perspective. The College of Classical Chinese Medicine believes that the brilliance of biomedicine is most powerfully applied within the context of whole-systems science, and that Chinese medicine can truly flourish only when understood and applied according to its own precepts and tenets. Clinic Students enter the clinic in the second year as they observe seasoned clinical faculty diagnose and treat patients using individual lineage styles of practice. Year Three: Refining Clinical Skills and Developing a Medical Mind Theory The third year is devoted to the advancement of clinical reasoning. Incorporating modern and classical case analysis, students learn to compare and integrate biomedical, TCM and classical approaches to patient diagnosis and treatment. DSOM: Third-year students gain a deeper functional understanding of the acupuncture channels by studying the symbolic meaning of the acupuncture point names. They also study the symbolic meaning of herb names. Skills Students hone their palpation, perception and clinical reasoning skills, with a focus on applying them to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In addition to learning advanced manual and needling techniques, students practice adjunctive acu-moxa modalities, including moxibustion, cupping, guasha, bleeding and teishin. The refinement of clinical skills includes the use of microsystems in diagnosis and treatment. It also includes standard physical examination and assessment methods from the biomedical approach. Cultivation The qigong series concludes with an emphasis on clinical application, and the business series continues with an emphasis on marketing and business systems. A two-course series explores the classical understanding of what in the West is characterized as psychological dysfunction, including the role of the emotions in chronic disease. These courses encourage the exploration and understanding of one's own self-limiting patterns. DSOM: In the third year of the classical texts series, students translate portions of the Huangdi Neijing , with an emphasis on clinical application of the knowledge gleaned from this seminal text of Chinese medicine. The theme of the third-year IEI series is \"developing a medical mind.\" Biomedicine As the biomedicine series continues, the Western approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease is compared to, and integrated with, TCM and CCM approaches. The third year includes courses on the biomedical under- standing of nutrition and public health. Clinic The third-year clinical rotations enhance the confidence and competence of students in preparation for the internship phase of training. In the clinical mentoring rotations, students engage directly in the intake and treatment of patients under the complete guidance of their clinical supervisor. In a spring quarter pre-internship rotation, students become familiar with the process and responsibilities of being an intern by shadowing and supporting the interns who are about to graduate. College of Classical Chinese Medicine | nunm.edu 60 Year Four: Becoming a CCM Practitioner Theory/Skills In the fourth year, students undertake one of the signature features of the program\u2014a yearlong Traditional Mentorship Tutorial (TMT) series. The small-group, apprentice-style format of this unique offering affords students the opportunity to absorb the lineage system of their chosen mentor. Many students elect to do more than one TMT series. Review courses help prepare students for the national board exams. The herbs review course is combined with training that prepares soon-to-be graduates with the knowledge and skills required to run a successful herbal medicinary. Cultivation Qi cultivation continues in the fourth year with three taiji practicums. The second of two practitioner cultivation courses focuses on relationship dynamics between the practitioner and patient. The final course in the business series prepares students to be successful, fulfilled and ethically/legally upright with regard to the business and practice management aspects of their professional life. DSOM: Students receive additional training in systems- based medicine, providing an understanding of the broader healthcare system necessary to coordinate care within this system, and to collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary healthcare setting. The theme of the fourth-year IEI series is \"the courage to be vulnerable.\" The IEI series, Doctoral Capstone Tutorial, and Doctoral Capstone Mentorship (run by the chair of the student's capstone committee) support students through the completion of the three parts of their doctoral capstone project: a written report, an oral presentation and a professional practice vision statement. Biomedicine DSOM: To ensure that DSOM graduates are prepared to communicate effectively with providers in the broader biomedically based healthcare system, they complete cutting-edge coursework exploring the relationship between Chinese medicine and biomedicine models of understanding the pathological basis, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Clinic During the final year of study, students step into the role of intern and assume an increasing level of responsibility 2017-2018 Course Catalog | College of Classical Chinese Medicine 61 for the diagnosis and treatment of patients under the expert supervision of clinical faculty. Through an application process, each intern is paired with a clinical faculty mentor, with whom they experience at least one internship rotation per quarter throughout the final year. This provides students continuity of training in their resonant style of practice and long-term management of patient cases. DSOM: In addition to participating in one or more primary care teams with naturopathic physicians at NUNM's multidisciplinary campus health center, DSOM interns have the opportunity to complete one or more rotations at NUNM's multidisciplinary community clinic sites (e.g., the Richmond Clinic at Oregon Health & Science University and the Integrative Medicine Program at Providence Hospital Cancer Center). Electives MSOM and DSOM students are required to complete 6 and 10 elective credits, respectively, for the purpose of rounding out their education.

Through increased self-awareness, students learn to identify personal challenges, as well as potential professional challenges. They are encouraged to explore the steps they can take while in school and beyond to strengthen their character and undertake the lifelong pursuit of becoming a mature medical practitioner. Discussion, reflection, individual and group awareness exercises, and writing projects are employed. CM 815 - Practitioner Cultivation II (1 lecture credit and 0.5 lab credit)This course focuses on relationship dynamics between the practitioner and patient with a strong emphasis on listening, connection, communication, boundary definition, and understanding transference/counter transference. The primary tools of exploration are discussion, lecture, case-study, role-play, mind-body exercises, self-reflection and writing. Prerequisites: CM 635 and intern statusMaster of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine | nunm.edu 72 CM 715, 725 - Chinese Medical Psychology I & II (2 lecture credits each)These courses offer an introduction to Chinese medical systems of five-phase element healing. From a general perspective, an in-depth analysis of the \"spirits\" and pathological emotions associated with each organ network is presented. Multiple models are employed, including Neijing perspectives on Dian-Kuang disease, the Dragon Rises, Red Bird Flies model of Dr. Leon Hammer, the Wang Fengyi system of Confucian therapeutics, and Eight Extraordinary Vessel approaches to psychological conditions. Emphasis is placed on the practical application of therapeutic techniques (including herbal prescriptions) that facilitate physical and emotional healing. Prerequisite: third-year status Elective: CM 16E - Five-Element Wilderness Retreat (1.5 lecture credits)This wilderness-based course facilitates the practitioner's journey toward a deeper connection to nature, including a deeper connection to each other, as well as the hidden layers of one's own healing potential. More specifically, this course presents an immersion in the natural manifestations of the five-phase elements. In a retreat format, participants cultivate their sensitivity toward the natural world and experience natural manifestations of the phase elements and selected acu-moxa points. Energetic practices, including art, poetry, group sharing and personal reflection are landmarks of this process. Elective: CM 26E - Shan Ren Dao Retreat (4 lab credits) In this two-week retreat, students are immersed in the theory and practice of the healing system created by the modern Confucian educator Wang Fengyi (1864-1937). This system remains the most complete emotional healing system of Chinese medicine still in practice today. The goal of the retreat is for participants to experience the abstract Confucian concept of humanity's \"true nature\" by achieving a heightened sense of health, happiness and well-being through the process of moderating negative emotions and restoring the inherently positive qualities of our human mandate. Physical Medicine CM 515, 525, 535 - Palpation and Perception I-III Practicum(1 lab credit each)Through supervised hands-on experience, students develop the ability to sense and palpate the physical and energetic bodies. Students become familiar with internal and external anatomical landmarks, and practice palpating the mobility and motility of various body fluids and tissues, including bone, connective tissue and organs. The process of evaluating lesion patterns from a whole-body perspective is also explored. These courses cultivate hand-skill perception and prepare students for bodywork and acu-moxa techniques courses. Prerequisite: these courses are to be taken in the ordered sequenceCM 615 - Asian Bodywork (1 lecture credit and 0.5 lab credit)Students learn key massage and bodywork strategies to treat a variety of conditions, with a focus on the resolution of pain. Topics include assessment, patient communication and strategic thinking. Students practice the techniques of rocking, stretching, palming and percussion. Also covered are gentle movement techniques to be done with patients. Prerequisite: second-year status CM 735 - Applied Palpation and Perception (1 lecture credit and 0.5 lab credit)Students learn key assessment, bodywork, acupuncture, and adjunctive therapy techniques and strategies to treat a variety of conditions, primarily physical pain. The course also covers patient communication and strategic thinking. Gentle movement techniques learned in the Palpation and Perception series and Asian Bodywork are revisited with a focus on clinical application. Prerequisites: CM 535, 615 Shiatsu Acupressure Massage The shiatsu series presents a thorough grounding in the principles and style of Asian bodywork, the energetic anatomy upon which it is based, and the fundamentals of touching with quality. Students learn a variety of techniques and maneuvers in the context of a complete, full-body massage. This style of shiatsu is highly effective and enjoyable to give as well as receive. Though shiatsu is a Japanese word and massage tradition, it derives from Chinese sources and is based on the same theories and principles that have influenced the entire pan-Asian approach to medicine. Shiatsu I-III can be taken early in the Chinese medicine program to more fully prepare students for what they learn in the Points and Techniques series. These courses present shiatsu as a holistic massage focusing on wellness, and do not require the ability to diagnose in order to be effective. Shiatsu is a complete modality on its own, but also trains the student in the art of palpation and general sensitivity, which is useful in all aspects of a medical practice. Elective: CM 15E - Shiatsu I, Back of the Body (1.5 lab credits) This introductory course presents two of the cornerstones of Asian/Japanese massage, shiatsu and Do-In [a self- massage routine ( in Chinese)]. Neither massage uses oil nor requires disrobing. This course presents traditional Asian style massage on a table and teaches the back half of the body. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to perform. An emphasis is placed on learning the proper alignment and body position for the practitioner, and on memorizing and internalizing the sequence (kata/form) of the massage. Students are exposed to the energetic, theoretical and technical aspects of shiatsu. Theory focuses on learning the channel pathways. Instruction emphasizes kinesthetic learning, alternating between demonstration and practice. Open to all NUNM students.2017-2018 Course Catalog | Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine 73 Elective: CM 25E - Shiatsu II Short Form, Front of the Body (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu II teaches the second half of the short form. In terms of the kata, it covers the front of the body. The front of the body also takes about 45 minutes to do. This course continues the Do-In (Dao-Yin ) training with an emphasis on being able to teach it to others. The last part of the course combines the back of the body from Shiatsu I with the front learned in this term to complete the 'short form.' The whole shiatsu short form takes about an hour and a half to perform and constitutes a very thorough and satisfying massage for both the giver and the receiver. Prerequisite: CM 15E Elective: CM 35E - Shiatsu III Short (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu III, the short-form practicum, integrates the material learned in Shiatsu I and II. In a mock clinical approach to classroom learning, students bring a different volunteer client to class each week to give them a shiatsu massage. The instructor circulates and provides individualized feedback during each session. The short form constitutes the basic framework for the clinical practice of shiatsu, and by the end of the term the student should be capable of performing it professionally in about an hour and a quarter. Prerequisite: CM 25E Elective: CM 45E - Shiatsu IV Long Form, Back of the Body (1.5 lab credits)The long form builds on the short form learned in the first year and introduces new techniques. Specifically, stretching maneuvers for all the major joints of the body, along with more specific pressing of acu-points, are integrated into the massage. Pertaining to the self-cultivation aspect of the training, another Dao-Yin form is presented. Students learn a comprehensive series of stretches (much like yoga) for the practitioner, both as preparation to give as well as receive the shiatsu stretches, but also to generally open and strengthen the practitioner's body. Intimate knowledge of these stretches also constitutes the basis for the use of stretches as a prescription for clients. Prerequisite: CM 35E Elective: CM 55E - Shiatsu V Long Form, Front of the Body (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu V covers the long-form kata for the front half of the body. This course completes the very thorough whole-body treatment, which takes two to three hours to perform. Again, stretches and specific point work are integrated into the kata. Useful for both assessment and treatment, the long form is a comprehensive and satisfying massage. Prerequisite: CM 45E Elective: CM 65E - Shiatsu VI Long Form, Integration Practicum (1.5 lab credits)Shiatsu VI is the long-form practicum. Students bring a volunteer client into the classroom to perform a long-form treatment on them. The instructor circulates providing guidance and feedback. Students work on solving their technical difficulties, generally refine their massage technique, and hone their theoretical understanding, while developing their capacity to relate to their clients and discuss shiatsu in a professional manner. Some diagnostic palpation is practiced focusing on shu and mu points. Opportunities for improvisation from amongst the myriad of techniques become necessary to keep the treatment to a reasonable length of time. These processes train the student to tailor their treatments in real-world settings to their clients' individual needs and limits within the context of the shiatsu kata, while the kata provides the basis for a consistent product/service that ensures continuity between sessions and across providers. Prerequisite: CM 55E Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine | nunm.edu 74 Research *CM 992 - Doctoral Capstone Tutorial: Research and Writing in Chinese Medicine (1 lecture credit)This course, taken in the summer of the final year of the DSOM program, provides training in CCM scholarship and prepares students to complete the required doctoral capstone project. It assures that students are well acquainted with the three components of the capstone project (written report, oral presentation and professional growth). Students refine the focus of their project, which may be on any approved topic pertinent to classical Chinese medicine. By the end of the course, students will have produced an abstract and a preliminary outline for their project report and chosen a capstone project committee, which will guide them in the completion of the project. Details of the process and requirements are described in the \"Doctoral Capstone Project Handbook\" provided in the course. Prerequisite: fourth-year standing *CM 993 - Doctoral Capstone Mentorship (2 lecture credits) Over the course of their final year in the program, students are mentored by their committee chair to research, write and present their doctoral capstone project. Prerequisite: CM 992Traditional Arts of Cultivation Chinese Cultural Arts: Chinese Calligraphy Chinese calligraphy is an ancient and elegant art form that originated with the ancient Chinese shamans known as the Wu. Calligraphy is the traditional Wu's way of accessing the universal qi for healing and creating harmonizing feng shui energy. Shamans have used brushes to express their healing power for thousands of years in China. Calligraphy is still used as a tool for cultivating inner knowledge and to understand the roots of classical Chinese medicine. Elective: CM 13E - Chinese Calligraphy I (1 lab credit) Students first learn how to use the basic tools of calligraphy, namely brush, ink and paper. Progressing through the basic strokes of Chinese writing to the writing of specifically chosen characters, this process is designed to facilitate their understanding of the relationship between characters, philosophy and universal qi. In the process, students learn to harness and control their own internal qi. Open to all NUNM students. Elective: CM 23E - Chinese Calligraphy II (1 lab credit) Students learn new symbols and continue the inner cultivation begun in Chinese Calligraphy I. Prerequisite: CM 13E Elective: CM 33E - Weiqi (1 lab credit) Students learn the history, philosophy and principles of weiqi (Chinese chess, also known as \"Go\"). This course develops the critical thinking skills of students as they learn to apply the strategies and techniques of the game to the art of treating disease. Elective: CM 43E - Introduction to Chinese Tea (0.5 lab credit) In this two-day retreat, students are introduced to using Chinese tea in service of healing and self-cultivation, and understanding the energetics of tea. Students learn the six classes of teas in the world and how to brew each type. Qigong Qigong literally means \"energy work\" or \"energy cultivation.\" Personal experience of, awareness of, and sensitivity to qi are considered imperative to the successful practice of classical Chinese medicine. In a series of nine weekend retreats and sets of weekly practice sessions, students are immersed in the fundamentals of the Jinjing (Tendon and Channel) School of Qigong, one of China's true alchemical life science traditions. By way of traditional lineage instruction, students experience the elements of a deeply nourishing qigong practice and learn to apply their skills and knowledge to the education and treatment of others. In particular, students learn to prescribe individualized qigong treatment plans for patients. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine 75 CM 518 - Qigong I Retreat | CM 519 - Qigong I Practicum (0.5 lab credit and 1.5 lecture credits)The first qigong module explores the alchemical and shamanic origins of qigong theory and practice. Students are introduced to the fundamentals of the Jinjing School of Qigong, including shaking (tou), walking (zou), and quiet meditation or \"settling\" (ding). A key element of this course is the practice of the Universe Stance (Yuzhou Zhuang) or Standing Meditation (Zhan Zhuang)\u2014the position that occupies a central role in most qigong traditions. A sitting \"internal alchemy\" form (neidan) is also emphasized. Through these practices, students are guided to experience the phenomenon of qi in their bodies as well as in nature. CM 528 - Qigong II Retreat | CM 529 - Qigong II Practicum (0.5 lab credit and 1.5 lecture credits)In addition to strengthening and deepening the practices learned in the first module, students learn the first eight-segment long form of the Jinjing School of Qigong, namely Yin Yang Harmonization Qigong (Yin Yang Sheng Jiang Kai He Gong).

Prerequisite: completion of Qigong I-IX Retreats and Qigong I-IX Practica Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine | nunm.edu 76 Taiji Taiji Quan (T'ai Chi Ch'uan) literally means \"the very pinnacle, highest, or greatest fist,\" i.e., martial art. A more useful translation might be \"the ultimate exercise.\" Its precisely choreographed movements create a relaxing mind-body dance that stretches and strengthens the entire body. Its slow, deliberate moves develop balance and grace. Its meditative style facilitates harmonious breathing and a focused mind. It is, in short, meditation in motion. There are many variations within the world of taiji. Yang style taiji is the most commonly practiced style in both China and the U.S. Within styles there are various practice lengths, loosely divided into long and short forms. Here, the focus is on a long form. This form takes around 30-40 minutes to perform and thus also takes some time to learn. The three sections of the long form are divided neatly into the three terms of the academic year. Thus, the first year of study is devoted to learning the sequence of moves along with the principles of movement that accompany them, and an inward-looking focus that emphasizes the cultivation of qi within the student. From a Chinese medical perspective, taiji harmonizes the \"three treasures,\" jing, qi and shen (essence, energy and spirit). Each class includes specially designed warmup exercises, qigong, and detailed instruction in the form. The first year of study focuses on learning the sequence of movements and the correct way of doing each move. Taiji I is required in the fourth year of the CCM programs. However, students are encouraged to take it sooner if they wish to take full advantage of the taiji elective series. The taiji courses are open to all NUNM students. CM 819, 829, 839 - Taiji I-III Practicum (1.5 lecture credits each) The first section, which is the subject of Taiji I, teaches all the basic moves and principles and thus constitutes an effective short form that can be practiced on its own. Subsequent courses build on the foundation, emphasizing deepening awareness through the practice of the form. At NUNM, our instructors focus more on the health and spiritual cultivation attributes of taiji as opposed to its martial arts aspects. In this context, these courses are effective and enjoyable for anyone who enjoys movement arts or exercise. At the same time taiji is very meditative, one of the reasons people like to practice taiji, and indeed many find this moving meditation preferable to sitting meditation. Prerequisite: these courses are to be taken in the ordered sequence Elective: CM 14E, 24E, 34E - Taiji IV-VI Practicum (1.5 lecture credits each)The second year of taiji consists of elective classes that pick up at the completion of the long-form sequence and focus on practicing the taiji quan. Having learned the sequence of moves, the next steps have to do with refining and perfecting the form through practice over time. Each term, and indeed each class, focuses on a different aspect of practice until the form is thoroughly integrated and the student is confident in the ability to practice alone.Prerequisites: CM 839 for CM 14E; these courses are to be taken in the ordered sequence Elective: CM 44E - Taiji Retreat (0.5 lab credit)In this weekend retreat, students are introduced to the history, principles and practice of taiji. A classical approach is used to enable students to understand and experience that taiji is a healing tool capable of playing a critical role in the prevention of disease and the nourishment of life. Traditional Mentorship Tutorial CM 812, 822, 832 - Traditional Mentorship Tutorial I-III (2 lecture credits each)A hallmark of the CCM programs, the tutorial classes are designed to facilitate direct and personal contact between students and instructors, and thereby the culture and lineage system of a classical Chinese medicine education. Topics are discussed from the unique perspective of the mentor's own path of learning and knowledge integration. This series is required in the internship year of study. Prerequisite: these courses are designed to be taken in sequence Elective: CM 12E, 22E, 32E - Traditional Mentorship Tutorial I-III (2 lecture credits each)Students take the CM 812, 822 and 832 Traditional Mentorship Tutorial series in the final year of their program.

Prerequisite: these courses are designed to be taken in sequence Elective Requirement MSOM and DSOM students are required to take 6 and 10 credits of elective courses as part of their core program, respectively. Clinical Training Overview The clinical training objectives of the CCM programs are aligned with the overall mission of training competent practitioners in the art and science of classical Chinese medicine. The clinical aspect is expected to be a refinement of the knowledge base acquired in the academic portion of the program, with the implicit understanding that many important skills can only be attained in the applied context of a practical learning situation. These skills include, but 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine 77 Clinical Training The components of the clinical portion of the program are Introduction to Clinic, Clinical Observation, Clinical Mentoring, Clinical Pre-Internship, Clinical Case Presentation, Clinical Internship, and Internship Case Presentation.

In addition, students must pass all components of the Clinic Entrance Examination. An Internship orientation is required before beginning the Internship rotations. Students are gradually led through the clinical experience in a sequential fashion, from active observation to being able to conduct a comprehensive patient intake and treatment protocol. In the spirit of the classics, emphasis is placed on recognition of Chinese syndrome pattern differentiation (rather than symptomatic prescribing), with the goal of creating individual treatment plans designed to assist patients in returning to a more harmonious and balanced state. Training in how to write a case report (using the CARE Guidelines) is woven through all four years of the clinical education. In order to complete the clinical portion of their program, students must pass the Clinic Exit Examination.Master of Science and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine | nunm.edu 78 CM 530 - Introduction to Clinic (0.75 clinic credit) This course introduces students to the fundamentals of working in the NUNM clinics. Topics include clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards, charting, patient confidentiality, patient-practitioner relations, issues surrounding addiction and chemical dependency, and cultural humility. The course prepares students to begin observing treatments with a focus on the material and nonmaterial changes that take place throughout treatment, and to support the supervisor efficiently and effectively. CM 600 - Clinical Observation I-III (2 clinic credits each) Clinical observation is a forum in which five observers watch the clinical supervisor in session with a client. While observing, the objective is to absorb as much of the method and process of clinical practice as possible. Students practice creating patient timelines for case reports. Prerequisites: students must be CPR certified, have passed the CNT course, and have completed CM 530 CM 700 - Clinical Mentoring Rotation I-VI (2 clinic credits each) Clinical mentoring rotations have the same structure as the clinical observation rotations, with the addition that students become more directly involved in the patient intake, diagnosis and treatment, under the direct guidance of their clinical supervisor. Students learn to gather the information needed to create a meaningful case report. CM 710, 720, 730 - Clinical Case Presentation I-III (1 clinic credit each)The clinical case presentation series provides a forum for students to apply and integrate the concepts and information learned in their academic courses to clinical scenarios encountered during their clinical mentoring rotations. Prerequisite: third-year status CM 770 - Pre-Internship Rotation (2 clinic credits)In the pre-internship rotation, students pair with interns as they prepare to assume this role. Prerequisite: completion of at least two clinical mentoring rotationsCM 800 - Clinical Internship Rotation I-III (2 clinic credits each)During clinical internship, the student assumes primary responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of clients under the supervision of experienced practitioners. In the first quarter of clinical internship, interns are paired and every needle insertion is directly supervised. Prerequisite: students must be CPR certified CM 800 - Clinical Internship Rotation IV-IX (2 clinic credits each) During clinical internship, the student assumes primary responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of clients under the supervision of experienced practitioners. By the end of the year, students have produced a case report based on their own patient encounters. Prerequisite: students must be CPR certified Clinical Internship Holiday Requirement (no credit assignment) Students are required to do 24 hours (six individual shifts) of clinical internship during designated holiday periods. CM 810, 820, 830 - Internship Case Presentation I-III (1 clinic credit each)In this clinical course series, interns present case histories of chosen clients, and receive feedback and critique by fellow interns and a clinical faculty member. Prerequisite: intern status Classical Chinese Medicine Certificate Programs Students in the CCM programs, who meet the prerequisites and are in good academic standing, are eligible to apply for admission into the Qigong and Shiatsu Certificate programs. Due to space constraints, admission is limited. These are not degree programs and do not lead to eligibility to sit for licensure exams. Contact the Office of Admissions for further information. Qigong Teaching Certificate Program The Qigong Teaching Certificate program is taught once the student has completed all of the required Qigong Practicum and Retreat courses in the core program. Over the subsequent year, the student completes the Qigong I-III Teaching Practica, during which they progress from observing qigong instruction of NUNM patients and students, to teaching her/his own qigong classes. Shiatsu Certificate Program The Shiatsu Certificate program consists of six courses (204 hours) taken over two years, and the completion of two terms of performing shiatsu treatments in one of the NUNM Health Centers. This certificate program is designed to be pursued concurrently with the DSOM or MSOM programs. At the end of the certificate program, students will be fully prepared to use shiatsu as an independent treatment modality. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | MSOM Four-Year Curriculum 79 MSOM Four-Year Curriculum COURSE #

General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine . Geneva, Switzerland. 2000.) Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) \"The terms 'complementary medicine' or 'alternative medicine' are used inter-changeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.\" (From: World Health Organization. General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine . Geneva, Switzerland. 2000.) Integrative Health \"Integrative health is a state of well-being in body, mind and spirit that reflects aspects of the individual, community and population. It is affected by: 1) Individual biological factors and behaviors, social values, and public policy, 2) The physical, social, and economic environments, and 3) An integrative healthcare system that involves the active participation of the individual and the healthcare team in applying a broad spectrum of preventive and therapeutic approaches. Integrative health encourages individuals, social groups, and communities to develop ways of living that promote meaning, resilience and wellbeing across the life course.\" (From: Witt CM, Chiaramonte D, Berman S, et al.

This new and expanding model of care incorporates complementary therapies, such as nutrition, mind-body medicine and somatic therapies, with the best of conventional treatments. The Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH) degree combines integrative medicine and mental healthcare training for a truly unique, multidisciplinary and collaborative learning experience. This holistic approach to mental health provides students with concrete skills in biopsychosocial assessment, evaluation, diagnosis, and integrative and conventional therapies. The experiential curriculum is designed to enhance self-awareness and facilitate self-exploration. Candidates should be prepared to explore their own personal psyche, to be vulnerable with their peers and instructors, and to use their own psychological material for learning how to work with clients. Several courses are delivered in a weekend format, allowing sufficient time and a safe space for deep exploration and processing. Students explore how their personal identity as a healthcare professional is shaped by what they learn about themselves. Throughout this process, students have ample opportunity to practice new psychotherapeutic techniques as they support one another in self-exploration. Group supervision is built into the program, and students work closely with mentors to conceptualize and manage cases, practice skills, and continually reflect on their own experience and growth as a practitioner. Graduates will be equipped to address the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health disorders from an integrative medicine perspective. Because the MSiMH degree does not qualify students to sit for licensing exams as a professional counselor, candidates must be concurrently enrolled in a clinical degree program at NUNM that will provide them with a degree or license to work with patients in a medical context (ND, MSOM or DSOM). The MSiMH program is designed to provide students with additional training in mental health disorders and psychotherapeutic approaches to healing, and graduates will be prepared to more effectively address mental health care within the scope of their individual licenses. Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health The mission of the integrative mental health program is to train practitioners in the biological, psychological, social and cultural foundations of mental and emotional health. The program strongly emphasizes the use of applied mindfulness; the cultivation of interpersonal therapeutic presence; and the application of natural medicines and interventions for an innovative and holistic approach to prevention, personal growth and treatment. Program Outcomes and Competencies Students in the MSiMH program will be prepared to meet the following program outcomes and competencies: 1.

All elective courses are scheduled based on faculty availability and adequate student enrollment.electives2017-2018 Course Catalog | Master of Science in Nutrition 117 It's becoming widely understood that nutrition plays a significant role in health and disease. The old adage \"you are what you eat\" has never been more true. The Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN) degree program focuses on diets that are based on whole, unprocessed foods and integrates nutritional biochemistry and pathophysiology with advanced clinical nutrition knowledge. An active-learning curriculum provides a solid foundation in holistic nutrition and food systems, complemented by skill-training in cooking, teaching and nutritional counseling. Nutrition is a dynamic science with new research findings constantly being published. As we continue to learn about the complex relationship between food and human metabolism, there is no argument that whole and minimally processed foods are better for reducing disease risk. Fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds provide us with many beneficial nutrients beyond vitamins and minerals. However, each individual also has their own unique nutritional needs. No one diet is right for everyone. Focusing on each person as an individual allows for variation of dietary needs that provide the best nutritional support possible. Nutrition books are top-sellers, demonstrating that the public wants more information about nutrition. Simultaneously, obesity is at an all-time high and chronic disease continues to rise. This paradox demonstrates that nutrition knowledge is not translating to individuals' ability to make dietary changes. People need help and support to make significant behavioral changes. In order to make nutrition accessible to every individual in every community, we need a nutritional philosophy that embraces cultural preferences. We need to treat food as medicine. The Master of Science in Nutrition program at NUNM prepares its graduates for a variety of settings, including health coaching and nutritional counseling, nutrition research, serving on integrative healthcare teams, being a personal chef and professional food service consultant, and involvement in community nutrition educational programs. Master of Science in Nutrition The mission of the Master of Science in Nutrition program is to advocate for healthy lifestyles by increasing awareness of how food and nutrients impact human health and disease, and to respect diverse nutritional needs, dietary patterns, and food preferences.Master of Science in Nutrition | nunm.edu 118 Program Tracks One Year This is the standard program track, beginning in the fall term and ending in the summer.

A non-degree seeking student is someone who has not matriculated into a degree program at NUNM. Students who have matriculated into a degree program and have taken a leave from their primary program may not take courses as a non-degree student. Non-degree seeking students must complete a \"Non- Degree Seeking\" application, which is available through the Office of Admissions. Approval is based upon space availability and meeting prerequisite requirements. Practitioners seeking continuing education units (CEUs) should contact the Office of Advancement. Credit Hour Policy Credits are awarded based upon hours of instruction. NUNM is on a quarter system. A quarter is defined as 12 weeks (summer quarter is 11 weeks). Credits for coursework are awarded according to the following: 1 lecture credit = 12 hours instruction per quarter + 24 hours per quarter outside of class time1 laboratory credit = 24 hours instruction per quarter + 12 hours per quarter outside of class time1 clinical credit = 24 hours instruction per quarter + 12 hours per quarter outside of class time1 tutorial credit = 12 hours of instruction per quarter + 24 hours per quarter outside of class timeCredit hours will not be adjusted if individual students utilize more or less study time as listed above, and will be held responsible for knowing all material. Students who feel they require additional study time should seek resources from the Center for Academic Success. Challenge Examinations - Graduate Level Only NUNM policy allows an individual to challenge by examination the content of a required course. Applicants who have been accepted may request to challenge a course prior to matriculation. This option is only available to students who have appropriately documented prior graduate coursework and there is a question as to whether or not the information covered sufficiently meets NUNM requirements. Transfer credit policies and course descriptions are outlined in the university catalog and are available from the Office of Admissions. There must be a difference in hours between a transfer course and the university's course and/or a question of equivalency of material covered in order for a challenge exam to be given. After the challenge exam has been administered, the grade is recorded and the student is notified of the results. If the student fails the exam, they must register for the course and pay the appropriate tuition. To be considered for a challenge exam, the student must: Complete transfer credit review during the admissions process to identify which courses may be eligible for challenge. Students who are applying for transfer credit reviews must sign the \"NUNM Transfer of Credit Agreement\" form upon admission to the university. Transfer credits will not be considered after matriculation. Submit a \"Transfer/Challenge Exam\" form (obtained from the registrar) to the program dean and the instructor (to which the challenge exam is related) for approval. Once permission is obtained, the program dean (or designee) will facilitate arrangements for the student to take the challenge exam. Pay the appropriate fees and submit an \"Exam\" form, located in the Faculty Support Office, to the instructor before taking the exam. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Take the challenge exam prior to the offering of the course that is being challenged; the exam must be taken, graded, and the grade submitted to the registrar no fewer than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter in which the course is offered.Academic Policies | nunm.edu 162 The following statement is for veteran students inquiring about prior credit: Any veteran receiving GI Bill\u00ae benefits while attending NUNM is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA school official (located in the Registrar's Office) for review of prior credit. Auditing Students may audit a lecture course, space allowing, if they have met the prerequisites, have obtained the instructor's signature, and have registered for the course. The course will appear on the student's official transcript as an audit. Classes taken as an audit must be declared by the end of the quarter's second week. Audited courses are not eligible for challenge exams. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Attendance and Tardiness In order to maintain educational standards, NUNM expects one hundred percent (100%) attendance at classes and clinical rotations; with a minimum attendance of 80% of all courses. Faculty members may exercise discretion on attendance, as well as require students to attend up to one hundred percent (100%) of scheduled classes in order to pass a course. Students should consult course syllabi for additional details on individual faculty attendance expectations. Students who wish to petition for an excused absence for clinical rotations must follow policies outlined in the Clinic Absences section of the student handbook. Instructors may take into account habitual tardiness when calculating a course or clinic grade. Students are responsible for being aware of and meeting faculty attendance expectations. Grading and Promotion NUNM maintains high standards of scholarship, and recognizes its responsibility to provide each student the best opportunity to complete their program(s) successfully. At the beginning of each course, the instructor is required to define clearly for class members the objectives of the course and the standards and methods by which student achievement will be measured. Students are responsible for checking their grades online in SONIS. Courses that are graded using the \"P/F\" grading system are not included in a student's GPA. For students enrolled in any program (fall 2015 or later), at the end of each quarter, each student's course performance is reported to the registrar using the following letter grading system. A student's grade-point average will be calculated using the following chart: 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 163 Grade Percentage Points A 90-100 4.0 B 80-89 3.0 C 70-79 2.0 D 60-69 1.0 F 59 or less 0.0 W/WF N/A Not calculated A (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE): passing B (SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): passing C (MARGINAL PERFORMANCE): passing D (UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): not passing for graduate-level courses, passing for undergraduate F (FAILURE): not passing, permanent grade P (PASS): satisfactory performance W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation AU (AUDIT) IP (IN PROGRESS) R (REMEDIATION REQUIRED): marginal performance (temporary grade) - graduate level only RP (REMEDIATED PASS): grade given for a passed medical clinic rotation, but with required skills remediation - graduate level only RC (REMEDIATED C): pass remediation exam - graduate level only For students enrolled in the ND or CCM programs prior to fall 2015, at the end of each course, each student's performance is reported to the registrar using the following pass/fail grading system: H (HONORS): superior performance; equivalent to \"A,\" not available for all courses P (PASS): satisfactory performance; equivalent to \"B\" or \"C\" FR (FAIL REMEDIATE): marginal performance (temporary (REMEDIATED equivalent to \"C-\" F (FAILURE): unsatisfactory performance (permanent grade); equivalent to \"F\" I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing AU (AUDIT) CMP (COMPLETE): used for courses that are not graded, but attendance is required and a specified number of hours need to be completed, such as preceptor hours T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation NC (NOT COMPLETED): hour requirement or attendance not met IP (IN PROGRESS) Academic Policies | nunm.edu 164 Grade of \"R/FR\" - Graduate level \"R\" (remediation required) or \"FR\" (fail remediate) is a temporary grade. Students who fail a course may receive an \"R/FR\" grade rather than an \"F\" (fail) if they meet the criteria and have the opportunity to take a remediation exam to pass the course. \"R\" grades are converted to either an \"RC\" (remediated \"C\") if the remediation exam is passed or a \"D/F\" if the remediation exam is failed. \"FR\" grades are converted to either an \"RP\" (remediated pass) or \"F\"\u2014not to a \"P\" or an \"H.\" A grade of \"R\" or \"FR\" cannot be converted to a \"P\" or \"H\" grade. Grades of \"R/FR\" are not eligible for grade appeals. Students who receive two or more \"R/FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RC/RP\") will be placed on academic probation and must sign an academic contract. Students earning three or more \"R/FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RC/RP\") will be required to appear before the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC), and may be suspended. An \"R/FR\" grade that has not been remediated by the end of the second week of the following term (e.g., a spring term course should be remediated by the end of the second week of summer term) will automatically be converted to an \"F.\" Grade of \"RC/RP\" - Graduate level Students who pass the remediation exam will earn a permanent grade of \"RC (remediated \"C\")/RP (remediated pass).\" grade of \"RP\" will be given when an ND student passes a clinical rotation, but is required to attend a clinical skills enhancement course to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency. An \"RP\" grade will also be given if a student receives a passing grade on a clinic rotation, but was recommended for remediation more than once. CCM: Grades of \"RP\" are given when a supervisor believes a clinical weakness exists and has not been adequately improved upon by the end of the rotation. The CCM student will be required to remediate with either the associate dean of clinical education or the supervisor in order to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency. Grade of \"D/F\" - Graduate LevelFor graduate-level students, a letter grade of \"D\" or \"F\" is considered a failing grade. A failing grade in a required course (including clinical rotations) requires the student to repeat the course/clinic rotation the next time it is offered, usually the next year. If it is an elective course that is failed, the student is not required to retake it\u2014however, the student is strongly encouraged to do so as they will remain on probation and/or can trigger an ARAC meeting if further courses are failed. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per-credit rate. Any naturopathic student failing a clinical rotation will be required to register for and attend skills-building. Grade of \"F\" - Undergraduate LevelWhen an undergraduate-level student receives a failing grade, the course must be repeated the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per-credit rate. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 165 Grade of \"I\" When a student cannot complete a course in the term in which it begins, an incomplete (\"I\") grade may be considered. The granting of an \"I\" grade is at the discretion of the faculty member and used in exceptional circumstances; and may be based upon approved excused absences provided by the Center for Academic Success. Faculty may consider the grade of \"I\" petition when the following criteria have been met: The student has satisfactorily completed a minimum of 80% of the course requirements; and The student is passing the course; and The student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. While these criteria must be met to consider an \"I\" grade, their fulfillment does not entitle students to receive an incomplete grade. The instructor of a course has the final decision regarding appropriate awarding of an \"I\" grade. To request an incomplete grade, the student is responsible for submitting to the Registrar's Office an approved \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form, which can be obtained from the Registrar's Office or the Center for Academic Success. To complete the form, a student must: Meet with the faculty member to complete the form and discuss the remaining course assignments to be submitted to change the incomplete grade; and Use the supplemental worksheet attached to the \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form to create a timeline for completion of course requirements; and Return the completed petition form to the Registrar's Office. When the student completes the work required to change the \"I\" grade, the faculty member will submit the \"Grade Change\" form to the Registrar's Office. A grade of incomplete should be completed within the first two (2) weeks of the next term, with an extension of no more than two (2) quarters. Failure to complete the required course work by the timeline on the contract will result in a failing grade. If a grade of \"I\" extends beyond two (2) quarters due to ongoing circumstances, the student may be required to take a leave of absence and will be allowed to complete the course material upon return from leave. Students who apply for a leave of absence and have not completed 80% of the coursework will receive a grade of \"W\" for the class, and will need to repeat it upon return from leave. A withdrawal will affect the student's ability to continue in certain course sequences in subsequent quarters. Multiple \"I\" grades in one quarter may result in the inability to petition for incomplete grades the subsequent quarter.A student requesting a grade of \"I\" in a course that is a prerequisite for a subsequent course may not enroll in the subsequent course until the grade of \"I\" is resolved or complete a petition to deviate, with faculty and dean approval. The program dean can deny registration for a student's final professional field experience (e.g., fieldwork, internship, capstone, etc.) if an \"I\" grade has not been resolved. Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA or total credits completed; however, \"I\" grades may affect a student's satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting \"I\" grades should meet with the Office of Financial Aid to examine the effects on their financial aid award. An incomplete will not be awarded when a student is failing a course for the purpose of giving additional time to complete late assignments. Any student who is failing a course after week eight (8) is not eligible to request an \"I.\" Grade of \"I\" - Graduate-Level Clinical RotationsA grade of \"I\" will be given to students who are passing a clinical rotation but have missed up to two (2) shifts (8 hours) during an 11- or 12-week term. Students must make up any missed shifts by the end of the following term in order to convert an \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" If missed shifts are not made up by the deadline, an \"I\" grade will convert to an \"F.\" See Sections 6 and 7 of the student handbook for more detail. Grade of \"CMP\"This grade (complete) is used for courses that the student is required to attend, but no evaluation is given. Examples of such courses include, but may not be limited to, ComEx, community education or new student orientation, for which the student is required to complete a certain number of hours. Grade of \"IP\"This grade designates a course is in progress; temporary grade. Once the faculty member submits the grades, the \"IP\" grade will be changed to the appropriate rating. Grade of \"W\" \"W\" (withdrawal) is a grade used to indicate that a student has withdrawn from a course. A \"W\" is recorded on a student's transcript but not included in GPA calculation. A \"W\" grade is, however, considered part of the courses attempted calculation as per the satisfactory academic progress policy.Academic Policies | nunm.edu 166 Remediation - Graduate Level Only Students who receive an \"R/FR\" are eligible to sit for remediation exams and/or projects. All remediation exams and/or projects must be completed and grade changes submitted to the Registrar's Office by the end of week two (2) of the following term (spring term grades have until week three of summer term). For students who receive an \"R/FR\" grade in spring quarter and have already made verifiable travel plans that interfere with this remediation schedule, they may, with the approval of the programmatic dean, be allowed to complete the remediation by the last week of the summer term. ND PROGRAM ND students who earn a 67-69% (\"D\" range or \"FR\" grade) in lecture courses are eligible to remediate a final exam. Labs and tutorial courses may offer remediation exams at instructor discretion, based on the course material and the feasibility of offering a remediation exam. If a remediation exam is available, an \"R\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. CCM PROGRAMS CCM students who earn a 60-69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. An \"R\" or \"FR\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" or \"FR\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES PROGRAMS School of Graduate Studies students who earn a 60-69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. An \"R\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. Clinical Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the program dean. ND CLINICAL SKILLS ENHANCEMENT TUTORIAL Clinical skills enhancement courses are generally scheduled over a six-week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and works with them directly throughout the duration of the course. At the end of the course, the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course. A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical skills enhancement course, even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to remain on track in their clinical education. When an ND student receives two or more grades of \"Pass with Clinical Skills Enhancement Recommended\" during their academic career, the clinical skills enhancement course becomes a requirement and the student will be registered for it the next term. ND OBJECTIVE STRUCTURED CLINICAL EXAMINATION (OSCE) TUTORIAL An ND student who fails an OSCE exam twice will be referred to an OSCE skills tutorial for three sessions, and a failing grade will be recorded on their transcript. Upon successful completion of the OSCE tutorial, the student must then register to retake the OSCE exam. Any student who fails an OSCE exam three times is referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Students who fail the OSCE exam three times may be suspended. CCM CLINICAL SKILLS REMEDIATION Clinical evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week six (6) of the term to provide feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation. The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the CCM associate dean of clinical education and the CCM dean, can assign remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs run by a CCM resident. CCM CLINIC ENTRANCE EXAMINATION All CCM students take a practical point location examination at the beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advanced Point Location course in the spring quarter.2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 167 CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becoming an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to assume responsibility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. Grade Appeals Students have the right to appeal a failing grade if they perceive that there has been an error in the grading procedure, or if there is a perceived lack of clarity about the faculty member's expectation for passing a course. The appeal must be made within two weeks of receipt of the grade. Grades of \"B\" or better cannot be appealed to receive a higher grade or a grade of \"honors.\" A student may request a review of a grade given in an exam or a final grade for a course only in the following manner: A written request by the student, for a review of the grade, must be submitted to the faculty member. This appeal must be within two weeks of the posted grade. The faculty member will advise the student in writing of the decision within seven days of receipt of the request. The student may appeal the faculty member's decision in writing via a \"Grade Appeal\" form. The completed appeal form will be submitted to the registrar. This appeal must be made within seven days of the faculty member's written notice to the student regarding the decision. The written appeal to the registrar must be accompanied by appropriate written documentation as to why the student feels the grade is in error, and what the outcome was of the discussion and appeal with the faculty member. The registrar will forward the appeal to the Academic Appeal and Review Committee (ARAC). ARAC will review the documentation, may have a discussion with the faculty member, and issue a recommendation to the program dean. The recommendations from ARAC may include upholding the grade as submitted or requiring the student to remediate an exam. ARAC may not recommend a passing grade to be substituted in place of a failing grade. The program dean will review the recommendations and make a final decision. The student and faculty member will be notified in writing of the final decision. The decision is final and may not be appealed to higher authority. ND OSCE Exam Appeals ND students who have a non-passing first OSCE exam result may not appeal, since a failing grade is not given until the second exam attempt is unsuccessful. A failed OSCE exam grade appeal must be submitted to the associate dean of clinical education within two (2) weeks of the posted grade, and will be referred to the Program and Student Assessment Committee for review. The committee will notify the student in writing of the decision within 14 days of receipt of the request. Academic Policies | nunm.edu 168 Academic Advising The Center for Academic Success (CAS) administers academic advising for all students. Students who are pursuing any track other than the standard published tracks must confer with CAS to ensure all requirements are met. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress are required to meet with a CAS academic advisor. The Center for Academic Success and academic advisors are responsible for advising students on the following: Academic probation (meeting with students on academic probation) Changing tracks (four- to five-year, etc.) Academic aspects of leaves of absence (regular or medical) Questions regarding concurrent track options Requests for permission to take exams early or late (in extraordinary circumstances only) Assistance with the grade appeals process Petitions for excused absences General questions regarding academic progress and success Satisfactory Academic Progress - Graduate Level Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. Students must enroll in courses per published and/or approved curriculum layouts (unless on an approved deviated track).\"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as: Passing grades in all academic courses and clinical rotations (for clinical students); and Passing all program requirements within one and one-half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program, generally between 5-7 years; and Maintaining a minimum of 11 credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Clinical students who receive two (2) or more failing grades of \"D\" or \"F\" in courses, clinic rotations, or OSCE exams are considered not making satisfactory academic progress in a 12-month period. School of Graduate Studies students who receive three (3) or more grades of \"C\" or lower in their academic career, or two or more failing grades of \"D\" or \"F,\" or falling below full-time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track), are considered not making satisfactory academic progress. The Academic Progress Committee meets twice per academic term to determine students' academic progress. Students making unsatisfactory academic progress will be referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress in a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty member may request the student to access tutoring; and may share concerns with the program dean and/or director of academic access and success about classroom attendance, performance on examinations, and any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Financial aid recipients who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies in place for that office (see Section 10.8 Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility in the student handbook). These policies are separate from NUNM's satisfactory academic progress policies. Students who have \"reached maximum timeframe status,\" depending on the enrolled program, are considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. Maintaining Active Enrollment for Satisfactory Academic Progress To maintain an active enrolled student status, a minimum enrollment of one (1) credit is required. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one (1) credit each quarter will be considered withdrawn and must reapply, and will be subject to the graduation requirements in the catalog specific to the year of reapplication (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 169 Students who have met all course requirements but have outstanding graduation requirements, such as a DSOM capstone, MSiMR thesis, clinical hours, clinical proficiency objectives (CPOs), preceptor hours, or other graduation requirements, must register for either one (1) credit of \"Thesis/Capstone Completion\" or one (1) credit of \"Graduation Completion\" each term until all graduation requirements are met. DSOM and MSiMR student have a maximum of one (1) academic year to complete their thesis/capstone. ND students have a maximum of two academic terms to finish all outstanding requirements. Students are not eligible for financial aid while registered for thesis/capstone or graduation completion. Students also must adhere to the maximum length of program requirement. Failure to register each term for thesis/capstone/graduation completion credit will constitute a withdrawal. If a student wants to continue beyond the maximum length of program timeline, they will be required to meet with the director of academic access and success and their program dean to determine if they may continue at NUNM. The director of academic access and success and program deans will assess if the student can demonstrate knowledge retention and skills of their program. If it is determined that the student has gaps of knowledge and/or skills, the student will be required to complete additional academic and/or clinical work. Students who are granted an extension to continue their program beyond the maximum length of program deadline will then be matriculated under the university catalog of the year of their extended program, and are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog. Students will be required to sign an academic contract. Academic Probation - Graduate Level Students failing any course (\"F\" or \"D\" grade) or clinic rotation, failing an OSCE exam twice, or receiving two or more \"FR\" grades (regardless of whether remediated) will be placed on academic probation. When placed on probation, all students must meet with an academic advisor within one week to sign an academic contract. This agreement will delineate a timetable for repeating failed courses, identify needed resources, and require that the student not fail any other required courses during the probationary period. Students may not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. Students who fail to complete an academic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with their university advisor(s) to discuss strategies for successful completion of their program. Students are removed from academic probation once any courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed, and the terms of the academic contract are met.Satisfactory Academic Progress - Undergraduate Level Undergraduate students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as follows: Meeting and maintaining the minimum grade-point average requirements (2.00); and Having a completion rate of 67% of courses attempted per term; and Having less than the maximum of 1.5 times the number of credits required to graduate, i.e., students cannot enroll in more than a cumulative of 136 attempted credits; and o Multiple withdrawals from courses will impact a student's eligibility to make satisfactory academic progress. Degree completion within the maximum length of study (defined as 1.5 times the length of the longest undergraduate program); and Taking a minimum of 12 credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Students who earn a term GPA of less than 2.00 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.00, or earn a term GPA of less than 1.50 and have a cumulative GPA of 2.00-4.00, are considered not making satisfactory academic progress. The Academic Progress Committee meets twice per academic term to determine students' academic progress, and students may be referred to the Center for Academic Success or to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Students must enroll in courses per published and/or approved curriculum layouts. Academic Policies | nunm.edu 170 A minimum enrollment of one (1) credit is required to maintain student status. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one (1) credit each quarter will be considered withdrawn, must reapply, and will be subject to the graduation requirements in the catalog specific to the year of reapplication (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). Students who have met all graduation requirements, except for the capstone/internship, must register each term for one (1) credit of \"Graduation Completion\" until they have completed their requirements (students will not be aid-eligible at this point); with a maximum of two academic terms. Failure to register each term for the graduation completion credit will constitute a withdrawal. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress during a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty member may request the student to access tutoring and may share concerns with the program dean and/or the Center for Academic Success about classroom attendance, performance on examinations, as well as any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Financial aid recipients who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies. These policies are separate from the institution's satisfactory academic progress policies. Students who have \"reached maximum timeframe status\" are considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. If a student wants to continue their program beyond the deadlines, they will be required to meet with the Center for Academic Success and program dean to determine if they may continue at NUNM. The academic advisor and program dean will assess if the student can demonstrate knowledge retention and skills of their program. If it is determined that the student has gaps of knowledge and/or skills, the student will be required to complete additional academic work. Students who are permitted to continue their program beyond the one and one-half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program will be required to follow the university catalog of the year of their extended program. These students are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog and are required to sign an academic contract. Undergraduate Academic Standing Academic standing and credit completion are monitored for all students at the end of each term (including summer) by the Registrar's Office, which will notify the student and the Center for Academic Success when the student is not making satisfactory academic progress. Students receiving financial aid need should review the financial aid satisfactory academic progress requirements for continued eligibility. The Registrar's Office monitors student GPAs (both term and cumulative) for academic standing and credit completion to determine sufficient progress toward degree completion. Incomplete grades are not calculated as part of a student's GPA. Academic standing and insufficient credit completion are evaluated separately as described below. Academic Standing The Registrar's Office and the Center for Academic Success use the following categories to describe a student's academic standing when unsatisfactory. These categories are as follows: Academic Warning Academic warning status occurs when a student earns a letter grade of \"D\" or less in an individual course. A student may still be considered to be in good academic standing if their cumulative GPA is at or above a 2.00. A letter grade of \"D\" is identified as a concern of potential academic problems if not rectified. While on warning status, a student is expected to meet with an academic advisor to develop a plan to address the concern. Academic Probation Academic probation occurs when a student earns a term GPA of below 2.00 and has a cumulative GPA below 2.00; or earns a term GPA of less than 1.50 and has a cumulative GPA of 2.00-4.00. When placed on academic probation, a student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success to sign an academic contract within one week of notification. The academic contract will identify needed resources, including but not limited to, remedial work, 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 171 additional coursework, tutoring or repeating course(s), and requires that the student improve their GPA. Students are removed from academic probation once they have earned a minimum term GPA of 2.25, have a cumulative GPA of 2.00, and the terms of the academic contract are met. Students may not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. Students who fail to complete an academic contract within one week may be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled and/or placed on registration hold. A student who does not meet the criteria to be removed from academic probation, and who does not escalate to academic suspension, will continue on in probation and be subject to the same requirements. While on academic probation, if a student receives an additional term GPA of less than 2.00, they will be referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Academic Suspension Academic suspension occurs when a student is ineligible to enroll at the university for a specified period of time. Suspended status is noted on the student's official transcript. Suspension is determined through the ARAC process. A student has the right to appeal an academic suspension if they believe that their suspension resulted from: Failure of the program dean or the Academic Review and Appeals Committee to follow the procedures set forth in the policy on unsatisfactory academic progress. The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense. Information relevant to the decision was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing. Failure to appear at an ARAC meeting is not grounds for an appeal without an approved excused absence. Academic Review and Appeals Committee The Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC) is an institutional process with a degree program-specific outcome. The committee is composed of four faculty members and chaired by the registrar, who convenes the meetings. Program dean(s) appoint faculty members. Meetings of ARAC are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. Students should submit any supporting paperwork for early review to the registrar, prior to the meeting with ARAC. Graduate Programs ARAC reviews student progress in required courses and in the clinic. A student required to attend an ARAC meeting is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until they have resolved the referral to the committee. Essential elements reviewed by ARAC during graduate student hearings include, but are not limited to: Failure of a course, clinic shift or OSCE Failure to complete an academic contract in a timely manner Failure to comply with the terms of an academic contract Remediated courses Failure of two or more required courses in different degree programs Failure to follow approved and/or published curriculum layout Failure to make satisfactory progress in a required research project (MSiMR students) The committee will review the situation, meet with the student, and make a recommendation to the program dean(s). Recommendations may be, but are not limited to, any of the following regarding the student's change of status: Probationary status requiring counseling or support for the conduct in question Development of a revised academic contract outlining a timeline for converting the failing grades to passing grades, which may include restrictions on new coursework undertaken by the student until the failing grades are changed. (This will allow financial aid eligibility to be maintained.) Suspension from NUNM or from a specific program Suspension from a single program or from all programs may occur in the following cases: Failure to satisfy an academic contract Failure of two clinic shifts throughout a student's academic career Failure of two required classes in a given quarter, including electives Failure of two sequential classes Failure of the same class twice Failure to meet technical standards Receiving three or more RCs, RPs, or grades of \"D\" or less in an academic career Failure of any OSCE three (3) times for ND students Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress Academic Policies | nunm.edu 172 Undergraduate Programs ARAC reviews student progress in courses. A student required to attend an ARAC meeting is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until they have resolved the referral to the committee. Essential elements reviewed by ARAC during undergraduate student hearings include, but are not limited to: Failure of courses Failure to complete an academic contract in a timely manner Failure to comply with the terms of an academic contract Failure to follow approved and/or published curriculum layout Failure to make satisfactory progress in the capstone project The committee will review the situation, meet with the student, and make a recommendation to the program dean(s). Recommendations may be, but are not limited to, any of the following regarding the student's change of status: The ability to continue in the program under academic probation status Requirement of personal counseling or support for the conduct in question Develop and sign a revised academic contract with the Center for Academic Success that outlines a timeline for resolving GPA concerns. This may include additional restrictions on new coursework undertaken by the student until the probation status is lifted. Suspension from NUNM Suspension from NUNM may occur in the following cases: Failure to satisfy an academic contract A term GPA of less than 2.25 and a cumulative GPA below 2.00 while on academic probation Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress A student who is academically suspended a second time will be expelled from NUNM and forfeit the opportunity to re-enroll at NUNM. Appeal of Academic Suspension A student suspended will have three (3) business days from the date of the sanction notification to submit an intention to appeal to the provost, or the provost's designee, in writing. The student then has seven (7) calendar days to submit the written appeal and supporting documentation to the provost or designee. The written appeal does not provide an opportunity for ARAC to rehear the case. The provost, or the provost's designee, will respond to the written appeal with a final decision within ten (10) calendar days, not including weekends or published holidays that the university is closed; based on assessment of the information presented by the dean and ARAC, the student, and a review of the investigation process and procedure. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the program dean, or the Academic Review and Appeals Committee, to follow the procedures set forth in the policy on unsatisfactory academic progress The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing The provost may elect to uphold the decision of the dean; reverse the decision; request a different resolution; or refer the case back to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee if there is new information that was previously not available to ARAC for consideration. Reapplication and Readmissions Policy - Graduate Level Students who have been suspended cannot submit an application for readmission to NUNM for a minimum of one (1) calendar year from time of suspension, unless noted differently in the suspension letter. A suspended student who wishes to apply for readmission to NUNM must meet one of the following criteria at the time of suspension.

Expelled students are ineligible for reapplication or readmission to NUNM. Completing these steps does not guarantee readmission to NUNM. These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of students. Academic Policies | nunm.edu 174 Honor Council The Honor Council is a standing committee composed of faculty, resident, student and staff representation. The committee meets monthly to review written complaints and performance reports referred from the dean of students that reflect failure of a student to maintain behavioral standards according to the Honor Code and Code of Conduct. Behavioral standards include, but are not limited to, honesty, respect, interpersonal skills, deportment and demeanor, learning skills, professional behavior and communication skills. The committee reviews reports that may be submitted by faculty, staff or students. The Honor Council, depending on the nature and severity of the report, may request a formal code of conduct investigation. The committee does not accept anonymous reports. After reviewing all information, students will meet with the committee to discuss reported problems. The committee makes recommendations to the dean of students, who then makes the final determination and notifies the student, in writing, of the outcome. The dean of students reviews all reports submitted for Honor Council review, and on occasion, may choose to expedite the process and make a determination without submitting the information to the Honor Council for review. If the Honor Council determines that the frequency of reports, an accumulation of non-academic violations, or the seriousness of a report demonstrates a problem, they may recommend a more severe sanction such as probation, suspension or expulsion, which may interfere with a student's ability to complete their academic program. Thereafter, any reports forwarded to the Honor Council may serve as a basis for the committee to recommend suspension. Meetings of the Honor Council are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. A student may bring a faculty member or a member of the Office of Student Life as an advisor or advocate. Advisors' sole purpose during the investigative process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation. After reviewing a student file, the committee may recommend disciplinary sanctions that include, but are not limited to, any of the following sanctions to the dean of students: The student is found not in violation. No further action is required. A letter of reprimand or warning outlining policy, with a reminder to adhere to the policy or procedure. Referral for required areas of deficiency and remedial work may be required. This may include, but is not limited to, counseling, tutoring, meeting with an advisor or mentor, repeated course work, or restricted enrollment in certain courses. Restitution Community service or educational programming Disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons. The student does not currently demonstrate the appropriate behaviors, attitudes, skills or knowledge required for the program. A student placed on disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons may be required to perform remedial work, which may alter their course of study. In this case, any additional reports forwarded to the committee showing concern may result in suspension from the program. A recommendation for suspension or expulsion from NUNM. The committee may provide any additional recommendation it believes is suitable to address the issue at hand. Reports and letters outlining decisions made by the Honor Council and/or dean of students are maintained in the student's file in the program dean's office, and the Office of Student Life. Honor Code reports do not affect a student's academic record unless the outcome is suspension or expulsion from NUNM. Copies of reports and letters are maintained in compliance with NUNM's Record Retention Policy. Patient Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB) is to apply a systematic, objective review process to adverse clinical events, and to provide 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 175 formative feedback about clinical policies, procedures and educational practices with the goal of improving patient care and clinical quality. The PSMB serves as a subcommittee of the Honor Council. Once a student has been referred to the Honor Council for a clinical violation, the PSMB conducts a root cause analysis using the fishbone/cause and effect method to audit NUNM systems. The information is presented to the Honor Council, which deliberates as to whether there was a patient safety issue, as well as makes recommendations for prevention of future similar problems. Appeal of Honor Council Suspension or Expulsion Students have the right to appeal a suspension or expulsion from NUNM for Honor Code or Code of Conduct violations. Violations of a lesser nature may not be appealed. No adverse action will be taken against a student for registering an appeal in accordance with these policies. Within three (3) business days from the date disciplinary action was levied against the student by the dean of students, the student must notify the provost (or designee) of intention to appeal. The student will then have seven (7) calendar days to complete and submit to the provost (or designee) a written request for review. The provost (or designee) will respond with a final decision within ten (10) business days, not including weekends or published holidays, based on assessment of the information provided by the dean of students and the investigation of procedure, or refer the appeal to the Student Appeals Committee. In the unforeseen event the provost (or designee) needs additional time in reviewing the evidence, the provost (or designee) will notify the student in writing of the deadline extension. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the dean of students, or the Honor Council, to follow the procedures set forth in the policy in the student handbook. The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense. Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing. The provost (or designee) may elect to uphold the decision of the dean, reverse the decision, or request a different resolution. Examinations and Completion of Assignments Students are required to complete all examinations and assignments on schedule. Extensions of assignment deadlines are offered at faculty members' discretion. In cases of severe illness, bereavement or family emergency, refer to the Petitioning for Excused Absences policy in the student handbook. Please also see the Financial Policies section regarding fees. Students who may have a temporary disability that inhibits their attendance and participation in class or clinic should contact the Center for Academic Success for an accommodation. Academic Policies | nunm.edu 176 Graduation Policy Candidates for graduation must complete the following within the same calendar year as the commencement ceremony they participate in: Satisfy all courses in the degree program curriculum Satisfy clinic requirements for all medical students, if applicable to the student's degree program Demonstrate competence in all technical standards For medical students, demonstrate satisfactory professionalism for a health professional Transfer students enrolled in a clinical program must complete at least three (3) years of professional training at NUNM Second professional degree students must complete at least two (2) years of professional training at NUNM Satisfy thesis or capstone project requirements, if applicable to the student's degree program Satisfy all financial obligations to NUNM MSiMR: Students are required to complete a master's thesis by the middle of the final term of their last year. A master's thesis instruction document is provided to all MSiMR students. DSOM: Students are required to complete a three-part doctoral capstone project by the end of the final term of the DSOM program. A project handbook is provided in the Doctoral Capstone Tutorial course scheduled in the summer quarter of the final (internship) year. Undergraduate Capstone: Undergraduate students are required to complete a capstone project by the middle of the final term of their last year. Information about the capstone project is available on the Capstone Moodle course page. A diploma will not be issued to students until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met. The official graduation date is the last day of the term in which all requirements are completed. An ND student is ineligible to take licensing examinations until all required work is completed. Voluntary Leave of Absence Students considering a leave of absence must schedule an appointment with the Center for Academic Success. A student in good academic standing may apply for a leave of absence of up to, and no more than, one academic year (four academic quarters, regardless of enrollment of summer term), which entitles the student to re-enter NUNM during a predetermined quarter the following academic year, provided there is space in the class. Students who are on a leave of absence cannot participate in any academic activities, including clinical rotation shifts or preceptor rotations. Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to the sequencing of courses and missing prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be approved by the Center for Academic Success or program dean. The program dean and/or academic advisor can guide students through a new schedule. The registrar must be advised of a student's intention to return to NUNM within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter in which the student plans to register. The registrar will instruct students to complete and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to be approved by the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Administration, Center for Academic Success, and Student Life, with the form being returned to the Office of the Registrar when completed. Concurrently enrolled students may take a leave from their secondary program without taking a leave from their primary program. However, concurrently enrolled students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program must also take a leave of absence or withdraw from their secondary program. If a student does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from the program and will be required to submit a new application for admission. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. A leave of absence normally will be granted to any student who is in good standing (i.e., has no outstanding grades of incomplete, fail remediate or failure for required courses, and is not on academic or disciplinary probation), and who has satisfied all financial obligations to NUNM. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four quarters) of absence from NUNM during their academic career. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 177 Medical Leave of Absence Students considering a medical leave of absence must schedule an appointment with the Center for Academic Success. In the case of a medical leave of absence, which may be granted to a student on academic probation, appropriate documentation is required from the attending physician. The physician must indicate the necessity of granting the leave. A student who is not in good academic standing (i.e., has outstanding grades of incomplete, fail remediate or failure for required courses; or is on academic or disciplinary probation) and is serving in the military will be granted a medical leave of absence without medical documentation. The student must submit documentation from the military branch of their time serving. Students who are on a medical leave of absence cannot participate in any academic activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams; and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations. A student who wishes to return from a medical leave of absence must provide to the Center for Academic Success adequate documentation from the attending physician demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to the program. After documentation has been reviewed and approved, the registrar will be advised of the student's intention to return to NUNM. The advisement of a student's intention to return must be given within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter in which the student plans to register. The registrar will instruct the student to complete and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to be approved by the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Administration, Center for Academic Success, and Student Life. The form should be returned to the Office of the Registrar when completed. Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to sequential courses and missing prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be approved by the Center for Academic Success or program dean. The program dean and/or academic advisor can guide students through a new schedule. Concurrently enrolled students may take a leave from their secondary program without taking a leave from their primary program. However, concurrently enrolled students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program must also take a leave of absence or withdraw from their secondary program. If a student on a medical leave of absence does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from NUNM and will be required to submit a new application for admission. Any incomplete grades will be converted to a failing grade. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four quarters) of absence from NUNM during their academic career. Concurrent Student Leave of Absence Students are only allowed to be enrolled in two (2) programs concurrently. Concurrently enrolled students are not required to take a leave from both programs at the same time, allowing them to remain in one program while on leave from the other program. However, concurrent students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program must also take a leave of absence or withdraw from their second program. In the case of a leave of absence, students are assured a seat in both programs upon return to NUNM. Any exception to this policy must be petitioned to the dean of students (or designee) and is subject to the conditions outlined below. For concurrent students who choose to take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary program, and wish to continue the series of courses in their secondary program for the remainder of the academic year, the following conditions apply: There is not an option of continuing in their secondary degree program at a full-time status, nor returning early from the leave of absence to the primary program. Concurrent students who elect to continue in their secondary degree program while on a leave of absence from their primary program are not eligible for Title IV financial aid. Students may be reviewed for aid eligibility in the next academic year. Concurrent students cannot add core courses in their secondary program until the next matriculation start date. This policy may not apply to students with an MSiMR secondary-degree program. Involuntary Leave of Absence This policy is designed to maintain the health and safety of all campus community members. A student may be restricted from campus or subject to an involuntary leave of absence, when, due to a mental, emotional, physical or psychological health disorder, their continued presence at the university poses a significant risk of substantial harm to themselves or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment. A significant risk is based upon an individualized assessment and constitutes a high probability of substantial harm that cannot be mitigated by reasonable means.Academic Policies | nunm.edu 178 In most situations where a student's medical, psychiatric or psychological condition poses a threat to themselves or to others, the student will be highly encouraged by the dean of students to voluntarily accept a leave of absence (LOA) or medical leave of absence (MLOA). However, if the student does not take such a voluntary leave, the involuntary leave of absence (ILOA) process may commence. If a student has taken actions that are identified as being a significant risk to the health or safety of oneself or other(s), or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment, the dean of students or designee, acting on behalf of NUNM and in consultation with the Crisis Assessment and REsponse Team (CARE Team), may initiate the ILOA process as set forth below. The significant risks may include, but are not limited to, acute danger/loss of life, inability to independently manage daily tasks, or inability to cooperate with necessary support services, etc. If the decision is made to place the student on an ILOA, the student is prohibited from participating in any academic or non-academic NUNM activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical and preceptor rotations. The student may be subjected to actions including, but not limited to: A temporary ban from campus Withdrawal from class attendance or experiential learning (i.e., preceptor rotations, community education, university-sponsored travel, etc.) An interim suspension of participation in any campus or off-campus NUNM activities Completion of a mental health, substance abuse, or other necessary evaluation conducted by an appropriate off-campus licensed health providerStudents will receive a written description of the details of the ILOA pertaining to them, including the appeal procedures as outlined in Section 14 of the student handbook. The letter regarding the ILOA will be placed in the student's file with a copy sent to the program dean(s), director of academic success and access, registrar, director of financial aid, and the provost. The Registrar's Office will notify course instructors of the student's leave status. A student who wishes to return from an ILOA must provide to the dean of students (or designee) adequate documentation, as outlined in the initial letter, from the attending physician or mental health professional demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to NUNM. Students taking less than a full academic year off may find, upon their return, that the appropriate course load required to stay on track will not qualify them for full-time financial aid. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be approved by the academic advisor/program dean and the registrar. Students who take an ILOA will earn a grade of \"W\" for all enrolled courses at the time the leave is instated. If the student has completed at least 80% of the course at the time of the withdrawal, they may be eligible to petition the faculty member for a grade of \"incomplete.\" Withdrawal from School Students may initiate formal withdrawal by meeting with the dean of students. Students withdrawing from school at any time during the school year must complete an exit interview with the Financial Aid Office and submit a completed \"Leave Withdrawal\" form available from the dean of students. Failure to register for any quarter is considered a withdrawal, and the student will need to submit a new application and application fee for readmission. 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 179 A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code is not permitted to withdraw from NUNM until all allegations are resolved. A student required to attend an ARAC meeting is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until they have resolved the referral to the committee. Withdrawals - Federal Title IV Aid Recipients If a student ceases attendance (drops or withdraws) from all Title IV eligible courses in a payment period or a period of enrollment, the student is considered withdrawn for Federal Title IV aid purposes. Federal Loan Exit Interviews Federal regulations require that any student who has received a federal loan while attending NUNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted online at studentloans.gov. Additional information may be obtained by calling the Financial Aid Office. Independent Study Independent study is offered only when specific, approved circumstances require the student to achieve the course competencies outside of the normal classroom venue. This could happen, for example, when there is an unavoidable scheduling conflict for a student on an approved non-standard track. Independent study is not allowed for elective courses when the student has completed the elective requirement for their program. Conduct and Professional Standards NUNM expects all students to maintain professional standards of conduct and appearance. These standards are found in the academic and nonacademic policies and procedures section of the student handbook, and in the clinic section and honor code. The naturopathic oath, classical Chinese medicine oath, state laws and regulations, and documents of professional organizations such as the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM) provide further insight concerning professional standards of conduct. The student conduct code in the student handbook specifies procedures for investigating violations of university policies and the sanctions that may be imposed. Academic Freedom NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general.Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains permanent academic records of each student enrolled at NUNM. Unless otherwise required by law or special circumstances, the university will follow the policies set forth in this section and the record retention policy found in the student handbook. Typically, a student's academic record contains an application file, personal information necessary for NUNM business, grade reports, and records of any official action by NUNM concerning the student. Students are notified annually via email of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) - commonly referred to as the \"Buckley Amendment.\" The Business Office, Financial Aid Office, Office of Student Life, and Academic Affairs Office may also maintain student files as required by their respective functions. NUNM will maintain information on students in a secure, confidential manner in accordance with FERPA, and to that end will observe the following guidelines: University officers and faculty may review student records on an as-needed basis. NUNM holds the following information as directory information, which may be disclosed in response to legitimate requests: name, address, telephone number, university email address, dates of attendance, enrollment status (full time, part time and leave of absence), academic program, graduation date, photograph and awards received. NUNM will only print the following information in directories: name, year in school, university email and telephone number. Personal information about students will not be shared with third parties on- or off-campus, except as directed in writing by the student, the courts or governmental agencies. A student who wishes to review their records may do so by submitting a request in writing 48 hours prior to the time they wish to view their records. A student may not make copies of documents in their files. A student who believes information contained in their academic record is inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy may request that the records be amended. In the event of a disagreement between a student and the administration as to the disposition of an issue, the student has the right to place a personal position statement in their academic file. A student has the right to file complaints with the appropriate agencies concerning alleged failures by NUNM to comply with applicable laws and rules, and/or their implementing regulations.Academic Policies | nunm.edu 180 Students may request information to be withheld by completing a \"Directory Hold Request\" form available from the Registrar's Office. NUNM may, in accordance with FERPA, disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education record without consent if the disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency. Each student is responsible for furnishing, completely and accurately, all information required by NUNM so that it may perform its proper function as an educational institution. If a student's circumstances change (e.g., name, address, financial situation, etc.), the student is responsible to ensure that appropriate university officials are informed of the changed circumstance as soon as possible. No part of a student's file, except directory information as noted above, will be released to any person outside of NUNM without written consent of the student, except as required by law. Records for students attending NUNM under the provisions of the Veterans Administration will be accessible to certain authorized state and federal personnel without prior consent in accordance with 45 CFR, part 99.31 and part 99.35. FERPA does not apply to employment situations, nor does it apply to candidates for matriculation to NUNM. However, Human Resources and the Office of Admissions adhere strictly to guidelines of professional conduct. All student admission applicant and employee applicant records are the property of NUNM and will not be released or returned except as outlined above. Change of Track Students are admitted to a specific educational program and required to follow their educational track. Within a track, students are not allowed to drop required courses or take required courses ahead of schedule. After matriculation, students may request to change tracks to any of the standard educational tracks by submitting a \"Student Status Change\" form, approved by an academic advisor, to the Registrar's Office. Once processed by the Registrar's Office, students must follow their new educational track. Students may deviate from the standard educational tracks for the following reasons: documented chronic illness, bereavement, or approved academic accommodations and considerations. Deviation requests must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation before approval can be given. A $50 fee is applied to every approved petition to deviate. A track change also requires a signature from the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. All track requests must be completed by week eight (8) of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Students may require an individual track layout due to approved deviations, a leave of absence, transfer credit, adding a second program, failure of a required course, etc. Due to the timing of some deviations, a student's course schedule may not meet full-time enrollment status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be required due to course conflicts, and will be made at the discretion of the registrar at no additional cost beyond the change fee. Students who deviate from their approved educational track may be required to take a leave of absence. Students who are admitted into a degree program that does not have a lockstep track are exempt from this policy. Change/Addition of Degree(s) Students who wish to withdraw from one degree program and enroll into another must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, an academic advisor will work with the program dean to approve and inform the student regarding potential transfer credit, challenge exam options, and establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. Students who wish to add an additional degree (i.e., become a concurrently enrolled student in two degree programs) must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, the student will work with the Center for Academic Success to establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification. Students may pursue no more than two degrees concurrently. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Students who matriculate into a second degree program will do so under the catalog corresponding to the year in which the student begins the new degree. Adding/Dropping Academic Courses Students self-register for all core courses and may not deviate from the established curriculum unless they have submitted and received approval via a \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements\" form. During week one (1) of each quarter, students may change sections in courses for which this is applicable. During this same period, they may also register for elective courses, and must submit an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office. For ND students, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) may not be added once the quarter has begun (they must be registered for prior to week 1). Courses may be officially dropped only by submitting an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office. (See below for the grading criteria and reimbursement schedule for dropped courses.) No core course can be officially dropped without the program 2017-2018 Course Catalog | Academic Policies 181 dean's signature. Students who are withdrawing from the institution will receive a grade of \"W\" regardless of the week they withdraw. See Section 6.7 of the student handbook for more information. Non-attendance in any course will earn a grade of \"F.\" Students who request to withdraw from a course after week one (1) must receive program dean and faculty approval. Courses dropped after week four (4) are ineligible for a refund and will be assigned a \"W\" or \"WF\" based on the grade they were receiving at the time of withdrawal. All grades are included on student transcripts. Weekend courses may be added or dropped up to the day before they begin based on the same criteria as above. Weekend courses that are dropped before they begin will receive a one hundred percent (100%) tuition refund.

Student Life | nunm.edu 182 Student Handbook Students are responsible for reading, understanding and abiding by all policies, rules, regulations, standards of conduct and information listed in the student handbook. Policy, rules, regulations, and standards of conduct changes to the student handbook are made without prior notice, including during the course of any academic year, to any course offering, requirements, policies, regulations, dates, and financial information or other information contained within the handbook. A current student handbook can be found online at nunm.edu. Paper copies are available in the Office of Student Life. Student Government Association The NUNM Student Government Association (SGA) is an elected government of the student body. According to the NUNM student body constitution, the mission of SGA is \"to serve as a forum in which the common needs of the diverse NUNM student body are identified, and to use SGA resources to address those needs and to enhance the student experience at NUNM.\" SGA also oversees the management and distribution of the student activity fees collected each quarter with registration. Students elect an executive council\u2014 president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and judicial liaison, as well as class officers and student representatives to university committees. Elections for SGA positions occur every spring quarter, except for the incoming first-year class whose class-wide elections are conducted in the fall quarter. All members of the student body are invited to attend and participate in all SGA meetings. For more information, consult any of the class representatives or any member of SGA. Student Disability Support Services The Center for Academic Success coordinates student accommodations based on Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students with questions should contact the director of student access and success. Health Insurance NUNM does not require students to carry medical health insurance coverage as a part of their enrollment at the university. However, students who travel as a part of their program requirements are required to have a personal medical insurance policy that is in effect prior to the date of departure of their trip.Housing Although on-campus housing is not available, NUNM is located near residential areas. Students may contact the Office of Admissions for additional information. Student Identification Cards All students receive a photo identification card during new student orientation. Wearing a photo ID is recommended at all university facilities, and required at all NUNM health centers and for entrance to the main campus after hours. This card also allows students to check out books at the NUNM library and at several other Portland college libraries with which NUNM has borrowing agreements. Emergency Contact Information Students are required to provide an updated emergency contact in SONIS . This information can be updated by using the \"Change of Address\" form found on the Registrar's page of the NUNM website. Substance Abuse Policy and Program NUNM is in compliance with U.S. Public Law 100-297 and the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (U.S. Public Law 103-382), and the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409-030-0100. NUNM policy prohibits unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs by students or employees on or off the university premises. A copy of the Substance Abuse Policy and Program is contained in the student and employee handbooks. Drug Testing Policy NUNM is in compliance with Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409-030-0100. All students are required to undergo a drug screen prior to matriculation at NUNM. Students enrolled prior to July 1, 2015, are required to undergo a drug screen prior to any clinical rotations or fieldwork experience. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in a revocation of the offer of admission to NUNM. New students will forfeit their enrollment deposit and current students will receive an interim suspension from NUNM. Any current student who refuses to take the substance test will be prohibited from participating in clinical rotations or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates. A copy of the Drug Testing Policy is contained in the student handbook.Student Life2017-2018 Course Catalog | Student Life 183 Campus Crime Statistics The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, codified at 20 USC 1092 (f) as a part of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. In accordance with U.S. Public Law 101-542, the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, the university annually publishes and distributes statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of reportable criminal offenses that are reported to campus security authorities. These statistics are available to all students and employees of NUNM. Statistics are also posted online at ope.ed.gov/security. Students and employees are advised of campus security procedures and practices, incident reporting and crime prevention during training; and are encouraged to be responsible for their own security and the security of others. Arrest Policy Violations of local, state and/or federal law are subject to university action. A student who has pleaded guilty to, or otherwise accepted responsibility for, a violation should be aware that the university may also sanction the student. Regardless of a plea, the dean of students must be notified within 72 hours if a student is arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense other than a minor traffic violation. If a student is unable to meet the 72-hour deadline, the student may be placed on an involuntary leave of absence pending a conversation with the dean of students. A student may be suspended immediately, pending a conduct hearing, when an arrest involves an act of violence; the illegal sale, manufacture or delivery of drugs; or when the continued presence of the student on campus poses a threat to the safety or the rights, welfare, or property of another. If found in violation, a student will be subjected to disciplinary sanctions as outlined in Section 14 of the student handbook, up to and including expulsion. If a matriculating student has been charged with a criminal offense between the time they submitted an application and the time they arrive at school, the student must inform the Office of Admissions and dean of students prior to arrival. If the university later discovers that a student has withheld disclosure of a criminal charge, they may be subject to immediate suspension. If a student is convicted of an offense and allowed to remain enrolled at NUNM, the student will be required to meet with the dean of students and program dean(s) to discuss possible ramifications for clinical rotation and licensure requirements. The intent of this policy is to ensure the safety of patients and other members of the university.Remote Classroom and Children on Campus A remote classroom with audio/video live feeds is available for nursing mothers. Others may petition the Office of Student Life for permission to use the remote classroom. Please note that not all classes are available for remote viewing due to the nature of some classes and specific instructor requirements. Babies in arms are permitted in the remote room, but parents must find off-site childcare once babies become mobile or are over 12 months of age. Due to academic concerns regarding class participation and video education, students are permitted to use the remote classroom for a maximum of two quarters per infant during their program at NUNM. Babysitting is not available on campus, nor is it possible to make private arrangements for on-campus babysitting. Parents are required to make suitable arrangements for off-site childcare so that they can attend class. Children are not permitted to attend class with parents. The remote room policy and privileges do not include exams and quizzes. Students are expected to find alternative childcare during exams. Children are not allowed to attend clinic shifts with parents unless they are being seen as a patient and accompanied by a guardian. New Student Orientation New student orientation is a required course that provides students with the opportunity to become oriented and familiar with the campus and their peers; meet with essential faculty, staff and administrators; and learn the rights, responsibilities and expectations of being a student at NUNM. Any student who is enrolling at NUNM part time or greater is required to attend new student orientation prior to the first term of enrollment. At that time, students will be assessed the new student orientation fee, which is charged to their student account. Attending new student orientation is a requirement for graduation from NUNM. A student who matriculates into an additional program during their academic career is exempt from participating in a second student orientation. Students who complete new student orientation will receive a grade of \"CMP\" for completion. Failure to attend all of new student orientation will result in a grade of \"NC,\" and the student will be required to retake the course the next time it is offered. Students who miss new student orientation will not be refunded the fee. Students readmitted to NUNM must make an appointment with the Office of Student Life to determine if re-orientation is required.
