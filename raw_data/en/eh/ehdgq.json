For some people balance conjures up being stable. \"To have an even distribution of weight or a situation where different elements are equal or of the correct proportion\". But in its literal sense, wouldn't' life be boring if you were in balance and harmony all the time? Could you imagine yourself balancing on one leg for example for long periods of time, wobbling around spending precious energy trying to stay balanced and not going anywhere? Or trying to be the perfect partner, mother, father, work colleague, or boss - in fact what is perfect anyway? Perfection as they say is in the eye of the beholder, but balance can also be seen in this way too. Some peoples idea of balance is to have that perfect image of symmetry and form, where everything appears equal and their lives are governed by the 'perfect' appearance. But I wonder how balanced they may feel inside. Whereas for others it can be more life changing. Losing ones sense of balance can lead to a fall, or suffering from vertigo can really upset a persons sense of confidence and trust in their physical ability. In my work as an [energy healer](/spiritual-therapy/) balance it is much more complex and offers more than one perspective which involves viewing balance from a spiritual perspective too. The idea of balance is simple yet the reality to achieve this can be complex. Balance is viewed from Six Perspectives In polarity therapy terms balance is viewed from six different perspectives Outside to inside - inside to outside. Front to back - back to front. Up and down - down and up So, balance is more than just one perspective and is multi-leveled. What I mean by this is the relationship between the body, mind, emotions and spirit. You could say that balance is about relationships with internal and external factors in life, which creates harmony and unity. How well do you relate to the foods that you eat, for example, do certain foods bloat you, energise or calm you? Does the diet that you follow control you - are you consumed by what you should or shouldn't eat? Being controlled by something can create rigid thinking. How well do you communicate with your nearest and dearest? Are you able to be completely yourself with those around you? Or do you hide a part of you because you think they won't understand or not acknowledge your value? How well do you listen? Communication is a key component in one's happiness when relating to others. How do you perceive yourself within your family, work, relationships? Are you a victim of circumstance a tyrant controlling others or a doormat without a point of view? Are you spiritually connected, yet struggle to live in this earthly reality? Or feel disconnected and lost feel like you don't belong? Balance is not as simple as it may seem, it is a complex mix of the relationship between all aspects of yourself and beyond. Most of us aim to be happy, healthy, and feel free even if we don't know how to achieve this. What is Balance Anyway? Achieving true balance is a feeling, a knowing and sense of oneness or unity. Yes, of course, you can experience this balance in yoga tree pose to get you to that feeling too for a moment, but it is more than that. Balance may require more of a conscious effort through clearing energy blocks from your body, mind, emotions, and spirit. Having said that you can be perfectly happy with your lot, a nice house, car, children, partner, career and that is feeling balance too. But for others, there is a deeper knowing to strive for a deeper connection - it is a matter of individual perspective and ultimately what drives your purpose in life. Balance is a Result of Unimpeded Energy It is the underlying energy that creates life and this vital life energy that keeps us alive which is the key. Balance is a result of an unimpeded flow of energy that is expressed through the body, mind, emotions, soul, and spirit. It is like a superhighway of connections and streams of consciousness, all working to relate together. When pain in the body or an upset at work can affect your sense of self and connection to the higher vibrations of spiritual realms. Equally to be in your head all the time can affect your body and give you pain or disconnect you from emotion. Yet if you are highly emotional and are stuck in the dramas of life you may be missing out on living your higher purpose in life. We are human after all and personally I don't know anyone who is in a state of [balance](https://spiritualbalance.net/) all the time, life is an ebb and flow. To get to a place in your life when you feel alive, free and a deep sense of connection. Or, to know when you are out of balance and then understand how you get back your state of balanced flow is one of life's joys. So you see balance is much more complex and is a dynamic state of being. If you feel like you need to work on your balance and are seeking something more in life, get in "}
