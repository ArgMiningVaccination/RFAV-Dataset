In determining whether you acted as a \"reasonable layperson\" as described above, y our TPA will consider the following factors: A reasonable person's belief that the circumstances required immediate medical care that could not wait until the next working day or the next available appointment. The time of day the care was provided. The presenting symptoms. Any circumstance that prevented you from using established procedures for obtaining Emergency Health Services. Benefit Certification/Prior Authorization is not required for Emergency Health Services.

Ambulance Service (ground or air) to the coroner's office or to a mortuary is not c overed, unless the ambulance had been dispatched prior to the pronouncement of death by an individual authorized under state law to make such pronouncements. In determining whether you \"acted in good faith\" as a \"reasonable layperson\" when obtaining emergency Ambulance Services, your TPA will take the following factors into consid eration: Whether you required Emergency Health Services, as defined above. The presenting symptoms.

This rule applies to any and all monies a Participant may receive from any third party or insurer, or from any uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance benefits, as well as from any other person, organizati on or entity. By way of illustration only, your Plan's right of subrogation includes, but is not limited to, the right to be repaid when a Participant recovers money for personal injury sustained in a car accident. The subrogation right applies whether th e Participant recovers directly from the wrongdoer or from the wrongdoer's insurer, or from the Participant's uninsured motorist insurance c overage. The Participant agrees to sign and deliver to the TPA , on behalf of the Plan, such documents and papers as may be necessary to protect the Plan's subrogation right.

Settlement of a legal claim or controversy without prior notice to your TPA , on the Plan's behalf, is a violation of this Plan . In the event a Particip ant fails to cooperate with the TPA or takes any action, through agents or otherwise, to interfere with the exercise of the Plan's subrogation right, the Plan may recover its benefit payments from that Participant. When reasonable collection costs and rea sonable legal expenses have been incurred in recovering sums which benefit both the Participant and the Plan , the Plan will, upon request by the Participant or the Participant's attorney, share such collection costs and legal expenses, in a manner that is fair and equitable, but only if the plan receives appropriate documentation of such collection costs and legal expenses. Appeals and Grievance s APPEALS FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 84 Your TPA will administer Level I and Level II appeals on behalf of the Plan according to the procedures set forth below. These procedures apply to appeals of adverse benefit determinations based on medical necessity, appropriateness, healthcare setting level of care, effectiveness of a Covered Service , and/or rescission of coverage in the event of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact. (Note: your TPA responds to all urgent or expedited requests within 24 hours of receiving the request.) Level I Appeals To initiate a Level I appeal, a Plan Participant (all references to Participant in the Appeals and Grievance section of the PBB include the Employee and/or covered Dependent(s)) must submit a request for an appeal to the TPA within 180 days of receipt of a notice of denial of items or services under the Plan. The Participant must tell the TPA the reason why the denial should be overturned and include any information supporting the appeal. The TPA will acknowledge to the Participant in writing within one (1) working day that it has received a request for an Appeal. The acknowledgement letter will contain the name, address, and direct telephone number of an individual at the TPA who may be contacted regarding the appeal. Timeframes for Processing Appeals of Adverse Determinations Level I appeals involving the review of a denial of coverage for services before they are received (pre - service) will be completed within 15 calendar days of receipt of a standard appeal request. Appeals involving the review of a denial of coverage of services after they are received (post - service) will be complete d within 40 calendar days. The TPA may extend the review period for a maximum of 10 calendar days for pre - service requests and 20 calendar days for post - service requests if the TPA can: 1) show reasonable cause beyond the TPA's control for the delay; 2) ca n show that the delay will not result in increased medical risk to the Participant; and 3) provide a written progress report to the Participant and the related provider within the 25 - day or 60 - day review period. Participants must agree, in writing, to a re quest to extend a deadline. Some appeals of pre - service denials relating to claims involving urgent care are processed on an expedited basis. Expedited decisions are made when a Participant's life or health, or ability to regain maximum function, would be jeopardized by following the standard appeal process and time frames; or, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of the Participant's medical condition, would subject the Participant to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. In cases that require an expedited decision of a pre - service request, based at the request of a participating provider or Participant, a decision will be made within 72 hours of the receipt of the request. The TPA will not conduct expedited appeals for services already provided (\"post service\") to a Participant. If a Participant requests an expedited decision, the TPA medical director will review the request. If the medical director determines that the request for an expedited appeal is medically necessary, a decision will be made within 72 hours of the request. All required information will be transmitted between the TPA, the applicable FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 85 provider, and the Participant by the quickest means possible. If the medic al director determines that a request for an expedited appeal is not medically necessary, the TPA will notify the applicable Participant and then process the appeal within 15 calendar days. Internal Review of Appeal of Adverse Determination by Medical Director Level I The appeal will be reviewed by the TPA medical director not involved in the initial determination, nor by a subordinate of the person resolving the claim initially. The medical director will re - review the request to make a determination r egarding whether the requested healthcare services are medically necessary and covered under the Plan. If medical judgment is involved, the TPA medical director will utilize input from a healthcare professional with training and experience in the relevant field. Notice of Decision on Appeal of Adverse Determination by Medical Director If the medical director decides to reverse an initial adverse determination, the TPA will approve coverage of the services. The applicable Participant and the applicable pr ovider will be notified by mail or electronic means (fax, email, etc.) within two (2) calendar days of such decision. If the medical director decides to uphold an initial adverse determination, the applicable Participant and the applicable provider will b e notified by telephone within 24 hours that the adverse determination has been upheld and by written or electronic means within one (1) working day of the telephone notification. Written notification must be provided in a linguistically appropriate manner . The notice will provide the opportunity to request diagnosis and treatment codes and their meanings.

If the Participant does not wish to pursue the appeal, the TPA wi ll mail to the participant written notification of the decision and confirmation of the Participant's decision not to pursue the appeal within three (3) calendar days of the medical director's decision. If the TPA is unable to contact the Participant by telephone within seventy - two (72) hours after making the decision to uphold the initial adverse determination, then the TPA will notify the Participant by mail of the decision. Included in the notification will be a self - addressed stamped response letter which asks whether the Participant wants to pursue the Level II appeal by asking the Participant to check \"yes\" or \"no\" on the letter. If the Participant does not return the letter within 10 calendar days, the TPA will again try to contact the Participant by telephone. If the Participant does not respond to the TPA's telephone calls and does not return the response letter within 20 calendar days of the written notification to uphold the initial decision, the TPA will close the file, documenting that the Par ticipant has not responded. If the appeal was processed on an expedited basis, then a Level II appeal will automatically proceed. This review will be completed within 72 hours. If an FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 86 expedited review is conducted during a Participant's stay or course of treatment, coverage for healthcare services will be continued subject to applicable co - payments and deductibles until the TPA makes a decision and notifies the Participant. If the Participant does not make an immediate decision to pursue a Level II appeal, or if the Participant requests additional time to supply supporting documents or information, the timeframes described above for completing an appeal will be extended to include the additional time the Participant needs. Internal Panel Review of Advers e Determination - Level II If the Participant requests a Level II appeal, then the TPA will conduct the appeal on behalf of Employer according the process set forth below.

If the Participant c hooses to have legal representation at the hearing, the Participant must notify the TPA prior to the hearing. Failure to notify may require rescheduling of the hearing within the timeframe allowed to complete the appeal. If the TPA or Employer has an atto rney present to protect its interests, a notice will advise the Participant of that and advising that the Participant may wish to obtain legal representation of his or her own. The TPA will notify the Participant of this at least three (3) calendar days be fore the hearing.

For claims involving urgent care, a Participant may request an expedited external review if the adverse benefit determination involves a medical condition of the Participant for which the regular time frame w ould seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Participant or would jeopardize the Participant's ability to regain maximum function, and the Participant filed a request for an expedited internal appear; or, if the final internal adverse benefit determ ination involved a situation where the Participant had a medical condition where that time frame would pose such jeopardy, and if the final internal adverse benefit determination concerned an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or healthcare s ervice for which the Participant received emergency services and was not discharged from a facility. Individuals in urgent care situations and individuals receiving an ongoing course of treatment may proceed with an expedited external review by an IRO at the same time as the internal review process occurs. There are no fees or costs imposed on a Participant for the external review of an appeal.
