The program is organized to encourage youth to attend their court hearings and begin planning for a future of hope. Part of the day's activities includes giving youth information about available resources that will help them when they transition out of care. The foster youth's resource caregivers, social workers, GALs, and CASAs are also invited to attend. The event kicks off with a welcome from Senior Fam ily Court Judge R. Mark Browning. Throughout the day, former foster youth share their experiences of gr owing up in foster care and encourage youth to pur- sue their dreams; they emphasize the importance of p lanning for a successful future and encourage the younger foster youth to make good use of the many opportunities that are availab le to them. Prizes and incentives are given out to further enliven the program, and each youth leaves with a backpack or duffel bag filled with useful items and a $20 gift card. A healthy lunch is served to model nutritious food choices. Representatives from resource and support organiza tions provide valuable information for youth and adults alike. After a brief presentation from each or ganization, the participants visit courtrooms in which representatives from resource organizations are availab le to answer any questions and register youth for services. To help take the mystery out of court, a mock hearin g is held in one of the courtrooms. There is a Q & A during and after the hearing when foster youth and resource families are invited to ask judges questions about the court hearing experience and for judges to discuss why it is important for the youth to participate in their hearings. When youth and social workers were asked if hearing from the former foster youth was helpful for them, there has been an overwhelmingly positive response. Some of the individual comments are below, the first two from current foster youth an d the third from a social worker: I cried, it made me so happy because sometimes people like me feel like giving up, but there are people that have gone through the same things as I did and they are doing great things. One is going to law school! I can't use my experience as an excuse now be-cause if they can do it, I can do it. It was good for me to look at successful people coming out of CPS - they're not bad kids like everyone says they are. We're always looking for what will flip the switch for the kids. I think these speakers really helped a lot of the kids.

A child's brain is affected by what they eat more than any other organ. Eating healthy foods and avoiding a few key ingredients can help regulate a child's attitude, improve school performance, promote better sleep and improve overall health. Kid-friendly guide to healthy eating . Dr. Bill Sear, a world-renowned pediatrician and author, developed Traffic Light Eating - a concept that toddlers through teenagers can follow. Green light foods are go and grow foods , and generally can be consumed in any amount. Yellow light foods may be eaten nearly every day, but can slow you down if over- consumed. You should stop and think before eating red light foods , as they lack nutritional value and do harm. Some examples: Green light foods: Fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, water Yellow light foods: Chicken, fish, whole grain bread/pasta/cereal, brown rice, nuts, yogurt, milk, juice Red light foods: Fried chicken, ice cream, soda, hamburger, foods with \"no\" ingredients (see below) A few additional tips for using nutrition as medicine for your child's behavior: Brainy breakfast. A proper breakfast will result in more stable behavior, improved brain function, less anxiety, better test scores, and support weight control. Key elements include protein, carbs with fiber, low sugar, and healthy fats. Healthy fats for healthy brains. Omega 3 fatty acids, found in fish, avocado, flax seed, nuts, etc. are a necessary part of brain development and function. These healthy fats allow for faster communication between nerve cells, stabilize and ele-vate mood, increase attention span, and decrease aggression during times of stress. Play every day. Besides being physically healthy, play is emotionally healthy. Exercise releases \"happy hormones\". Fidgety children should be encouraged to be active...play WITH them. Hydrate with water. Children will think more clearly and have more energy when properly hydrated. Hydrating with sugary drinks doesn't quench thirst! Sugar can cause tantrums , foggy thinking, and impair the immu ne system for hours at a time. TIP: Dilute 100% fruit juice with water (gradual ly increase dilution to more water than juice). Know the No's . A few ingredients have such negative affects on children's behavior and health that it is suggested you avoid them altogether; any food containing them is a red light food . These ingredients include high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils (trans fats), and artificial flavors & colors. Before making major changes to your diet, it is best to check with your medical professional. This training will be offered again! See the Calendar of Events on page 13 for details!

Katherine's Delicious Spinach~Green Pea Casserole By Stephanie Jurgenson, Board Certified Holistic Health Coach Your Children Are What They Eat: The Effect of Diet on Children's Behavior Who was this outsider who arrived in Hawai'i a mere 17 years ago to take over a prestigious private school? Did he possess the qualifications to see its expansion into a full educational institution, spanning pre-school to high school? Would this visionary leader be able to bring sufficient sustained, practical initiative, high standards, and perseverance? Could he relate to the larger community in raising the necessary funds to see the expansion of the school campus incorporating a middle school, elementary and preschool? Could he lead his school to competency in technological advances and teaching innovations, alongside Iolani and Punahou? If so, where did such accomplishments come from? Joe Rice is a story waiting to be told . . . which is exactly what he plans to do now that he has retired from Mid-Pacific Institute and moved to Washington state. Joe's story, told succinctly, begins in Tacoma, WA, born to a teenage mother. His military father abandoned his mother when he learned she was pregnant. Two stepfathers later, Joe realized that life was a continuous journey, especially a struggle, as their migrant family (11 children) moved from orchard to orchard. \"We were on welfare forever,\" he reflects now some fifty years later. Pic king grapes, apples and walnuts was part of Joe's vagabond youth, but his most indelible impressions were with his alcoholic stepfat her. Joe's mother was continually beaten by him, and Joe, wanting to protect her, also found himself to be the object of his father' s inebri- ated rage. Eventually, as a teenager, Joe was placed in a resource home. Looking back in retrospect, he philosophically puts it in perspective: \"Hate consumes you,\" he says. \"I never was able to make peace with my father, but I've changed these negatives into positives through service to the communities where I've lived.\" Joe set his goal to be a social worker, but education became his ticket to liberation and service. Motivated to learn, he graduated from Tacoma Com- munity College, then the University of Washington, working at whatever jobs he could to pay his bills. Along the way, he quick ly ac- knowledges, there were many supporters of his personal goals, like the woman during his senior year in high school who fought t o keep him from being drafted. Instead of a military career, Joe joined the Peace Corps so he could help educate others less fortunate than he. His training brought him to Hawai'i and equipped him to serve two years in Afghanistan and then two more in the Micronesian islands of the Marianas. Here he married and later, as a government employee, established the Hawai'i English Program in the South Pacific, which brough t him often to Hawai'i. His home state of Washington eventually provided him with further experience in the classroom, and then as an administrator in an elementary school. Especially satisfying was his work in establishing a school for migrant children, build ing upon his own personal experience. Thereafter, encouraged by that success, he sought to do a similar task in El Salvador, but was thw arted due to political unrest. Hawai'i was destined to be his crow ning achievement in educational development, an d Mid-Pacific Institute the fortunate locatio n of his vision and ambitions. In 1996, he accepted the position of President and CEO at MPI. Here, over the past 17 years, he has ener- getically and creatively been increasing the school's technological competence, along with teaching innovations, designed espec ially to promote problem-solving and focused research through self-directed projects. What was formerly only a campus for high schoo l students has now incorporated a middle school, an elemen tary school and a preschool. Taki ng risks has never been challenging f or Joe, given his life experience in having to adapt for survival. He knows firsthand the need for change, and was successful in leading his own life journey through it--unpromising as it often was--and then his own school which he loves so much. Now, Joe Rice has returned full-circle to the state of his birth and formative development, to care for his family . . . and to reflect. Eventually his story, especially the pain and lessons from his childhood, will be told openly, honestly, and without regret. O ne of his final efforts before leaving Hawai'i was to establish a scholarship fund for \"kids just like myself.\" Besides his legacy at Mi d-Pacific Institute, Joe served on the Board of Family Programs Hawai'i, wanting to directly be involved with youth with challenged pasts and to be an inspiring role model for staff as well as youth. Hawai'i has benefitted greatly from this tireless worker, this voice not afraid to speak up, this visionary who knew from whenc e he had come. He was not \"your common Joe,\" but your most uncommon soul who could lead because of his past. \"All of these things molded me,\" he often said. Throughout his career he spoke unap ologetically, and he did so with his own personal touch. Hawai' i will continue to be blessed.

Contact Line (Mon-Fri 8:30 RFSS Family Resource Specialist Resource Family Support Services (RFSS) is funded by the Department of Human Services It has been a busy couple of months prepar ing for the Statewide Annual Conferences, but I was grateful for the many new resource families th at called the Warm Line for the first time. It was a great way of introducing the support se rvice to the callers since many asked the ques- tion, \"What is the Warm Line and what do you do?\" The Warm Line is an additional support for resource caregivers th at offers referrals that can help with childcare subsidies, enhancement funds, respite and other resources as needed. We also maintain and provide a resource manual for families online at www.FamilyProgramsHawaii.org . If you have any questions regarding th e children in your care, the Warm Line has a wealth of information and contacts that can assist. The Care to Share project, which matches items needed by resource families for children in thei r care with donors who want to donate their items to a family, is operated by the Warm Line. We also provide information about upcoming trainings, and alter native trainings which can be taken to fulfill the DHS training hours requirement. We can also help you borrow video copies of past train- ings. The Warm Line also assists with registering families for trainings, support groups, and other events organ-ized by Family Programs Hawai'i Resource Families Su pport Services and other partner agencies and commit- tees. The Warm Line is available statewide via a toll free number at 1-866-545-088 2 or on O'ahu at 545-1130, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p. m. I'm looking forward to hearing from you! Lorie Naftel Teen Day:Dream4Real (cont.) Neurobiology of Trust and Mistrust When asked what they most liked about Teen Day, the youth have said: Seeing people I knew and meeting new people. I liked it all but especially meet ing new friends who can understand me. We've stayed in touch. Having fun with people I didn't know. It was a good experience. I met kids that go through what I go through. I saw twins from my school and I never know they were in foster care. It was helpful. Honestly, it was good. It was the highpoint of my summer. The planning committee for this event includ es former foster youth, Judiciary representatives from both the Family Court of the First Circuit and the Intermediate Court of Appeals, the Court Improvem ent Project, the Hawai'i Departme nt of Human Services, a guard ian ad litem, and community organizations. A goal of the committee is to have Teen Days held throughout the State. For upcoming Teen Day Events, visit www.ittakesanohana.org and click on their calendar. Learning to trust, or mistrust, others, is a lesson that begins ve ry early in LIFE. Trust vs. Mistrust is a lesson that does n ot require think- ing or language; it is an emotional experien ce. The development of basic trust in othe r people begins before we have language, before birth. This is a lesson that relies on what we ca ll implicit memory; facial expr ession, tone of voice, body language, eye contact, the gentleness or harshness of a touch. The youngest child knows whether he is wanted or not, whether he ca n trust this caretaker or not. When our youngest children learn that they cannot depend on the caretaker, when they are handed off in adoption, placed into an other foster home, shipped off to a friend's apartment for the night, th is youngest child learns to defend himself from the caretaker he cannot trust. This 'caretaker' is now a new resour ce caregiver, adoptive mom or dad, aunt or uncle, grandparent or friend; and our yo ungest child knows better than to trust and be hurt ag ain. \"Our\" youngest, and oldest child, and all of them in-between will require the hi ghly Emo- tionally Regulated Parent in order to rebuild the neuronal connects needed to trust. These connections can be rewired through brain based parenting and target ed clinical interventions. Nobody is beyond the hope of healing. Given the regulated environment, the regulat ed parent with a trauma informed and re gulated clinician for support, no child is b eyond the hope of attachment and healing. Emotional Regulatory Healing is a respons e to 'our' children wounded through the trauma of abus e and neglect, as well as the trauma of adoption. This week, begin with Slow and Low: speak qu ietly, slow down your body movements; lower your tone of voice, sit down and slow d own more with your children. As you calm your body and brain, so too, in time, will your children calm theirs. Do this for one full week and watch the transiti on from Chaos to Calm begin in your home.

Wonderful events took place statewide, all with the same goal, to honor and thank the compassionate people who make a difference in the lives of Hawai'i's children and families. O'AHU PACT Keiki Day Every year Parents and Children Together (PACT) looks for volunteers to help them sell a special edition of The Honolulu Star Advertiser's Parents and Children To gether Keiki Day newspaper to raise funds for their programs. On May 8, 2013, the Foster Care Training Committee (FCTC) assisted in this community en- deavor. Through this committee, there were repres entatives from the Depart ment of Human Services, Queen Lili'uokalani Children' s Center, Family Programs Hawai'i - It Takes An 'Ohana, Catholic Charities Hawai'i and Partners in Development Foundation. There was much support from patrons who bought papers, provided additional donations, tooted their hor ns and gave thanks for the services provided to children and families. It was a fun day for a worthy cause. A Day on Secret Island On May 4, 2013, resource families, former foster and guardianship youth spent the day at Kualoa Ranch's \"Secret Island\" to celebrat e National Foster Care Month. Families enjoyed canoe paddling, volleyball, kayaking, swimming, standup paddle boarding, snorke ling, relaxing on the beach and meeting old and new friends. This was a day for our 'Ohana to relax and enjoy the beauty of our precious 'aina. Resource caregivers and adopted parents reported: \"Now days, it's so hard to find a place to take the kids wher e everyone can enjoy together, but you guys did it! Secret Is- land was perfect! It was such a wonderful event! My yo ungest commented that it was probably one of the top 10 days of his life! My teen daughter enjoyed playing a little volleyba ll, cruising on the hammock, and going on a boat ride. My middle one loved stand up paddling, played with new friends, and even got to co nnect with his biological sister who was adopted by another family! Thank you so much to everyone who made this event happen!\" \"I would personally like to Thank you and everyone involved in this past week-end Secret Island Event for the Resource Families. My two girls remembered from last year how fun it was to meet other kids there and the bonding was more memorable than ever. The staff again was \"Outstanding\" in pr oviding our safety and assura nce that we were also fed well. We can never Thank you enough for what all of you do for the children of tomorrow. Again, you are all the Guardian Angels in their Hearts.\" With almost 50% of children in fo ster care being Native Hawaiian, this event also helped resource families connect the children in their care to their cultural roots. The Foster Care Training Committee, who planned this event, would like to thank our community partners, Wells Fargo Hawai'i, the Glue committee and Qu een Lili'uokalani Children's Center, for he lping make this great event possible! KAUA'I NFCM Proclamation Event Kaua'i Mayor, Bernard Carvalho Jr., pr esented a beautifully framed procla- mation to celebrate National Foster Ca re Month. Represented were re- source caregivers, social workers, and auxilary support service staff. 2013 NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH EVENTS MAUI Whole Foods Display and Sign Waving Events This year, Whole Foods offered Hui Ho'omalu the opportunity to have an informational table at their Kahului store for the entire mont h. We had a great spot in the store where the majority of folks walk by on their way out and/or to grab utensils for their deli- cious grocery gatherings. The table had a colo rful display of pictures, information, and blue ribbons to celebrate those who foster and to encourage others to inquire about foster- ing. In addition to the month-long display, we also had two great sign-waving events that were bursting with color and enthusiasm from our partners at Catholic Charities, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and the Depart ment of Human Servic es - Child Welfare staff, as well as some wonderful resource ca regivers -- all willing to show their support f o r M a u i ' s F o s t e r C a r e C o m m u n i t y .

Mostly all who attended the workshop rated it excellent and meaningful, indicating they would definitely recommend it to others. In addition to the workshop, representatives from various agencies in the community, including Caregivers and foster youth, participated in a sign-waving activity to thank resource caregi vers and highlight foster care and child abuse prevention EAST HAWAI'I Mahalo Dinner and NFCM Proclamations Each year the month of May is recognized across the country as Na tional Foster Care Month. The East Hawai'i Friends of Foster Fami- lies showed appreciation for the dedication of resource caregivers who care for children and youth by hosting a Mahalo Dinner. The East Hawai'i Friends of Foster Families consists of Partner agencies: Department of Human Services, Neighborhood Place of Puna, Catholic Char ities Hawai'i-SRF, Catholic Charities Hawai'i-NO P, Hale Kipa, Hawai'i Behavioral Health, Partners in Development Foundation-Hui Ho'omalu, The Salvation Army-Family Intervention Services. These agencies recognize the trem endous efforts of success in regards to those committed to the foster care mission. This year's annual dinner was held on May 10 , 2013 at the Church of the Holy Cross. The Resource Caregivers in Hilo were pr esented with a procla mation recognizing May as National Foster Care Month by Mayor Billy Kenoi. Kevin Dayton, the Executive Assistant to Mayor Kenoi and also a licensed resource caregiver, presented the procla-mation on behalf of the County of Hawai'i. Senator Kahele also presented a proclama- tion on behalf of the State Senate. Page 7 Building Connections Volume 6, Issue 4 Dear Reader, Thanks to a Federally funded, three year grant awarded under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, EPIC 'Ohana recently created a manual entitled: Maintaining Connections: The Valu es Behind Family Engagement Practices Within the Child Wel- fare System . Maintaining Connections is not a typical \"how to\" manual which outlines the technical st eps and procedures of a particular program. Instead it is a ma nual which articulates the values that inform EPIC's work and honors the Hawaiian cu ltural influences and mainland perspectives that permeate it. It's a \"how to\" manual of a different order: one that speaks of the impulses behind the actions - the heart of the work - rather than the nuts and bolts of it. For those of us at EPIC, it is an articulation of the ground that we stand on. Below is an excerpt from one chapter: Value 1: Children have a right to know and be connected to their families. To read the entire chapter and manual go to: http://www.epicohana.org/resour ces/grant%20manual%20web.pdf. While Maintaining Connections depicts EPIC's values, we know those values are rooted in the al oha spirit of Hawai'i - the spir it each of you embodies daily in your care of Hawai'i's foster keiki and their families. To each of you, the staff at EPIC say \"mahalo\" for the work you do and for being such outstanding partners in our efforts. We know it really does take a communi ty 'Ohana to diminish the hearta che and damage of child abuse an d neglect. After reading this excerpt or the manual, please feel free to cont act EPIC with any comments, quest ions, or concerns. We always welcome feedbac k and the oppor- tunity to grow. Once again, mahalo and aloha, Wilma Friesema and the EPIC `Ohana Manual Writing Team 808/748-7921 'Ohana Connections Corner: New Family Engagement Manual Page 8 Building Connections Volume 6, Issue 4 Maintaining Connections: The Values Behind Family Engagement Practices Within the Child Welfare System Value 1: Children have a right to know and be connected to their families. Throughout the world it's universally accepted that families are the building blocks of society. It's within our families that we feel loved and a sense of belonging; where we learn the inti mate dance of give and take and are encouraged to become healthy, responsible adults. It's within ou r families that we learn to be an individu al yet part of a grou p - which is an essential stepping stone to becomi ng a positive citizen. In the Hawaiian tradition, family has always been central to a sense of identity and spirituality. Traditional Hawaiian practices and teach- ings wove a deep relational wisdom into the daily lives and spiritual practices of its people. From the Hawaiian perspective, an individual no more stands alone on this island than a tree stands alone in a forest. Each of us is interconnected with the community surr ounding us, and with our ancestors who have prov ided the seed and spark of life. In the Hawaiian beliefs, Akua , the great spirit, is transmitted through one's ancestors an d it is through them one is given the breath of life. Ancient Hawaiian chants were often recitations of the names of ancestors throughout many generati ons; invoking ancestors' names called in their strength and spirit. It also s howed respect and appreciation for the past while acknowledging the present is but a pr ecursor to the future. Who a person is today is born from the pa st and will impact the generations that follow. Within the rich and complex Hawaiian traditions of honoring ancest ors, there is one teaching, in particular, that captures the essence of 'Ohana Connections and fami ly engagement work. That is the teaching of the piko. Piko literally means belly button or umbilical co rd, but it also refers to th e essence or center that bi nds us to our family and an cestors. On a physical and metaphorical level it is the co rd of life; providing us with nutrients from our mother, but also genetic, cultur al, and spiritual nutrients passed down from our elders thro ugh our parents. It's the unspeakable prim al connection we feel with our blood kin t hat courses through the very cells of our body. Just as developing fetuses cannot grow without an umbilical cord, children cannot adequately grow without a strong piko or attachment, and adults rarely thrive wit hout a sense of belonging and rootedness. The piko is at the heart of our deepest sense of security and be longing. Through it we get our fa mily's values, history, and love. (Continued on pg 9) Page 9 Building Connections Volume 6, Issue 4 According to Hawaiian teachings, unresolved emotional issues, unbearable stress, drug abuse, or other personal limitations create knots, or hihia, in the piko which limit the flow of positive, nurturing en ergy and create an imbalance within relation- ships. Though there is still a family at tachment, despite the hurt and tangled emot ions, the quality of the connection is com- promised, sometimes with only a thread of positive connection remaining. The ancient Hawaiians developed a way to address this problem. As islanders, they were highly attuned to the necessity of pono (balance) in all aspects of life so they developed the ho'oponopono to work through the hihia within relationships. As a practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, the ho'oponopono's purpose is to untangle the interpersonal knots of mi sunderstanding and conflict so connection and harmony can be restored. While the content of the conflict is im portant, the real focus is on healing the relationship. The work of family engageme nt can be summed up as the attempt to identify the piko and undo the hihia in that family's piko so that they can, once again, be attached and secure in their connection with each other. We'v e found the greater the disconnection - the m ore pro- found the abuse or neglect, or the longer the family has been apart - the larger the hihia in the piko. In cases of significant disconnect, 'Ohana Connections work provides close and on-goin g support to the youth and families to wo rk through their hihia. This is especially true when there have been years of separation and fears of re-engag ing with the Child Welfare Sys- tem and/or possible family rejection are ru nning high. Stressing the reality and validity of the family's connection or piko, despite the many years of separation, is an important foundational piece. A former therapist and ho'oponopono practitioner, who often worked with our staff, would te ll families, \"The piko is your tie to each other. No piece of paper, no order from the state can sever your piko. Only the family members can make that choice for themselves.\" This was an especially powerful message for Kealoha and her daug hter, Pua. Pua was 16-years old when EPIC's Connections Specia list began working with her. Pua had entered care when she was six, and was in contact wi th only one sister who was living on the m ainland. The last time she had seen other relatives was at her father's fune ral when she was seven. At that time she didn't know if she wasn't living with family because it wasn't \"allowed\" or because they had rejected her. An internet search located 42 relatives who lived on O'ahu and Maui. The family was excited about reconnecting with Pua, and a fter much prep work visits were set up with cousins, aunts, and grandparents on both isla nds. A highlight was when Pua, who believe d her maternal grandmother had died long ago, discovered grandmother was still alive. \"Is it really you, Tutu ?\" Pua asked as she hugged her grandmother tight. Though all the new connections were very ex citing, Pua confided she really wanted to see her mom. The Connections Specialist l ocated Kealoha, Pua's mom, and met with her several times. Kealoha was doing well; she was sobe r, working, and trying to find housing , but, she admitted, she struggled to maintain a stable life due to inte rmittent domestic violence and drug use. She was getting supp ort and counseling, she said, which helped her feel opti mistic that this time could be different. Pua's treatment team voiced concerns about Pua reconnecting with her mom, but they also knew it was important. Pua's therapist , the ho'oponopono practitioner, suggested he an d the Connections Specialist use ho'oponopono to create a safe space for a first meeting and to set the stage for further healing to occur. The treatment team agreed. To begin, the therapist and Connecti ons Specialist met with Pua and Kealoha separately to talk abou t the painful past, the ho'oponopono process, and what the mother and da ughter hoped would be the outcome. The preparatory meetings with Kealoha were especially important. Pua had some hard questions she wanted to ask her mom; it was likely much hurt and anger would be expressed. When Kealoha was forewarned of the question s she became defensive and minimized her ro le in her daughter's suffering. Th is alarmed the therapist as he feared Kealoha mi ght invalidate her daught er's experience, which would be yet another injury to Pua. The therapist and Connections Specialist addr essed Kealoha's fears and pain underneath the defensiveness. They assured her the ho'oponopono wasn't about judgment; it was an opportunity for healing. The best way she co uld help, they said, was for her to listen to he r daughter with an open mind and heart, and take responsibility to whatever degree she co uld. They empathized with Kealoha's gui lt and the burden she had carried, while stressing this was an opportunity to right some past wrongs. Kealoha softened and said she understood. She agreed the Connect ions Specialist, whom she trusted, could remind her to stop an d listen to Pua if she became defensive. The day of the ho'oponopono arrived. Kealoha and Pua ran to each other and hugged without a breath of hesitation. They both cried and said they were sorry. Kealoha reassure d Pua she had nothing to be sorry about. \"It was me who failed you,\" she said. (Continued on pg 10) 'Ohana Connections Corner (cont.) When they were ready, the ho'oponopono began with a pule (prayer) asking for guidance, wisdom, and support so mother and daughter could heal their wounds. The therapist talked about the piko, and the profound bond that Kealoha and Pua shared. He also talked about the hihia and the purpose of the ho'oponopono session. The time came for Pua and Kealoha to talk about what happened. Pua was scared to speak up; Keal oha encouraged her, saying noth ing said would be wrong or too much. Gradually Pua began to descri be the childhood abuse and subseque nt pain of being in foster ca re. \"Why did you hurt me so much?\" Pua cried. \"Why didn't you take better care of me?\" Kealoha started to make excuses, but with a gentle reminder she quickly caught herself. As she listened, she responded to Pua with more and more empathy and stated clearly that Pua had just been a ch ild. She and Pua's father had failed, she said, and she was dee ply sorry. Kealoha then shared some of her own childh ood abuse experiences. This was done, not out of defensiveness, but as a way to give Pua a fuller understanding of the family's pain and to share that she intimate ly knew the heartache of abuse. The time of forgiveness followed. The therapist shared how high ly the ancient Hawaiians valued forgiveness; once forgiveness w as granted and received the matter was considered truly settled. But, he explained, both the re quest for forgiveness and the gra nting of it had to be sincere in order for pono to be restored. He acknowledged that for Pua an d Kealoha, with their long history of separation and hurt, forgiveness would likely be a long proc ess. That day they were taking a beginning step, a choice of direction for both of them. Kealoha admitted her wrong-doing and directly asked Pua for her forgiveness. Pua tried, several times, to say it was her fault, but Kealoha firmly told her she had been a child and she was innocent. Pua, through her tears, told her mom she loved her and that she was choosing to forgive her. Kealoha cried, an d said she loved Pua too and always had. Kealoha went over to Pua and held her tigh t as her daughter broke down and wept. When Pua's tears were spent, th ey shared their gifts and a prayer was offered. Food was shared, and a plan for their next cont act was made. They both expressed gratitude for the ho'oponopono - a new experience for both of them - and said it had felt comforting and pow- erful to have their ancestral tradition be part of their coming together. As everyone ate and talked story the ho'oponopono came to its own natural end. Pua and Kealoha continue to have contact, four years later. They've had many ups and downs as they work through the old hihia in their relationship and contend with newly created ones. The ho'oponopono did give them a positive start, how ever, and helped them reclaim their love and attachment to each other. EPIC strongly adheres to the truth so simply and elegantly captured in the concept of the piko - families are innate ly attached and will continue to have that unspoken bond unless one or the other has chosen to let it go. EPIC also believes in the empowerment of the family inherent in the idea of the piko. Even in families where parental rights have been terminated, ma ny youth, like Pua, continue to have strong emotional ties to parents, si blings, grandparents, aunties, uncles, and co usins. This strong emotional tie is exte nded to, and includes, hnai (adopted/nourished) relatives as well. As we practice and promote the engagement of biological and hnai relatives, working through the hihia in the family's piko is often a bumpy and challenging process. Safety c oncerns, personal limitations, mental health needs, and unrealistic expectations are co ntinually addressed each step of the way. Through the ups and downs howeve r, we find adhering to the fundamental truth so eloquently cap tured by the ancient Hawaiians gives our work its own kind of piko. As we respect and embrace the import ance of family connections, we draw on and find strength in that deep reservoi r of traditional Hawaiian values that elevate one's family ties to such an essential ingredient for personal balance and well-being.

Page 11 Building Connections Volume 6, Issue 4 The 6th Annual Conferences for Resource Families, \"Pathways to Healin g: Understanding the Truama Be hind the Behavior\" took place this year in West Hawai'i, East Hawai'i, Maui, Kaua'i, and O'ahu during the mont hs of May and June. Our speakers from Project Keala- hou, a program of the Department of Health , presented information on Trauma-Informed Ca re, a way of looking at behaviors and ex - periences of children and youth who have experienced some form of trauma. Tia Roberts, Paula Quealy, Crystal Brown, Kerry Caus ey, and Brandee Aukai spoke of how viewing situations from a trauma-i nformed lens can help us find appropriate solutions and help c hildren heal. Becoming trauma informed involves a purposeful understanding of how behaviors are connected to a person's trauma history . Responding in a trauma-informed way can be the world of difference between helpin g a child feel safe vers us unsafe and between helping a child heal versus re-traumatizing them. Our speakers also discussed the importance of self care. Becaus e doing this work and hearing traumatic stories can have an imp act on us, it is important to recognize the signs of vicarious trauma and its slow changes of ou r own behaviors and attitudes. Families l earned that committing to self care can help us mana ge our own stress, and keep us motivated and inspired in helping children on their path s to heal- ing.

Carol Evans & Jade Lam Page 12 Building Connections Volume 6, Issue 4 Adoptive Families Needed Through Wendy's Wonderful Kids We are featuring Amy in this newsletter who is currently in foster care and legally free for adoption. Please help spread the w ord. Amy is a 15 year-old girl in need of an adoptive home that can embrace her unique qualities. She wants to be loved and cared for and desperately wants to belong and be accepted. She is of Hawaiian and Caucasian decent and is a Christian. Amy has a great smile, is friendly, loving, thoughtful, and sweet. She is funny and has a good sense of humor with a great bel ly laugh. Amy is outgoing and talka- tive and will stop to chat with anyone. She loves to read and particularly enjoyed the Twilight series, the Hunger Games, and books by Ellen Hopkins and Cassan- dra Clare. Amy also loves listening to music of all kinds, enjoys movies, doing art work, hanging out with friends, and going to the beach. Like many other teens, Amy enjoys getting manicures, pedicures, and make-up. Onion rings and li hing mui treats are some of her favorite foods. Amy loves animals, little children, and the elderly. She is protective and loyal to those she cares about. She tries to make people feel better. Amy has struggled in school and does better in a small group with 1:1 instruction, preferably in an alternative academic setting. She reads at a high school level, while she struggles in math, which is her least favorite subject. Amy has challenges with impulse control. In the past, she lashed out before thinking and has difficulty calming down once she is upset. With proper guidance, Amy may learn different coping strategies. Amy would like a family who is nonjudgmental. As she has been so negatively and harshly judged all her life, she needs someone who is patient and calm, nurtur- ing, and straight-forward. Amy does not like dishonesty. Amy also has a tendency to test for genuineness, so a family will ne ed to be committed even during diffi- cult times. She needs a family who will treat her with respect, while still being able to set appropriate rules and follow thr ough with consequences for her. Amy needs a family who will support her through present and future decisions that need to be made in her life. A family with fe w children that can provide extreme patience, structure, consistency, predictability, calm mannerisms, and role modeling would best meet her needs. If you are interested in learning more about Amy, please contact Katie Joosse at Family Programs Hawai'i at (808) 540-2552. On June 28, 2013, the State of Hawai'i held its first ever National Reunification Month Event. National Reunification Month, recognized by the American Bar Association, Center on Chil-dren and the Law, and other national organizations, celebrates both the importance of and successful reunification of families involved with child welfare services. Though the national movement recognizes that reunification is achievable through collaboration among the family and the community, Hawai'i's event emphasized a \"team effort\" theme. A family, who had been involved with child welfare services but has since successfully reunified, was honored along with Maui Child Welfare Services and other team support members. Hawai'i's inaugural event, held on the island of Maui, was graciously hosted by the Queen Lili'uokalani Children's Center. Special tribute was paid to Simeon U'u and his family, Maui CWS worker Christina \"Satyo\" Dosland, and key support persons, including Lois Torikawa, social worker at Waiawa Correctional Facility; the court, resource caregivers; attorneys; the children's GAL; and community service providers such as the family's therapist, parent educa-tors, and community shelter staff. The theme of this year's event was \"Reconnecting Hearts,\" highlighting the DHS' primary goa l of successful reunification for families through a collaborative approach. The event was attended by various dignitaries, including Senator Gilbert Keith-Agaran (Wailuku, Waihe'e, and Kahului) and Jo-An n Ridao, Director of the Maui Department of Human Concerns, representing the office of the Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa. Governor Neil Abercrombie also signed a proclamation that was pre- sented to the U'u family and Ms. Dosland/Maui CWS. The proclamation recognized National Reunification Month, underscored the i mportance of reunification as the preferred outcome for families involved in child welfare services, and emphasized the \"team\" approach to effectuate success ful reunification. At the event, the DHS emphasized its primary mission of reunification and strengthening families, and highlighting the importance of collaboration and partnerships when working with families. In a video featuring the U'u family and Ms. Dosland, Simeon talked about being in the child welfa re system for two years before truly understanding that he could lose his parental rights to his children. Simeon discussed having faith that he and his children w ould be reunited and attributed the family's achievement to relationships with both his CWS social worker and the social worker at the Waiawa Correctional facility , and other support persons. Ms. Dosland discussed how service providers, such as the children's therapist, the Parent Educator, and the resource caregivers wer e vital in ensuring the family's success.

Richardson School of Law.
