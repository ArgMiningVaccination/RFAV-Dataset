When the central channel of energy is brought into balance a deep sense of ease, alignment, and energetic nourishment can be felt. The chakra system, feeds meridian points, corresponding organs and glands, can influence emotional/psychological content, and the aura (the protection and immune system of the body). This gentle hands-on, energy technique releases stagnant or blocked energies, calms anxiety, lifts the mood and creates a deeper inner connection while supporting a gentle state of deep relaxation. Any feelings of fatigue fade away and a sense of renewed vitality emerges into present awareness. You will feel deeply connected and aligned to your natural state of being. ADD-ON SOUL READING Jennifer's natural compassion-connection offers intuitive information, insights, and personal messages specific to you, your personality, and your life; past, present, and future. Soul Readings are not considered fortune telling. They are based on your energetic blueprint accessed through the energy healing process and considered the healing path of your Soul. Adding-on a Soul Reading offers you a consciousness awareness by supplying potent information about the state of your being. This helps you maintain the energetic corrections made during your session as well as, a gentle support transforming old energies into a better alignment with your Soul's purpose. Having a conscious awareness deepens your personal understanding with a clear direction on what to work on. It also encourages a deeper healing experience and greater sense of personal transformation by strengthening your personal sense of power and ability to create a more fulfilling life in a balanced way.

[MORE ABOUT SOUL & INTUITIVE ENERGY READINGS HERE>>](https://www.jennifersmusing.com/intuitive-energy-readings.html) CHAKRA BALANCING EXPERIENCE Jennifer will gently move through each chakra to establish a connection through compassion and access more specific information at each energy center. In this manner, Jennifer is able to systematically interpret the quality and care for each chakra; releasing, clearing, cleansing, balancing, and stabilizing the energy of each energy center. Jennifer prefers to stay at each chakra center until it's well balanced before moving onto the next. This helps stabilize the correction without it being more of a generalized sweep. There is no way to deeply correct everything in one day so, it's important that time and attention is give to strengthen each chakra point to better support the other chakra's, continuing to build a better foundation and ease of consistent flow. If you choose to add-on an intuitive reading of your energy, Jennifer will share the information, insights, or messages during your healing session to help integrate the information through the system. You will gain specific information to expand on in your own time, while, also feeling grounded in your own personal, healing experience. After your healing session is complete, you will be given some time to process your experience. Jennifer will answer any questions and share any thoughts about energetic maintenance and after care. You will leave feeling balanced, revitalized, deeply cared for, and loved.
