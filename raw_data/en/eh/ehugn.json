Here in California we have a beautiful display of wild flowers, green grasses, and blossoming trees. Unfortunately, not everyone can enjoy these gorgeous spectacles though! Are you one of the many who end up indoors with itchy noses, scratchy throats, and watery eyes? Want to learn how to naturally treat allergies with effective holistic remedies that help you long term? A natural solution for seasonal allergies is a good idea, because while [Claritin](http://www.rxlist.com/claritin-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview) & [Benadryl](http://www.rxlist.com/benadryl-drug.htm) may help with symptoms to get you through the season, the side effects can be just as miserable as the allergic response: - headaches - sleepiness - nervousness - rashes - GI issues - or more serious conditions like jaundice, stunted growth, or enlarged prostate glands... In my opinion, it's better to learn how to naturally treat allergies and get to the root of your health imbalance that causes them. Why risk creating other health imbalances from conventional pharmaceutical allergy drugs? Natural remedies work great as long as you're consistent and persistent in treating yourself. Hopefully my story will inspire you to try! My Seasonal Allergy Struggles And How I Healed I can tell you from personal experience that you don't have to choose between seasonal allergy symptoms & drug side effects. I've had to deal with a major dust mite allergy and hay fever for most of my childhood & young adult years and was able to heal from them naturally. The last time I remember having a bad year of seasonal allergies was back in 2008 when I visited my Father-in-law in Maine. My sinuses became extremely inflamed when their neighbors cut a field of grass. I remember spending a few days inside, alternating self-acupuncture treatments and clearing my nose with a saline rinse (with the neti pot that I pack on every vacation). It worked! And was able to enjoy our visit without a visit to the pharmacy. That was over a decade ago and I haven't had an experience like this every again! At that time in my life I made a huge shift in diet, supplements, self-care practices, and natural therapies. If you're interested in taking a natural approach to managing allergies, you'll likely need to try a few different approaches. My 5 Favorite Remedies For Seasonal Allergies How do you naturally treat allergies? Here is a list and explanation of the therapies that helped me. I've also included a few new ideas that have worked for friends & clients too. 1. Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine For Allergies A Chinese Medicine practitioner may use [Acupuncture and/or Chinese herbs](https://falconhealingarts.com/traditional-chinese-medicine/) to work with the root cause of your imbalance. For allergies, there is typically a deficiency in what we call \"Wei Qi\", which is the protective energy that is analogous to our immune system. Practitioners will boost this energy while also increasing your blood circulation. Treatments will take your time and commitment, but this may be your best chance in resolving allergies naturally, for good. I'm taking new clients online (virtual sessions, herbs & coaching only) or at my office in Belmont, CA (also includes acupuncture and my other in-person modalities). 2. Use a neti pot or saline rinse Rinsing your nasal passages regularly is a great way to prevent allergic rhinitis. The rinse removes microorganisms, pollen, dust, excess mucus, and other impurities from the nasal passages. It can reduce discomfort from seasonal allergies and can even shorten the span of the common cold if done in the first few days. Here's a helpful video on how to use a neti pot: 3. Eating Local Honey It's theorized that consuming local honey helps one to become desensitized to the pollen that is causing an allergic reaction in one's environment. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24188941) showed that there was a significant reduction in allergic rhinitis symptoms after consuming a high dose of local honey over an 8 week period. Honey is yummy and in my opinion, is worth a shot if you're trying to heal naturally! 4. Essential Oils Do you want another reason to love essential oils? They can help immensely with seasonal allergies! [Peppermint](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/peppermint-oil?OwnerID=3234758)supports respiration by unclogging sinuses, soothing scratchy throats and reducing inflammation. [Lemon](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/lemon-oil?OwnerID=3234758)promotes drainage in lymph tissue, flushes out toxins, boosts immunity, and supports the respiratory system. [Lavender](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/lavender-oil?OwnerID=3234758)is a natural antihistamine and helps with itching. It's also calming and reduces inflammation. Together, these oils are a wonderful blend to keep handy when you're outdoors and concerned about a reaction. Dilute them in a carrier oil such as fractionated coconut oil (20-50% dilution) and apply to temples, back of ears, and soles of feet. [DoTERRA's TriEase Softgels](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/triease-seasonal-blend?OwnerID=3234758) allow you to take these oils (lavender, lemon, and pepperming) internally, which is safe to do daily because of their high purity levels. They provide comfort when seasonal threats are high and help to protect the respiratory system. Here's some other ideas of essential oils that work to manage not just allergy symptoms, but other issues that affect your breathing: 5. Heal your gut The great majority of our immune system resides in the gut in the form of beneficial bacteria. They help to protect our gut lining, increase our immunity by helping to make lymphocytes & other white blood cells, and allow us to digest & absorb nutrients efficiently. So when there is a dysfunction of the immune system, such as seasonal allergies, the gut is the most logical place to make significant changes.
