All you want to do is eat junk and drink copious amounts of caffeine. You think the sugar and caffeine highs will give you the energy boost. While they do, they don't give you the long-term energy boosts. Rather than getting help to sustain you until your next meal or get you through a slump in the day, they cause a crash afterward. Sugar and caffeine metabolize quickly and leave you with far less energy than you started with. It's important to find long-term energy boosts. That means following these 10 home remedies for energy boost to help you. Get Yourself Active Before looking at food or drinks that you can have, why don't we focus on something that we feel like we can't do? How does expending energy help us gain energy? It does seem counterproductive, but it can be extremely beneficial. Of course, this will depend on the reason for your slump in energy. If your body is genuinely tired, exercising isn't going to help you too much. However, if you feel like you should have energy - like it's Monday morning and you just don't feel like you have the energy for the first day of the week at work, \u2014 then you'll find more activity will help you. The body is slumping because you're not doing enough. You're not getting the muscles working, and your brain isn't getting the right type of hormones to pass through the system. When you exercise, you release endorphins and serotonin to spread the happiness and remove pain from the body. As you get high from exercise, you start to think about doing more. Sure, you don't want to do it at first, and you hate it while you're doing it, but you'll love the endorphin rush afterward. You'll be pumped for the rest of the day. You'll also get rid of the stress build up. Stress is one of the main reasons for the lack of energy, but the endorphin and serotonin rush help to balance out the hormones and get rid of the cortisol. This is why so many people choose to exercise first thing in the morning. They get the best start to the day, so they are ready for work. If you don't have other genuine commitments, try out a class at 6am, or 7am on a Monday morning. You'll find your day goes so much better. On home remedies for energy boost. Experts recommend doing 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise a week. If you want to lose weight, it's recommended that you double that. Exercises classes are a great way to get the activity and socialization aspect, offer far more mental health benefits. Try Non-Fat Milk or Coconut Milk to Your Morning Coffee While caffeine will give you a rush and a slump, I'm not saying that you can't have it at all. Small amounts of caffeine aren't too bad for the body. If you want the placebo effect, you can always opt for decaf coffee. You get the taste without the sudden rush and later slump. Whatever type of coffee (or even tea) you drink, think about adding a splash of milk. Make it a non-fat or a non-dairy alternative, like coconut milk. These options are full of protein, which will help to boost your energy levels throughout the day. Your muscles and tissues struggle when you have an energy slump. They need protein to keep them strong and boost their metabolic rate. When you do that, you'll find the rest of your body responds. Milk is also good for the bones. Even almond or coconut milk has calcium, so you'll protect the bones and teeth, building a stronger body that utilizes its energy better. Coconut milk is beneficial for its healthy fats - yes, your body needs some fats. The healthy fats breakdown slowly and metabolize fully in the liver. Your body gains long term energy boosts through this. Make a Switch to Green Tea If you don't fancy the caffeine levels in coffee, but you still want something with some caffeine, then it will be worth considering green tea. There is just a small amount of caffeine in this - not enough to cause a sudden crash but enough to give your body an extra energy boost. The benefit of green tea is that the body can metabolize it better. It actually helps to speed up the metabolism, meaning that you start burning more calories and get a sudden boost of energy. Green tea is one of those superfoods that people losing weight are encouraged to drink. It's not a miracle weight loss cure but powerful when included as part of a healthy and balanced diet. Studies have also shown that green tea helps to boost endurance levels over a 24 hour period. That means you'll have better energy levels when you drink it at 11am all the way through the day. Since the caffeine levels are lower than coffee, you get to drink more of it throughout the day. A cup at 11am, and another at 3pm will be perfect to help balance out the energy boosts. You can add some honey to plain green tea if you don't like the slightly bitter taste. Honey is sugary but it's natural sugar, and a little isn't going to do that much harm. You can also opt for flavored green teas but check the packaging to find out if they are natural or added flavorings. Opt for Nuts as a Snack One of the reasons for the lack of energy is a lack of selenium. This is one of those nutrients that many of us forget about - in fact, many of us aren't even aware of it. We focus so much on calcium, iron, the vitamins, and even magnesium. A selenium deficiency can lead to low energy levels. The best thing about this nutrient is that it is found in abundance in nuts. You can opt for peanuts, walnuts, cashew nuts, and even Brazil nuts. You just need a handful to boost your selenium levels considerably. Nuts are also a healthy snack. They have plenty of healthy fats and protein within them. Both of these break down slowly, so you're left with longer lasting energy boosts. They'll also keep you feeling fuller, so you don't snack as much on the wrong things. Nuts are excellent for those on a diet! Just a handful is all you need to get all the health benefits. If you're allergic to nuts, you can opt for seeds instead. They're not as effective as nuts, but at least you don't have to miss out completely. Try an Energy Muse You may be skeptical about these, but there are plenty of holistic therapists and remedy fans who rave about them. The truth is that the scientists have mixed views. It is possible that the energy muses just offer a placebo effect, but surely that is better than dealing with an energy slump, right? An energy muse is an ancient method to gain more energy throughout the day. Traditionally used by the Chinese, Japanese, and other Oriental nations, the Muse is made up of gemstones (typically amber), crystals, and Chinese coins. All the elements work together to improve the balance in the body. Amber and copper are supposed to encourage proper blood flow and improve the oxygen levels. When your brain gets the right amount of oxygenated blood, it is able to keep the hormonal balance in order. These muses are also supposed to help ease thepain in the body, which instantly improves your mood and your energy levels. Even if you don't get the holistic benefits, you'll love to mix and match your jewelry to your outfits. You have something beautiful to wear every single day, whether it's a bracelet or a necklace. When you feel good about yourself, you balance out your hormones to help improve the energy levels. Try Out Yoga or Meditation There is a lot to be said for holistic remedies. Getting energy isn't all about the food that you put into your body. It's about how you take care of your mind, body, and soul. Therefore, yoga or meditation can be extremely powerful for improving your health and energy. Both yoga and meditation give you the chance to focus on your breathing, allowing you to get more oxygenated blood into your system. At the same time, you can clear your mind and focus on improving all elements of your mind and body. You'll find your flexibility improves, as well as your posture. Pain is a past problem so you can feel happier within yourself. Meditation and yoga have long been used to invigorate yourself. You replenish energy levels. It will certainly feel easier to do a yoga session than it will to go for a 60-minute jog or walk to improve your activity levels. Yes, yoga will count as exercise, so you get two tips for the price of one. Start Oil Pulling Daily Oil pulling has long been used as a way to kill bacteria and look after the oral health. However, did you know that it can also be used to boost your energy levels? When our bodies have to fight off infections and diseases, our energy levels take a hit. There's only so much the body can do, and the lack of energy is usually a sign that you need to slow down and focus on improving your health. Well, what if you could find something that helps to fight off infections for your body? This is where oil pulling comes into play, especially if you use coconut oil. Remember that oil pulling is a way to kill the bacteria in the mouth. Well, more like it draws out the bacteria. It can also draw it out from the back of the throat. By removing the bacteria for the body, there is nothing for the immune system to fight again. Coconut oil is so useful because of its antibacterial properties. At the same time, it has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. You can fight off all sorts of infections and reduce the inflammatory response, making it easier for the blood to flow around the body. Make it part of your daily routine to keep the body - and the oral health - in good shape. Drink More Water Instead If you're feeling a slump coming on, why not pour a glass of water for yourself instead. Dehydration is a common reason for slumps in the energy. The brain isn't able to concentrate as much, so it starts to release more cortisol in the system. The muscles become dehydrated and fatigued, so they don't work as well. When you remain hydrated, every single organ, muscle, and tissue in your body can work effectively. They all work together to keep you alert and happy. Rather than reaching for the chocolate bar or the coffee pot, reach for a glass of water instead. You'll also find that you curb any of the cravings that you do get. Your body struggles to tell the difference between thirst and hunger and will send hunger signals when you need a drink. Have a glass of water and see if you still feel like you need food. If a glass of plain water doesn't sound that refreshing, add [some lemon slices](http://www.positivehealthwellness.com/diet-nutrition/benefits-lemon-water-morning-make/) to it. You'll be surprised at the way the sweet taste can instantly kick any craving that you have without adding refined sugars to your body. Add Some Complex Carbs to Your Diet Not all carbs are bad, even though some of the \"experts\" will have you believe that. Carbs are a necessary part of the diet. They help create energy in the body for your metabolism to use. It's important to get the right types of carbs to make the most of your energy levels. Simple carbs that use refined sugars, flours, etc. will just lead to quick bursts of energy and then bigger slumps straight after. They are also linked to weight gain because the metabolism must store calories to deal with the insulin response for the rising blood sugar levels. Complex carbs are your starchy carbs. Think about potatoes, brown pasta, whole grain bread, and other similar foods. They will break down similarly to fiber and protein. You're left feeling full quicker than if you chose simple carbs and you will find that you have sustained energy levels throughout the day. Opt for lunch that contains complex carbs. They will help to combat the creeping 3pm slump and help you last until dinner time without a sugary snack. Get a Good Night's Sleep This is often better said than done, right? The theory is simple. If you sleep for your optimum length of time, you won't feel the slump later in the day. Experts recommend that you get between 6 and 8 hours of sleep on a nightly basis, but everyone is different. What I find around the 6-hour mark is perfect for me, but 8 hours is way too much. I know someone else who runs on 4 hours a night and never suffers a slump. What's important is that you get good quality sleep. You can be in bed for 8 hours but wake up every hour or so for one reason or another. You won't always know if you didn't get a good night's sleep unless you have some type of sleep tracker that tells you just how much you moved while sleeping and if your sleep was broken. Focus on ways to clear your mind and tire your body out so that you sleep well. You can help this by going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time every morning. Your body clock will soon get used to the habits, and your brain will know just how much sleep it will get to get ready for the next day. Only You Can Boost Energy Throughout the Day You don't need to put up with the 11am or 3pm slumps - I say those times because they are the most common throughout the day. You can boost your energy levels, however much sleep you have had on a night. Try out the above tips about home remedies for energy. Some of them will link together. For example, you can improve your sleep quality by practicing yoga and meditation to get rid of the stress levels. By incorporating as many as possible together, you get the chance to remove the slumps and the cravings for foods that will give you quick bursts throughout the day. Energy slumps will hit for all types of reasons. Unless you are ill, there's no reason that you should have to put up with them. Focus on a diet that will sustain and boost your energy levels properly, rather than creating a bigger slump just hours later.
