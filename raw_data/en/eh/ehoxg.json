What are pneumococcal bacteria? Pneumococcal bacteria cause pneumococcal infection. They can cause serious illnesses like pneumonia and bacterial meningitis. They can also cause other conditions like severe ear infections. Some adults carry pneumococcal bacteria in the back of their nose and throat. They can pass bacteria on by coughing, sneezing, and close contact. Exposure to pneumococcal bacteria doesn't normally result in serious illness. But, sometimes it leads to pneumococcal infections. You have a higher chance of becoming unwell with a pneumococcal infection if: - you're aged 65 or over - you're under 65 and have certain health conditions People aged 65 or over are more likely to suffer serious long-term health problems from pneumococcal infection. These health problems can lead to death. What is pneumococcal disease and why do we need a vaccine?
