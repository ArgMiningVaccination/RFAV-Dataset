The safety of Trumenba was evaluated in 16,284 subjects 10 through 25 years of age in 12 clinical studies (9 randomized controlled and 3 supportive non-controlled studies) conducted in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Chile, and Australia. A total of 11,991 subjects 10 through 18 years of age, and 4,293 subjects 19 through 25 years of age received at least one dose of Trumenba. A total of 5,501 subjects 10 through 25 years of age in the control groups received saline placebo and/or one of the following vaccine(s): Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant (HPV4) (Merck & Co., Inc.); Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced polio virus Inc.); Hepatitis A Vaccine (HAV) (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). The safety evaluation in the clinical studies included an assessment of: (1) solicited local and systemic reactions, and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary maintained by the subject or the subject's parent/legal guardian and (2) spontaneous reports of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), throughout the study (day of vaccination through 1 month or 6 months after the last vaccination, depending on the study and safety parameter). In controlled studies, demographic characteristics were generally similar with regard to gender, race, and ethnicity among subjects who received Trumenba and those who received control. Among participants in clinical trials B1971009 (Study 1009), B1971016 (Study 1016), and B1971057 to 8.1% to 20.8% were Black or African-American, <2% were Asian, and 5.8% to 17.1% were Hispanic/Latino. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Study 1057 was a randomized, observer-blinded, multicenter trial in the U.S. and Europe. In this study, 1057 subjects 10 through 25 years of age received at least 1 dose of Trumenba on a 0- and 6-month schedule. Trumenba was co-administered Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY) (GSK Vaccines, SRL) Study 1009 was a randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded, multicenter trial in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in which 2,693 subjects 10 through 18 years of age received at least 1 dose of Trumenba on a 0-, 2-, and 6- month schedule. A control group (n=897) received HAV at 0 and 6 months, and saline at 2 months. Study 1016 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multicenter trial in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in which 2,471 subjects 18 through 25 years of age received at least 1 dose of Trumenba and 822 subjects received saline on a 0-, 2,- and 6- month schedule. Local adverse reactions at the injection site were assessed in the three studies. Tables 1, 2, and 3 present the percentage and severity of reported local adverse reactions within 7 days following each dose of Trumenba for Study 1057 and following each dose of Trumenba or control (HAV/saline or saline) for Study 1009 and Study 1016, respectively. In Studies 1009 and 1016, local adverse reactions were reported more frequently following Trumenba compared to control (see NCT03135834.

In Study 1009, mean duration of pain was 2.4 to 2.6 days (range 1-17 days), redness was 2.0 to 2.2 days (range 1-12 days) and swelling was 2.0 to 2.1 days (range 1-21 days) for the three-dose series in the Trumenba groups. In Study 1016, mean duration of pain was 2.6 to 2.8 days (range 1-67 days), redness was 2.2 to 2.5 days (range 1-13 days) and swelling was 2.1 to 2.6 days (range 1-70 days) in the Trumenba group.

The frequencies of adverse reactions were highest after the first dose regardless of the schedule. After subsequent doses, the frequencies of adverse reactions were similar regardless of dose number and schedule. Serious Adverse Events Among the 8 controlled studies investigating the three-dose (0, 1-2, and 6 months) schedule (Trumenba N=13,275, control N=5,501), SAEs were reported by 213 (1.6%) subjects and by 106 (1.9%) subjects who received at least one dose of Trumenba or control, respectively. Non-serious Adverse Events Among the 8 controlled studies investigating the three-dose (0, 1-2, and 6 months) schedule (Trumenba N=13,275, control N=5,501), AEs that occurred within 30 days of vaccination were reported in 4,056 (30.6%) subjects who received at least one dose of Trumenba and 1,539 (28.0%) subjects in the control group who received at least one dose. AEs that occurred at a frequency of at least 2% and were more frequently observed in subjects who received Trumenba than subjects in the control group were injection site pain, fever, and headache. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Trumenba. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Nervous system disorder: Syncope (fainting). "}
