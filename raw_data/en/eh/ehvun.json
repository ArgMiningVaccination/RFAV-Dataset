We have made it through the darkest part of winter and each day the light grows stronger! We are now at the halfway point between Winter and Spring, light a candle and sow your seeds of intention. February's focus is on self love and the heart chakra. Self love and an open heart chakra is a foundation that sends out magical ripples that create powerful, positive shifts in health and happiness that not only benefit you but all of those around you. The heart chakra is your control center for compassion, empathy, connection, forgiveness, and unconditional love. It is the great bridge that connects the physical body to the divine, the lower three body chakras with the upper three spiritual chakras. The heart chakra also plays a huge role in connecting us to others. When your heart chakra is healthy and open, you are unafraid to give and receive love. You forgive yourself and others easily, you practice self-acceptance, harmony and experience deep compassion. When the heart chakra is out of balance, however, you may feel emotionally unstable, angry, paranoid, unworthy of love, always in self-pity or unforgiving of yourself or others. If you feel that your heart chakra is in need of some attention, there are many things you can do to balance the energies. The first step toward healing is engaging in self love. Once you fully love and protect yourself, you are able to project this loving energy onto others. Some of my favorite natural go to's to promote self love and balance the heart chakra include: ~Essential oils like bergamot, palmarosa, rose, neroli, ylang ylang, and geranium ~Fresh flowers like the healing high vibration of the rose ~Herbal teas made from rose petals, raspberry leaf, tulsi, motherwort, and hibiscus ~Crystals like rose quartz, healing frequency's in 528hz ~Reiki! There are many services and events here at the studio to help you on your path of self love, not just in February, but each day of the year! I have however chosen February to focus on many of them. The [Rose Quartz Integrative Massage & Reiki ](https://integrativehealingartsstudio.org/2016/09/27/integrative-massage-reiki-with-rose-quartz/)services started out as a Valentine's Day promotion here at the studio in 2012 and wound up staying on the service menu year round due to the profound impact made, they have become, by far my most popular services. A Reiki session with rose quartz is also available for those who do not wish to have a massage.
