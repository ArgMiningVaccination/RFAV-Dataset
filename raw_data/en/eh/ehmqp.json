The Novavax COVID -19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted is administered as a tw o-dose primary series, three weeks apart. The vaccine contains the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein and Matrix -M adjuvant. Adjuvants are incorporated into some vaccines to enhance the immune response of the vaccinated individual. The spike protein in this vaccine is produced in insect cells; the Matrix M -adjuvant contains saponin extracts from the bark of the Soapbark tree that is native to Chile. Efficacy Data The vaccine was assessed in an ongoing randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled study conducted in the United States and Mexico. The effectiveness of the vaccine was assessed in clinical trial participants 18 years of age and older who did not have evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection through 6 days after receiving the second vaccine dose. Among these participa nts, approximately 17,200 received the vaccine and approximately 8,300 received saline placebo. Overall, the vaccine was 90.4% effective in preventing mild, moderate or severe COVID -19, with 17 cases of COVID -19 occurring in the vaccine group and 79 cases in the placebo group. No cases of moderate or severe COVID -19 were reported in participants who received the vaccine, compared with 9 cases of moderate COVID -19 and 4 cases of severe COVID -19 reported in placebo recipients. In the subset of participants 65 years of age and older, the vaccine was 78.6% effective. The clinical trial was conducted prior to the emergence of delta and omicron variants. Safety Data The safety of the vaccine was assessed in approximately 26,000 clinical trial participants who rec eived the vaccine and approximately 25,000 who received placebo. The most commonly reported side effects by vaccine recipients included pain/tenderness, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, joint pain, nausea/vomiting and fever. Approximately 21,000 vaccine recipients had at least two months of safety follow -up after their second dose. The Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination P roviders) includes a warning that clinical trial data provide evidence for i ncreased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following administration of Novavax COVID - 19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers informs that in most people who have had myocarditis or pericarditis after receiving the vaccine, symptoms began within 10 days following vaccination and that vaccine recipients should seek medical attention right away i f they experience any of the following symptoms after vaccination: chest pain, shortness of breath, feelings of having a fast -beating, fluttering or pounding heart.
