We remain aware that the responsibilities entrusted to us obliges us to provide this generation and generations to come with the best possible educational system in order to enable them to restore and defend their rights. In this regard, we feel it is our duty to arm our children and youth with the necessary education and knowledge while preserving the values and ethics that would assist them in starting their curse of life in the right direction, to be able to compete in labor markets that are becoming more scarce as time passes. Reforming education and improving its quality has become the main focus of the Palestinian society in light of the complaints filed by students, teachers, guardians/parents, educational institutions and business people alike. These complaints are concerned with the quality of education and weakness of the educational outputs (i.e., level of education and knowledge acquired by students). Other complaints revolve around the large number of textbooks, difficult exams, and whether these tests can measure students' abilities and competencies. Complaints also were in regard to the system's focus on memorization and indoctrination, or feeding of information; and students dropping out of school as well. Moreover, there are complaints related to school facilities; teaching methods, students' behavior, assessment methods, compatibility of subjects taught at schools and universities and needs of the labor market; and the role Palestinian education plays in contributing to the development of society, in general. These issues constituted a collective burden at the political, educational and social levels in the Palestinian society. Therefore, it became vital for all concerned to concentrate their efforts to redirect the educational system and work towards putting it on the right track if Palestinians are to be able to keep pace with international changes and modern educational methods. This in turn will advance the Palestinian society through building a generation with skills, knowledge and good ethics. A generation that is resilient and capable of dealing with life's challenges, contribute to research and scientific inventions, and is able to solve problems. As part of the sought reform efforts, an education review committee was established, chaired by the Prime Minister and coordinated by the Minister of Education and Higher Education. The committee's efforts resulted in producing a document and an action plan for reforming the Palestinian educational system. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education implemented several steps during the past year towards reforming the system. One of its main achievements was producing and action plan for curricula development and began to develop the curricula for grades 1-4. It also began to implement a policy of digitalization in the Palestinian education system in line with the latest technological developments concerning teaching and learning. At the same time, it approved a new modern system for the secondary education called (Injaz), and incorporated the technical and vocational curricula (TVE) in public education for grades 7-9. This integration constitutes Ministry of Education and Higher Education6 exposing students of the abovementioned grades to vocational subjects that illustrate the relationship between theoretical knowledge and practicum. It also encourages students to join the vocational stream during their secondary educational stage. The Ministry also accelerated the process of developing a legal framework for the educational sector by developing and obtained approval of a contemporary education law in addition to developing a specific law for higher education as well as approved a Law of Innovation and Excellence. It also implemented innovative ideas that provide sustainability in the energy sources for schools by providing solar energy equipment hence benefitting from the renewable energy, in addition to other innovative initiatives that cannot be named here due to the large details entailed. Moreover, in line with the State of Palestine adoption of the National Policy Agenda of the development plan 2017-2022, which drew on the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals approved at New York Summit in 2015, which took into account national priorities, such as: ending the Israeli occupation which constantly destroys achievements made by Palestinians and available resources and potentials, the education sector began preparing the education sectoral plan for 2017-2022. Preparation of the plan was based on EDSP III (2014-2019), including its principles, objectives and programs which can be utilized in developing the Palestinian education system. It was also based on the National Policy Agenda and international obligations towards achieving the fourth goal of the Incheon / Korea Declaration of May 2015. The EDSP III was reviewed and aligned, using the ministry monitoring and evaluation system indicators with the participation of all stakeholders, including governmental organizations, NGOs, CBOs, higher education institutions, international organizations and supporters of the education sector. It is worth noting that, similarly, other Palestinian sectors also started preparing sectoral plans. The current document is the fruit of partners' sincere efforts that aimed at reviewing and developing the draft education sector plan of 2017-2022. The plan aims to transform the Palestinian education system from a system that is based on instructional and memorization approach to a student-centered approach. The teacher under the new system shall become a facilitator whose role is to develop the skills and competencies of the students instead of providing and feeding information. This milestone change requires an in-depth reform of the current curricula, assessment system, teaching and learning methods, teachers' roles, supervisors' roles and the adoption of a result-based management system for education. Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to the team who prepared the Education Strategic Plan and the Education Sectoral Strategy Review Team, composed of all institutions and agencies. I also would like to renew my commitment and that of the ministry's cadre to continue to work in genuine partnership with all education sector stakeholders to achieve the set goals of the education strategic plan of 2017-2022. Dr. Sabri Saidam Minister of Education and Higher Education Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-20227 Preface by Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Education Within the framework of the new global trends formulated by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)--especially the SDG 4 with its objectives--which were adopted by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education at the Incheon Summit 2015, in Korea, as well as the National Policy Agenda (2017-2022) approved by the Palestinian government and highlights quality education for our children, we started preparing a strategic plan 2017-2022 that is based on our Education Development Strategic Plan III (2014-2019) with its established work structures and programs that needed to be updated and elaborated. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education formed a team of senior staff to prepare the Sectoral Strategic Plan 2017-2022 based on the vision of a \"Palestinian society that possesses values, knowledge, science and technology and is able to employ that knowledge for liberation as well as development\". This strategy is based on the sustainable development goals and the National Policy Agenda of 2017-2022. And since the goals we aim to achieve through the education strategy are ambitious, require great commitment, and are connected to other sectors in a pivotal way, it was vital that our efforts be consolidated with related international and regional partners. To achieve this, meetings to prepare a strategy that responds to our needs were organized by UNESCO, local and civil society organizations and government organizations as well as the education development section in the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. The team started broad consultations with all stakeholders. The progress achieved was presented at each stage through workshops held to discuss and approve achievements made. Efforts to produce this strategy continued for eight months until we were able to produce this document which expresses our aspirations as well as reflects the holistic performance of all of the education sector stakeholders. In my capacity as Chairman of the Education Strategy Development team, I would like to extend my thanks to members of the strategy team and support teams. I also am grateful to our international development and local partners for the efforts they invested to formulate this strategy, which now serves as a key driver for education development in Palestine for the next 6 years. I'm confident that the content of this strategy is pivotal for achieving our vision of education in Palestine.

IntroductionMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202219 I. Introduction The decision of the United Nations General Assembly 70\\1 presents the world with a new ambitious development plan \"transforming our world: 2030 agenda for sustainable development\". It is an agenda of action for people, planet and prosperity. All countries and stakeholders shall work to implement it in a collaborative spirit. The 2030 agenda for sustainable development has 17 goals and 169 targets. These goals and targets are integral, indivisible, universal and inclusive. They take account of the living conditions and available development tools of each country. They also respect their national policies and priorities. The targets are universal and achievable. Each government identifies its national policies and priorities, guided by international aspirations and determines the means of integrating these universal targets into national planning, policies and strategies. It is noteworthy that they take account of the link between sustainable development and other ongoing economic, social and environmental operations. These goals and targets aim to continue the course of millennium development goals, enforce human rights, achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. These goals and targets are integral and indivisible in a manner that achieves balance among the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental dimensions. The integrity of the sustainable development goals (SDG's) is significantly important for achieving the content of this plan to improve life for all and make a milestone change in our life which education constitutes one of its key pillars: Figure (1): SDGs 2030 Ministry of Education and Higher Education20 To achieve SDG 4 on education and the education targets included under other SDGs, it will be necessary to mobilize national, regional and global efforts that are aimed at: achieving effective and inclusive partnerships; Improving education policies and the way joint action is carried out; Ensuring highly equitable, inclusive and high quality education systems for all; Mobilizing resources for adequate financing for education; Ensuring monitoring, follow-up and review of all targets. Targets and requirements related to the fourth goal: The targets of Education 2030 are specific and measurable, and contribute directly to achieving the overarching goal. They spell out a global level of ambition that should encourage countries to strive for accelerated progress. These targets are: Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality basic and secondary education that leads to relevant and effective learning outcomes .

Target 4.a: Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all .Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202221 Target 4.b: By 2030, at the global level, substantially expand the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular, least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including: vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engi - neering and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries. Target 4.c: By 2030, substantially increase the number of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especial - ly least developed countries and small-island developing States National Development Plan 2017-2022 Confirming the commitment of the State of Palestine to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the Palestinian government launched its strategic planning process for the sectors covered by the Palestinian development strategy and the programs of the budget of the next six years. It considered 2016 as the year of planning since it drafted the National Policy Agenda, which identifies the high policies of sector and cross sector strategies developed for 2017-2022. It also started preparing sectoral strategic plans since the second quarter of 2016 in conjunction with preparing the mid-term budget of 2017-2022 in accordance with the action methodology approved by the Council of Ministers to integrate sectoral planning processes into mid-term budget preparation. This developed methodology is based on a set of bases and policies designed to organize the process of preparing sector and cross sector strategies, budget's programs and mid-term budgets. These bases are: - The period of the sectoral strategic planning is six years (2017-2022) and that of the mid- term budget is three years (2017-2019). - The sectoral strategic plan is based on the National Policy Agenda which is a key component of the national development plan and determinant of the sectoral strategic goals. - The sectoral and cross sector strategic planning includes 21 sectors and cross sectors: 1. Education, 2. Agriculture, 3. Health, 4. International relations, 5. Justice, 6. Culture and heritage, 7. Employment, 8. Energy, 9. Local government, 10. Housing, 11. Environment, 12. Social protection, 13. Communications and Information Technology, 14. Security (Interior Ministry), 15. Public finance management, 16. National economy, 17. Tourism and antiquity, 18. Water and waste water, 19. Transportation, 20. The Youth, 21. Gender. After approving the sector and cross-sector plans as well as the mid-term budget, the Palestinian government shall prepare a final document of the National Policy Agenda. This document identifies the strategic directions which could be achieved through the sectoral strategies within the framework of macro and mid-term financial economy. The National Policy Agenda reflects contributions by active governmental and non-governmental entities. The policy agenda shall constitute along with the sectoral strategies the components of the Palestinian national development plan. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEHE) leads the process of national strategic planning of the educational sector of 2017-2022. Ministry of Education and Higher Education22 Education Strategic Plan 2017-2022 The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEHE) operates according to its EDSP III (2014-2019). After the government of Palestine decided that sector plans should be prepared in line with the National Development Plan 2017-2022, and the National Policy Agenda which is aligned with SDGs 2030, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education made a comprehensive review to its strategy guided by the National Policy Agenda, Education Framework 2030, Education Review Committee's report, Education Plan Assessment (2014- 2016), strategic plan annual monitoring and evaluation indicators, the National Report on Education for All 2000-2015 and future indicators and attitudes. The review was conducted in partnership with all stakeholders - national team 2030, relevant governmental organizations, universities and other higher education institutions, international organizations and relevant civil society organizations. Consequently, this Sector Strategic Plan is an elaborated version of EDSP III (2014-2019) with its structures and priorities as well as the same assumptions, goals and objectives, but with additional focus on issues that were highlighted in the National Policy Agenda, such as preschool, TVET and scientific research.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022II. Overview of the Education and Higher Education SectorMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202225 II. Overview of the Education and Higher Education Sector Palestinian Education Sector The Ministry of Education and Higher Education leads the education sector in Palestine in its capacity as the official body responsible for running, organizing and developing the educational sector (direct management or through supervision) with all its sectors (pre-school education, school education (1-12 grades), technical and vocational education, non-formal education and higher education). It leads the national effort of strategic planning of the education sector, headed by His Excellency, Minister of Education and Higher Education Sabri Saidam, through the planning and budget group. It also engages the relevant governmental, civil society and international organizations in the process of planning. A brief on the education sector: the subsectors of the education sector in Palestine are multiple. These subsectors intersect with many other sectors in their interest and importance; these subsectors are: 1. Pre-school Education: It is a learning space offering early childhood education to children aged three years and seven months, prior to the commencement of compulsory education at basic schoo l. Pre-school education aims to provide appropriate environment where child personality can physically, mentally and socially grow and get ready to basic school. It provides children with sufficient opportunities to develop their personality through play and other activities such as drawing, picnicking, relating stories and reciting poems appropriate to their age and environment. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education has indirect supervision of pre-school education. It licenses preschools in accordance with definite conditions and specifications. It also puts the terms and conditions the cadre of the preschools needs to meet, and determines the type of curricula and programs for this sector. However, its policy today is directed towards integrating preschools into the formal education system and adopting a standard curriculum. The data indicate that the majority of preschools are privately operated. It is noteworthy that the two-year pre-school education stage is not compulsory. However, the new Law of Education stipulates that the one year of preschool education (KG2, sometimes called Grade 0) is compulsory. 2. School Education (Basic and Secondary): Basic Education Cycle: This stage starts from first grade through ninth grade. It is divided into two parts: a. First stage of Basic Education (grades 1-4) - the preparation stage : This is considered the primary stage of Basic Education. It is considered the foundation stage to ensure balance and full development of the personality of the child (mentally, emotionally and physically). Ministry of Education and Higher Education26 It is designed to give them a sound Basic education in reading and writing Arabic and mathematics as well as to enhance their national and intellectual values; stimulate their interest in the environment and care for their physical health. b. Second stage of Basic Education (grades 5-9) - the empowerment stage: This stage is designed to enable the child to acquire diversified knowledge and sciences. Secondary Education (Acquisition): This stage covers grades 10-12 with their academic, vocational and technical streams. The students join these streams according to their capacities and inclination and in accordance with the laws and regulations governing this process. It provides students with specialized scientific, professional and cultural experiences and knowledge which help them continue their higher education or join the labor market. It is aimed at helping students start their practical and university life since it constitutes a bridge between basic education, higher education and labor market. 3. Higher Education: It is the high stage of education served by universities, academic and technical colleges that provide students with university certificate. Higher education is different than basic and secondary education. It presents students with specialized disciplines that qualify them for work based on the certificate he/she earns. 4. Non-Formal Education: Unlike formal or standard education, non-formal education is conducted outside the frame of the standard education settings. It includes every objective and organized educational activity and every piece of knowledge, skill, value or behavior outside the framework of official educational systems-- such as schools, universities or any other formal educational institution\u2014be they in social, economic or political institutions or in factories or Non-Governmental Organizations. Thus, it is any educational activity organized outside the frame of schools. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education has programs of non-formal education: 1. Parallel educational program provided for those who dropped out after 5-6 years from basic school; and 2. Literacy and adult education program designed for illiterate people, aged 15 years and over. Figure (2) shows the sectors of the education stages in Palestine.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202227 Figure (2): Sectors and educational stages that comprise the Palestinian educational sector Centers of Responsibility and Other Service Providers / Activities Directly Related to the Sector 1.

There is great cooperation between the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Education and Higher Education within the framework of the High Council for V ocational and Technical Education to promote this type of education and training. This is carried out in order to achieve harmony between the needs of the labor market and education which provides students and graduates with the necessary skills. The Ministry of Social Development cooperates with the Ministry of Education in providing social care for needy and troubled families, stabilizing their conditions and ensuring that Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202229 their children continue going to school. The Ministry of Health provides many health care services in schools, such as vaccinations and regular medical examinations for students, as well as receiving referrals for sick cases from schools, etc. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics assists in providing accurate and periodic data on many issues that assist the ministry in performing its duties, and provides data on some issues that are not provided by the ministry, such as the percentage of literacy in the community. The Ministry cooperates with the Higher Council for Youth and Sports in promoting school sports through the Directorate General of Student Activities. The Ministry of Women Affairs works with the Ministry of Education through its Gender Unit to ensure that gender issues are taken into account in the Ministry's strategies and plans and in achieving justice in all aspects of work of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. The Environmental Quality Authority cooperates with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in many aspects that contribute to improving the school environment and the environmental culture of the students. The National Commission for Education, Culture and Science also provides effective communication points between the Ministry and the international, Islamic and Arab communities to exchange knowledge, benefit from educational expertise and experience among countries, as well as coordinates joint efforts and work to achieve the SDG4 and the educational goals of 2030. Universities and colleges represent the continuation of the learning process for students to be well-prepared for the job market and for daily life. - UNRWA: UNRWA's schools absorb (24.2%) of the Palestinian students and runs 12% of the Palestinian schools. It coordinates with MoEHE through mutual letters, periodical meetings and joint coordination committees. - Civil Society and Community-Based Organizations: several civil society organizations assist in developing the Palestinian education system in different educational domains, including teacher training, conducting research and developing learning and teaching methods as well as implementing innovative educational initiatives. Among these organizations are community-based and private universities and colleges, Palestinian Center for Teacher's Innovation, Tamer Institute for Community Education and A.M Qattan Foundation. - International Organizations and Partners: several international organizations that support the Palestinian education sector work in different educational sectors such as adult education, TVET and Educators Development. Among these organizations and partners are UNESCO, UNICEF, UNRWA, AMIDEAST, and German Institute for Adult Education (DIE). There are also several international and Arab partners supporting development of the Palestinian education sector, including those who support the Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA), the World Bank, the British Council, China and Arab States. Ministry of Education and Higher Education30 Linking education with Targets and Other Sectors: Education is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and essential for the success of all SDGs. Recognizing the important role of education, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights education as a stand-alone goal (SDG 4), and also includes targets on education under several other SDGs--notably those on health; growth and employment; sustainable consumption and production; and climate change. In fact, education can accelerate progress towards the achievement of all of the SDGs and therefore should be part of the strategies to achieve each of them. Since the Palestinian education system is required to respond to the rapidly changing labor market, technology development, urbanization, migration, political uncertainty, environmental and natural disasters, lack of natural resources, demographic challenges, increasing unemployment, poverty, increasing disparity and risks threatening peace and security, the education sector should be closely related with other sectors, particularly: - Agriculture Sector: Education helps people move towards further sustainable agricultural methods and understanding improved nutrition. It is considered a key element of the efforts exerted to reduce malnutrition and hunger. It is basic for improving income and agricultural productivity. Agricultural education which provides students with agricultural production skills is one of the professional and technical educational programs the Ministry of Education and Higher Education pays much attention to. That is rationale since the agriculture sector is one of the most important and most vital sectors in Palestine. - Culture and Heritage Sector: There is a strong link between the education sector and the culture and heritage sector. The Ministry of Education places great importance to promoting the Palestinian culture and heritage by supporting Palestinian artists, poets and authors. By doing so, it creates a well-educated generation that follows suit of Palestinian poets and authors through organizing students' competitions as well as by consolidating and enhancing students' talents. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education considers the Palestinian heritage as a significant part of the Palestinian people's national identity. - Labor Sector The labor sector is closely related with the education sector, mainly with regard to developing technical and vocational education and adapting the skills and competences of secondary, tertiary and university graduates to the current and future labor market's needs. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education and the Ministry of Labor have strong cooperation within the framework of the Higher Council of V ocational and Technical Education to set the policies and direction of this sector as well as to develop it. - Energy Sector Educational programs, mainly formal and non-formal ones, can better preserve and contribute to renewable energy. Education is essential for reducing the levels of carbon which leads to global warming. It is necessary to present the youth with knowledge and skills of energy use Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202231 with the aim of enabling them to make informed decisions as energy-users. As part of the plan to provide schools with sustainable energy, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education decided to provide them with power generating solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. It cooperated with power companies to transfer surplus electricity in the summer to the utility power company which in turn returns these units of electricity to the schools in winter when consumption of electricity increases and solar panels productivity decreases. - Environment Sector: Education can present people with skills to participate in constructing and keeping cities more sustainable and more resilient in times of disasters. Education is also key to full understanding and reduction of the impact of climate change, especially at the local level. Education and training optimizes skills and capacities necessary for supporting sustainable livelihood means, preserving natural resources and biodiversity, particularly in environments at risk. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education attaches special attention to environmental issues. In cooperation with PCBS, it makes full biennial periodical survey of the educational environment in schools, preschools, universities and other higher education institutions. It also provides green and environment-friendly schools buildings. It uses clean energy and grows the lands owned by education facilities. It also promotes students attitudes towards hygiene and gives environmental issues enough room in the curricula. At the same time, it makes sure that students' activities address environment and biodiversity preservation issues in Palestine. - Health Sector: Education can make a difference in the health sector. It reduces the rates of early mortality, raises awareness on reproductive health, reduces the prevalence of diseases and ensures healthy lifestyles and well-being. Based on this interconnected and interdependent relationship between both sectors, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and the Ministry of Health implement several schools' health programs and activities such vaccination and medical referrals. Since school health is essential for realizing education goals, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education established a General Administration of School Health in the year 2000. Moreover, the Palestinian curricula includes a number of subjects concerning different health issues. - Information and Communications Technology Sector (ICT) The development of telecommunications, digitalization and information technology enabled several poor countries to overcome costly infrastructure investments and allowed them to improve education services at effective cost. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education moves towards digitalizing education to make milestone change in the educational process. It intends to employ technology for the service of education based on four components. Three of these components depend on the infrastructure of communications and information technology as well as technology equipment (internet, portals, computers). The fourth component is teachers training and rehabilitation. - International Relations Sector: There is a strong relationship between education and the means of implementing and activating Ministry of Education and Higher Education32 international partnership for sustainable development. The relationship with international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNICEF, UNRWA and other supporters of the education sector (education development partners) is essential for helping Palestine (financially, technical experience) develop its educational system and enhance its ability to fulfill the 2030 sustainable development goals under its international obligations. - Justice Sector: Education contributes to abridging the social and economic gaps towards achieving equality. Social education is vital for facilitating and ensuring participation, inclusiveness, social justice and social coherence. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education attached high importance to justice, equality, freedoms and other values in the new Palestinian curricula and educational activities and initiatives at schools. - Local Government Sector Education is essential for developing the skills necessary for reducing and managing disasters' risks. There is strong cooperation between the education and local government sectors. For example, some municipalities and local councils collect education taxes where revenues are spent on education and to provide pieces of land for building schools as well as on providing students with relevant services. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education looks forward to more effective role by municipalities and local government units to provide preschools, especially in areas where until now don't have preschool education as a compulsory service for one year. This policy is designed in line with the National Policy Agenda of 2017-2022 which gives special attention to this sector in terms of enrolment or quality of education, as it views preschool education as a necessary stage for preparing children for Basic education. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education views municipalities and local government units as pivotal partners for digitalizing education and improving its quality in Palestine. - National Economy Sector: Economic activities, organizing projects, labor market skills and education levels are all interconnected. Education can decisively affect production patterns and consumers' awareness of more sustainable products and waste prevention. The education sector is closely connected with the economic sector, and therefore education content should be aligned with the demands of the labor market in terms of the skills which facilitate transition from school to work hence preventing mismatching with the labor market. Education also supports industrial development and economic transformation. It affects innovation and provides the bases necessary for absorbing technology and diversity. - Public Funds Management Sector: The Ministry of Finance and Planning supports implementing different sectoral strategies and policies through its development and organizational role on the national level; support of the educational policies and National Policy Agenda; and technical and fiscal support for the application of these policies. The Ministry of Finance and Planning guidelines and procedures support the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in institutionalizing the result-based management approach by preparing programs-based plans and budgets. Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202233 - Social Protection Sector: Education is necessary for eliminating poverty. It enables individuals to increase their income and resilience. Educating girls enables them to overcome poverty by reducing the rates of early marriage, health problems and other risks. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education and the Ministry of Social Development have several joint complementary activities. They follow up on dropout students and try to reinstitute them into school. Furthermore, the Ministry of Social Development supports poor families to enable their children to continue education and assists in solving the social problems which they face. - Tourism and Antiquities Sector: The Ministry of Education and Higher Education attaches great attention to promoting students' affiliation to their homeland and their pride in the Palestinian history and culture. It materializes that through the Palestinian curricula, educational activities and tours organized by schools to archaeological sites in the different Palestinian areas. This role by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education is complementary to the efforts of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquity to expose Palestinian tourism and archaeological sites demonstrating the history of the people of Palestine and the stories of the people who lived in Palestine over centuries. - Water and Wastewater Sector: Education and training develop the skills and capabilities of using natural resources more sustainably. Education also enhance hygiene. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education, therefore, pays special attention to rationalization of water-use and safe-handling of wastewater as well as utilization of treated water for agricultural use. The Ministry also gives attention to other environmental and health programs presented to schools. The content of the Palestinian curricula has sufficient room for this subject as well. - Gender Equality Sector: Education of women and girls is important for improving their abilities, participation skills and life opportunities, hence the State of Palestine gives special attention to gender equality. In that regard, Palestine was one of the countries that achieved the specific targets of gender equality and equity under the goals of education for all 2000-2015. It also made significant progress regarding positive discrimination for the benefit of females. Proving its interest in gender issues, it created gender units in all public Palestinian institutions. These units have close cooperation with the Ministry of Women's Affairs. - Youth Sector: The Ministry of Education and Higher Education gives special attention to the youth sector since all youth categories are students of basic, secondary, academic, vocational or higher education. Through its programs, the Ministry targets this sector by providing the youth with the skills and competences they need to meet the demands of the labor market in Palestine and abroad. Ministry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022III. Sector's Vision and Strategic GoalsMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202237 III. Vision and Strategic Goals of the Education Sector Educational Vision Since the Palestinian education system requires a clear and agreed upon vision with obvious skills, knowledge and values that are suitable for the 21st century, and would be considered a springboard for restructuring the education strategies and activities, the following vision was adopted for the educational sector in Palestine: \" A Palestinian society that has values, culture and technology to produce knowledge and employ it for its liberation and development.\" Transforming the education system to realize this vision requires that the educational system and schools be viewed as: - Community-based schools owned by the society and designed and established to be educational organizations where employees are knowledge-producers and students are treated as key individuals of the educational process. - Schools free from the bureaucratic structures which hinder utilizing multiple paths necessary for achieving targets. - Schools encouraging all students on free reading, research and self-learning. - Open-minded and developed leadership that respects the other. - All operational processes of the system are subject to development and continuing improvement. - The leaders of the system and schools concentrate on prevalent social norms which govern the behavior, including those related to beliefs, development, knowledge and those that orient the employees and the students towards the values and the vision. Based on this context, we look forward to achieving: - A society where governmental, non-governmental and private organizations can work together to provide quality education at all levels. - Safe child-friendly schools with diversified education and technology methods able to build effective relations with the society to meet students' needs. - Qualified and committed schools 'staff that enjoy respect and appreciation, knowing that their first priority is to provide service for students. - Schools working in partnership with the directorates and the ministry which, in turn, supplies them with financial and human resources as well as technical support. They also set forth learning standards and objectives and empower assessment and accountability systems which inform the society of the education quality at schools and the levels of successes achieved by students. Ministry of Education and Higher Education38 - Schools promoting citizenship and affiliation to the society, in which the local community feels that schools are their property and that they bear responsibility for the quality of education they provide. Also, that schools are responsible for creating the conditions in society that lead to their prosperity. - Schools with appropriate self-management that enables them to independently take decisions and measures related to educational issues and school life management in accordance with the appropriate mandate and powers. - Schools that support professional development of their staff by concentrating on continuing improvements that lead to students' success. - Schools and leaders that serve, support and emphasize integration of students and keep them at the center of the educational process. - The ministry and the directorates build integrated relationships and coordination with teacher training institutions, and ensure that student teachers have practical experience qualifying them for a teaching degree in education hence enable them to teach after graduation. Strategic Goals of the Education Sector The current strategic plan for the education sector adopted three main general objectives for the education system in Palestine. These objectives are an extension of the goals for EDSP III (2014-2019), including all the targets under 2030 SDG 4 and the national priorities related to the National Policy Agenda of 2017-2022: Sector Goal (1): Ensuring safe, inclusive, and equitable access to quality education at all levels of the system The first goal of the Palestinian education sector aims to ensure safe, inclusive and equitable access to education. This goal also includes providing safe access to schools and educational institutions as well as a safe and violence free educational environment for students and teachers, particularly in the areas threatened by the Israeli occupation military and settlers; such as \"Area C\", and the Old City of Jerusalem and Hebron where that need to feel safe and protected is most vital. The Palestinian education seeks to achieve inclusion and equality at all educational levels (preschool, basic education, secondary academic and vocational education, higher education, research and non-formal education). This goal serves as a commitment to challenging all forms of exclusion, marginalization, inequity and inequality related to teaching and learning opportunities. It is oriented towards making the necessary changes in the educational policies and concentrating efforts to serve the deprived categories of the society, mainly the persons with disabilities to ensure that no person is deprived of their right to education. This goal has two dimensions: The first is to improve enrollment in all the educational stages (preschools, basic, secondary and higher education) and the educational tracks (vocational track, scientific track and human sciences track) and find a balance between them. The second dimension aims to maintain enrollment and survival rates and good participation in education (such as literacy and others).Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202239 Sector Goal (2): Developing a student-centered teaching and learning pedagogy and environment The second goal aims to ensure quality education, improve educational outcomes, promote inputs and processes, evaluate outcomes and set forth progress measuring mechanisms. This goal can be achieved by ensuring teachers and educators good employment conditions and appropriate professional training as well as support and incentives within genuine educational systems administered and resourced effectively. It is sought to promote quality education which enhances creativity and knowledge and ensures acquisition of basic literacy skills, analytical skills and problem-solving skills. as well as advanced social and communications skills. It is aimed to enhance a Palestinian education system that develops the skills and values which help citizens enjoy good health and decent life; face up to local and international challenges by means of education for sustainable development and international citizenship; arms students with science, knowledge, creativity, excellence and loyalty; and strengthens citizens' steadfastness and attitude towards local, regional and international development. Sector Goal (3): Enhance Accountability and Results-Based Leadership, Governance and Management The Ministry of Education and Higher Education seeks to strengthen its monitoring and organizational role in the educational sector by institutionalizing the educational strategic planning process; ensure that the necessary legislations for the education sector's management and development are in place; ensure proper application of the national educational plans and policies, change the ministry's inputs-based approach into results and accountability-based one towards decentralization and local community participation; develop financial management towards optimal use of potential resources. The ministry has adopted a clear objective to institutionalize the procedures and approaches of the sector-wide concept through the financial agreements of the Joint Financial Arrangement and promoting coordination with the different partners. This is accompanied by extensive capacity building and training programs for the sectoral and administrative staff. Ministry of Education and Higher Education40 Figure (3): Logical Framework linking vision, goals and service programs Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022IV. Education Sector PoliciesMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202243 IV. Education Sector Policies Education policy is the governmental education-related policy principles and decisions as well as the laws and rules governing the education systems. It is a set of principles which define the general scope, philosophy, objectives and systems of education, as well as the general structure of the education system and its different organizations. These set of principles explain the relation between what the country needs and what the education institutions should provide, hence these education institutions can be evaluated based on the above. Based on the reviews of the education sector and the national education trends, the following policies of the education sector were adopted in accordance with the sector's strategy goals: Goal (1): Ensuring safe, inclusive and equitable enrolment in the education sector at all levels of the system Key Policies and Strategies: -Ensure enrollment of all Palestinian children to education according to law and as a human right, with special attention to be given for children in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem. -Provide adequate means to increase the rate of students with special needs to be integrated into schools within a clear national strategy that defines relations with all concerned. This includes stakeholders, the role of each stakeholder and the requirements necessary to achieve this purpose. -Meeting the needs of gifted and creative students to ensure them development. -Maintain progress towards expanding enrollment in early childhood programs. This includes the expansion of the Ministry's engagement in the provision of such service to children in remote areas in the form of preschool programs attached to lower-level basic schools (1-4 grades). In addition, municipalities and local government units should also be encouraged to provide preschools, mainly in areas where private sector investment is modest. -Progressive enforcement of compulsory early childhood education, prior to Basic education stage (preschool) in accordance with the Law of Education, which was approved by the Council of Ministers in the first quarter of 2017. -Provide sufficient and adequate school buildings that have suitable and safe facilities from playgrounds, fields, health units, etc. for all educational stages. -Organize public awareness campaigns to encourage the people who haven't enrolled in education or quit school without literacy skills to enroll in non-formal education.

Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022V. Situation AnalysisMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202249 V. Situation Analysis To better explain the process of the education sector plan development, it is important to provide a short description of the relevant context: Historical Context: Historically, Palestine lies south west of Asia on the southeastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Coast, extending to the Jordan River. Thus, it lies in the heart of the world, namely Asia and Africa, which makes it a land bridge linking both continents. It has a large number of historically and religiously important cities. These cities, with Jerusalem at the top, are of high importance for the three monotheistic religions. Political Situation: Politically speaking, Palestine is a State under occupation according to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 19\\67 of the year 2012. It has the most unstable security situation in the world due to the Israeli occupation violations of Palestinian citizens' rights in addition to the physical presence of the colonial settlements that are built on expropriated Palestinian eland; a breach of all international conventions and laws. What makes the situation worse, as most international human rights organizations view, is the apartheid wall which Israel built on Palestinian lands in the West Bank, in addition to the violations committed against the Gaza Strip epitomized by the siege. These Israeli policies and measures, which it has accelerated since the inception of the Palestinian National Authority in 1993, worsened and tensed the security situation. Demographics of Palestine: The estimated population of Palestine in 2016 is (4.88) million of which (2.97) million in the West Bank (60.8%) and (1.91) million in the Gaza Strip1. Though the total fertility rate in Palestine had declined in 2014 to (4.06)2, it still has a high population growth (2.8) compared with other Arab countries. The percentage of the individuals aged (0-14) years constitutes (39.4%) of the total population whereas that of the elderly population aged (60 and over) constitutes (4.5%) of the total population. Data revealed a decline in the average of young children in Palestine and an increase in the average of the age category (15-59 year olds); while the average of the elderly (60 years and over) remains steady. Despite this relative transformation in the age structure of the Palestinian population, dependency ratio in Palestine increased compared with other Arab countries. This increase occurred despite the fact that it declined from (101.3) in 1997 to (74.6%) in 2014. 1 PCBS, Demographics in Palestine 2015. 2 PCBS: Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014.Ministry of Education and Higher Education50 In light of these data, attention should be given to the significant rise in the rate of the youth aged (15-29 years). This age category is increasing noticeably in Palestine, making up for 30% of the total population. Palestine is going through a fast population growth and demographic shift creating challenges for the 2030 agenda for development due to the impacts they have on the resources necessary for development and provision of public services such as education, healthcare, food and energy, on the one hand. On the other hand, it gives an opportunity for economic growth. Based on population growth projections in Palestine3, the population is likely to increase from (4.75) million in 2015 to (6.9) million in 2030 and (9.5) million by 2050. This increase is projected though fertility rate is expected to decrease. This situation would lead to demographic change in population categories. The percentage of the age category (0-14) shall decline to (35%) by 2030 or reach (25%) by 2050. The percentage of the elderly shall slightly increase while the percentage of the working-age category (15-64) shall increase from (57.8%) to (61%) by 2030 and reach (67%) by 2050. This shows that the working-age category shall increase and so dependency ratio shall decrease. Palestine has a demographic opportunity that can be converted into demographic return and economic growth if invested well into the economic, social and administrative policies and human capital, mainly health promotion, education quality, productive workforce, gender equality and empowerment of youth and women. In light of the impact of demographic factors, the education age category (preschool-higher education) shall increase from (2.1) million in 2015 to (2.8) in 2030, an increase by (33%). The number of school students shall increase from (1.3) million in 2015 to (2) million in 2030, an increase by (54%). This implies that there is need for new infrastructure and new schools. 100 schools should be built on annual basis from 2015 until 2030. Labor4 The rate of Palestinian laborers working in the West Bank, Israel and Israeli settlements reached (16.6%) during the first quarter of 2014. The rate of wage laborers was (67.6%) of the total number of laborers in Palestine (64.8%) of which in the West Bank and (74.6%) in the Gaza Strip. The services sector, which is considered to be a key employer for the Palestinian workforce, was employing (35.7%) of the total number of the workers in Palestine in the first quarter of 2014, (65%) of which in the Gaza Strip and 32.6% () in the West Bank. (2.8%) of the Palestinian workforce works in Israel, and most of the Palestinian workers there work in the construction sector (63.0%). The trade sector, restaurants, and hotels is the second key employer in Palestine. It employs (21.1%) of the workforce in Palestine of which (23.5%) are in the West Bank and (20.2%) are in Gaza Strip, and (11.1%) of them work in Israel. It is noted that the public sector plays a key role in reducing the economic crisis that the Palestinian people face. It was employing about a quarter of the Palestinian workforce (22.9%) during the first quarter of 2014 - (40.5%) in the Gaza Strip and (15.9%) in the West Bank-. 3 Prime Minister's Office, National Population Committee, UNPF, \"Palestine 2030\", population growth in Palestine and its impact on socio-economic sectors, 2016. 4 Situation of the Palestinian people living in Palestine, 2014.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202251 Agriculture: Agriculture is the backbone of the Palestinian economy, contributing nearly (27%) to the GDP in the West Bank and absorbing (37%) of the workforce. The cultivated areas amounted to (2.435.000) dunums in the 1950's, representing (40%) of the total area of the West Bank. The area under irrigation was about (322.000) dunums, representing (13.2%) of the total cultivated areas. The cultivated area in the Gaza Strip increased from (97) thousand dunums in 1948 to (146) thousand dunums in 1967. However, Israeli occupation control of water resources and confiscation of large areas of the Palestinians' lands caused damage to the agricultural sector. And so, its contribution to GDP decreased from (36.3%) in 1966 to (5.1%) in 2011 in the West Bank and from (28.1%) to (8.3%) in the Gaza Strip. The factors that led to this decline are owed to Israeli occupation confiscation of Palestinians land and control of water resources. These policies pushed the Palestinian workforce to quit farming. Technology: Indicators of PCBS show that the rates of the Palestinian households that have (ICT) or information and communication technology tools in 2013 were as follows: computers (50.5%), (54.1%) in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; landline phone (35.4%), (38.9% ) the West Bank and (28.8% ) in Gaza Strip; Internet service at home (35.7%), (39.5%) in the West Bank and (28.3%) in Gaza Strip. These data also show that (96.4%) of the households in Palestine have at least one mobile phone, (96%) in the West Bank and (97.1%) in Gaza Strip. Rate of persons (10 year olds and above) who use computers and Internet is at (53.7%) and (39.6%) respectively. Economic Situation: Prospects of the Palestinian economic growth is subject to the Israeli occupation control and domination, especially in area (C) and the Gaza Strip. It has been confiscating land, controlling natural resources, besieging the Gaza Strip and restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinians for years. Despite all these obstacles, economic indicators show some improvement. Preliminary estimates indicated an increase in GDP in Palestine by (8%) during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015; in addition, the increase in the GDP per capita rose (1.5%) during the same period. Contribution by the workforce was at (45.8%). The year 2015 witnessed a decline in the unemployment rate going from 27.5% in 2014 to 26.6% in 2015. Despite this, it is noted that the rate of unemployment among the youth aged (15-19 year olds) has been steadily increasing, according to the PCBS data, recording 39% and 51% among fresh graduates during the first quarter of 20165. The government seeks to improve revenue collection competences and rationalize expenditures. It set forth a scenario to reform revenues by adopting a revenues strategy aimed at expanding the tax base, increasing the number of taxpayers, promoting registered taxpayers' commitment, reviewing tax exemptions and improving commercial and financial relations with Israel through specialized committees to solve pending problems and improve transfer of clearance taxes. Concerning expenditures policies, the government seeks to continue implementation of the austerity policy, dispose of unnecessary expenditures, keep the number of public sector employees stable and reduce the debts it owes to banks to ensure enough margin for borrowing 5 PCBS, census.Ministry of Education and Higher Education52 in case of crisis, as well as to and arrears. It also wants to set forth a scenario for financing investment projects with focus on high priority projects. The Israeli Occupation and the Reality of Education The Palestinian people have been going through tragic situations due to the life-threatening policies and practices adopted by the Israeli occupation. It exercises intransigence, arrogance and armed violence against men, women, children and the elderly in addition to disrupting the life and development of all people. It also caused big damage to the education system by prohibiting many teachers and students from reaching schools for long periods of time. In many cases, it denied schools the right to be supplied with computers6. Israel is determined to obstruct the Palestinian education process through its policies of closure, siege, schools and education centers demolition. Moreover, it denies students access to schools and universities, prohibits schools' construction in area (C) and Jerusalem, censures the Palestinian curricula in Jerusalem as well as places pressure on private schools there to adopt Israeli curricula in place of the Palestinian curricula. Its practices include imposing a siege on the Gaza Strip and banning entry of construction materials necessary for building and rehabilitating schools, obstructing entry of textbooks and disrupting communications between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Education Sector in Jerusalem: Obstacles and Challenges: I. Buildings and Classrooms: A large number of schools in Jerusalem suffer shortage of buildings suitable for educational use due to: 1. Difficulty of securing suitable land for building schools. 2. Difficulty of obtaining construction licenses from the Israeli occupation municipality . 3. Shortage of the number of available classrooms combined with the small present classrooms led to an overcrowding of students, hence making it difficult to secure appropriate educational environment. 4. Some schools face demolition orders. 5. Prohibiting schools' expansion and imposing high fines and taxes on schools, which drains the MoEHE financially. II. Leased Buildings MoEHE leases some apartments, as a practical solution. However, these buildings lack school specifications and are located in separate areas, making it difficult for teachers and students to move from one section to another. This adversely affects students' discipline and so the education process in general. III. Restoration and Maintenance: Many schools in Jerusalem lack regular maintenance and restoration, particularly within the walls of the old city. Most of these schools are ancient and cracked and lack ventilation and natural light. Despite these difficult conditions, most of them are overcrowded reflecting Palestinians tenacity to hold on to their right to the old city. In short, most of governmental\\ Waqf schools in Jerusalem are in need of restoration and maintenance. 6 Arab Knowledge Report 2010-2011.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202253 IV . The Education Sector in Jerusalem is subject to Multiple Authorities: This could be the most serious problem facing the education sector. Multiple authorities mean the absence of a single supervising party responsible for setting the philosophical vision and or education strategy for schools, which leaves opportunities open for the Israeli occupation authorities to interfere in the affairs of Palestinian schools in Jerusalem to serve their interests and goals. V. Israeli Occupation Interference with the Education Sector and Curricula: Israeli occupation authorities control the Palestinian education curricula in East Jerusalem. They are responsible for the printing of textbooks used in Arab schools. The printing is executed post review and changes of the texts to suit their views and ideology (i.e., deleting all that relates to the Palestinian identity, and citizens' rights as well as rights to the al-Aqsa Mosque. VI. School Dropout: Main causes of students' dropout: - Israeli occupation municipality encourages students to drop out by tolerating and ignoring students' absence. - Deteriorating economic conditions push families to take their children out of school into the labor workforce instead of continuing their education. - Automatic upgrading of students regardless of his/her academic achievement or ratio of attendance; a policy adopted and applied on Arab schools by the occupation municipality. - Shortage of school buildings, overcrowded classrooms, and its poor conditions. - The apartheid wall and military check-points are serious obstacles obstructing students from continuing their education. Appendix 4, below, reports on the diagnosis of the status of education in Jerusalem. \"Area C\": The Interim Agreements between the PLO and Israel and in 1994, divided the West Bank into three categories: Areas A, B and C. Area A and Area B comprise approximately 36% of the West Bank and encompasses large rural areas. \"Area C\" covers 64% of the West Bank where (5.8%) of the Palestinian population lives; Israel has retained complete control of this area, including security and administrative matters such as land-related civil matters, land allocation, planning and construction as well as infrastructure. There are 2,074 Palestinian schools of which 1,782 are in the West Bank with 179 in \"Area C.\" These schools are subject to systematic Israeli violations since they are located near the Israeli built apartheid wall, colonial settlements and military checkpoints or are located in Jerusalem and Hebron. Israeli occupation authorities allow Palestinians to build only on 1% of the area of this part of the Palestinian territory. The citizens who apply for permits to restore buildings can hardly get these permits. Such a policy is a major obstacle to building new schools or restoring old ones. The following table shows the extent of losses incurred in the educational process as a result of Israeli violations in 2016: Ministry of Education and Higher Education54 Table (4): Losses incurred to the educational process as a result of Israeli violations in 2016: Item 2016 Arrests 135 Detentions 793 Injured 778 Martyrs 25 Assaults on schools 66 Unsafe access to schools 42 Demolition notices 8 Main Israeli violations affecting schools in \"Area C\": - Deprivation of the State of Palestine from having full sovereignty over its land. - Political instability and spread of military checkpoints and electronic gates in the whole area of the West Bank. - Israeli colonizers' violence towards Palestinians. - The physical presence of the apartheid wall, withholding the issuance of construction permits, and shortage of school buildings. - Lack of adequate capital for these areas. - The spread of poverty, unemployment, and the phenomenon of dropping out of school, especially among girls. - Censure of Palestinian curricula, especially in Jerusalem. The Status of Education in Palestine Given the importance of education in preparing individuals and society to engage in regional and international competitions and facing up to challenges such as ICT revolution, rapid information growth and economic changes, the education sector should be enabled to keep pace with all these changes. It should build and rehabilitate students to acquire new knowledge, technical and life skills, as well as to acquire human values and attitudes towards preserving their national identity and Arab Islamic heritage and culture. The changing political conditions, ongoing Israeli occupation and strife to achieve national independence affect the different aspects of life in Palestine. These imposed factors demand that Palestinians have a resilient education system that is responsive to the rapidly changing situations and prepares individuals for a better future. Diagnosis of the Education Status Given the importance of having an effective education strategic plan for (2017-2022) in line Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202255 with national priorities of the national development plan (2017-2022) and the goals of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, mainly the SDG4 and its targets which the world seeks to realize by 2030, diagnosing the education status is considered to be the first step towards achieving the national priorities and international goals. The preparation of the sectoral education plan depended on the documents and reports which provided us with inclusive knowledge and realistic diagnosis of the Palestinian education sector as well as special scientific procedures. Key reports and documents used as a reference for the preparation of the plan: 1. The Education Sector Plan Review Report of 2014-2016. 2. National Report on Education for All 2000\\2015. 3. The report of the Higher Committee for the Review of the Educational Process in Palestine- 2015. 4. Annual monitoring and evaluation reports released by the monitoring and evaluation system of EDSP III (2014-2019). 5. Analysis findings according to the suggested diagnosis tool of the sectoral planning manual 2017-2022, issued by Ministry of Finance and Planning. These five documents are key to diagnosing the education system (preschool, basic school, academic and vocational secondary education, non-formal education, higher education). Summary of the Palestinian Education Status 1. Preschool Education (Kindergartens): The Ministry of Education and Higher Education has decided to increase preschool education opportunities by increasing classrooms in governmental schools and rehabilitating their staffs in accordance with early childhood development strategy. Providing preschool services is considered to be a basic element of the inclusive approach to children's development. It is evident that the performance of the children who enroll in preschools is much better at later stages than that of those who don't. A basic target of the current education strategy is to develop a preschool curriculum and increase the number of licensed kindergartens which meet health, safety and professional standards. Reviewing the above said documents and reports indicated that: - The main and specific indicators of preschools and their targets for 2013-2015 focused on ensuring safe and equal access to education for all, including individuals with special needs (achieving international enrollment records). They also focused on improving safe, motivating, equal and student-centered education environment that meets community and development needs. These targets can be measured through the following indicators : Rate of children enrolled in preschools (KG1, KG2). This is defined as the total number of children enrolled in the Preschool Program approved by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education regardless of the age of the child at the time when they enrolled. They appear in the form of a percentage of the population of preschool age category (4-5 years). The rate of children enrolled in preschools rose from (55.1%) in 2014 to (57.3%) in 2015. Ministry of Education and Higher Education56 Figure (5) shows that less than half of the preschool aged children are not enrolled. The rate of enrolled children falls far short of the target set by Dakar Framework for Action (70%) though preschool education institutions are operated by the private sector, except for two preschools operated by MoEHE. However, these are the facts for the years 2004-2013. It is worth noting that the number reached 96 for the government KG2 in 2016. To achieve the said target, MoEHE endeavors to: a. Open preliminary classrooms in marginalized areas and give access to children with disabilities. b. Urge the private sector to invest in early childhood sector. c. Encourage private preschools to accept children with disabilities. d. Encourage international and local organizations to participate in maintaining governmental preschools and open private ones, as well as for institutions working in the early childhood sector. e. Raise awareness of the Palestinian family and local community about the importance of education and early childhood care, and to enroll their children with special needs in preschools. f. Make in-depth studies about the government's experience in opening preschool classrooms in governmental schools. Key preschool sector's targets: increasing the rate of female educators, principals and supervisors in governmental and private preschools in accordance with teachers training strategic standards. Contributing elements, conducted by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, to achieving this target are: enhancing and developing the qualifications of women educators working in preschools, developing women educators' qualification standards; and training supervisors and teachers within the sector. To upgrade the indicators of the above said targets, it is necessary to take the following steps: a. Continue to review and diagnose professional needs of women educators and supervisors as well as principals of preschools. b. Produce specialized training programs for preschools' educators, supervisors and principals. This includes external training.EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 -2022 51 (achieving international enrollment records).

Preschool curriculum: The General Framework for Preschool Curriculum was accomplished in accordance with children's needs. Preschool teaching and learning national manual must be accomplished, as well as to complete the national manual for preschool women educators. The percentage of students enrolled in governmental preschool programs rose from (0.7%) in 2014 to (1.24%) in 2015. Despite this increase, this result falls far short of the target (4.2%) which will hopefully be achieved by 2019. This situation shows that it is urgent to provide preschools for the areas which still lack such services to enable children to enroll and develop their personalities at an early age. The number of public and private licensed preschools in the northern governorates increased from (956) preschools in 2013 to (1137) in 2015; while the student's ratio to preschool teachers (PTR) in 2012-2013 stood at (17.8:1). However, the rate of actual achievement compared with the curriculum evaluation and development plan was not satisfying.EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 -2022 52 Key preschool sector's targets: increasing the rate of female educators, principals and supervisors in governmental and private preschools in accordance with teachers training strategic standards.

However, the rate of actual achievement compared with the curriculum evaluation and development plan was not satisfying. Key Challenges Facing Preschool Education (Kindergartens): a. Compulsory preschool education has not been implemented yet in accordance with the new Palestinian Education Law. b. Raising the rate of enrollment in preschools. c. Improving performance of preschools' staffs. d. Ensuring budgets for early childhood sector. e. Curriculum consistency with the philosophy of education in Palestine. f. Prohibition by Israeli occupation of building or adding any classrooms to public preschools in Jerusalem, Hebron, Bedouin communities and \"Area C.\" g. Recurrent aggressions by the Israeli occupation military and settlers on preschools in contact areas (close locations with the settlers and or Israeli checkpoints residents). h.

Pending decision regarding the creation of an adequate management unit to administer preschools. i. Ensure the development of a quality child-centered education service, which requires overcoming the following various obstacles: 1. Most preschools' teachers aren't specialized in education, in general, or child education. 2. Most of preschools' women teachers who receive educational training quit working in private preschools. 3. Inadequate training concerning teaching through play. 4. Absence of teaching through play programs for children with disabilities. 5. Inadequate infrastructure of preschools for children with disabilities. 6. Shortage of furniture, educational toys and computers. 7. Traditional technical support by organizations concerned with the early childhood sector. Suggestions to overcome the above said obstacles and to promote preschools and the early childhood sector: a. Making periodical studies about the quality of preschool education. b. Raising preschool educators' standards. c. Keeping pace with international preschool education developments. d. Employing locally made toys and materials that can be used at preschools as educational tools. e. Raising families and children awareness about dealing with children and providing assistance in building their personality. Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202259 f. Rehabilitating preschools infrastructure to fit children with disabilities. g. Introducing educational technology into preschools curricula. h.

Introducing a unit for preliminary classrooms in the new school buildings allocated for the lower basic stage. q. Encouraging universities to open specialized program for preschools. r. Ensuring financial support for preschools through sustainable local and governmental resources. s. Having a standard vision for all governmental and nongovernmental institutions supportive of the early childhood sector by making it part of the plans of the ministry and stakeholders. 2. Public Basic Education Sector: Transforming the public education system from a memorization-based and test-driven to a student-centered dynamic pedagogy model is at the heart of the strategy. Such a deep shift requires an integrated systemic approach that covers genuine reform in curriculum, assessment, supervision, and teacher education. Changing the role of supervision from teacher-control to teacher- empowerment system and applying authentic assessment methods as opposed to traditional ones are preconditions for any successful educational reform. The ministry will build on the initiated change process to shift the role of the principal from pure administrative tasks to dealing with educational quality matters as a resident supervisor. The implementation of the Teacher Education Strategy (TES) will expand its coverage significantly with a view to have all working teachers qualified by the end of the 6-year strategy (2017-2022). The ministry also responds actively to the rapid changes in the IT field to make use of its potential for enhanced and more autonomous learning. However, strengthening inclusive and special education services across the education system remains to be a challenge, where the ministry will need address it intensively. Also, establishing robust mechanisms of cooperation with the international community to protect the right to education for all Palestinians in \"Area C\": and Jerusalem remains a key objective.Ministry of Education and Higher Education60 Finally, one major 'system' reform was carried out/adopted, which is the restructuring of the schools according to Grade (1-4), (5-9), and (10-12); since it is considered to be a priority of the strategy. Key Education Sector National Legislations Developed by MoEHE: 1. Like other Palestinian ministries and organizations, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education operated according to the Jordanian and Egyptian laws that were in force in the West Bank and Gaza Strip respectively since 1967. After the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, it issued regulations and bylaws to govern government organizations and ministries, including the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. 2. In 2004, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education prepared a Draft Law on Education and presented it to the PLC for discussion where it was recently approved. Presently, work is underway to develop regulations for the mentioned law. This law includes the principles and goals under Article (3\\B\\4) which stipulates that \"education shall be a right for every citizen. The PNA shall guarantee that not only school students but also all ages, social and professional categories shall enjoy this right\". 3. Article (24\\1) of the Palestinian Amended Basic Law stipulates that \" Every citizen shall have the right to education. It shall be compulsory until at least the end of the basic level. Education shall be free in public schools, institutes, and institutions\". 4. A new Law on Education was drafted and approved by the Council of Ministers in the first and second readings. It is now in its final stages of the 3rd reading after which it will to be submitted to the President of the State of Palestine for approval.

They also indicate that the absorption capacity is close to the standard required for ensuring education aged population enrollment, and increasing the participation of the Basic education aged population group in basic and secondary education programs. School buildings quality: Basic education school buildings adaptability increased, in accordance with school buildings standards (e.g. space per student, sanitary units, playgrounds, physical state of classrooms, teacher area, labs and library), from (84.3%) in 2014 to (84.5%) in 2015. Such increase shows that school buildings improvement is based on priorities-linked needs in spite of limited budgets. Classrooms and non-classrooms shall be increased in accordance with the educational physical standards in basic schools by (882) classrooms by the end of 2017.

By the end of 2017, this shall help ensure qualified human resources to deal with students with disabilities, accommodated school buildings, books and tools for this group. It is necessary, therefore, to develop a specialized diploma for students with disabilities, engage relevant private sector organizations, and include their needs into MoEHE's supplies and printing plan. Moreover, necessary legislations that are responsive to the Palestinian situation should be drafted and school capacities should be promoted to absorb the largest number possible of students with disabilities. And last but not least, enabling policies should be adopted to help them become productive citizens and to be able to enroll in higher education institutions.

(Figure 15) The rates and values of the above said indicators show a significant increase in the indicators of the above-mentioned goal and its response to international standards. They also indicate that the absorption capacity is close to the standard required for ensuring education aged population enrollment, and increasing the participation of the Basic education aged population group in basic and secondary education programs. School buildings quality: Basic education school buildings adaptability increased, in accordance with school buildings standards (e.g. space per student, sanitary units, playgrounds, physical state of classrooms, teacher area, labs and library ), from (84.3%) in 2014 to (84.5%) in 2015. Such increase shows that school buildings improvement is based on priorities -linked needs in spite of limited budgets. Classrooms and non-classrooms shall be increased in accordance with the educational physical standards in basic schools by (882) classrooms by the end of 2017.

Values are defined as the core principles, beliefs, ideals standards and life stands that serve as a general guide for directing behavior. They are the reference point for decision-makers, or for evaluating beliefs and actions. On the other hand, attitudes toward education are defined as a group of cognitive, emotional and behavioral components that connect through the individual's response to a certain issue, subject or position (that is education-related), and the nature of the response in terms of acceptance or rejection.

The curricula for grades (1-4) were developed upon the ministry's decision to form committees to put the outline of the curriculum through local experts and Japanese technical support. Understanding that school textbooks alone are not enough, in light of today's available resourceful knowledge and easy access to information, eased developing these curricula. Developing other curricula requires trained teams that are knowledgeable on the rules of writing a book as part of the curriculum, including the content and technical format. The curriculum should never be restricted to the textbook. Rather, the school environment should be harnessed to implement the curriculum smoothly. In addition, teachers should be given enough room to implement the curriculum, but not at the expense of accountability and monitoring by education principals and supervisors in charge. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education's decision towards separating education stages in schools is not an easy one. The rate of schools which were separated in accordance with each educational stage and in line with the strategy of separating basic school students from secondary schools reached (31%). 26.3% 51.2% 55.9% Figure (33): Authentic Assessment Degree of Representation in the curricula of the Arabic Language, Mathematics and Science disciplines for the 4thand 10thgrades (basic) Arabic Languag Math Science Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202275 The curricula for grades (1-4) were developed upon the ministry's decision to form committees to put the outline of the curriculum through local experts and Japanese technical support. Understanding that school textbooks alone are not enough, in light of today's available resourceful knowledge and easy access to information, eased developing these curricula. Developing other curricula requires trained teams that are knowledgeable on the rules of writing a book as part of the curriculum, including the content and technical format. The curriculum should never be restricted to the textbook. Rather, the school environment should be harnessed to implement the curriculum smoothly. In addition, teachers should be given enough room to implement the curriculum, but not at the expense of accountability and monitoring by education principals and supervisors in charge. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education's decision towards separating education stages in schools is not an easy one. The rate of schools which were separated in accordance with each educational stage and in line with the strategy of separating basic school students from secondary schools reached (31%). Challenges and difficulties the process faces include: a. Educational challenges: The students might need to walk longer distances to reach their schools. This might adversely affect the quality of education in certain cases or increase the rate of dropouts. It could also lead to waste of the educational physical and human resources. For example, some schools might have extra classrooms which no longer be used while others might suffer shortage of classrooms as a result of the process. b. Economic challenges: students are forced to walk longer distance, which costs them more money to pay for transportation. In addition, the need for new school buildings and human resources will increase the development and operating costs. c. Social challenges: some families may refuse to move their children to other schools due to higher costs for longer distances between home and school, or remoteness from their residential areas. The diversity of the geographical structure of the Palestinian society (city, village, camp, Bedouin community) may make the separation process more difficult. The number of the students in some villages may not meet separation needs. Also Lack of appropriate locations for building new schools or rejection of a co-education system even at basic stages, due to cultural factors, may complicate the process. d. Political challenges (Israeli occupation): these challenges include the Israeli occupation's policy of not issuing construction permits for the Palestinians living in \"Area C\" and East Jerusalem; apartheid wall; checkpoints; difficulties in movement/travel, experienced by students and teachers alike, from the areas close to Israeli colonies and areas threatened of confiscation; and prohibiting building or adding any concrete rooms to schools in these areas. Key Challenges Facing Basic education: 1. The exceptional situation of Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Jordan valley area, and areas close to the apartheid wall, all pose huge challenges due to Israeli arbitrary measures related to building new schools in these areas. 2. Land for building schools is donated by local communities or municipalities and is not purchased to meet citizens' needs or population density in suitable areas, hence negatively Ministry of Education and Higher Education76 affecting the geographical distribution of schools. 3. Ensuring (100) schools annually to absorb the increasing number of students by 2030. 4. Adapting school buildings to international standards. Over 50% of existent schools should be replaced. 5. Adapting existent and leased school buildings to the needs of students with disabilities. 6. Absence of gender-related policies (males, females, co-ed) and school distribution mechanism. 7. Schools levels are not regulated. 8. Evening classes in Gaza and the applied education shift system. 9. Men are less inclined to view teaching as a desirable option, especially in certain majors (Arabic language, science, and math). Although it is a universal phenomenon, the Palestinian cultural reality requires that males be encouraged to go into teaching. 10. Education profession status: The most important indicators of this issue is that young people are less inclined to go into the teaching profession; an increase in the number of teachers who prefer to leave teaching once they have another job opportunity; teachers' burnout (exhaustion, frustration, dissatisfaction) and its impact on teachers' performance; and the increase in the number of teachers taking on a second job after working hours to meet life basic needs, especially male teachers. 11. Teacher qualification: Over 50% of teachers need educational rehabilitation. They lack educational skills. 12. Recruiting the best graduates for education profession. 13. Education profession is dominated by women. Males do not prefer to go into teaching. 14. Increased violence rates between students and teachers and among students themselves. 15. Current education supervision system. 16. Conflicting and overlapping teachers' training and their poor impact on teachers' performance. These programs are also subject to several parties within the Ministry, 17. Teachers are overloaded by administrative agendas, paper work that is left unattended, and multiple development projects by international and local organizations. 18. Large number of textbooks, especially at basic stage. 19. Multiple concepts and topics without concentrating on students' mastery of any of it, each according to his/her ability. 20. Gap between the intended curriculum and the implemented one. Negligence of the hidden curriculum. 21. Text-book centered and examination-driven education as well as didactic approach. 22. Absence of life context from the education content and concentration on 21st century skills. Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202277 23. Absence of optimal employment of technology with an objective for learning and limiting it to repeating textbook information. 24. Absence of a legal framework to govern the use of technology in the learning process. 25. Weakness of school infrastructure. 26. Multiple projects targeting technology in education and absence of coordination among them. 27. Computer illiteracy among school teachers and principals. 28. Weak education environment for employing technology in education. Suggested solutions to overcome the above said obstacles and develop the Basic education sector: 1. Implementing the policy of owning leased buildings. 2. Ensuring financing resources for purchasing school buildings in Jerusalem. 3. Ensuring budgets necessary for building schools to respond to the natural growth of students' number. 4. Providing heating systems for all schools. 5. Ensuring safe transportation services for the students who live in threatened risky areas. 6. Working to make our schools green and suitable for persons with disabilities (PWDs). 7. Setting forth environment preservation policies, protection methods, and implementation mechanisms. 8. Setting forth a national strategy of employing technology in education. 9. Setting forth national education-assessment strategy. 10. Accrediting a school counseling diploma as pre-requisite for obtaining a counselor's position. 11. Developing a practical education plan to be basis for approval of the education program by the Accreditation and Quality Agency. 12. Developing student education competencies document, focusing on main textbooks. 13. Developing concept paper on literacy and life skills for the basic stage students. 14. Developing a strategy to improve physical education at schools. 15. Implementing the policy of opening leaving schools open after hours for extracurricular and social communication activities. 16. Engaging local community in school activities to participate in disseminating schools' messages. 17. Introducing modern tools and systems (interactive projectors) in schools to achieve quality education using new methods.Ministry of Education and Higher Education78 18. Implementing child capacity developing activities and using the necessary tools which have long-term impact on child scientific thinking. 19. Allocating (100) education counseling centers annually where counselors can provide counseling services to promote students' mental health and ensure student-friendly environment. 20. Developing education supervision system for schools with focus on improving classroom practices. 21. Setting up monitoring and evaluation system through interdepartmental cooperation. 22. Setting forth environment-preservation policies and developing procedures to implement them. 23. Setting forth new education assessment policy to render it part of the teaching learning process and avoid memorization-based assessment. 24. Concentrating on art and physical education and developing strategies to materialize them at basic schools and for both sexes. 25. Integrating environmental concepts into the curricula. 26. Evaluating school textbooks in terms of gender-sensitivity and promotion of environment preservation concepts and life skills. 27. Adopting programs that promote students attitudes towards vocational and technical education. 28. Integrating vocational education into general education (7-9 grades) at all schools and other classes as well through exposure to connect teaching with practical life experiences, and to also encourage students to enroll in the vocational stream. Obstacles posed by the Israeli occupation, and their impact on realizing strategic goals (basic and other education sectors) 1. Israeli occupation practices make it difficult to provide regular health services to schools in marginalized areas and or refer cases to specialized medical centers. These and other measures aggravate the situation and negatively affect students' achievement. 2. Israeli occupation deprives students' safe access to schools. Moreover, other violent practices (detention, injury) impact their cognitive and physical health. Their academic achievements were also affected, as a result. 3. Imposing restrictions on the textbooks related to promoting students' national identity. 4. Obstructing use of Palestinian textbooks in Jerusalem. 5. Lack of land for building schools and education facilities in Jerusalem. 6. Israeli procedures for granting licenses/building permits and banning access to Jerusalem. 7. Prohibiting construction of roads in Jerusalem and its districts.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202279 8. Poor education environment and resources in Jerusalem and \"Area C\" schools. While at the same time, the Israeli occupation prevents the Ministry from developing these schools. 3. Secondary Education: The main reforms and interventions mentioned under Basic education (in particular curriculum, supervision and school restructuring) also relate to Secondary Education. The ministry aims to resume its efforts for a comprehensive Tawjihi (General Secondary Matriculation Examination) reform as part of the wider curriculum and assessment reform. Also, designing more effective policies to address the relatively high drop-out of boys is a key challenge. One of the key targets of the Education Sector Strategy 2017-2022 is that curriculum, assessment, teacher qualification, and supervision system must be fully compatible and integrated with each other . 1. Secondary Education Indicators according to the 2013-2015 Targets Key indicator 1: Ensuring safe and equitable enrollment in education for all, including PWDs (achieving international enrollment records): - The Adjust Net Enrollment Rate (NERA) of students in secondary schools reached (67.97%) noting that the net rate of male students enrolled at this stage declined from (79.9%) in 2009\\2010 to (72.0%) in 2013\\2014; while that of female students, during the same period, declined from (88.1%) to (68.2%). The rate of male students at this stage reached (59.3%) compared with (77.4%) for female students. The Net enrolment rate (NER) -- the number of students in the Secondary education phase (grades 11-12) who are at the official age of enrollment into that phase (16-17 years) expressed as a percentage of the total population who are at the official age of enrollment into that phase (16-17 years) - was during (2013-2015) at (63.9%).

The gross enrolment rate rose from (71.06%) in 2004-2005 to (73.5%) in 2012-2013. The rate of females enrolled in secondary education is more than that of males. It is noted that the gross rate of enrolment in secondary education was declining from 2008 until 2013. The rate of students who transitioned from the basic stage to the secondary stage reached (88.83%). The clear vision and philosophy of the ministry's plan, adequate human and financial resources and adequate infrastructure of schools and facilities (playgrounds, libraries, and internet) contributed to that rate. While the rate of dropout from secondary education was (3.57%) for the same period. It declined from (3.7%) to (1.96%) in 2015.

The percentage of students enrolled in the literary stream is (76%), compared with (21%) in the scientific stream and (3%) in the vocational stream. This adversely reflects itself on students' distribution in higher education institutions in terms of majors and labor market needs. It increases the gap between majors in humanities and sciences on one hand and the need for skilled technicians and professionals, on the other. 3. General Secondary Examination Injaz, formally called (Tawjihi): It is the connecting link between school and university education stages. Its results are considered the only criterion for admission to local and regional universities. The Injaz examination is subject to a host of technical standards and bases in its preparation. However, there is a real problem with the essence of this this examination and its ability to measure students' knowledge and skills rather than their ability to recall information found in textbooks and retrieving it as is. The rate of students whose scores are (50-60%), at the Injaz examination, constitute a burden on the Palestinian society and its effort to develop. The rates of pass and failure took, during the last 10 years, a single trend that is easy to predict for the next years. The percentage of pass in the scientific stream was (75-85%) and (50-65%) in humanities, where the later constitutes the higher percentage of students taking the exam (75%). 4. Increasing the rate of qualified teachers in line with Teacher Qualification Strategy, as required, is a real challenge due to inadequate financing. Also, weak implementation of the policy of separating schools according to stages and the absence of a clear vision for educational rehabilitation, all make it necessary to include schools' separation policy into the plan and implement the concept of inclusive school. 5. Ensuring protection for the students and teachers of schools in area (C) and Jerusalem in cooperation with international human rights organizations. These schools have continued to have shortcomings due to: inadequate financing; weak implementation of the policy of EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 -2022 84 Employing education technologies: The percentage of classes in which educational technologies are employed rose from (21%) in 2014 to (22.2%) in 2015.

Thus, it is necessary to include schools' separation policy into the plan; implement the concept of inclusive school; promote cooperation with the local community to provide land for school construction; and, develop secondary stage Teacher Qualification Strategy in cooperation with universities. Suggested Solutions to overcome the above-mentioned obstacles: 1. Inclusion of students with disabilities to achieve equal education. 2. Implementing school separation policy taking into account students' special situations and achieving an inclusive and in-depth education. 3. Activating technical and vocational education by keeping pace with knowledge and technology developments; reducing unemployment and responding to local, regional and international labor market demands. 4. Owning and developing leased buildings to ensure appropriate and safe school environment. 5. Increasing the rate of enrollment in schools by providing safe and healthy schooling environment. 6. Developing the education system (infrastructure that provides services for all majors); approving education acceleration system; issuing instructions and laws and building society partnerships. 7. Implementing interdepartmental activities; improving communication skills among ministries and identifying their roles integrally. 4. Public Education Sector \\ Vocational Education Activating the proposed governance structure for the TVET sector in the form of a Higher Council for V ocational Training will address a long overdue management and coordination gap. Moreover, mainstreaming the new apprenticeship program across all vocational schools will significantly improve the relevance and attract more students to the vocational stream. Also, having a National Qualification Framework (NQF) and the Palestinian Occupational Classification (POC) constitutes a major milestone in capturing previously unrecognized qualifications offering much needed recognition and job opportunities for a large number of professionals. In addition, increasing the number of vocational schools will serve to attract and increase the number of women students in vocational education.

Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202291 Vocational and Technical Education Key Challenges: 1. Dispersion of the vocational and training education system management among several ministries. 2. Waste of time, efforts, and funds; and absence of contributions by representatives from the private sector and civil society including NGOs in the management of this sector. 3. Poor quality TVET programs; high rate of unemployment among graduates and incongruence between this sector's outputs and labor market demands. 4. Conflicting and selective donors' policies. 5. Low rate of enrollment in TVET schools. 6. Community adverse attitude towards TVET. 7. Limited TVET's majors. 8. Poor infrastructure (curricula, staff, equipment, systems and buildings). 9. Developing and reforming supervision and monitoring system in vocational schools. 10. Promoting and monitoring educational, health, psychological and vocational aspects which motivate vocational stream students, teachers and supporting staff. 11. Assessing and analyzing the current curricula to measure to what extent they achieve desirable education goals. 12. Developing the current curriculum in accordance with labor market needs and modern technologies by the end of 2017, since the methodology of its development lacks clarity. 13. Developing the national qualification framework for the vocational education system (NQF) and the national classification of occupations system in accordance with Arab and international classification systems. It is still pending approval by the Council of Ministers. Suggested solutions to overcome the above said obstacles and improve the TVET sector: 1. Increasing the rate of enrollment in schools by ensuring a safe and healthy environment for teaching and learning. 2. Facilitating vocational stream students' enrollment in universities by providing more vocational majors. 3. Increasing vocational and technical programs in colleges. 4. Increasing vocational education graduates' share of employment in the ministry and its institutions. 5. Allocating government budget for TVET institutions, same as universities. 6. Establishing a specialized TVET library to be used as a reference for teachers and lecturers. 7. Adopting the national qualification framework. 8. Communicating with the Arab Federation for Technical Education to return Palestine to its status within the Arab world.Ministry of Education and Higher Education92 9. Increasing public awareness about the importance of TVET to reduce rates of unemployment among the youth. 10. Integrating TVET into Basic education to expose students to labor market needs. 11. Encouraging women to joining TVET programs and introducing gender-sensitive vocational majors in addition to creating new vocational schools. Obstacles posed by Israeli occupation and their impact on achieving strategic goals: 1. Israeli occupation checkpoints impede students' access to vocational schools, especially in remote areas. These and other Israeli measures affect the rate of enrollment in TVET, especially for girls. 2. Israeli occupation authorities deny Palestinians permits to build vocational schools in marginalized areas, especially in \"Area C\". 3. Inability to communicate with vocational schools in the Gaza Strip due to the Israeli closure and control over entry points. 4. Inability to build vocational schools in Jerusalem due to Israeli occupation authorities refusal to issue building permits for these schools. 5. Non-Formal Education: Adult education in Palestine includes all students above 15 years of age. while parallel education allows students between 14 to 40 years of age to enroll in afternoon classes for two years and hence giving them the opportunity to receive a 9th Grade certificate. It is worthy to note that the Ministry of Education and Higher Education provides limited supervision on the non-formal education sector as it depends on close coordination with five other ministries and agencies. However, the Ministry did develop an Education Strategy specifically for non-formal education with clear concepts, categories, and interventions that aims at organizing the sector. Non-Formal Education Key indicators according to the (2013-2015) targets: Key Indicator 1: Ensure safe and equitable access to education for all, including students with disabilities (achieving international enrolment record): During 2013-2014, number of learners in literacy centers was recorded at (1533), including (787) (51.34%) males and (746) (48.66%) females. Data indicate an increase in the number of students within literacy and parallel education programs in the northern governorates from (1321) to (1487)/ while a decrease occurred in the southern governorates from (911) to (740). The number of students within the Non-Formal Education Program (literacy, parallel) was at (2232) in 2014 and the number of learners in the parallel education centers was (277). The percentage of students in the parallel program who became literate in the northern governorates during the same year was (25.4%). In 2015, this percentage rose to (26.2%). Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-202293 The number of literacy and adult education centers rose from (79) in 2011\\2012 to (90) in 2013\\2014. This increase reflects the wish to reduce illiteracy rates. The number of parallel education centers rose from (11) in 2011\\2012 to (23) in 2013\\2014, reflecting a significant interest in transitioning this category to basic formal education (6th grade). Key Indicator 2: Improving safe, motivating, equitable and student-centered teaching and learning environment that responds to community and development needs. The rate of literacy among adults in Palestine (15 year olds and over) rose from (96.3%) in 2014 to (96.4%) in 2015. The rate of literacy is defined as the number of adult population (15 year olds and over) who have fluency in reading and writing, expressed as percentage of the population group corresponding to the same age category. In this regard, the bigger share was for the males with (98.4% males and 94.4% females). It is noteworthy that Palestine has achieved or has come close to achieving the 4th goal of Dakar Framework for improving levels of adult literacy which is set at (95%). The rate of classes in which educational tools used in Non-Formal Education reached during the same year (34%). EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 -2022 91 5.

Whereas the percentage of individuals who did not finish any educational stage reached (9.4%) in favor of males (7.1% males and (11.9% females). The rate of achievement in implementing the adult education strategy reached (71%) in 2015. It is planned to achieve (14.3%) for the current year. The result was (0.0%) in 2014 compared with (7.1%) as a set target. Non-Formal education sector development policies: Success and sustainability factors Reducing the rate of illiteracy among adults 15 years and older from (4.7%) to (2%) as well as increasing the rate of students in parallel education from (260) to (860) contributed to the success of this policy. This achievement was attributed to: increasing the number of centers in the different directorates; women's desire outweighing males'; media and promotional campaigns for enrollment conducted by these centers; female dropouts from these centers being less than that of males; high rate of enrollment in Basic education, and decrease in dropout from the basic stage down to (0.9%). In order to sustain these changes, it is necessary to continue the implementation of the previous policies, start implementing the Arab Agreement to Eliminate Illiteracy through the project \"Province without Illiteracy\". And to also increase media campaigns, enforce the Compulsory Education Law, and complete integration between the literacy and parallel education programs. Implementation of the national adult education plan in coordination with stakeholders. Important factors contributing to the plan included: political will of the Ministry's officials; dedication of the ministry's staff responsible for this sector; and the existence of a strategic partner who is committed to developing this sector (DVV International). To sustain the stamina of continuing to implement this strategy, it is necessary to have new partners that believe in and can support the adult and non-formal education sector. Increasing the percentage of qualified, men and women, teachers and supervisors in literacy and parallel education programs according to standards of the teacher training strategy from (0%) to (100%) by 2019. This targets achievement thus far was due to: assessment of teachers' needs, defining adult education standards, students' will and desire to develop themselves, and the existence of training financial support. To press ahead with that, it is necessary to promote the competencies of adults' teachers, keeping in line with international and regional attitudes towards adult education, and providing adults' teachers with the necessary skills and competencies to facilitate the teaching learning process.

Achieving this target requires: political will to develop the curricula, specialized staffs (curricula center), changing unsuitable previous curricula, financial support from Arab institutions and organizations, and benefitting from other Arab countries' experiences in this regard. It is therefore necessary to continue reviewing and assessing the new curricula to respond to students' needs. Non-formal Education Challenges: Delay in implementing the national adult education programs' strategy was due to several reasons: limited financial resources; structure of the section being not helpful for implementing adult education programs at the national level; shortage of monitoring and supervising cadres; and lack of cooperation and seriousness on the part of local partners. Suggested solutions to overcome the above said challenges and improve non-formal education. 1. Creating effective partnerships between the ministry and other relevant organizations. 2. Concentrating on the role of media in promoting adult education programs and raising awareness about the importance of education. 3. Highlighting success stories to students and other participants in the program. 4. Introducing new programs integral to existing programs to meet targeted group's needs. 5. Integrating vocational education into non-formal education to raise public awareness about vocational education and its role in achieving development, reducing unemployment and poverty rates. 6. Establishing a specific high national commission for adult education. 7. Setting awareness raising programs to educate mothers and families about different subjects (spending rationalizing, child friendly family, household safety). 8. Modifying and strengthening structure of the non-formal education section; establishing a high national commission for adult education. 6. Governance & Management: A high-priority reform track of the strategy is a comprehensive ministry management reform to reflect the newly adopted direct service delivery programs and the new roles of program managers. This major reform is aimed at shifting the ministry into results-based and accountability management and providing space for higher degrees of decentralization and community participation. These comprehensive management reform will be accompanied by an intensive on-the job training and capacity building programs for the new functions and operations. The ministry will exert its efforts to develop the official Education Law and secure its approval this year prior to starting implementation of this strategy (2017-2022).

The same results were achieved in 2015. These low rates can be attributed to the fact that th e studies conducted in the past didn't take into account Palestinian laws that govern organizational structures of the Palestinian institutions. This situation led to establishing a specific committee to review the laws and present a draft structure in accordance with the plan and relevant laws. In addition to the committee's review, the government of Palestine began preparing the national development plan for 2017 -2022 and sectoral plans, including the general education plan 2017 -2022. It was necessary to act slowly but surely towards accomplishing the structure and identify the impact of the new sectoral plan on programs' policies, goals and status (omission, addition, and integration). The degree of the ministry and directorates' employees' satisfac tion with the physical environment at work (space per employee, lighting, equipment, cleanliness, etc.) was (62.7%).

The level of technology use in administrative work is 62.8%. This rate is low due to many reasons, most prominent of which is the absence of policies which promote the role of technology in official correspondences, and the level of technology competencies of many employees.

To keep this development process going, it is necessary to set forth training needs-based vision, form a committee to manage training and recruit expert graduates, continue using the participatory approach, make partnerships with different ministries to make training activities integral, promote objective coordination between general directorates, programs officers and policies committee; develop staff's capacities in scientific research that aims to improves performance. The number of administrators and technicians who received specialized training in their field saw an annual increase of (520) individuals by the end of 2016. The achievement of this target is due to: adequate financing, existence of active international partners who provide advice and material support for training, existence of training staff, existence of needs-based training strategy and existence of training facilities. Furthermore, there is a need to increase the number of qualified staff. Therefore, it is necessary to continue training administrators, technicians and support staff; search for additional financing resources; keep building capacities and M&E to preserve work quality; ensure compatibility of training to work needs; employ technologies in training through learning community centers, and continue to conduct the ongoing assessment of training programs. National and modern law of education in Palestine was finalized in line with international approaches in this regard. This was made possible by the existence of supportive policies and effective national partnerships. Implementation of this law shall be monitored and evaluated to address any relevant gaps, if found. Reviewing and revising any regulations or instructions to be in line with the new law, as well as compatible with related programs implemented in relevant ministries and agencies to ensure equality and equity of opportunities. Promoting and employing M&E within the ministry, district directorates, and schools. Also, to be applied on local and international partners by adopting a M&E system to standardize programs achievements and amend interventions to achieve the goals. Enhancing relations and improving coordination and cooperation mechanisms between the ministry and the UNRWA as well as other partner organizations. It is also of high importance to develop memorandum of understanding agreements with national and international organizations. Promoting exchange of information about success stories between the ministry and its partners; where conferences were held and successful experiences were highlighted and such stories were disseminated at the national and regional levels. To strengthen this track, it is necessary to ensure financial support, motivate the people who have initiatives and successful experiences and publicize success stories and experiences through mass media and brochures. Establishing energy-saving and sustainable school buildings. These schools shall be expanded by developing the manual on green buildings as well as coordinating with relevant organizations, and increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022101 Providing quality and inclusive education for all as well as opening resource rooms for students with disabilities. This target was achieved due to: studies emphasizing the importance of having resource rooms in each school; local community support for providing resource rooms for students with disabilities; pressure by the local community to ensure specialized avenues to follow up on their children, as well as to ensure the existence of adequate support by the ministry to operate resource rooms. Therefore, in order to open more resource rooms, the ministry must do the following: introduce that into school buildings specifications and structures within its approved policies; develop qualified education staff to operate these resource rooms; as well as to ensure that the necessary equipment and furniture for this purpose are included on the directorate's general supplies lists. Education Sector Governance and Management Most Prominent Challenges: 1. Linking information systems through a single electronic network. 2. Multiple databases for each general directorate, separated from other databases. 3. Management focus is on inputs and processes with no focus on outputs. 4. Overlapping of responsibilities between general directorates and the ministry. 5. Having no decisive decision concerning the relationship between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education - sometimes the two are separated, sometimes integrated. 6. Centralization of education management. 7. Overlapping of responsibilities among ministries with no clear coordination mechanisms. 8. Unclear and weak monitoring mechanisms. 9. Participation by NGOs and other civil society organizations is superficial. 10. The development budget is mostly from foreign aid. 11. The constant need for contingency plans to ensure the continuation of the educational process in case of aggression, especially in the Gaza Strip. Main obstacles to implementing the policies and goals of developing the education sector in the field of governance and management: 1. Developing and institutionalizing training programs and courses for administrative and technical staff due to the absence of linking these programs to any policies until today. General directorates are recommended to partake in the institutionalization of the training courses, to better serve the needs of the employees regardless of their job titles and their tasks as stated in their job descriptions. 2. Increasing the number of male and female administrative employees who meet job requirements, due to the internal political division and its consequences on job integration, in addition to lacking opportunities to execute similar programs in Gaza due to the absence of the ministry's role there, a clear strategy must be put forth in place for cooperation and coordination with the Gaza Strip to be able to execute similar training in with the West Ministry of Education and Higher Education102 Bank. The strategy should also aim to unify the two halves of the homeland, as well as to enforce a declared incentive and promotion system for those employees who engage in training and show excellence at work. 3. Modifying the organizational structure and job descriptions at the ministry and affiliated departments to be in line with the goals of the strategic plan and programs and in accordance with the service offered, for the following reasons: delays in the structure's modification; inclusion of fields that are subject to preconditions by donors on the operational budget/Ministry of Finance; lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities. Therefore, it is recommended that the organizational structure and job descriptions of employees working with the ministry and the affiliated departments be endorsed to meet and fulfill the plan's goals. The organizational structure also needs to be updated in line with the strategic plan. Furthermore, the plan should include an update of the Ministry's structure in line with the strategic plan and to include the new jobs; update the structure of the Directorate of Education; and to register and re-organize the divisions of the directorates that work seasonally. For example, some divisions may be merged or integrated at directorates within the geographic proximity. Moreover, a ministerial committee can also be formed to examine the structure of the Directorate of Education, and to consider the necessary amendments needed to enhance capacities and boost accountability. Finally, plans for awareness raising must be approved and carried out so as to reinforce decentralization at the directorates. 4. Developing administrative, financial, and technical manuals and procedures, as well as follow-up mechanisms and monitoring techniques at all levels as part of decentralization. This can be avoided by implementing decentralization in administrative work at all levels, by training individuals to take responsibility hence implementing decentralization. In addition, approval of an accountability system, and designating an internal audit system to monitor implementation of applying rules and regulations governing work at the Ministry, directorates, and schools can also serve in the process of decentralization. 5. Reinforcing and optimizing use of technical and financial capacities available in the work environment. This has not been sufficiently included in the ministry's budget, due to lack of sufficient finances for construction of offices at the Directorates of Education (currently rented buildings). The previous point would help overcome this obstacle. 6. Completion of computerization of the administrative and financial systems and integrating them to be in line with the e-government trends. Up until this date, these systems have not been integrated. Development and computerization of the administrative systems have also not been integrated. In addition, there is still a delay in solving outstanding issues with companies. Therefore, there is a need to integrate the computerized systems at the ministry in order to improve work at the level of the ministry, directorates and schools; as well as to boost authorization of taking decisions at the competent and specialized departments. 7. Reinforcing and activating the use of the educational information systems at all levels remains weak. This is caused by failing to adopt intellectual property protection laws and protection rights acts relating to other information; absence of any clear decentralization policies; no proper use of evaluation reports results; and the absence of a clear methodology to deal and make use of decentralization. This can be overcome through the development and activation of frameworks on policy and decision making, follow up, and accountability at all levels. Such frameworks will strengthen delegation of authority to districts' offices.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022103 8. Lack of harmony between the government systems and procedures in terms of management of individuals, finances, as well as at the planning level. This is attributed to lack of utilization of the results of the evaluation reports on management of individuals. It is also attributed to the absence of a clear methodology to deal and make use of these reports. Therefore, there is a need to boost human resources development and improve its management efficiency in the civil service sector based on a needs-assessment study and results of the performance evaluation reports. 9. Delegating authorities to the local directorates (districts' offices and schools) to achieve the plan's goals in an efficient manner, especially since this obstacle has been at a standstill for a long time due to the absence of a clear policy to regulate delegation of powers at all levels; restricting the powers of school principals in implementing numerous administrative affairs at their schools; intervention by general directorates into the administrative affairs of the directorates of Education. Finally, the lack of investment in rich and accumulating technical expertise of teachers, principals, heads of departments at directorates of Education, and deputy directors of Education. All of the above can be overcome by: approving a control policy to authorize powers; establishing a system of accountability; restricting the tasks that can be implemented at the different administrative levels to broaden the powers and responsibilities; redefining the role of the Directorate of Education at the technical and administrative levels; widening the powers of the Director of Education and his/her deputies with regard to this role, and holding them accountable for the quality of education and learning process. Moreover, it would be necessary to adopt a clear policy to fix the contract of and promote the Director of Education and his/her deputies; and by the Ministry of Education's formation of an active education leadership team to be directly involved in the development of the Directorate of Education. 10. Reinforcing accountability mechanisms in the educational system and enhancing transparency in all administrative, educational and financial areas. Systems of accountability and principles of transparency have been insufficient thus far due to: the absence of clear decentralization policies; poor utilization of evaluation reports' results; and the absence of a clear methodology to make use of these reports. To achieve progress in this area it is vital that centers of responsibility are identified; daily work and tasks should be organized to be in line with the ministry's vision. 11. Consolidating community participation at all levels, and all aspects of the educational process, since this too has remained below the required level of the educational process. It can be improved through the development of policy and decision making mechanisms, and frameworks at all levels while ensuring that these actions are in line with the strategic goals and programs, (service based) and schools (level based). There is also a need to activate the relationship with all educational actors in Palestine, as well as to activate partnerships with the concerned international and regional actors. 12. Reinforcing and activating the means of communication between the ministry and field on the one side, and with the local and international associates on the other side with regard to educational affairs. To go forward with this issue there is a need to communicate with local, regional and international associates in a manner which serves the ministry's policies. There should also be periodic meetings to follow up, assess and overcome the challenges, if any. 13. Documenting and exposing the policies of the Israeli occupation and its military procedures which violate the right for children to a free and secure education, especially in Jerusalem, Ministry of Education and Higher Education104 areas located behind the apartheid barrier, and in \"Area C\". To achieve this, more local and international aid for education is needed, especially in Jerusalem, and to ensure coordination that is in line with the goals of the strategic plan. Furthermore, there should be more media campaigns to expose the oppressive policies and procedures of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian education, such as denying children their right to education. There should also be more periodic meetings and conferences with the donors and human rights organizations to inform them about the violations against the students, schools, teachers and curricula, as well as to monitor and follow up on the indicators of the educational situation in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem. 14. Improving the financial environment necessary for the management of the education system at all levels and using it with high efficiency. This also includes improving the administrative infrastructure of the ministry and the directorates of Education or replacing the inadequate ones. To overcome this obstacle there must be clear policies to endorse decentralization at all levels. The ministry should also look for more financial sources to repair and maintain buildings. 15. Enhancing cooperation opportunities with the private sector and encouraging it to invest in education. This cooperation has been weak due to the absence of a clear policy to attract the private sector. Progress in this field has been limited, and is focused on the higher education sector; it does not target important sectors such as adult education and preschools. To overcome this obstacle there should be more periodic meetings and conferences with donors and supporters of the education sector ensuring to engage the private sector which will encourage it to invest in education. 16. Lack of finance to strengthen and expand the participatory scope in support of the education sector (SWAP) at the financial and coordination levels in line with the goals of the strategic plan. Periodic meetings with supporters of education may be held to ensure the necessary financial support for the education sector; in line with the goals of the strategic plan. 17. Increasing local and international aid for the education system especially in Jerusalem, and coordinating this support to serve the goals of the strategic plan. Aid to education has been obstructed by the Israeli occupation's restrictions on aid, which prevents projects that serve educational infrastructure development. Therefore, more efforts should be exerted to support education in Jerusalem, in line with the goals of the strategic plan. 18. Encouraging the local community to emphasize more on service-oriented programs and to organize school on a per-level basis. To improve this indicator schools may be organized on a per-level basis, and to make available government-subsidized transport means to ensure students' access to schools. 19. Develop and approve laws and systems that encourage decentralization and authorization of powers at times of emergency. This can be upheld by endorsing laws and systems that encourage decentralization; designation of clear strategies based on policies approved for authorization of powers at times of emergency to ensure smooth work-flow and ensure safety of the students and teachers. 20. Bolstering the educational institutions at the three levels (the ministry, directorates, and schools) at times of emergency, as it is vital to be able to manage crises at times of emergency for survival. Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022105 Suggestions to improve implementation of development policies, and goals of education in the governance and management sector: 1. Linking training programs to advancement and promotions in career paths. This will prepare staff with the necessary competencies according to the required tasks. 2. Introduction of specialized leadership programs for the different job categories at the medium and high management levels, aiming to reinforce capacity building so as to include all categories. 3. Integration of the ministry's computerized systems to enhance the credibility of data hence redressing the current imbalance. 4. E-government (increasing e-ministry efforts) to achieve integration at the national level, 5. Linking the private sector's commitment with a government-certified national strategy, 1. as part of the social responsibility. This will boost the private sector to assume its responsibilities. 6. Adoption of the teaching profession practice license, and implementing provisions of the teacher's preparation and qualification strategy. 7. Adoption of clear mechanisms to enhance decentralization, and reviewing job descriptions. 8. Taking care of, and reinforcing the work environment and construction of new buildings; 9. Finding a way to integrate the ministry with its higher education institutions in the fields of professional development and teachers' training, with a view to bolster integration between the general education sector and higher education. 10. Nationalizing training and capacity building to succeed in rationalizing spending, and to give local experts the chance to contribute to capacity building. 11. Improving women's participation in decision making by creating mechanisms that provide women equal opportunities as men; approval of women's leadership programs; and removal of all hurdles that are obstructing women's full participation in social development. 12. Providing electronic services (student's electronic registration in the basic grades in conjunction and partnership with the Interior Ministry). 13. Completion of electronic services with the other ministries to save efforts and time. 14. Bolstering and intensifying media campaigns to share successful experiences. 15. Producing informational materials that expose the Israeli occupation's oppressive policies and arbitrary measures against Palestinian children and education. 16. Training media professionals on an ongoing basis to disseminate and publicize the ministry's orientations to serve the educational process. 17. Promoting vocational training and education through media means in order to inform families of the importance of vocational education in enabling students to have a better chance to succeed in the future, as well as to actively participate in national growth and state building.Ministry of Education and Higher Education106 18. Building a computerized system for the General Directorate of Buildings in line with the e-government efforts in order to organize and integrate work and facilitate access to information, as well as to keep pace with the advancement of technology. 19. Designing a strategic training plan for new and renewed subjects in the fields of engineering, building systems, and renewed energy, for the General Directorate of Buildings' staff at the ministry and its directorates. This aims to guarantee fair distribution and proper scientific steering of the training as per the work's priorities and needs. 20. Enhancing management of public funds and financial sustainability by constructing sustainable administrative buildings that rely on renewable energy, in addition to developing the current system of identifying the needs and priorities of school buildings. 21. Adopting a policy which stresses the right of students with special needs to education by creating an inclusive and equal environment for these students (both males and females). This aims to (1) achieve the principle of equality and justice to all students; (2) increase the percentage of access of students with disability to education (so far below 33% according to the same source); (3) reduce illiteracy rate in the Gaza Strip (estimated at 53% according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics of 2011); and opening new majors in the field of special education for students at universities. Obstacle caused by the Israeli occupation and their impact on achieving the strategic goals: - Communication with Gaza: despite the internal Palestinian division, the Israeli occupation represents another obstacle. - Education in Jerusalem: education in Jerusalem is affected by the Israeli attempts to change it to theirs (Israelization); it is also effected by the MoEHE's inability to restore/ repair the current buildings or build new ones. - Communication with Arab neighbors: communications are restricted due to Israel's control of all borders and crossings, which obstructs the creation of partnerships. - Legal support and preventing violations: this is represented in Israel's refusal to allow human rights organizations to assume their role. - Defining nature of support by donor countries: Israel is the one who determines the nature of foreign aid as well as controls entry of any equipment and devices necessary for development. - Restrictions on movement: engineering teams endure difficulties when attempting to supervise/inspect school buildings across the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem. - Difficulty in obtaining permits: obtaining permits to construct or expand school buildings is made difficult by the Israelis in general, and in \"Area C\" in particular, which badly affects the planning process. - Difficulty in obtaining funding: there are difficulties in obtaining funds for activities included in the Ministry of Finance's budget plan for Jerusalem, as well as the Old City and Southern Neighborhood of Hebron. This difficulty badly affects the planning process.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022107 7. Higher Education Adapting higher education to its mission, development needs, and unemployment among graduates Implemented policies that helped to achieve development and growth in higher education: success factors and means of sustainability 1. Developing the bases for certifying higher education institutions and programs has been upheld due to the existence of the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Commission, in addition to the completion of a sponsored project to cover the expenses of appointing experts in the field. To support progress in this field, it is important to appoint a specialized team; adopt a new organizational structure for the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Commission; and finally ensure sufficient aid for follow up and evaluation of all higher education programs. 2. Ensuring constant and sustainable financial support for the higher education sector, represented by (1) decision of the Council of Ministers to support this sector; (2) approval of the Al-Quds Fund and Endowment to support this sector; and (3) allocating an annual amount from the public budget to support this fund. 3. Integrating government colleges with the Palestine Technical College as a step towards institutionalizing work. 4. Expanding the absorptive capacity of the Public University and the Public Technical University where the following has been achieved: government financing has been made available. The university enjoys a management with a sharp vision for the developmental needs of the university. Absorptive capacity has also improved due to the students' high demand on the university, and the reasonable fees charged for credit hours. To continue upholding the absorptive capacity, more government financing is needed, administrative, financial and academic laws and regulations should be upgraded, and more programs should be offered at the university. 5. E-learning and remote communication should be improved by nurturing a national trend that encourages all institutions to use technology in education, and in developing administrative systems. Therefore, the necessary equipment and technologies should be made available to all higher education institutions. 6. Upholding scientific research: this includes the creation of a council for scientific research, allocation of a budget for scientific research and development, establishment of councils and centers of excellence and research, offering incentives to creative and excellent individuals, and supporting the issuance of scientific journals. To enhance scientific research, research centers should be available with the necessary and qualified financial and human resources, in addition to a fund to finance scientific research. Key challenges facing the higher education sector: 1. The legislative and administrative status and good governance practices: there is poor commitment to the principles of good governance at higher education institutions and university management. Organizational structures and legislations are also not keeping pace with higher education needs and requirements.Ministry of Education and Higher Education108 2. Adapting higher education with its societal mission, development needs, and the issue of unemployment among graduates: this is due to the differences in higher education inputs, clear inclination towards humanities, increase in the numbers of students enrolled in open learning programs, and their limited integration into the labor market, and finally lack of compatibility between adequate development skills and competencies that a graduate should have. 3. Upgrading scientific research: there is a clear lack of interest in scientific research, failure to achieve the mission of higher education institutions in the field of scientific research, limited share of allocated funds for scientific research in public and university budgets, and failure to see the link between scientific research and social development needs. 4. Funding higher education: Higher education funding is described as limited. Also, financial resources allocated to education are inadequate whether it is for operational purposes and/or for development of higher education and scientific research. 5. Quantity and quality assurance: these issues have not been up to what is required due to the failure of achieving quality standards acceptable in higher education. Also, due to the inadequacy of higher education faculty members; and insufficient use of adequate and modern teaching methods. 6. Promoting technical education: promoting this sector has remained insufficient due to the low enrollment of students in this field, low societal valuation of vocational and technical education, and limited technical and vocational specializations that are in line with the needs of the labor market. 7. Improving cultural relations with other nations: improving this type of relations with other countries is limited due to the overlapping of goal-achievement tasks of two general administrations, lack of sufficient funding to achieve the goal, and lack of vision to embark on achieving the goal. To overcome this obstacle, more cooperation should take place with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to open more horizons to the concerned departments and promote liaison with the educational institutions. 8. Failure to link outputs of higher education and needs of the labor market: as a result of (a) the growing number of successful high school graduates who enroll in academic programs at universities, (b) financial deficit of universities which force them to admit students in majors that are not needed in the labor market, (c) the existence of the parallel education, (d) and community's low appreciation for technical and vocational education. To mitigate effects of this issue, it is essential to carry out the following: (1) more needs- assessment studies and surveys should be conducted concerning labor market needs; (2) students' awareness on technical and vocational specializations should be upheld; (3) integrating some vocational courses with the undergraduate courses as elective and free elective courses in some programs at universities. 9. Delays in achievement at service departments : this was due to the absence of the necessary technical equipment and programs, in addition to shortage in the number of support staff at service departments, and the universities refusal to link their data with the Ministry. To solve this issue, the databases of higher education institutions should be linked with the Ministry's hence information relating to certification and authentication of certificates, and for credibility inquiry if and when needed. Furthermore, a binding decision should be taken for all higher education institutions to link their data with the Ministry.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022109 Suggestions to improve and develop, and activate the higher education sector: 1. Improving the administrative systems at higher education institutions: by developing these systems the ministry will be able to efficiently plan and execute its plans that mirror the ministry's vision and strategy. This will also ensure a monitoring and evaluation system as well as an accountability system. Moreover, it will increase transparency in spending, recruitment, and in current and development expenditures. 2. Setting fiscal policies that seek to achieve sustainability: having fiscal policies concerning current and development spending as well as financing will support the achievement of goals and create an education friendly environment. 3. Strengthening interaction between higher education institutions and the private sector , aiming to uphold practicum through training. This will also give students the necessary skills to engage in the labor market. 4. Development and reinforcement of staff at higher education institutions: improving the necessary competencies of staff to plan, instruct, and evaluate students gives an educational dimension and enhances relations between the teaching staff and students. Furthermore, providing the necessary educational technologies also helps improve performance of the teaching staff. 5. Higher Education Law: upholding efforts to approve a modernized law for higher education. 6. Proposing specific and clear executive regulations and systems in areas of accreditation and certification equivalence, authentication of certificates, as well as approval of programs, grants and scholarships. 7. Recruitment and training of staff capable of preparing strategic sectoral plans, due to the lack of the qualified staff in this field. 8. Providing institutions with the necessary legal protection, given the external interventions into the work of higher education institutions and their execution of their programs and plans. 9. Providing financial and administrative support to the higher education institutions, especially during off days (students and personnel strikes).Ministry of Education and Higher Education110 New Priorities of the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022 Goal 1: ensuring safe, inclusive and equitable access to equal education at all levels of the system. Priorities of the Strategic Goal 1: The priorities of the first goal can be classified in three areas: a. Improving enrollment in education at all educational levels and maintaining good enrollment rates: 1. Maintaining a high percentage of enrollment at the lower basic school (grades 1-4) for all. This can be achieved through cooperation between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the Ministry of Social Development, and the security services to make education compulsory. 2. Increasing enrollment at pre-school education (kindergartens). This can be achieved through cooperation between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the private sector (which owns the majority of kindergartens) and international institutions, especially UNICEF and UNESCO. 3. Maintaining a balance of enrollment in the secondary education tracks (vocational track, scientific track, and humanities track) by increasing enrollment in the vocational education track, so that it constitutes the largest proportion of the educational tracks followed by the scientific track and then the humanities track, and not vice versa. 4. Providing sufficient number of school buildings to absorb the increasing number of students by 2030 through cooperation between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the local community, municipalities, and donors of the education sector; upholding private sector investment in education; and increasing the number of UNRWA schools. 5. Follow up on students who drop out of school at all education levels especially after Grade 8, in order to increase the level of enrollment in secondary education. This is possible through the cooperation of the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Waqf, local community institutions, civil society institutions, the media and the security services, and others to make education compulsory up to the tenth grade. 6. Raising the gross enrollment ratio for higher education from 50% to 55%. This can be achieved through cooperation with community institutions to increase scholarships for students, and with international and Arab Funds and institutions to provide scholarships to students. There is also a need for investment in the labor market to encourage students and provide them with scholarships in areas and majors needed in the local market, as well as other jobs elsewhere. 7. Increasing the absorptive capacity of the Public Technical University. b. Providing protection and safe access to education at all stages and to all premises: 8. Creating stronger ties with the international community, including UN institutions, international human rights institutions and diplomatic representatives' offices, to guarantee and protect educational rights of Palestinian students in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022111 c. Equity and justice 9. Increasing enrollment in technical and vocational education training, especially for female students. This increase has to be adapted to plans based on requirements of the labor market, and carried out in cooperation with the owners of private institutions and factories to provide and encourage access to majors that the labor market needs. The Ministry should cooperate with local and international institutions, the Ministry of Labor and other partners in this regard. Furthermore, there is a need for providing suitable specializations. 10. Designing and executing integrated, easy to use, and all-inclusive programs, services and infrastructure for early childhood. These programs include fields such as health, nutrition, protection, and educational needs, especially for children with disability. This may be achieved in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, international institutions, especially the UNICEF and the UNESCO, the private sector, and civil society institutions concerned with early childhood. 11. Providing the appropriate environment at school and educational facilities, and furnishing the necessary equipment for students with special needs to enroll at all levels of education, and in cooperation with local and international partners. 12. Reinforcing technical and vocational training and education, university and other higher education, as well as adult education and training, with special attention to gender equality. This necessitates the need to remove gender-based barriers and barriers affecting vulnerable categories (i.e. persons with disability). 13. Supporting higher education institutions, including universities, by encouraging and supporting policies to provide life-long and quality education opportunities on an equitable basis. 14. Identifying, monitoring and improving women's access to quality education. In addition, encouraging their participation in the education sector, their achievement, and their level of completion is equally important. There is also a need to take measures that focus on males in case of a clear disparity in favor of the females. 15. Identifying obstacles obstructing children's and young adults' access to quality education programs. This can be done through the research and study centers of local institutions and the reports issued by the Ministry of Social Development and others, while taking the necessary measures to eliminate these obstacles. 16. Providing access to a wide range of learning and educational facilities and environments, as part of the formal, non-formal, and adult education frameworks. These frameworks include networks and places of the learning groups. To achieve this goal, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education will cooperate with international and local institutions concerned with adult education. 17. Offering all scholarships opportunities to the disadvantaged youth categories (both males and females). 18. Strength ening the capacities of the Lending Student Fund by increasing the amount allocated for that purpose through grants and loans from Arab, Islamic and international funds, local institutions, banks, etc.Ministry of Education and Higher Education112 Goal 2: developing student-centered teaching and learning pedagogy and environment. Priorities of the Strategic Goal 2: priorities of the second goal can be grouped under four categories: a. Developing programs, curricula and evaluation systems: 1. Improving the quality of education at preschools to integrate it with school education and facilitate child integration in this system. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education cooperates with international institutions, especially UNICEF, UNESCO and regional organizations concerned with this sector. 2. Considering curriculum reforms at all levels by identifying standards and reviewing curricula. This will assure the quality of these curricula and their feasibility for the Palestinian context, including skills relating to (21st century skills), competencies, values, culture, and knowledge. This is achieved through cooperation between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, universities, research institutions and civil society institutions concerned with education. 3. Developing a stronger and more comprehensive measurement and evaluation system to evaluate the learning outcomes in important areas of the educational track, including: during the primary Basic education level (grades 2 & 3), or at the end of the primary basic level (grade 4), the basic level (grade 9) and the secondary level (Tawjihi/Injaz). This should be implemented in a way that expresses cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The new system includes assessment of the basic skills for reading, writing, and numeracy, and assessment of the non-cognitive skills as well. It also designs evaluations for the training activities as an integral part of the teaching and learning process at all levels. These evaluations should be linked with the teaching methods. 4. Providing an environment conducive to education through educational facilities and playgrounds, promoting sports activity, encouraging reading, and participating in the free activity for all students. This is done in cooperation between the Ministry and donors to the education sector, the local community and some international institutions. 5. Offering alternative ways of teaching and learning for children and young adults who are not enrolled at school, whether in Basic education or secondary education alike. Methods of equivalence and linking of educational programs should also be developed to ensure flexible formal and non-formal education. 6. Evaluating the early childhood care and education programs and policies to uphold their quality. 7. Introducing policies and programs that offer suitable distance education at the higher education level with the necessary funding and technologies. This includes use of internet and open classes (direct connection available at a broad extent) and other methods, provided that these methods meet the accepted quality standards to best benefit from them. 8. Providing distance learning possibilities; offering training in information and communication technology; making use of the appropriate technology and the required infrastructure for home-based education, and education in conflict areas and/or remote areas. This requires Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022113 special attention for vulnerable girls, women, boys and young men and other marginalized groups. 9. Maintaining a high degree of quality of the literacy and numeracy programs in accordance with the national assessment techniques. These programs should also be designed based on the students' needs and their previous knowledge and experiences. The programs should also be linked and integrated with the necessary skill development so that students can achieve decent work and make a living, since these are elements of lifelong learning. 10. Encouraging use of information and communication technology, especially mobile phones, in literacy and numeracy programs. 11. Setting up a framework to assess reading, writing, and numeracy skills, while offering tools to evaluate the level of efficiency based on the learning outcomes. This requires identification of the intended efficiency in multiple contexts, including work and daily life skills. 12. Designating policies and programs to encourage education for sustainable development and education in the field of global citizenship. These policies should apply to formal and non- formal education through specific procedures; also, to offer training to teachers; reform the current curricula; and offer the necessary educational support. 13. Boosting the creation of stronger assessment systems as part of education for sustainable development and education for global citizenship. This will help evaluate the cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioral results of the learning process using the existing tools that have proven to be valid whenever possible, and identifying the needs requiring the creation of new tools. 14. Approving coherent, multifaceted and comprehensive policies tackling gender and cases of persons with special needs, as well as promoting standards and systems which ensure security and non-violence at schools. 15. Ensuring safety and availability of water, electricity, as well as toilets that are good to use for both women and men at every educational institution. Adequate and secure classrooms, and materials and technologies that are suitable for learning should all be available. This is done in collaboration between the Ministry, international institutions and donors to the education sector and local communities. 16. Approving active systems to collect feedback on implementation. This would reinforce good education practices and teacher professional development. 17. Reducing budget deficit of universities by 30%. 18. Approval of clear and specific quality assurance standards in certification of programs and institutions. 19. Reinforcing e-learning and distance learning. b. Training and qualifying human resources working in the educational system: 20. Implementing the Teacher Education Strategy for teachers and support staff in cooperation with the Ministry, the World Bank, the Amideast and the Palestinian universities.Ministry of Education and Higher Education114 21. Transforming the supervision system practices from inspection and guidance to empowerment of teachers. 22. Formulating clear policies, strategies, and work plans to enhance professional abilities of the staff of early childhood care and education. This can be achieved by boosting and monitoring the staff's professional development, their status and their work conditions. 23. Endorsing cross-sector joint policies (Basic education, vocational education, and higher education) to enhance and reinforce professional skills, vocational and technical training and education, and higher education; link between the different components; boost connections between knowledge and policy making processes, aiming to keep pace with the varying circumstances and uphold feasibility; and establish vigorous partnerships. 24. Guaranteeing quality assurance of higher education qualifications while maintaining the ability to equate and recognize them. This also aims to facilitate transfer of the attained levels between the recognized institutions of the Ministry of Higher Education. 25. Reviewing, analyzing and improving the quality of teacher training levels (prior to and during service). Also, ensuring good pre-service preparation and the potential of continuing professional development and support for all staff. 26. Equipping teachers with the appropriate technological skills to enable them to use information and communication technology and social media networks. Teachers should also be equipped with media know-how, critical thinking skills to deal with resources, and training to overcome the challenges facing students with special educational needs. 27. Reinforcing school leadership to boost education and learning. c. Adapting education, life and labor market needs 28. Improving the quality of technical and vocational education and higher education, and offering majors that are required in the labor market for both males and females. This comes through collaboration between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labor, industrial and private institutions, universities, technical colleges and international institutions. 29. Collecting and using evidence when a change of skills is recommended. This would guide the process of skill development; limit disparities; respond to the labor market changes and societal needs and circumstances; and finally respond to the needs of the \"non-formal economy\" and development. 30. Encouraging development of multiple forms of training and education at workplaces and classrooms (when possible) through cooperation between universities and private institutions. 31. Offering opportunities to both male and female students of all ages, and at different stages of their lives. This will help them acquire the knowledge, expertise, skills, values and stands necessary for creating peaceful, healthy and sustainable societies. 32. Opening new applied programs (15).Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022115 d. Developing capacities in the field of scientific research: 33. Endorsing policies and programs which enable research at the higher education and university education levels, by enrolling students in science, technology, engineering, and math at early stages (especially for girls and women). 34. Financing 30 to 50 research projects at universities, in cooperation between the Ministry and private and international institutions. 35. Activating the existing centers of excellence. 36. Implementing joint postgraduate programs with other universities. Goal 3: promoting accountability, result-based leadership, good governance and management.

Developing a modern law for higher education 2. Enactment of laws, policies and legislation that ensure: - 12 years of equitable, free, all-inclusive, public-funded and quality Basic education and secondary education. This includes 10 years of compulsory education for all children, leading to fruitful learning results. This comes through collaboration between the Ministry, UNRWA and the private sector. - At least one year of free, compulsory and good pre-basic education, with special attention to reaching children from the most disadvantaged and poor communities through early childhood education and care services. This comes through cooperation between Ministry, the private sector, local communities, municipalities and local councils, and local and international donors. 3. Approval of integrated multi-sectoral policies and strategies for early childhood care and education that is based on coordination among the ministries responsible for nutrition, health, social care, child protection, water/sanitation, justice and education. There is a need for allocating appropriate resources to implement these policies and strategies. 4. Upholding resilient education streams as part of the formal or non-formal education frameworks hence enabling students to combine and transfer the obtained degrees so as to get promoted to higher levels. Also, recognition, certification and authentication of past education and designation of appropriate programs to link between streams, and offering guidance and counseling services for career development are all important to sustain. 5. Educational sectoral policies, plans and budgets should uphold the principle of non- discrimination and equality in and throughout education. There is also a need for designing and executing urgent and goal-focused policies to support the vulnerable and marginalized groups, in addition to developing indicators to measure progress in achieving equality.Ministry of Education and Higher Education116 b. Developing the administrative and governing environment: 6. Reforming the ministry's central leadership and operational structure in line with the service delivery program of the strategic plan. 7. Institutionalizing the concept of result-based management at all levels in the Ministry. 8. Redistributing schools to be in line with level-based school type (grades 1-4, grades 5-9, and grades (10-12). 9. Upholding fair allocation (distribution) of resources among schools with good socio- economic status and schools suffering conditions of deprivation and or under an emergency situation. 10.

Introducing a system to collect, analyze and share appropriate available data concerning literacy levels and the reading, writing and numeracy needs. The system should also be able to classify data according to gender and any other marginalization indicators, in cooperation between the Ministry and PCBS, ensuring equitable allocation and distribution of resources among schools and educational centers with good socio-economic status and those that are deprived and disadvantaged. 18. Ensuring that the policies, programs and mechanisms of international scholarship programs are in line with the national developmental priorities and plans, with special attention to reinforcing human resources in areas where these resources are most needed.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022117 19. Enactment of gender-sensitive strategies to attract the best and most enthusiastic for teaching candidates, and placing these candidates to the positions where they are mostly needed. This requires a set of legislative and political measures to make the teaching profession attractive for the current teachers and for those who might be attracted to it. This can be implemented through (1) improving working conditions of the teaching profession, (2) ensuring that teachers receive the social security advantages associated with this profession, (3) and ensuring that teachers and other teaching staff receive salaries that are at least in parallel with other professions which require similar or equivalent qualifications of these teachers and teaching staff. 20. Setting up qualification frameworks for the teachers, their trainers and their supervisors. 21. Development and implementation of equitable, all-inclusive and gender-sensitive policies to manage teachers' affairs.

Links with the National Policy Agenda: Connecting the government's National Policy Agenda with the policy, interventions and priorities of the programs of the Education Sectoral Strategic Plan: 1. Early education for our children - include the following interventions: a. Developing early childhood development programs that are accessible to all, which entail the following relevant interventions of the Education Sector Plan 2017-2022: - Increasing the number of qualified women teachers, supervisors and principals in private and public preschools in accordance with the standards of the Teacher Education Strategy.Ministry of Education and Higher Education126 - Developing and implementing the standards required to qualify 50% of pre-school teachers (females) in line with the standards of the Teacher Education Strategy. - Upholding efficiency of female teachers, supervisors and principals (continuing education) at private and public preschools. - Opening more training centres for teachers and supervisors of preschools in all district offices. - Encouraging universities to open a specialized program in preschool education, and ensuring that this program gets certified. - Upholding student-based quality education for all boys and girls in the classroom. - Increasing the number of preschools which use educational techniques and learning technology in the teaching and learning process. - Taking a decision requiring the presence of technical supervision at preschools to ensure quality education there. - Compelling preschools to provide counselling service. - Evaluating and re-development of the Preschool Curriculum Framework to in line with needs of the Palestinian children in 2019. - Development and testing of the Palestinian Preschool Curriculum Framework. - Development of the evaluation and diagnosis methods for all aspects of learning, according to the methodology of the general framework of the preschool curriculum. - Development and activation of the administrative system and frameworks of policy, decision-making, and follow-up, at all levels. - Adopting an e-system and network to manage licensing affairs for preschools and private educational institutions. b. Expanding and enhancing pre-school education . Relevant interventions of the Education Sector Plan 2017-2022 include the following: - Increasing the gross enrolment rates of children in preschool (Bustan (KG1) and Tamhidi (KG2)). - Increasing the number of licensed private preschools. - Increasing the number of classrooms in the Tamhidi grade at public preschools in disadvantaged areas that lack these educational services. - Maintenance and restorations of buildings and furniture at the existing government preschools. - Increasing the ratio of enrolment of students with disabilities and special needs in public preschools.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022127 - Upholding the awareness of the community and parents on the importance of education and early childhood issues. - Increasing the number of government and private preschools taking advantage of international and local support and protection in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem. - Adopting the policy of compulsory education of the Tamhidi grade by the government. - Adding a Tamhidi grade unit at new school buildings that are earmarked for early Basic education. - Review and update the regulations and instructions of various work fields, in line with the new law. - Upholding coordination between governmental and non-governmental sectors working on or associated with the preschool sector. - Building a qualified and competent administrative unit to manage the preschool sector at the national level, aiming to uphold the capacity of the ministry in implementing early childhood education programs. - The government should establish the High National Commission for Early Childhood. Israeli occupation's prohibition of construction in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem is one of the major obstacles to implementing the above policies and interventions. This obstructs the ministry's plans to provide preschool services in these areas. To overcome this obstacle pressure must be imposed on the Israeli occupation through international organizations, in an effort to obtain the necessary construction or purchase permits and establish preschools in areas mentioned.

Most prominent obstacles to achieving goals mentioned above: the Israeli occupation's procedures constitute a big obstacle. For instance, Israel banns construction or addition to school buildings and other educational facilities in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem, since they are located under full Israeli control. Therefore, it is vital that international organizations intervene to secure the necessary construction permits. 4. From education to work: a. Adapting technical and vocational education, higher education and training in line with the needs of development and the labor market, while ensuring equal opportunities for all.

Israeli occupation's procedures are major obstacles to achieving the above interventions . For instance, Israel prohibits construction and addition of classrooms or facilities to new buildings for schools and educational institutions in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem, due to being under full Israeli control. Therefore, it is vital that students in \"Area C\" and Jerusalem are allowed access to vocational training in their area of residency or be provided with affordable transportation to access vocational schools in other areas. There is also a need for creating vocational education programs that are suitable for the needs of students in \"Area C\". b. Developing the technical training and vocational education centers' infrastructure and facilities : Relevant interventions of the Education Sector Plan 2017-2022 include the following: - Maintaining and restoring buildings, furniture and equipment, including specialized rooms, workshops, and technological equipment used for learning. - Increasing the number of existing schools where teaching means are ample.

National policies that have indirect relation on the education sector: There are a set of indirect connections that link the education sector to national policies: - Intensifying national and international efforts to end the occupation. In relation to education, there are some vital relevant interventions that need to be carried out, and in the forefront, it is important to work on \"Instilling the valued status of Jerusalem and to work on its development since it is considered the capital of the State of Palestine\". Daily suffering of Palestinians living in occupied Jerusalem concerning education include: Israeli interventions into Palestinian education in Jerusalem, complete military and civil control of the city, and depriving the Palestinian people from decent and secure educational services are all forms of Israeli violations against education. Israel also practices pressure on Palestinian schools in Jerusalem to replace the Palestinian curriculum with the Israeli one. Furthermore, restricted entry permits and low wages (compared to Israeli schools) have reduced the number of qualified teachers in Jerusalem. All these violations require political and technical support from the international community. Therefore, and to support education in Jerusalem, the Ministry of Education and the Palestinian government have adopted the following policies: 1. Free textbooks to be distributed to all schools. 2. Granting teachers and all of the educational staff working in Jerusalem a special salary bonus. 3. Allocating 10% of international scholarships to Jerusalem's students. 4. Offering partial grants to students of Jerusalem living within the Old City's wall that covers half their tuition fees at Palestinian universities, in addition to other policies that might be adopted to reinforce the steadfastness of Palestinians in Jerusalem. 5. The ministry is to allocate part of its planning efforts and budgeting for Jerusalem, as it is part of the state of Palestine and the eternal capital of it, according to the United Nations resolutions and other legal terms of reference. Hence, this strategic document in addition to the annual action plans and related budgets should include and prioritize Jerusalem. Maintaining sustainable minimum support for education in Jerusalem requires the approval of special budgets to uphold and protect education there. This includes private schools since they are vulnerable to Israel's financial threats and or being constantly pressured to endorse the Israeli curriculum. Covering the educational needs of Jerusalem requires an estimated sum of $30 million per year. - National unity: The Ministry of Education and the Palestinian government consider that re-uniting the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, geographically and politically, in addition Ministry of Education and Higher Education138 to implementing the Gaza Reconstruction Plan a top priority. The ministry is currently reconstructing schools that were destroyed by the Israeli occupation during the summer of 2014 war on Gaza. The ministry's efforts in this regard include restoration of buildings, construction of new structures, and maintenance to others. - Enhancing the status of the State of Palestine at the international level: The Ministry of Education, through its plans and programs, seeks to enhance the strategy of service delivery to citizens at the various levels and in cooperation with all partners. This involves special attention to marginalized areas especially \"Area C\" and Jerusalem. The ministry is also seeking to reinforce partnerships and integration of service delivery with NGOs and the private sector. - Effective government: The Ministry of Education has adopted the system of performance and result-based management. The ministry continues to: integrate the process of planning in budgeting; enhance transparency and accountability; develop human resources in the education sector; integrate gender in its policies, programs and budgets; take further measures to improve management of public funds; ensure financial sustainability through sustainable energy projects at schools, such as solar cells and productive school, and more... - An independent Palestinian economy: The Ministry of Education gives special attention to bridging the developmental gap between the West Bank and Gaza, as part of its plans, programs and interventions. For instance, the ministry fairly distributes its activities and programs among all directorates of education within its available resources and ability to deliver, especially in the Gaza Strip. The ministry supports and encourages industrialization especially in the technical and digital fields and reinforcement of the digital content. It also boosts digitalization of education at various levels: providing all schools with free access to the internet (under an agreement with the Ministry of Telecommunication); reinforcement of digitalization of the educational content through an educational portal which all schools, teachers and students have access to; and providing schools with sufficient computers and tablets containing the Palestinian curriculum. Learning through these tablets is currently being experimented at two basic schools in each of the directorates of education (grades 5-6), where implementation will be expanded gradually at a later date. The Ministry of Education and all of its development partners (partners of educational plans and programs) take into account eliminating all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, as well as any hurdles preventing full participation of women in societal, economic and development in general. These are implemented as policy interventions to reinforce gender equality and empower women. Moreover, all interventions carried out by the ministry whether in regard to enrollment, quality, management and governance, all take into account the issue of gender, marginalized groups and persons with special needs. The educational plan and programs aim to enable Palestinian youth to get an opportunity for future success and active participation in public life, as well as in state building, with focus on disadvantaged youth. This priority is associated with the priority of quality education \"from education to work\". The Education Development Strategic Plan also emphasizes the importance of reinforcing preventive healthcare and promoting citizens' health behavior and awareness. This is achieved through initial and periodic checkups, health education, and implementation of projects and health programs. - A society capable of steadfastness and development: The Ministry of Education places special emphasis on boosting reliance on renewable energy resources. The ministry uses Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022139 alternative energy (for example by installing solar cells at schools' roofs) to run school activities. This system is currently being implemented at new schools and will gradually apply to the existing ones. Contribution of the Education Sector Strategy 2017-2022 to cross-sector strat - egies: 1. Cross-Sector Gender Strategy: First: studies and assessment of the educational situation and the National Education for All Report 2000-2015 revealed that Palestine is one of the countries that place great emphasis on gender equality and justice. It also revealed that females outperform males on many issues whether regard to higher enrollment at all levels of education, mentioned in the first strategic goal, or in regard to quality education, which is mentioned in the second strategic goal. Second: The Ministry of Education has taken into account gender issues in all of its interventions to achieve its strategic goals: enrollment and access to education, quality of education, and governance of the education system. Third: the monitoring and evaluation system will include the gender variable in all relevant indices to tackle any issues arising during implementation. 2. Cross-sector Environment Strategy: The Ministry takes into account environmental issues in its interventions to achieve the strategic goals. Examples of this include the following: - To achieve the first strategic goal, which is access to education and a safe education environment (through interventions), the Ministry takes advantage of renewable energy, where the use of solar cells has been included as an essential component of new school buildings. It also reinforced the concept of green buildings. - To achieve the second strategic goal of improving quality of education, the Ministry has taken into account environmental issues and the protection of biodiversity, as part of its efforts to enhance the Palestinian curriculum. The Ministry will also launch multiple school activities to encourage protection of the environment through scout activities at schools. - Concerning governance and management, the Ministry conducts a comprehensive environmental survey every two years at all educational facilities (preschools, basic, secondary and vocational schools, and higher education institutions) in cooperation with the Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). The Ministry also monitors environmental issues through its assessment and evaluation system which the Ministry has approved for its annual and strategic plans. 3. Cross-sector youth strategy: First: youth constitutes an important part of the categories targeted in the Education Sector Strategy. The Ministry endeavors to address all issues pertaining to this category through its interventions to achieve the strategic goals. These interventions include: - Providing youth with educational and vocational guidance to help them choose suitable careers for their future.Ministry of Education and Higher Education140 - Providing sport and free activity facilities for the youth to allow them to express their talents and interests at schools and universities. - Promoting voluntary activities for the benefit of society and to preserve the environment and enhance ethical values. - Providing learning tracks that suit youth's interests and needs to allow them to find suitable jobs. - Addressing the psychological, physical and mental needs of the youth through a variety of educational activities that are implemented at all levels of education.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022VII.

Management PlanMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022217 XI. Management Plan Monitoring and Evaluation System The Education Sector plan along with its goals, policies and programs has been based on the organizational structure developed by the Education Development Strategic Plan III of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (2014-2019), which encompasses a system of result-based monitoring and evaluation. This system helps shareholders get to know whether the plan has succeeded or if there are any changes regarding related conditions. The system also highlights intervention recommendations affected by these changes, if any. More importantly, in the event of failure, the system provides early warnings to detect the causes of failure, and offers suggestions for timely adjustment and evidence-based decision-making. In 2009, the Ministry established a special monitoring and evaluation system within the Directorate General of Planning. The M&E system helps all stakeholders, partners and decision-makers contribute effectively to the education system reforms with a view to achieve a greater goal of nurturing well-educated citizens who are qualified for the labor market. In recent years, the M&E system has been strengthened and developed both in terms of operations and reporting with a special attention to school, teacher, and student performance. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation reports are distributed annually to the central Ministry that covers the entire education system, as well as to each directorate. During preparations of the third strategy 2014-2019, and after a comprehensive review, the M&E system was harmonized and adjusted to the new planning rationale which includes indicators at the output levels, objectives, targets, results and impact. Linking the M&E system directly to service delivery programs provides an opportunity to institutionalize the RBM approach, which is gradually adopted by the Ministry in all its operations and management. The program-wide output, goals and objectives are all designed to be SMART and can be fully controlled through this approach. The Ministry will rely on this system after adapting it to the changes introduced in the Education Sector Plan 2017-2022 to provide accurate information and data to assess progress, and to agree on corrective actions when needed. This system provides annual indicators that assist in the yearly review of progress in order that corrective actions are taken to ensure that the correct track is maintained. Key objectives of the Monitoring and Evaluation System of the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022: 1. Strengthening results-based management and accountability through the education system. 2. Measuring the suitability of the policies adopted by demonstrating the inter- relationship between application and results (goals, objectives, and program outcomes) and by providing solutions in the event of a defect. 3. Following up on achievements at the level of outputs, goals and objectives of the plan.Ministry of Education and Higher Education218 4. Using monitoring and evaluation reports as reference during the annual planning cycle, policy-making and management. As the Ministry has adopted and institutionalized direct service programs, the monitoring and evaluation system has been reorganized to track the level of results, goals and objectives, and to track the level of implementation of outputs and expenditures for each program, as shown in the following figure: M&E indicators were classified into 3 levels according to the results series. The first level includes key performance indicators (KPIs) for each program, linked with the purpose of the program; for example, the results. The second level presents indicators of the level of the program's objectives or goals, while the third level presents indicators of outputs and expenditures. Each indicator of the system addresses three points: Answer of \"what?\": Measures the circumstances surrounding the indicators that are based on collected data. Answer of \"why?\": Analyzes the gaps between actual data and targeted data, and identifies the reasons in the event of failure to achieve the approved targets. Answer of \"how?\": Provides policy recommendations and interventions at the stage of the annual planning cycle. In addition to analyzing and evaluating indicators, broad sector assessments will be conducted annually. As part of the 2017 objectives, the Ministry will seek to revise some indicators and develop appropriate theoretical frameworks as well as tools for levels of monitoring and evaluation of: early childhood (pre-school), basic school education, secondary school education, vocational education, non-formal education, higher education, and administration. Through this process, the ministry aims to manage strategic programs spanning 6 years (2017- 7 7 7 Higher Education Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022219 2022). Vulnerability will be measured in all programs implemented in \"Area C\", Jerusalem and disadvantaged areas. The indicators will highlight the degree of gender sensitivity and existing gaps. Last but not least, indicators of marginalized groups and people with special needs will constitute a key part of the system. M&E Groups To ensure progress as planned in the Strategic Plan and annual plans, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education has adopted several monitoring and evaluation structures, including: 1. The Strategy, Planning, and Budget Management Group : It consists of: Chairman of the Group (Minister of Education and Higher Education), Vice- Chairman (Deputy- Minister), and membership of the deputy Assistants, Program Directors, the General Director of Planning and the General Director of Finance. The group meets periodically to follow up on preparations of the annual plans, implementation, spending and decision- making which contribute towards achieving the goals set as well as overcoming difficulties facing the implementation process. 2. The Education Sector Working Group (ESWG) : The group consists of specialized technical groups that are \"equipped\" with technical knowledge and are formed according to the main challenges and priorities needed, or based on the new programs approved under the third strategic plan 2014-2019. ESFG Forum is the main reference of ESWG. This structure ensures a deeper level of understanding and a higher level of information quality. The group consists of international institutions such as UNESCO, UNICEF and others, in addition to supporters of the education sector, including JFA, AMIDEAST and others. 3. The National Education Group 2030 : It is a national educational group that includes the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (presidency and coordination) and governmental, civil and international institutions concerned with education. The nomination for membership is issued by the Minister of Education and Higher Education. The task of the group is to achieve the 4th SDG and the emerging goals adopted by the Incheon / Korea Summit to be achieved by 2030. The team also ensures integration of the proposed global, regional and national policies; policy interventions adopted in the Education for All 2014 National Assessment Report in national development plans; strategic plans for the education sector until 2030; and monitoring and evaluation of what is periodically accomplished.Ministry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022XII. Linking the Strategy Goals with SDG's and International CommitmentsMinistry of Education and Higher EducationEducation Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022223 XII. Linking goals of the Strategy with SDGs and international obligations The following figure illustrates the logical sequence of the relationship between SDGs, the National Policy Agenda and the Education Sector Plan: First: The New York Summit mobilized the entire world towards 17 goals for sustainable development in order to advance humanity towards a better future. The goals included 169 targets and 229 indicators. The Fourth Goal aims to achieve quality and equitable education for all. Second: Palestine signed the Incheon / Korea Declaration to achieve the objectives of education under the 4th SDG 2030. The declaration contains 7 goals and 3 requirements: Goal4.1: Ensuring that all girls, boys, girls and young women and men have free, equitable and quality basic and secondary education, resulting in appropriate and effective educational outcomes by 2030 Goal4.2: Ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality development and care in the early childhood and pre-school education level, so that the children become ready for basic education, by 2030 Goal4.3: Ensuring that all women and men have equal access to quality and affordable vocational and higher education, including university education, by 2030 Goal4.4: Achieving a significant increase in the number of young people and adults with appropriate skills, including technical and vocational skills, enabling them to have decent jobs and work as entrepreneurs by 2030 Goal 4.5: Eliminating gender disparities in education and ensuring equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children living in vulnerable situations, by 2030 Goal 4.6: Ensuring that all young people and a large proportion of adults, both men and women, are good at reading, writing and numeracy, by 2030 Goal 4.7: Ensuring that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to support sustainable development, including, inter alia, education for sustainable development and means of sustainable livelihoods, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and appreciation of the contribution of culture to sustainable development by 2030 Goal 4-A: Building educational facilities that take into account gender differences, disability and child differences; upgrading existing educational facilities; and creating an effective, safe and non-violent education environment for all. Ministry of Education and Higher Education224 Target 4-B: Achieving a significant increase in the number of global scholarships available to the developing countries, especially for the least developed countries, small island developing states and African countries. The aim of this increase is to enhance access to higher education, including access to scholarships of vocational training, ICT, technical, engineering and scientific programs in both the developed and developing countries, by 2030 Goal 4-C: Achieving a significant increase in the number of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation in teacher training in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries and small island developing states, by 2030 Third: The National Policy Agenda has been defined in relation to the SDGs 2030 according to the following: a.

The monitoring and evaluation system helps the Ministry verify the course of the plan and conduct annual corrections to maintain progress towards the specific results. Fifth: The Ministry of Education and Higher Education as the coordinator of the Education Sector Plan 2017-2022 began reviewing its third strategic plan in light of the National Policy Agenda for the Development Plan 2017-2022; the international commitments of Palestine at the New York Summit - which adopted the SDGs, the Incheon / Korea Declaration to achieve the goals of education by 2030. And also in light of the reform plan adopted by the Education Review Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister and coordinated by the Minister of Education and Higher Education. The plan was reviewed with stakeholders in the education sector, including government, civil society, higher education and international institutions, supporters, and international partners. The review was carried out based on monitoring and evaluation reports and completion reports on the annual plans. Linking education goals with SDGs 2030 and international obligations : Education has a recognized role in achieving other SDGs. Therefore, it is important for policy to reflect this interdependence. Several reports issued by United Nations organizations such as the UNESCO, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, FAO, ILO, UNFPA, UN-Women, and UN Habitat, as well as reports by the World Bank, UNIDO, WTO, UNC, TAD, UNEP and CBD illustrate the connection between education and several other SDGs. The most important parts of these reports are explained as follows: SDG1: Eradicating poverty in all its manifestations everywhere: closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector, as illustrated below: Goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. It also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and the vulnerable; increasing access to basic services; supporting those affected by extreme weather conditions and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. The reports show that there is a reciprocal relationship between education and poverty, as education reduces poverty by increasing the income of individuals, and by reinforcing the ability to resist negative shocks. Education of girls also prevents the succession of poverty from generation to generation by reducing early marriage, early childbirth, and other risks associated with these events. Enrollment in education is usually lower among poor groups. Challenges and obstacles to poverty reduction include raising the educational requirements for access to the labor market in low- and middle-income countries, and limited access to education for people with special needs. Policy recommendations in international reports focused on the need to create and expand educational opportunities as part of a multidimensional approach that combines income support, job creation, better healthcare, education, social protection, and access to energy. These recommendations have also focused on other community development interventions.Ministry of Education and Higher Education226 SDG2: Eliminating hunger, providing improved food security, nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture: this is closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector, as illustrated below: Goal 2 aims to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. It also aims to ensure access to safe, nutritious and adequate food at all times of the year for all. This will require sustainable food production systems, resilient agricultural practices against shocks, equitable access to land use, access to technology and market, and international cooperation in investment, infrastructure and technology to increase agricultural productivity. Reports show that education is an essential element of the efforts to reduce malnutrition and hunger. They also emphasize the importance of basic education in improving income and agricultural productivity. For instance, agricultural education and training is seen in the reports as an incentive for agricultural productivity through developing the capacities of producers and promoting the development of skills and competencies for innovation. Farmers need to reach more advanced levels of education to take advantage of new sources of ICT-based information, provide technical advice and respond to new market opportunities and environmental change. Furthermore, education also plays a key role in helping people move to more sustainable agricultural practices and understand improved nutrition. Many reports point to the detrimental effects of undernourishment on educational outcomes, and those most affected are those who come from marginalized groups suffering malnutrition and poverty. An ILO report concludes that social protection programs, including cash transfers, school fees, food and school feeding programs, have been found to be effective in increasing school enrollment rates and reducing dropout rates and child labor. SDG3: Ensuring that everyone enjoys a healthy lifestyle and well-being at all ages: this is closely linked to the second strategic goal of the education sector as shown below: Goal 3 aims at ensuring health and well-being for all people at all stages of life, and addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive health, maternal and child health; communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases; comprehensive coverage of health insurance; universal access to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. The goal also aims to boost research and development, increase health financing and strengthen the capacity of all countries to reduce and manage health risks. Many reports have confirmed that education affects health and well-being, reflecting a common understanding that education is a powerful tool for improving people's health. The reports found that learners are better informed about diseases, and that they can take preventive measures, identify early signs of disease and use health care services in many occasions. Reports also showed that basic education supports comprehensive health coverage by enabling healthy lifestyle choices and implementing health care recommendations. Better education for women results in better health outcomes for themselves and their children, and for faster transition Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022227 of their countries to stable population growth. The reports found that the most educated young people (especially women) are more willing to control the size of the family and invest in the health and well-being of their children. Moreover, evidence collected by the reports confirms that education is a means of protecting young people from engaging in dangerous behaviors. In addition, reports recommend that education programs should provide students with values and skills that support not only success to join the labor market, but also enable them to have healthier and more prosperous lives. Schools can further be the main centers for the provision of basic healthcare and the sources of medical and educational information. Reproductive health education programs in schools can also be effective in increasing knowledge and adoption of safe sexual behavior. These programs can serve as a central component of health promotion and education to change youth behavior and encourage adoption of healthy behaviors. SDG5: Achieving gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls: this is closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector , as illustrated below: The goal of gender equality and empowerment of women has been advancing in recent decades. Girls' access to education has improved, as the rate of child marriage has decreased and progress has been made in sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including a reduction in the number of maternal deaths. However, gender equality continues to be a constant challenge to the countries of the world, and its absence constitutes an obstacle to sustainable development. Several reports have discussed the relationship between education and gender equality in both directions. The reports describe how education affects gender equality and the empowerment of women. For instance, education expands opportunities for girls and young women and raises their aspirations to work outside the home. The more education women gain, the more they move outside the framework of domestic or traditional agricultural production activities and go to work for pay. Policies ensuring that women and girls who have access to services, including health and education, have contributed to the significant progress in women's standard of living. The greater the educational achievement, then the more the attitudes of both girls and boys towards gender equality, leading to more positive attitudes towards achieving gender equality for both males and females. Education empowers women to overcome discrimination, claim their rights and overcome obstacles that prevent them from obtaining a fair share of public progress. Secondary education is particularly critical for women to be able to claim their rights and participate in decision-making, in addition to being a path to decent work. The reports also show that the high educational achievement of women expands their freedom by enhancing their ability to question, think and act according to their circumstances and increase access to information. Education enhances the social status of girls and increases their ability to influence within marriage. In addition, investing in education can help accelerate the demographic transition. Some reports suggest that technical and vocational training for sustainable development in general lacks a gender perspective. The reports also showed three clear links on how education affects gender equality and the empowerment of women:Ministry of Education and Higher Education228 First : Women do not have enough time, which reduces their access to education. Second : Early marriage limits girls access to education. Increasing the ability of women to plan for their children will lead to a real improvement in their children's education, social and economic success and improved wages. Children are affected by their mothers' education and by being poor. Third : Increasing family income with the participation of women often leads to an improvement in the educational achievement of children, as women tend to allocate more of their income to food and education than men. Policy recommendations in a sample of reports on several regions addressed a set of points to be taken into consideration: 1. To achieve all-inclusive basic education; greater attention should be paid to the excluded children (especially poor girls in rural areas). 2. Coupon programs have traditionally been used to make education more equitable by targeting disadvantaged groups such as women, youth and low-income students. 3. Clean energy options, especially in rural areas, can save time for girls to study and improve their academic performance. 4. Ensuring that young women have access to voluntary family planning has the greatest impact on achieving good levels of education. SDG6: Ensuring sustainable availability and management of water and sanitation for all: It is closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector as illustrated below: Water and sanitation are an issue at the heart of sustainable development and a vital requirement for the survival of people and the planet. Millennium Development Goal 6 addresses not only drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources around the world. A report has indicated that education and training develop skills and the capacity to use natural resources more sustainably, as well as promote public health. Education and information programs are therefore seen as a prerequisite for creating the conditions for integrated water resources management. The report emphasizes the need for cultural change through education and economic incentives for water users. Investment in education is a possible policy to improve access to safe drinking water and reduce water waste, by raising awareness of the need for water supply and the relationship between potable water and disease. Many children go to school in conditions that are not conducive to learning, such as lack of potable drinking water, safe laundries and clean toilets.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022229 SDG7: Ensuring affordable access for all to modern, reliable and sustainable energy services: this is closely linked to the first, second and third strategic goals of the education sector as illustrated below: Energy is critical to achieving almost all goals of sustainable development. It eradicates poverty, enhances health, edu cation, water supply and industrialization, and addresses climate change. Looking at the links between education and access to safe and renewable energy sources (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, solar, biogas, geothermal, marine sources, and waste), education is very important to reduce carbon levels leading to global warming. It is therefore necessary to target young people to provide them with the knowledge and skills about energy use, to allow them to make informed decisions as energy users. Educational programs, especially non-formal programs, can promote better conservation of energy and increases demand for renewable energy sources. On the other hand, the availability of energy improves the quality of the educational services provided and increases the likelihood of students attending or completing their studies in school. In particular, electricity is vital to education, since it operates educational media and provides communication between schools and homes. Electricity can also increase use of distance learning units and provide the opportunity to use more advanced equipment for education, which allows for use of more sophisticated means and materials. Furthermore, clean energy options can save time for women and girls to study and improve their academic performance. For example, affordable sanitation and energy can enhance access to water and sanitation, lighting, heating / cooling space, and clean energy to cook. Finally, supplying the countryside with electricity helps retain qualified teachers in rural areas, which is a key lever for improving the quality of education there. SDG8: Promoting steady, inclusive and sustainable economic growth for all, in addition to full and productive employment and decent work for all: this is closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector, as illustrated below: Steady and all-inclusive economic growth is essential for sustainable development The links between education, economic growth and job creation seem to be very clear in global reports. Several reports emphasize the importance of education for employment and growth in general. They have underlined the impact of education, particularly at the secondary and university levels, on the productive capacities and productivity of workers, as well as on achieving higher returns. The reports also pointed to the importance of education as a determinant of knowledge and entrepreneurship, both in wage and non-wage work. Education is expected to enhance international competitiveness and skilled manpower in the manufacturing industries, as investment in education has a positive impact on export growth. Further, the high level of education has a critical impact on the supply options in the labor market for women. The more education women gain, the more they move away from domestic work or traditional Ministry of Education and Higher Education230 agricultural production and go to work for pay. Education for girls and women enhances their chances of finding jobs, staying healthy and fully engaged in the society, and the better the level of education for rural youth, the more they enter a wide range of non-agricultural occupations. Reports indicate the importance of skills for the labor market through high-level and specialized training for companies. Reports indicate two types of challenges: the first is linked to the supply-demand relationship with the widening gap between skills acquired in education and the nature of jobs available, in addition to the needs of the labor market. A report has found out that in some countries, labor market returns for those who have completed basic or secondary level sharply declined, while returns for those who completed higher education increased. Second , girls are often left out of school and are not ready to work, or do not reach the level of education that prepares them for rewarding jobs. In some areas, high levels of female education have not reflected a significant increase in the rates of young women's participation in the labor force. Many reports call for further investment in education to stimulate growth and encourage innovation. Recommendations range from general investment advice to increasing pre-school enrollment among economically and socially disadvantaged families, and raising educational achievement to at least secondary level. Some reports also indicate a particular focus on the promotion of formal technical and vocational training, with closer interaction and relationship between educational, industrial and other institutions in the labor market while ensuring continuous training. It is worthy to note that there is a need for balance and sequencing of educational policies at three dimensions: post-basic educational opportunities, tools to enhance educational decision- making, and options of the second opportunity for education. Priorities should also be identified among the three dimensions (basic skills rather than post-basic skills). Several reports highlight the relevance of learning content to life and labor market needs, in terms of skills that focus on facilitating movement from school to work and preventing mismatches in the labor market. The first link between growth and employment opportunities in education is embodied at the macroeconomic level. A report by World Trade Organization (WTO) notes that economic growth is a necessary precondition for development - which explains why many countries with strong economic growth are seeking to achieve a leap in improvement of health, educational achievement, living standards, and reducing poverty. In terms of causal linkages, there is a strong correlation between high levels of education and economic shifts, such as the shift from agriculture to industry and productive services, and the increasing demand for skilled workers as a result of higher levels of education. For instance, competition has led to higher demand for innovation and high-tech. Economic changes have also driven changes in curricula and their content, while business interests have increased the importance of action-based learning and formal education. There are other links at the household level. Child labor in agriculture and other sectors can limit children's enrollment in education. Paid work and household work, especially for girls, increase the likelihood of repetition (retention) or drop out of school. Economic recession can also hinder children's continuing their education because of their parents losing their jobs. Long-term unemployment may pose further a serious threat to children's learning. On the other hand, women's work increases household income, improves their spending on health and education and improves the achievement of children. Finally, migration and remittances can Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022231 enhance human capital through expanding education options, especially in higher education, and stimulating investment in education. Reports have discussed some obstacles and challenges, especially regarding the lack of harmony between skills acquired through education and needs of the labor market, which leads to unemployment. Although there has been good progress in the education of women and girls, progress in employment and representation has been much slower. Women still earn less than men. SDG9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and promoting innovation: this is closely linked to the second strategic goal of the education sector, as illustrated below: Goal 9 includes three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures necessary for the operation of any community or institution. Industrialization promotes economic growth and provides jobs, thereby reducing poverty caused by low incomes. Innovation contributes to the advancement of technological capabilities of industrial sectors and encourages the development of new skills. International reports have shown many links between industrialization, infrastructure and education. Education bolsters industrial development and economic transformation, along with other factors the reports focused on the role of education as a strong catalyst of innovation and a basis for technology uptake and diversification. The development of wireless communications and digital and technological education has enabled backward countries to overcome the hurdles associated with the costly financial investment in infrastructure mobilized by developed countries in the 20thcentury. Technological innovations and development have allowed many countries to improve education at low cost. Education is therefore necessary to develop the skills needed to build a more flexible and more sustainable infrastructure. SDG10: Reducing inequality within and between countries: this is closely linked to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector, as illustrated below: Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities based on income, age, disability, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic status or any other factor within the country. The goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including representation, migration and development assistance. International reports show that there are many linkages between education and inequality, and education is seen as having two life-long effects later: The first effect is to obtain formal jobs.Ministry of Education and Higher Education232 The Second effect is a powerful tool for promoting justice. Unequal opportunities in education for children have a negative impact on per capita income. Several reports point to the importance of education as a tool for empowering individuals in all fields. A real challenge is that there is no correlation between high average levels of education and narrowing inequalities. Policy recommendations in this field confirm that raising educational achievement up to the secondary level or more helps reduce income inequality and promotes intergenerational transmission of competencies, such as education within families, which can have long-term benefits. Education policies also need to focus on improving low-performing schools and classrooms by providing a quality educational experience for the disadvantaged. Officials must reflect on opportunities for education or training that can help and encourage children to be creative or to think critically. These opportunities should include the poor and the marginalized categories. On the other hand, equality in access to education is seen as the key to opening wider horizons of education, and disparity in the quality of education between the rich and the poor is the main factor behind the unequal opportunities between them. As far as the challenges are concerned, reports indicate that despite the progress achieved, major inequalities in education outcomes continue to exist among groups within countries. Social and cultural norms in many countries exclude certain categories from education, especially girls and young women, in addition to other classes based on race, social class, or disability. Moreover, increase in income inequality leads to an increase in polarization in education outcomes, which in turn leads to a vicious cycle of marginalization and inequality. Global policy recommendations confirm that high quality public education can reduce gaps in the education of children between poor and rich households. These recommendations also confirm the need to prioritize investment in young children to reach the most disadvantaged groups (including girls). SDG 11: Making cities all-inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable: this is closely linked to the first, second and third strategic goals of the education sector as described below: More than half of the world's population lives in cities. By 2030, urban populations are expected to represent 6 out of 10 people. Despite many challenges in planning, cities and other well-managed human clusters can serve as incubators for innovation, creativity and key drivers of sustainable development. Linkages between education and cities focus on disaster risk reduction and management, and disaster preparedness requires significant long-term investments in education. The higher the levels of learning than just literacy and basic education, then the better the people's understanding of warnings and disaster preparedness plans. Meanwhile, urbanization has a major positive impact on changes in education, with emphasis on the vital role of cities in transmitting ideas and mobilizing political action. In urban areas, children are exposed almost 5 times more than children in rural areas to completing secondary education. Another positive effect of urbanization - mentioned in the reports - is the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022233 growing business earnings which increase the opportunity cost of raising children, and which may raise the marriage age of women, educational achievement and participation in the labor market. Reports suggest that education can give people the skills to participate in shaping and maintaining more sustainable cities, villages and camps, and to achieve resilience in disasters, wars and armed attacks. SDG12: Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns: this is closely linked to the second and third strategic goals of the education sector as illustrated below: Economic growth and development require the production of goods and services that improve the quality of life. Sustainable growth and development require minimizing use of natural resources, toxic substances, generation of waste and pollutants at all stages of the production and consumption process. Education is the main pillar of global efforts to bring about a paradigm shift in sustainability patterns by changing behaviors and lifestyles, and by achieving communities with low carbon production. Consumer education can promote lifestyle change and more well-informed choices. Several reports have addressed the need for consumers to target green energy options, housing options and green home-based goods to move towards environment- friendly economies worldwide. Many governments, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and companies are increasingly emphasizing the importance of learning and capacity building in their search for solutions to sustainability challenges, including climate change, disaster risk management, loss of biodiversity and sustainable production and consumption. Among the challenges identified is the lack of appropriate limits of education and training in management of chemicals and wastes in many developing countries. The reports also show an ambiguous role of the media (such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines and the internet), which can promote awareness and sustainability and promote sustainable consumption. Public policy recommendations focus on the need to promote education for sustainable consumption in developed countries - particularly by promoting literacy, the role of the media, education for consumption and public awareness. They also focus on education on the importance of biodiversity and the effects of unsustainable consumption and production patterns, and the health benefits of a moderate and diverse diet. All of these are seen as key instruments for easing the overall demand increases for food by reducing excessive consumption, especially meat, through the wealthiest sectors of the society. The common task of all countries on the long run is to improve and redirect education systems to enhance the knowledge, skills and directions needed to deal with the current and future challenges. This requires improving the quantity and quality of training and teaching of green skills and education for sustainable development, including specific skills in certain sectors such as sustainable design of green buildings and renewable and clean energy. Reports on education by the World Bank refer to education as one of the levers of government's efforts to create an economic environment that facilitates well-informed decision-making (such as long-term weather forecasts and agricultural extension services). UNESCO also emphasizes Ministry of Education and Higher Education234 the role of \"interrelated multi-level development responses\", which address consumption through raising awareness and promoting environmental production by moving to more environmentally sensitive practices (through training programs). As for the inverse relationship between education and responsible consumption and production, UNESCO's report on education for sustainable development has indicated that global trends to promote education for sustainable development, including changes in the physical environment; changes in international guidelines and government regulations; changes in demand for environmentally-friendly consumer goods and services; and increased demand for goods and services related to sustainability have put pressure on educational facilities to implement sustainability policies. The report also notes that the lack of awareness among households about their food and water consumption patterns has been an obstacle to behavioral change, which could have been overcome through adequate information. In terms of policy making, the reports indicate that the education sector should have long been adapting and cooperating with sustainable development partnerships and networks in such areas as climate change, biodiversity, water, fight against poverty, and consumption. SDG13: Taking urgent action to address climate change and its impacts: this is closely linked to the second strategic goal of the education sector as illustrated below: Climate change represents the greatest threat to development at all, and its widespread and unprecedented effects disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable categories. Urgent action to address climate change and minimize its impact is an integral part of the successful implementation of sustainable development goals. Many reports stress the importance of education for climate change. In general, education plays a vital role in reducing the causes and effects of climate change. The effects of climate change and extreme events depend on education as one of the important factors. Reports indicate that education and finance, especially for young people, can prepare people for adaptation when a natural disaster significantly affects their livelihoods. Therefore, education is critical to helping people adapt to the effects of climate change, especially in the poorest countries where farmers depend on rain fed agriculture and where they are more strongly threatened. Reports also indicate that education can help drive the behavioral change needed to combat climate change, and that basic education can provide the basis for absorbing environmentally friendly technology. The presence of a large number of qualified engineers and researchers is also essential to achieving this. In terms of constraints, research shows that both students and the public have a misunderstanding about the various aspects of climate change, the effects of global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, the information, education and awareness provided so far have proved to be insufficient to motivate people to work, and may have been counterproductive. The recommendations on education for sustainable development - addressing climate change among other issues - call for the need to develop a common framework for promoting the climate response through education and advocacy for education as a largely untapped strategic resource for building resilient and sustainable societies. \"Integrating climate change into the curriculum is the first step to be taken, development of a new cadre of professionals to address the complex problems of climate change is equally important, and education of citizens is Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022235 essential to facilitate change,\" says one World Bank report. The report also noted to the need for a different approach to providing information on climate change. Reports by international institutions indicate two links between climate change and education. First , the search for solutions to climate change by governments, NGOs and companies stimulates the demand for adapting education and building capacity in this regard. Second , climate variability can permanently affect people's health and education. Education is often cited as the key to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of climate change, to adaptation and to mitigation of climate change, particularly at the local level. SDG14: Conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources to achieve sustainable development: this is closely linked to the second strategic goal of the education sector, as illustrated below: Oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well- being and social and economic development worldwide. They are of particular importance to people living in coastal communities. Oceans provide livelihoods and tourist benefits, as well as a source of subsistence and income. It also helps regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding. The sustainable use, conservation and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems are essential for the achievement of the 2030 Plan, in particular for small island developing states. Education is important to enhancing awareness of the marine environment, moving towards marine agriculture and building a proactive consensus on wise and sustainable use. SDG15: Protection, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable forest management, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and halting loss of biodiversity: this is closely linked to the second strategic goal of the education sector, as illustrated below: Conservation of various wildlife forms requires specific efforts to protect and restore terrestrial and other ecosystems and promote their conservation and sustainable use. Goal 15 specifically focuses on sustainable forest management, restoration of degraded lands, successful desertification control, reduction of natural habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Various reports have emphasized the importance of education in raising awareness and changing beliefs, attitudes and behaviors towards environmental issues. Education is seen as a key element in efforts to promote more effective environmental management, including for protected areas. Reports on various challenges in this regard indicate that educational efforts are insufficient to engage key actors and stakeholders in integrating biodiversity issues into sectors outside environment. This is due to the weak relationship between higher levels of education and increased environmental attention, and to the inadequate use of traditional knowledge in Ministry of Education and Higher Education236 policies and environmental programs. Reports have provided several recommendations on environment and sustainable development in general, and the following areas were highlighted: Understanding biodiversity and its relationship to human well-being needs to be included in basic educational programs and promoted through public media. Reports pointed to the possibility of providing a broader share for the public and decision-makers to recognize the role and value of biodiversity, and that the steps necessary to preserve biodiversity can be done through education and more effective dissemination of scientific knowledge. The reports also called for supporting the development of new scientific research and educational and vocational skills for young students so that they can deal with global environmental challenges and sustainability. In its reports, UNESCO called for the promotion of new forms of international cooperation in science and education that are jointly organized to address the needs and practices of environmental change and sustainability. They also called for enhancing the skills of the related staff and developing national environmental information management systems. Education can be used to support the customary sustainable use of agriculture, aqua culture and forestry to achieve goal 7 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Reports also indicate that environmental degradation hampers people's capabilities in many ways and makes them go beyond income and livelihoods, reflecting impacts on health, education and other dimensions of well-being. It impedes the progress of education for disadvantaged children, especially girls. The World Trade Organization considers that \"increased reliance on natural resources is associated with lower levels of health and education\". Reports also indicate that environmental degradation hampers people's capabilities in many ways and makes them strive for income and livelihoods, therefore affecting health, education and other dimensions of well-being. Degradation further impedes the progress of education for disadvantaged children, especially girls. The World Trade Organization considers that \"increased reliance on natural resources is associated with lower levels of health and education\". SDG16: Encouraging the establishment of inclusive communities where no one is marginalized in order to achieve sustainable development, universal access to justice and building of effective and all-inclusive institutions that are subject to accountability at all levels. This is closely related to the first and second strategic goals of the education sector as described below: Peace, justice and the building of effective, accountable and all-inclusive institutions are at the heart of sustainable development. In recent decades, many regions have enjoyed increasing and sustained levels of peace and security. However, many countries continue to face armed conflicts and prolonged violent situations. Too many people face difficult situations as a result of weak institutions, lack of access to justice, access to information and other fundamental freedoms. Reports have indicated many links between education and inclusive societies. Education is widely seen as a tool to promote peace, justice and equality for sustainable development. Humanitarian agencies offer multiple possibilities, especially in education, to expand options for human capacities. Education is also recognized as being important to shaping values for future generations, reorienting priorities and social tendencies, and instilling empowerment skills Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022237 at an appropriate age. Moreover, education helps people understand and deepen democracy, promotes tolerance and the underlying trust, and motivates people to participate in political life. Education of girls and women in particular has an unparalleled transformation force by increasing their access to jobs, maintaining their good health and full participation in society. There are many links between education and inclusive societies: 1. Building resilience requires strengthening the capacity of individuals, communities and countries to address setbacks. 2. Crimes are directly related to unemployment and poverty at the local level, and decreases with family income and education. 3. Murder and armed violence often occur in poor urban areas characterized by a lack of employment, low standards of housing, overcrowding, low levels of education and social facilities. 4. Studies indicate a greater prevalence of physical violence by parents towards children in less educated, illiterate countries with low income. 5. Social and cultural norms in many countries exclude certain categories from education, including girls and young women in the first place. Exclusion in many occasions is also based on race, social class and disability. With regard to policy recommendations, UNESCO points to the need to advocate for education as a largely untapped strategic resource for building flexible and sustainable societies. The links between education and access to justice for all and peaceful societies need further study, programs and curricula to achieve these goals. On the other hand, reports indicate that democratic governments in general are more capable of achieving human development goals such as raising levels of education. Nevertheless, physical prosperity and good achievements in health and education can coexist with non-democratic practices. The same reports suggest that \"democracy may have the strongest impact on basic education, and that decentralization can have a strong impact on higher levels of education.\" They also warn that conflicts disrupt basic public services such as education and permanently harm people at all stages of their lives. Countries suffering from armed conflict have the world's worst indicators of education, and children in conflict-affected countries account for half of the world's children out of school. SDG17: Enhancing means of implementation and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. This is closely linked to the first, second and third strategic goals of the education sector as illustrated below: Achieving the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda requires the revitalization and strengthening of global partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors, and the mobilization of all available resources. Upholding support to the developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing states, is essential for the achievement of equitable progress for all. Many reports point to the relationship between education, the promotion of means of implementation and the revitalization of the global partnership for sustainable development. Ministry of Education and Higher Education238 Significant public investment in social infrastructure such as education is a prerequisite for effective sustainable development, and therefore an important component of sustainable development goals. Investment in education must occur in childhood and adolescence, and failure to invest at this stage is too costly to deal with later. Reports show that countries with higher spending on health and education were more resilient to financial crises. They also pointed out that the private sector has not shown real interest in investment in education at the global level, and most of the expenditure and investment came from governments. With regard to challenges and constraints, UNESCO reports that insufficient funding is one of the main obstacles to achieving education for all. UNESCO regrets the lack of adequate investment, finance or incentives in specific areas such as environment, sustainable development, and agricultural education and training. Several reports have discussed the challenges related to the role of the private sector in providing education. Policy recommendations in many areas call for increasing resources for the education sector, and note to the different ways in which these can be achieved: for countries with lower per capita GDP the focus should be on public investments that would yield long-term productivity gains, including improving the quality of the education system and the proportion of children completing basic and secondary education. The gap can be filled by increasing domestic revenue, dedicating an adequate share of government spending to education and increasing the concentration of foreign aid. Many educational systems can expand and improve the way to diversify sources of funding through households, fees, public-private partnerships, income-generating activities, donor support, etc. Meanwhile, governments, donors and international organizations must focus their priorities on the most vulnerable places and children. UNESCO's post-2015 framework reports recommend the inclusion of clear funding targets for education. The reports focus on the various priority groups that require enhanced access, including: 1) The most vulnerable children who are often not enrolled in education, such as children with disabilities, children in conflict areas or those who face barriers hampering their way to education, in addition to language, gender or poverty. 2) Agricultural education and training. 3) Unemployed workers in crisis areas. The second area of policy-making addresses how to mobilize the private sector to contribute to the provision of education. Public-private partnerships, expansion and improvement of post- basic education, and involvement of the private sector in technical and vocational training can be critical since the private sector is more involved in the most effective ways of linking skills with the labor market. Specific proposals were made for the agricultural sector and urban transport. Reports emphasize the need for communication with local community stakeholders in case of private investment in education.Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022XIII.

This affected its citizens, including students and teachers. The education sector has never been spared Israeli occupation oppressive practices. The restrictions imposed by the occupation authorities today culminate decades of oppression and repression. The education sector in Jerusalem mirrors the oppression and persecution which the Palestinian people there experience. The educational sector is negatively impacted by institutionalized discrimination and substandard infrastructure. The governmental \\ Waqf schools in Jerusalem have no regular restoration or maintenance despite their worn-out infrastructure. These practices and measures cause several problems such as classrooms overcrowding, instability of physical structure of schools and specialized facilities (labs, libraries). A large number of teachers and principals live outside the apartheid wall which makes their access to schools uneasy and disrupts their development effort. The political impacts on the education sector, obstruction of development efforts, changing and distorting of the Palestinian curricula, converting several school spaces into military outposts and breaking into schools at any given time makes it imperative to be aware of the legal aspects of the situation in Jerusalem to better understand the education sector. Israeli occupation practices have had negative effects on the whole of the Palestinian society in Jerusalem, including students and teachers. Our slogan is \"education for all \"while theirs is \"assaulting all\". This special section presents diagnosis and monitoring of the status of education in Jerusalem with the aim of showing the impact of the political situation on the education sector: Operating Authorities and Number of Schools and Students in Jerusalem: Owing to the very complicated situation in Jerusalem, the Palestinian education sector there is operated by several authorities. Coordination among these authorities is minimal to non- existent, resulting in major discrepancies in the quality of education children receive: 1. Waqf Schools: These schools, located within the directorate of Jerusalem, are administered by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education. There are (46) Waqf schools, absorbing (12420) students, representing (14%) of the total number of Jerusalemite students and teaching the Palestinian curricula. 2. Private Schools: These schools are administered by churches, charitable societies and individuals. Most of them are committed to the Palestinian educational programs and curricula. However, due to this commitment, they face a lot of pressure from the Israeli occupation authorities, especially since they receive some financing from these authorities in accordance with Israeli law. There are (82) private schools, absorbing (28722) students, representing (32.91%) of the total number of Jerusalemite students. 3. Municipal Schools: These schools are administered directly by the Israeli occupation education department and the Jerusalem Municipality. Israeli curricula and a heavily Ministry of Education and Higher Education244 censured version of the Palestinian curriculum are imposed on these schools. There are (65) municipal schools, absorbing (38220) students, representing (43.80%) of the total number of Jerusalem's students. 4. Contractors Schools: these schools are licensed by the Israeli Education Department. The Israeli Education Department sub-contracts associations or individuals to open classrooms in apartments as means to compensate for the shortage of schools and in return it covers the due expenses. Nevertheless, it hardly fulfills its obligations in relation to classrooms, standard specifications and employment of qualified teachers. There are (19) subcontracting schools, absorbing (6374) students, representing (7.30%) of the total number of Jerusalemite students. 5. UNRWA Schools: These schools are operated by UNRWA. They are committed to the Palestinian education program and curriculum. There are (7) UNRWA schools, absorbing (1541) students, representing (1.76%) of the total number of Jerusalemite students. Figure (3): The Palestinian Education Sector in Jerusalem: Percentage of students and authorities running these schools - 2015-2016. The status of the education sector in Jerusalem shall be discussed from two points: impacts of the Israeli occupation's violations and indicators of the monitoring and evaluation system in the schools operated by the Waqf Department. Impact of the Israeli Occupation Violations on the Palestinian Education Sector in Jerusalem There are many obstacles that leave their mark on the educational process in occupied territories due to violations by the Israeli occupation military and settlers. This is more clearly demonstrable in occupied Jerusalem: 1. Martyred, Injured and Detained Jerusalemite Students: Data of 2015-2016 reveal that (5) students were shot and killed; (32) were injured; (212) were retained in Israeli jails or put under home-arrest.

Figure (3): The Palestinian Education Sector in Jerusalem: Percentage of students and authorities running these Strategic Plan 2017-2022245 2. Impacts of the Apartheid Wall and Military Checkpoints: Jerusalemite students are forced to pass through (12) Israeli occupation checkpoints to reach their schools. These checkpoints are placed on the streets and main entrances of Jerusalem. They impede students and teachers' safe access to schools. Moreover, Israeli occupation forces also close Palestinian schools, inspect and affront Palestinian students and expropriate their bags; more than (500) classes were missed this year due to such measures, which also strike fear and horror among all students. Israeli policy of house demolitions under the pretext that they are built without permit or built on confiscated land or being owned by families of martyrs, overshadow the lives of Palestinian children. (24) students in (6) schools were affected by this policy. They were psychologically and socially affected according to counselors' reports. Their education achievement and academic behavior were also adversely affected. Figure (4): Percentage of Students affected by the apartheid wall (obstructing access to schools): 3. Israeli Violence against Students and Schools: Israeli violence against students The data of Jerusalem Directorate indicate that violence increased during 2015-2016 due to Israeli occupation violations. They show an increase in the incidents that have started since October 2015-2016. During the second semester in 2015-2016, (450) students from Waqf schools were subjected to Israeli occupation assaults, including shooting to kill under the pretext of ramming or stabbing incidents. Students were harshly beaten, subjected to tear gas, stun grenades and other physical and verbal attacks. Israeli violence against schools While Israeli violations against the Palestinian students continue, Palestinian schools weren't spared these violations. Several schools were exposed to brutal practices during the past year. Al-Uma Secondary School was stormed and (7) of its students were detained while (2) others were injured and placed under house-arrest. Israeli occupation forces attacked the Islamic Nahda School, in the Old City, using rubber- coated steel bullets, tear gas and stun grenades, causing injuries among students and teachers. They also beat a number of students with clubs. Other schools that were exposed to Israeli EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 -2022 228 The status of the education sector in Jerusalem shall be discussed from two points: impacts of the Israeli occupation's violations and indicators of the monitoring and evaluation system in the schools operated by the Waqf Department. Impact of the Israeli Occupation Violations on the Palestinian Education Sector in Jerusalem There are many obstacles that leave their mark on the educational process in occupied territories due to violations by the Israeli occupation military and settler s. This is more clearly demonstrable in occupied Jerusalem: 1. Martyred, Injured and Detained Jerusalemite Students: Data of 2015-2016 reveal that (5) students were shot and killed; (32) were injured; (212) were retained in Israeli jails or put under home-arrest. 2.

(24) students in (6) schools were affected by this policy. They were psychologically and socially affected according to counselors' reports. Their education achievement and academic behavior were also adversely affected. Figure (4): Percentage of Students affected by the apartheid wall (obstructing and Higher Education246 violence include: Muslim Youth School for Girls in Wadi Al-Jouz, which was stormed by Israeli forces under the pretext of searching for \"wanted\" persons; The Jabal Al-Mukaber School where the principal and school counselor were summoned by Israeli occupation authorities for questioning for honoring a mother of a martyr on the Mothers' Day, resulting in missing a total of (30) classes. Moreover, Israeli occupation authorities handed over full or partial demolition notices to six schools under the pretext that they are built without permits. Israeli police and border force also stormed Banat Omar Bin Abdul-Aziz School under the pretext that it hadn't paid property tax imposed by the Israeli occupation municipality. They seized computers and a printer and threatened to close the school. 4. Schools Buildings School buildings in Jerusalem aren't different from other shattered aspects of Palestinians' lives there. They suffer due to Israeli occupation practices and harsh laws related to building and maintenance of school facilities. 72% of school buildings administered by Waqf Department are subject to these laws that cause core problems and damage the educational process by prohibiting maintenance and or expansions. For example: The Education Directorate of Jerusalem data indicates a shortage of (2200) classrooms. Problems relating to school buildings include: 1) Dependence on renting or buying housing units to be converted into schools. The annual cost of rented schools is about ($892.824). 2) Most of school buildings were designed as housing units with small rooms. The average classroom size is about 20 sq.m. which is much less than international standards set for classrooms (48-50 sq.m.). 3) High classrooms density, especially in schools within the apartheid wall reaching (0.75 sq.m/ student). The international standard class space is 1.25 sq.m/student at the basic school stage and 1.5 sq.m at the secondary stage. 4) Shortage in school facilities: schools lack facilities (yards, playgrounds, science labs, computers, etc.) due to the small size of the rented buildings allowed. 5) Israeli occupation authorities threaten of demolish the following (5) schools: Al-Hassan Al- Thani, Al-Fatah \\ D, AlFatah \\G, Al-Thawri, Sharafat Al-Thanwya) (table 4). 6) High municipal taxes that exceeded NIS 100 million or $26.5 million. Israeli occupation municipality began to collect these taxes by confiscating schools' properties this year. 5. Student Dropout: 1) The phenomenon of students' dropouts in Jerusalem schools is different than in other schools because of the social, economic and housing situation Palestinians endure in Jerusalem. The figures released by the media concerning this phenomenon are inaccurate as they are released by multiple administrative and educational structures in the city. These bodies do not coordinate or communicate regarding this subject, in addition, the schools administered by the Israeli Education Department are hardly interested in addressing this problem. 2) PASSIA data indicate that 13% of East Jerusalem students drop out every year compared Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022247 with 1% of West Jerusalem students, divided as follows: 4.6% from Arab schools in 1948 occupied lands and 2.6% in Israeli schools. 3) The rate of dropouts among the Palestinian students in Jerusalem indicates that: the level of educational services is low, poor school absorption capacity and absence of quantitative and qualitative outputs, and home-arrest is a key cause of dropout in Arab Jerusalem schools. 4) Data shows that dropout in governmental schools in East Jerusalem is three times more than that in private schools. This might be attributed to the stress experienced by students and their families caused by the Israeli occupation policies, including House-demolition, checkpoints and other collective punishment measures. 6. Palestinian Curricula The Israeli occupation authorities constantly aim to erase the Palestinian identity in Jerusalem. They also do their utmost to change the reality of the city and fabricate its history and origin by censuring the Palestinian curricula and depriving Palestinian students of their right of access to their Palestinian curricula in its original form, as other Palestinian students. In addition, Israel has done everything possible to separate the Jerusalemite students from the rest of the Palestinian students. In implementing these policies, Israel has taken the following measures: 1) Censuring the Palestinian curricula by making omissions and adjustments in line with its colonial disposition and targets. 2) Prohibiting entry of Palestinian textbooks to Jerusalem schools mostly by force, pushing the education directorate to enter these books \"illegally\". 3) Notifying private schools which receive municipality aid of banning the Palestinian textbooks. 4) Threatening private schools' principals of harsh financial and administrative punishment if they use the Palestinian curricula. 5) Distributing the censured textbooks to the municipality and private schools free of charge whereas each package is sold for Jewish students for (NIS 1200-1500); an example of their political intentions towards Palestinian students in Jerusalem. 6) The repetitive terrorism acts exercised by the Israeli Ministry of Education and Israeli Intelligence Agency against some Palestinian members of the students' guardians committees aim to stop them from serving their schools and students. 7) Imposing Israeli curricula on the Palestinian schools that are subject to the Israeli education department or those licensed by it. It is worth noting that some of Beit Safafa (Palestinian village fully annexed in1967) schools teach the Israeli curricula while others teach the Palestinian curricula as the first part of the town was occupied in 1948 and the other in 1967. Ministry of Education and Higher Education248 7. Education Supervision and Rehabilitation: Major Challenges Facing Education Supervision in Jerusalem: 1) Shortage of supervisors in the Directorate of Jerusalem in comparison with the number of teachers and disciplines in the Waqf and private schools; with only (25 supervisors) to oversee (2532 teachers). This rate represents 0.9% when it should be no less than 1.3% - 80 teachers per a supervisor - clearly indicating the need for at least 6 supervisor posts. 2) Municipal and Israeli education department schools are hardly having access to education supervisors. 8. Shortage of Scientific Majors and Teaching Applications 1) A severe shortage of all educational majors, especially among males. Job-seekers feel hesitant to apply for the teaching profession due to the following reasons: 2) Low wages compared with the living standards in Jerusalem. The basic salary of a new teacher with a BA or MA degree is (NIS 1700, $445) while a similar position with a BA degree at the municipality schools is (NIS 5582) and (NIS 5891) for an employee with MA. In addition, teachers who work with the municipality schools receive bonus payments two times more than other teachers (travel or spouse bonuses) who also work in Jerusalem. 3) Inequality between contracted teachers and appointed ones with regard to bonus payments. This kind of inequality prompts many teachers to quit. 4) The number of applicants for teaching positions were 164 females and 7 males. 9. General Secondary Examination Like other education directorates in Palestine, the Directorate of Jerusalem has more students enrolled in the humanities and scientific streams at the expense of commerce, industry and hotels streams. That could be attributed to the shortage of vocational schools that meet the needs of the labor market as well as to the poor counseling services offered. Obstacles posed by the Israeli occupation to the general secondary examination: 1) Preparing general secondary examination rooms depends, to a large extent, on the municipality schools due to their size. They absorb about 50% of the total number of the exam's eligible students in Jerusalem. This situation presents many challenges and obstacles. 2) Shortage of observers during the exam hinder the course of the general secondary examination. The directorate is obliged to resort to job applicants to observe because the Israeli occupation authorities hardly give permits to teachers from other directorates to enter Jerusalem to do the job. 3) Approval for the \"spring holiday\" by Israeli Ministry of Education every March requires that the MoEHE to postpone the second secondary class holiday until the end of the school year. This presents conflict with dates set for the official general secondary examination in Palestine (Tawjihi/Injaz). Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2022249 Facing these challenges Key strengths: 1) Positive general attitude of the people of Jerusalem towards keeping the Arabic education system since 1967 despite the measures taken by the Israeli education department. 2) Keeping the general secondary examination (Tawjihi) in accordance with the Palestinian education system in all schools, including those operated by the Israeli education department. 3) Jerusalemite families interest in education. Although struggling to teach their children, they are tenacious in preserving their Palestinian rights to their education. Some of them file complaints with the judiciary against the Israeli education department and municipality for disregarding the right of the Palestinian children to education exemplified by the Israeli actions of freezing schools' construction. 4) Legal protection provided by the government of Jordan for the Waqf schools increases the schools' absorption capacities through the financial support of the Islamic Bank. The money is used for Development and in improving schools' infrastructure through coordination with Queen Rania's Initiative \"Madrasati Falasteen\" (Palestine is my school). 5) The Palestinian National Authority's interest and care for Jerusalem materializes through training courses held by the PNA for teachers working in Jerusalem; 10262 hours of training were conducted in 2954 days. 6) Provision in-kind assistance by the PNA for schools (computers, furniture, labs instruments). 7) Guardians Committees', which is an honorary position, work to preserve the Palestinian curricula included leading legal and civil battles to prohibit teaching censured textbooks at the Palestinian schools in Jerusalem. 8) The decision of the MoEHE to supply basic and secondary schools in Jerusalem with Palestinian textbooks free of charge. 9) The decision of MoEHE to print textbooks in Jerusalem in order to bypass the Israeli occupation checkpoints hence schools have easier access to the books. 10) The decision of MoEHE to present Jerusalemite students with scholarships. 10% of the scholarships presented by sister and friend states to the ministry are allocated to students attended Jerusalem schools and earned the Tawjihi certificate. 11) The campaign launched by MoEHE \"our duty to support Jerusalem old city students\". They are exempted from 50% of university fees at al-Quds University. 12) Lobbying for justice: Meetings held between MoEHE and diplomatic missions to expose Israeli occupation assaults on the education sector in Jerusalem. These meetings aim to apply pressure on Israel to stop its oppressive measures against the Arab education system in Jerusalem. 13) New general secondary system approved by MoEHE to rescue Jerusalemite students from the Israeli organizations which promote the Israeli general secondary examination (BAGROUT) to recruit Palestinian students. Ministry of Education and Higher Education250 14) Training courses conducted by MoEHE on the new curricula. These training courses include municipality and private schools in Jerusalem. 15) Support provided by Arab organizations for Jerusalem schools (Al-Quds Fund Agency of Morocco, Islamic Development Bank, Queen Rania Initiative (Madrasati Falasteen), Welfare Association (Taawon), Faisal al-Husseini Foundation and other local and Arab organizations). Needs of the education sector in Jerusalem 1) Buying and rehabilitating new buildings to be converted into schools (100 classrooms in the suburbs of Sharafat, Wadi 15 schools annually at the cost of $90,000 for each building. 3) Contracting engineering and consultation firms to solve problems related to Israeli fines (5 schools at the cost of $55,000 for each school). 4) Ensuring financial support for the private schools to secure educational needs and enable them to get rid of Israeli occupation dictations. Israel uses its financial support ($900 per student, $26 million per year) for these schools as a means to subject them to its system. 5) Digitalizing the education system including the administrative aspect: a. Providing licensed programs for Jerusalem Directorate ($250,000). b. Providing financial support to maintain schools' administrative and educational systems at an annual cost of ($25.000). This service doesn't target other education directorates in the West Bank. c. Facilitating communications with the directorate and schools by renewing the directorate's operator at an estimated cost of $15000. 6) Leasing means of transport for remote schools to increase enrollment and reduce dropout rates at these schools. 7) Employing (25) teachers of Hebrew as a second compulsory foreign language at an average of 2 classes per week for all classes (4-10). 8) Providing furniture to replace damaged fixture; (5% of the total number of students in Waqf and private schools) with (20571) units (chairs and tables). 9) Rehabilitating and training teachers working with the municipality and private schools on assessment, evaluation, discipline and new teacher qualification strategies. 10) Supporting related education at schools subject to Israeli violations. 11) Ensuring scholarships for general secondary students to continue their education at universities.
