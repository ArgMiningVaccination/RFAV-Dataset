The following items appeared in Counseling Today between 2001 and 2010: n ACA establishes a \"new professional\" membership category, with the goal of making association membership more affordable for recent graduates just starting out in the counseling profession. (February 2001) n By a unanimous vote of the Governing Council, the Association for Creativity in Counseling becomes the newest division of ACA. The purpose of ACC is to create a forum for counselor educators and practitioners to explore creative means of facilitating relational movement and therapeutic change within a counseling setting. (October 2004) n The 2005 ACA Code of Ethics is released after a years-long revision process. The updated code puts emphasis on multicultural and diversity issues facing counselors, addresses a paradigm shift concerning dual or multiple relationships, adds a section discussing end-of-life care for terminally ill clients and broadens ethical use of technology in research, record keeping and provision of services to clients. (October 2005) n ACA is one of only six organizations to receive a Summit Award in the Associations Advance America Awards program for its Hurricane Katrina relief effort, which included issuing a call to its 43,000 members to provide disaster mental health services in the Gulf Coast region. ACA sent 20 percent of the total number of deployed mental health counselors to the Gulf Coast after the devastating hurricanes of 2005. (July and August 2006) n Delegates to 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling, an initiative spearheaded by ACA and the American Association of State Counseling Boards, release Principles for Unifying and Strengthening the Profession, a document that identifies seven principles critical to moving the counseling profession forward. Among the principles are sharing a common professional identity and creating a portability system for counselor licensure. (November 2008) n The counseling profession realizes a historic victory more than 30 years in the making when California becomes the 50th and final state to license counselors as master's-degreed mental health professionals. Virginia was the first state to enact counselor licensure in 1976. (November 2009) n The 20/20 delegation, representing more than 30 organizations with an interest in counseling, reaches a consensus definition of counseling: Counseling is a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, education and career goals.

With such disparate, unstandardized licensure requirements, it has become a challenge to achieve three critical professional issues: a) licensure portability, b) unification of the counseling profession and c) convincing insurance and governmental entities that all counselors from different states are equivalently trained for clinical practice. ACA is a membership organization, and we advocate for employment opportunities for all of our members. Our position is that states determine a counselor's required level of qualification for licensure or certification \u2014 regardless of how diverse those requirements have become. Recently, the U.S. government has created a great deal of concern and consternation for many counselors and counselors-in-training. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have made decisions that place counselor education and training provisions into regulations that are at the high end of the qualification continuum. These regulations also are likely to soon influence proposed Medicare laws and regulations that would allow counselors to provide mental health services independently. In 2005, to address the license portability and professional identity issues, and in anticipation of the federal standards issue, ACA and the American Association of State Counseling Boards initiated 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling, a consortium of 31 counseling organizations charged with charting a course for the profession. The organizations participating in 20/20 have already reached consensus on seven Continued on page 90My travels recently took me to Malaysia, a beautiful country with an incredibly diverse culture and perhaps the happiest, most resilient and fun-loving people I have ever had the privilege of meeting. As I learned about the status of counseling and how it has evolved there over the past 20 years, I felt like I had fallen through the looking glass and emerged from the rabbit hole into an upside-down world. You see, in Malaysia there is no licensure for psychologists or social workers \u2014 only for counselors. The Malaysian government passed the 1997 Counsellors Act, a title and practice act for professional counselors, to help address mental health and other societal issues. Given that I was a counselor and advocate who helped fight the licensure and assessment wars in the United States, imagine my surprise when psychologists approached me to solicit support for psychology licensure in Malaysia! I politely declined. Malaysia's top-down, national counselor law accomplished in one fell swoop what it took us more than 30 years to accomplish in the United States \u2014 licensure in every state. I was more than a bit envious. The experience made me reflect on the continuing struggles we are encountering at home. In the United States, it is each state's right and responsibility to determine how best to protect the public through licensure regulations. The American Counseling Association championed counselor licensure initiatives in all 50 states, plus U.S. territories, and finally made this goal a reality within the past few years. But several unintended consequences have resulted, including widely varying licensure requirements \u2014 36-60 graduate credits, 1,500-4,500 training hours December 2012 | Counseling Today | 5CounselingToday From The President Bradley T.

Elmore, PhD Professor Emerita, Educational Measurement and Statistics Southern Illinois University Carbondale Visit counseling.org/publications for information on examination ACA Member out our yearlong celebration of ACA's 60th anniversary, I want to share some meaningful moments that took place along the way. I was fortunate to meet up with Robert Shaffer, ACA's very first president. Well into his 90s, Bob was easily able to recall the years that led up to ACA's founding, who played roles in the association's creation and what challenges he faced as our president in 1952-1953. Then there was a decision by Brooke Collison (ACA president in 1987-1988) to return to the classroom, but this time as a visiting professor in Kenya. He and his lovely wife Joan chose to reach out and share their knowledge, compassion and caring with stu-dents and communities halfway around the world. Brooke has been blogging for ACA about his experience at my.counseling.org. Interacting with these two individuals reminds us that life not only goes on after you serve as ACA president but that it looks significantly better as well! You should know that many of ACA's past presidents have gone on to serve the profession with distinction and their communities with great compassion. ACA is better because of our 60 past presidents. One milestone of note during this anniversary year is that our membership increased each and every month. We now stand at more than 52,000 members and continue progressing toward our all-time high membership total (around 58,000 individuals back in 1991). I thank all of you for our growth. During this 60th anniversary year, we also grew to eight professional counselors on staff. These fellow ACA members have made the commitment to work full time on behalf of the profession, and I am so pleased that they did. I believe their service in the areas of professional development, career consultation, research and public policy advocacy enhances what we do for members.Although I don't know what we will look like in another 60 years, I can tell you that 2013 will feature institutional growth, enhanced advocacy and services that are the result of your input. One example is that next month, we will launch a significantly improved ACA website. Our goal is to deliver the content you want in an easy-to- use and responsive format. Let me know what you think. Have you registered for the ACA 2013 Conference & Expo in Cincinnati from March 20-24? The Super Saver discount deadline is Dec. 15! This event includes more than 400 education sessions and will again feature our pre-conference learning institutes (which require separate registration) and more than 100 exhibit booths. Our keynote speakers will be actress and advocate Ashley Judd and counselor luminaries Allen Ivey and Mary Bradford Ivey. This is one professional conference you absolutely want to attend. As the year ends, I call your attention to those in need. At the professional level, I encourage you to consider a year-end donation to the ACA Foundation (see the announcement on page 45). Chaired this year by Courtland Lee, the ACA Foundation has been instrumental in assisting graduate students, providing help to \"our own\" in the form of the Counselors Care Fund and supporting ACA through the years. I know the ACA Foundation would appreciate your consideration, so please visit acafoundation. org and give generously. I also want to express my thanks for the 60 years of work that ACA members have done for their clients and students. You and those who came before you are what make this profession so special. The entire ACA staff wishes a 2013 full of peace, hope and pros- perity for you and for those whom you serve. As always, I look forward to your comments, questions and thoughts.

Executive Director's message Richard YepThe anniversary is over, but the celebration continues 8 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Judd isn't just playing another role when depicting depression I appreciated your preview of the upcoming American Counseling Association Conference and its keynote speakers (\"ACA keynote speakers view counseling process from different angles,\" October 2012) and was especially absorbed by the account of Ashley Judd's longtime battle with depression. I was extremely surprised, however, that the article never mentioned her title role in the 2009 film Helen, which depicts, with searing intensity, the impact of depression on one woman and her family. I highly recommend the film. When I saw it, it struck me as exceptionally realistic \u2014 and the article has helped me understand why, in fact, it is. Since learning from your article about Judd's real-life struggle, I am all the more impressed by her courage in undertaking a part that portrays the deepest abysses of clinical depression, as well as the possibility of recovery. Lauren Goodsmith Baltimore Pros and cons of home-based counseling need to be highlighted One of the concerns I have about the article on home-based counseling (\"Home is where the client is,\" September 2012) is the lack of attention to confidentiality. Living rooms and kitchens are open areas to other family members. Ideally, an office or other room with a closing door should be used when talking to individuals. For obvious reasons, caution should be used when counseling children whose parents are present when those parents are at risk of losing custody. Often, the parent is at risk of losing custody because of abuse or neglect to the child. In such circumstances, the child is sometimes coached, and the presence of a parent could negatively impact the veracity of the child's report. I do feel it is important for the counselor to do a home visit before making custody recommendations. As far as doing intakes in public locations such as libraries or laundromats (as one counselor acknowledged), I would think that would violate the ACA Code of Ethics' Standard B.3.c., Confidential Settings: \"Counselors discuss confidential information only in settings in which they can reasonably ensure client privacy.\" I believe the article should have paid more attention to confidentiality, safety and other concerns about counseling in the client's home. I am not saying it shouldn't be done, but rather that the cons as well as the pros should be considered. K. Joe Heard, LPC, CCMHC, CFMHE Benton, Ark. kjoeheard@sbcglobal.net kjoeheard.com uLetters December 2012 | Counseling Today | 9 Washington Update - By Scott Barstow & Jessica Eagle Counselors across the country are trying to become certified under new requirements for participation in TRICARE, the health care program operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) for active-duty military personnel, dependents and retirees. In some cases, the process appears to be working, but many counselors are running into problems. This is bad news both for counselors and for TRICARE beneficiaries, who need better access to mental health services. DoD's rules state that during a transition period lasting through the end of 2014, counselors can become certified for TRICARE if they have a counseling degree from a regionally accredited program, pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE), are licensed and meet supervision requirements. (During the transition period, counselors with a degree from a program accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs can be certified if they have passed either the NCMHCE or the National Counselor Examination.) Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, counselors will only be certified for TRICARE participation if they have a counseling degree from a CACREP-accredited program, pass the NCMHCE and meet supervision requirements. Many counselors are having problems with the supervision requirements. TRICARE is requiring two years/3,000 hours of post-master's supervised experience, obtained from a licensed professional counselor. Because counseling is a relatively young mental health profession, many state licensure laws recognize supervision hours conducted under the supervision of a psychologist, psychiatrist or clinical social worker. Consequently, many counselors would not meet the supervision requirements as specified in DoD's interim final rule. More problematic than the supervision requirements, however, is that some counselors are being told they will not be certified now if they do not meet the 2015 requirements (degree from a CACREP-accredited program and passage of the NCMHCE) because TRICARE won't recognize them after the transition period ends. The American Counseling Association has written the DoD asking that it clarify to TRICARE contractors and administrators that counselors meeting the transition period requirements will continue to be recognized as providers in 2015 and beyond. In addition, the letter asks that TRICARE allow counselors to become certified if they meet the education criteria by the end of 2014 but complete the examination and supervision requirements later. ACA's letter, which is posted at counseling.org/publicpolicy, also encourages TRICARE to recognize all supervision hours accepted by the individual counselor's state licensure board. If you have questions, comments or information about TRICARE certification of counselors, contact Scott Barstow with ACA at sbarstow@counseling.org or 800.347.6647 ext. 234. ACA stepping up coalition work on education issues ACA has increased its participation in coalition efforts supporting education funding and improved student outcomes. In October, ACA attended the Committee for Education Funding (CEF) Gala, where speakers including Education Secretary Arne Duncan addressed a packed room of educators and education interest group representatives. CEF presented Rep. Todd Platts (R-Pa.), Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) with awards recognizing their dedicated work to improve education funding and policies at the federal level. Since 2010, ACA has been a partner and supporter of the College Board National Office for School Counselor Advocacy (NOSCA) \"Own the T urf\" campaign. NOSCA recently released its second national survey, which takes the pulse of the school counseling profession. The first national survey in 2011, \"Counseling at a Crossroads,\" found that school counselors were at a point at which they could either become central to student academic achievement in schools or remain on the sidelines as new education efforts ramped up. The 2012 national survey, \"T rue North: Charting the Course to College and Career Readiness,\" provides powerful evidence that school counselors and their administrators know how to plot the course of their students' college and career success. However, significant barriers stand in the way of real progress. The survey identifies barriers such as a lack of focus, training, accountability and resources for counselors, but says that school districts, university programs, public policy and professional organizations can help to overcome these barriers. To read the report, go to counseling. org/publicpolicy. If you have any thoughts on the survey, or input for ACA's School Counseling Task Force, email Jessica Eagle in ACA's public policy office at jeagle@counseling.org. Finally, ACA has joined the America's Promise Alliance, founded by Gen. Colin Powell. The alliance is the nation's largest partnership of businesses, nonprofits and other organizations dedicated to 1) ensuring that children get the support they need to succeed, 2) slashing high school dropout rates and 3) helping students graduate ready for college and the 21st-century workforce. Alliance members agree to support \"Five Promises\" for young people: caring adults, safe places, a healthy start, effective education and opportunities to help others. School counselors are a critical component of this work, and ACA will be promoting school counseling's role to its partners in the America's Promise Alliance. In February, ACA will attend the alliance's Grad Nation Summit, which will focus on successful local, state and national education initiatives. uACA asks TRICARE to clarify, adjust counselor certificationThis is the second article in a three-part series of advocacy stories from the professional school counseling field.

Mainzer, Arts & T echnology High School in New York City As a counselor, and specifically a school counselor, I help people realize their potential. Different clients need different advocacy. Sometimes the need is obvious. For example, I had a young person who was transitioning between genders. Advocating for that client meant accepting successive name changes, being an active liaison with the student's teachers, researching sample policies (and sharing those policies with school administration) to ensure gender-neutral facilities and helping staff to recognize the right of the student to dress in accord with the gender with which the student now identified. Such efforts are never \"one shot,\" however. Each year, these issues must be revisited. Other times, the needs are not immediately visible. For example, in a past year, two graduating seniors represented different aspects of advocacy. One young man was confronting adulthood with severe physical challenges in addition to a learning disability. Advocacy meant helping him connect with adult transition services that would lead him to a meaningful career and urging the school to recognize his postsecondary success even though he was not going straight to college. Another young man was planning to go directly to college, but he was at risk for being mismatched with a large local institution where he was likely to get lost in the crowd. To me, he seemed like a kid who could maximize his potential at a smaller school with greater expectations. Advocacy with him meant long sessions after school supportively critiquing his plans and assisting him with the mechanics of college and financial aid applications. Sometimes it takes awhile to know whether you've made the difference you believe is possible. Several years ago, I had another student who was part of the first generation in his family to be college bound. After four and a half years, he was eligible to graduate high school, but he wasn't ready. He decided to stay on for another semester to complete an Advanced Placement (AP) course I was offering. (Since that time, all AP funding at my school has been cut.) After graduation, he went on to a community college. This past year, he reappeared in my office, and although it was late in the application season, he announced his determination to transfer to a four-year school upstate. Shortly thereafter, he appeared unannounced in my office again to inform me he was enrolled! When I asked him about his family's response, I learned I was the only person he had told thus far. Being a school counselor is a tremendous challenge, but it is also a tremendous opportunity. Ultimately, our students give us a tremendous amount to build on and to celebrate. An innovative approach to tackling truancy Submitted by Brandie Oliver, school counselor educator at Butler University In fall 2011, one of our school counseling graduate students whose father works for the Marion County Prosecutor's Office (MCPO) approached me to discuss Butler University's school counseling program getting involved in a partnership to address school truancy. The MCPO wanted to try an innovative approach that was proactive and supportive rather than punitive. After meeting a few times, we entered into a partnership to offer a parenting/student group as part of a diversion agreement that the MCPO would offer. The MCPO initially reached out to our school counseling program because it believes an education is one of the best crime prevention tactics available. The MCPO publicly announced that it would begin filing charges in criminal court against parents who neglected to send their children to school. However, the purpose of the initiative is not to target parents who are facing difficult personal circumstances, but rather to keep kids in school and connect parents to the resources they need. Butler provides support and guidance by bridging the gap between the legal system and the needs of the family. Butler's role is to provide groups for the parents and the students. We also have started conducting prescreenings prior to court hearings to better understand the unique nature and needs of each family. We have come to understand that not all families need or would benefit from the parenting group. For example, after meeting with one family, we determined that their child might need to be assessed for special education. In another case, a father had died recently and the son was now struggling greatly with school, so we referred the family to a free grief counseling youth support group in the area. A third family shared that their son had been the target of bullying, and the family did not feel comfortable talking with the school. As these examples demonstrate, the initial court screenings have allowed us to tailor recommendations and truly advocate for what is in the best interests of these families.Edward A. Mainzer School counselors making a difference 10 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Counselor, Educator, Advocate - With Jessica EagleThis past spring, we facilitated our first parenting group and student group. We learned a lot from this pilot group and will be starting our second session shortly. This group gives parents and students a voice. At the same time, Butler's school counseling students are getting invaluable, real-life, hands-on experience. We can teach advocacy, but this project demonstrates advocacy. I believe advocacy takes on many faces. This program is a great example of community-university partnership to advocate for families that many times are overlooked and left without a voice. My students have grown and developed incredible amounts of empathy after participating in this program, which we hope to continue expanding. The target population for this initiative is a difficult group. We have learned that these parents do not trust educators. Most of the parents have expressed that they do not contact their children's schools because they have been ignored or had poor educational experiences themselves. Attendance for parents at the group has been a challenge, but we hope this next session will be better. We also needed a translator for one of our families and did not allow enough time for translation and the activities that we were trying to cover. Along the way, we learned some very valuable lessons from the pilot group. I believe my students truly grew in their multicultural competence as counselors, both from the group and the court screenings. We debriefed and processed throughout, and many stereotypes have been debunked. Butler's school counseling graduate students have utilized their leadership skills, reflection skills, listening skills and flexibility \u2014 From left, Brandie Oliver and Butler school counseling graduate students Laura Rasche, Karen Bushouse, Kristen Raves and Megan Vawter.all of which are valuable and necessary components to take into the profession. Karen Bushouse, a third-year school counseling graduate student, spoke to the growth she saw in herself: \"I have to honestly say that while I didn't consider myself to be judgmental prior to starting the parenting group, I found that I had begun to guess what might have brought these parents to the point of having to attend court-mandated parenting sessions. I found that my assumptions were far from the truth in their stories. In listening to their experiences, I saw dedication to their children and their children's education, a willingness to learn and a desire to be a better parent. Their stories showed how so many of our schools aren't setting up students for success, which was simultaneously frustrating and empowering. There is much work yet to be done in our schools. I am proud to be a part of a program that is serving the community in this way and, further, I'm proud that this program is producing effective professional school counselors who can make the systemic changes that are needed in our schools today.\" u December 2012 | Counseling Today | 11 Jessica Eagle, a certified school counselor and national certified counselor, works in the American Counseling Association's public policy and legislation office. Contact her at jeagle@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org 12 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012 Letting Client be my guide: The mirror never lies Leading up to a two-week vacation this past July, I reveled in the thought that T rip of a Lifetime to Paris would bring two-for-one benefits. In addition to family fun exploring a place we had never visited, crossing the Atlantic would give me an excuse to escape electronically \u2014 and emotionally. No emails, phone calls or contact of any kind with Home was feasible during a fortnight of glorious alone time with Nuclear Unit. Better yet, the communication blackout would allow me to be fully present to Loved Ones, as well as to the sights, sounds, tastes, touches and smells of Europe's City of Light. I let go of my self-imposed obligation to dwell on Work, reasoning that I couldn't offer much assistance from a hemisphere away. (Of course, I had prepared Client One-and-All for my absence, providing appropriate resources should the need arise.) So, when the time came to return to Workaday World, flagging self-confidence in my professional competence, coupled with a sense of dread, baffled me. Shouldn't I be renewed, relaxed, rejuvenated and raring to go? My heart wasn't in the work, for I had left it behind in \"Gay Paree.\" First day back to work, First-Ever Client slumped in the threadbare chair across from mine. \"I've been struggling with something and wasn't sure if I should even bring it up,\" he said. Impersonating Competent Therapist, I encouraged him to share despite his reservations. \"I feel like you're never there when I need you.\" He sighed, wincing as he said so. I wanted to wince too, but thought better of it. We had been partners in his healing journey for more than two and a half years, during which he had displayed what appeared to be significant progress. Now this? Ouch. Next Client: \"I've had a lot of time to think since you've been away. I realized I've been working with you for a year and a half, and after all that time, I'm still having blowups and feeling depressed. Shouldn't I be feeling better by now? Maybe what we're doing isn't helping me.\" Boo-boo No. 2. On to Client No. 3. Our session began with a check-in regarding his intention to seek a psychiatric eval for meds. We had discussed this at length as an appropriate adjunct to talk therapy, given his intense symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Ultimately, Third Client had agreed to call a few of the psychiatrists on the agency's referral list while I was away to schedule a consult, without necessarily committing to treatment. \"I didn't do it,\" he said. \"I just didn't have any time. Things have been really hectic.\" Yah, RIGHT. Aaaaaargh! Once again, impersonating Competent Therapist, I regained composure and \"explored\" for the source of resistance, though I already knew from several past voyages through this agonizingly familiar terrain that Client's OCD was the likely culprit. His tendency to obsess about negative outcomes paralyzed him. \"What if there are side effects, or it doesn't work?\" The two of us had been going round and round about this for weeks. I had assumed I would return to the news it finally was a done deal. NOT. Strike Three. Yeeeeeer Out! Had I been a baseball player whiffing at home plate, Ump would be jerking his thumb downward toward the turf instead of over his shoulder. I'm just not good enough. What's the emotional equivalent of a Band-Aid? I am gushing blood here! When I broached the subject with Supervisor, she tsk'd at me, as a beloved auntie might do, pulling a wailing child to an ample, aproned bosom. I needed someone, anyone, to reassure me: \"There, there. Everything's going to be all right.\" As Competent Supervisor should, she \"explored.\" Though the expedition involved neither Band-Aids nor Bosoms, it did soothe my wounded ego. \"It's not you, per se. It's your mirrors,\" she offered. Um. Okaaaaaay. Nonplussed, Supervisor elaborated. \"You have been telling yourself you're looking at your clients, when what you're really doing \u2014 at least in part \u2014 is seeing your own reflection in each of them. Your clients are mirroring your diminished self-confidence. Use these thoughts and feelings as a lesson \u2014 for you and for them. And by the way,\" Supervisor added, \"it's natural to return after some time away and feel off your game. Give yourself a chance to get up to speed.\" First Gear: Reality check. Client plagued by OCD had mirrored my tendency to focus on the negative. It had been equally true on my first day back that Clients 4, 5 and 6 had reported breakthroughs in my absence, progress each had attributed to insights and coping tools gleaned in counseling. As for the complaints expressed by Clients 1, 2 and 3, those could be traced at least partially to transference issues. In fact, First-Ever Client had stated as much, following up his condemnation with an admission of what he described Learning Curve: Notes from a novice - By Suze Hirsh Coming in February! ACA Webinar series on depression Watch your inbox for more information. counseling.org/Resources/Webinars.aspx December 2012 | Counseling Today | 13 as co-dependence. \"I was having a few 'I-want-my-Mommy' moments. You're my only support system,\" he said. In fact, while I was away, Client had met a primary treatment goal of reconnecting with his estranged adult children. Unfortunately, that had come as a result of a medical crisis. The irony of this mirror was no longer lost to me. Client had discounted an undeniable positive: He had failed to notice that his support network had quadrupled, with three supportive grown-up Offspring rallying around his hospital bed. Picking up speed, I shifted into Second Gear, a variation of the time-honored grade school assignment, \"What I Learned on My Summer Vacation.\" Family had begun the trip with World's Worst Tour Guide Ever. Or at least France's Worst Tour Guide Ever. Despite my efforts to kick-start this guy, he subjected T ravel-Weary Family to an hour and a half of utter silence. Except for when he turned to Husband to comment with a sharp edge in his voice, \"Your wife asks difficult questions.\" I fumed. Husband dismissed Recalcitrant Tour Guide less than halfway through the scheduled time, sending him packing with a generous tip and the polite excuse that we were too pooped to continue. I was more pissed than pooped (excuse my French). What helped me recoup was another peek into the looking glass. But not until I had walked the block around our hotel, alternately punching the air and crying. Tear ducts sufficiently drained, it now was clear that, often, I have been my own Worst Tour Guide Ever. In the journey of my life, I have been the type who chooses the dusty smell of grindstones over the sweet perfume of roses. Roses! The very blossoms, which to my delight, were in abundant supply in the gardens of Versailles, our destination the following day. With Replacement Tour Guide. One who met our expectations as both charming and chatty. Ohhhhh. That's what Supervisor meant when she described the healing power of mirrors. And damned if there isn't a hall full of those at Versailles too. At this point, I found myself finally grinding into Third, whereby I picked up enough speed to integrate these European-born epiphanies in service to Client. While transference accounts for a percentage of Client gripes, it is equally valid that shifting gears and taking a detour in treatment strategy is necessary now and again. There's the mirror once more. Touch\u00e9, Client No. 2. It was becoming easier now to open my eyes to unblemished reality only because I had stopped taking Client's point personally and started taking it to heart instead. T raveling the same route when it's not getting you closer to your destination makes no sense. Reset the Sat-Nav (as the Europeans call it) and Pedal to the Metal. There's no denying that by virtue of the job, Counselor is trained to view Client through a humanistic lens. Too often, I forget to observe my reflection in this way when meeting my own gaze in the mirror. What I Learned on My Summer Vacation is this: When I allow myself to see my own face \u2014 warts and all \u2014 what I initially regard as ugly is in truth a beautiful gift. A catalyst for change. Or at the very least, motivation to make an appointment with Dermatologist. All joking aside, the poet John Keats expresses it with elegant simplicity: \"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty, \u2014 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'\" Even if the truth hurts. Especially when it hurts. I will remember that the next time I'm having a bad hair day. u Suze Hirsh completed her postgrad internship in mental health counseling at a not-for-profit community services agency in Florida.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org 14 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012 The continuing evolution of 'great' counselingThrough a Glass Darkly - By Shannon Hodges Now, here's what I tell Borderlines. I say, 'You have a personality disorder. You've had a lot of difficulty maintaining relationships due to emotional lability. It's likely you will repeat this dynamic in therapy, and at some point you will probably fire me and move to the next therapist.'\" I sat back in shock, scarcely able to believe that this Ivy League-educated psychiatrist and clearly learned clinician would seriously contemplate such articulation to his patients. But he was serious. Even more egregious was the enthusiastic applause of the audience, heads wagging like submissive puppies. My inclination was to challenge the presenter, but I lacked the moral courage. There has long been much disagreement regarding what makes \"great\" therapy. Sigmund Freud hypothesized that the primary value lay in the transference-countertransference dynamic between the patient and analyst. He believed that patients would project unconscious conflicts, wishes and desires from early childhood onto the analyst, and the analyst would project back. Somewhere within this transaction, therapy occurred. Freud's famous students, Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, broke with their mentor over unconscious desires and conflicts and created radically different schools. Adler focused on the conscious and elevated sibling relationships over parental ones. Jung's approach involved depth psychology, though with a metaphorical, as opposed to deterministic, focus. A thumbnail sketch of counseling John B. Watson and B.F . Skinner's behavioral approach emerged later with the therapist/patient deemphasized and replaced by a comprehensive system of rewards to reinforce desired behaviors. The existential and humanistic focus of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers became popular in the 1940s, and Rogers' epic work On Becoming a Person continues to sell more than 50 years later. Rogers and Maslow viewed the therapist/ client relationship as paramount, and in contrast to previous approaches, techniques were few. Rogers believed good counseling involved a therapist in a state of personal congruence, being genuine and empathetic and extending unconditional positive regard toward the client. His famous session with \"Gloria\" exemplified this approach and was a watershed moment for person- centered therapy. A bit later, Albert Ellis developed rational emotional therapy (later rational emotive behavior therapy, REBT), based on rational thoughts and behavior, and assigned clients homework to challenge their fears and anxieties. Aaron Beck developed cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which is similar to REBT but with nuanced differences. Beck's CBT and Ellis' REBT vary from traditional behaviorism in their emphasis on cognitions over behavior and in valuing the therapeutic alliance. These therapies have also emerged as possibly the most efficacious approaches (although some dispute this). In the postmodern era, a plethora of popular counseling approaches have emerged. Solution-focused and narrative therapy are separate though somewhat related therapies. Both are relatively easy to learn and implement, and each is respectful of cultural influences. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) have proved effective for clients recovering from trauma and are growing rapidly. Marsha Linehan developed DBT and has made it the treatment of choice for clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Barry Duncan, Scott Miller, Bruce Wampold and Mark Hubble have asserted a \"common factors\" theory, positing the therapist/client alliance as the most critical factor to successful outcomes. Multicultural- and feminist- oriented approaches have also emerged and been integrated into established therapies. An informal survey across borders So, what are contemporary counselors to make of these numerous and, in some cases, distinctly different theoretical approaches to counseling? In my 14 years of teaching a Theories of Counseling class, my students have often asked which approach they should use. Given the number and variation of theoretical approaches, it is scant wonder students would be perplexed. Perhaps the most realistic path is training students how to integrate different counseling theories into an approach that is efficacious and congruent with the individual counselor-in-training. In fact, surveys indicate that most counseling professionals do indeed integrate theories (CBT with solution-focused, Gestalt with existential, logotherapy with cognitive techniques, and so on). But given the proliferation of therapeutic approaches, I wondered what different counselors would say regarding what constitutes \"great counseling.\" So, I posed the question to a sample of counselors. My population \"December 2012 | Counseling Today | 15 included counseling professionals from the United States, Canada, Africa, Asia and Australia. Although my sample wasn't scientific, the gender, cultural and geographic composition of this august ad hoc group was notable for its variation. Some of those solicited are well known in the counseling profession, while others are recognized primarily in their communities. All have significant counseling experience, and several have published extensive research. Furthermore, the range covers counselors from a variety of theoretical perspectives. What did I discover? Here are some examples of the variations of opinion concerning what constitutes great counseling: n Sticks over time n Increases client self-awareness n Creates healthy change n Involves empirically supported treatments n Involves awareness of client decision points n Weaves cultural considerations into counseling n Actively solicits client feedback n Allows clients to tell stories and be heard n Provides a safe place for self-exploration n Establishes an \"'I-Thou\" relationship between counselor and client Each of these elements is likely important to great counseling \u2014 perhaps some more so than others depending on the individual client, presenting issue and situation. That list offers some examples of the differences, so what were the similarities? Essentially all respondents, regardless of gender, geography, cultural characteristics and theoretical approach, answered that great counseling involves creating a strong therapeutic relationship. Had I the time and space to explore it, the \"how to\" regarding creating the therapeutic alliance would likely unmask considerable variation, but the fact that all those sampled view the counselor/client relationship as significant suggests volumes regarding the nature of counseling. Carl Rogers based his hypothesis of the \"necessary and sufficient conditions for therapeutic change\" on the quality of the therapeutic relationship. I suspect many in my sample would agree that the therapeutic relationship is \"necessary,\" though not sufficient, for great counseling. Again, however, it is significant that all respondents saw the therapeutic alliance as critical. 'What treatment, by whom, is most effective?' Now let's dig a little further into this month's topic. A handy book for all counselors is The Heart and Soul of Change: Delivering What Works in Therapy (second edition) by Duncan, Miller, Wampold and Hubble. The authors provide an overview of outcomes research in counseling. Perhaps surprisingly, they assert particular therapeutic approach as less important than previously believed (at 15 percent of therapeutic success). Most important to successful outcomes is what the authors label \"common factors,\" the most significant being the therapeutic relationship (at 30 percent of success). Another common factor in successful counseling is \"soliciting client feedback.\" But the authors are clearly swimming against the current tide with their panning of the medical model system (represented by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and evidence-based therapy. In a late 1960s journal article, Gordon Paul posed a now frequently cited question: What treatment, by whom, is most effective for this individual, with that specific problem, and under which set of circumstances? The question, with its Zen-like ring, has been volleyed about the profession ever since. The small sample of counselors I questioned, as well as the authors of The Heart and Soul of Change, strongly asserts the therapeutic relationship as an essential, if not the most important, factor in client change. Interestingly, however, the therapeutic alliance appears to fall beyond the scope of Paul's iconic question. Clearly, positive change must be part and parcel of great counseling. Having spent many years counseling mandated clients, I learned to value James Prochaska, Carlo DiClemente and John Norcross' stages of change model. Was the client unaware that his five DUIs were a problem? Entertaining the notion? Making small changes? Motivational interviewing co- founder William Miller assesses every client's attitude for change in the first session and regularly thereafter uses his brief Change Questionnaire or the What I Want From T reatment assessment. At the end of each session, Scott Miller asks, \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being awful and 10 being great, where was today's session?\" Then he asks, \"How can we increase it one point?\" Understanding if the client wants change may be the skeleton key to the therapeutic relationship that Rogers wrote about decades ago.

In his popular book, The New Brain: How the Modern Age Is Rewiring Your Mind, neurosurgeon Richard Restak chronicles how people can increase their cognitive functioning. An optimistic attitude seems to be one of the keys to healthy and long-lasting cognitive functioning because optimistic people are more likely to engage their minds through creative endeavors such as playing or composing music, writing, reading, sculpting, painting and other activities. So, \"feeding\" the brain through \"learned optimism\" and creativity would seem to be a strong tenet of great counseling. It was a surprise to me that none of my survey respondents specifically mentioned the constructs of optimism, meaning or hope in their answers (although all of them would likely agree that such constructs are important). The future of great counseling certainly involves the different threads already mentioned, such as the therapeutic alliance, instilling client change, and nurturing optimism and creativity. I suspect counseling's future is likely to also involve more flexible integration and less dogmatic individual approaches. Breakthrough research on the brain and the subjective inner mechanisms of change also must be emphasized, and the dynamic tension between these exoteric and esoteric philosophies must be married into something efficacious, yet meaningful. Finally, integration requires revisiting our esteemed psychiatrist, patiently relaxing in this column's waiting room since the introduction. I toss the baton back to Rogers and his emphasis on respect and empathy toward clients. The psychiatrist's demeaning, deterministic language represents counseling's equivalent of a terminal diagnosis and certainly is contraindicated. Such hubristic verbiage wrongly exonerates a counselor's responsibility, while unjustly holding the client fully culpable for failed outcomes. Sadly, all the trappings of an elite education failed to equip this psychiatrist with the most basic of all therapeutic provisions \u2014 namely, the ability to cocreate the therapeutic alliance. Whatever else great counseling involves, at its most foundational level, it is about relationships. u Shannon Hodges is a licensed mental health counselor and associate professor of counseling at Niagara University.

A relatively new employee, Jessica is the voice of school counseling in ACA's office of public policy and legislation. Jessica is also a bocce ball player, an active environmentalist and the owner of a lovely smile. This is her career story. Rebecca Daniel-Burke: Tell us about your current position at ACA. What primary tasks do you perform? Jessica Eagle: As the school counseling legislative representative, I cover federal public policy matters. I have also broadened my scope of work to include opportunities for member engagement and school counseling professional development. I consult with state groups, and I look for ways ACA can provide more direct support for counselor educators and school counselors working to meet K-12 students' emotional/ behavioral health and college/career readiness needs. RDB: What led you down the path toward a career in counseling and school counseling? JE: I was an environmental community organizer for years. I recall having regular discussions with Shannon, my co-worker who had an environmental education background, about how educators could have the greatest impact on creating healthy, thriving, supportive communities. We discussed how schools are the community cornerstone where our future voters, leaders and citizens are shaped. Shannon regularly presented in classrooms, supported student environmental groups and empowered student leaders. T ragically, our community lost Shannon to a horrific, violent act. During this difficult and upsetting time, I started to think more about our conversations, my purpose and how I could best serve my community. I began to think about what it would be like if I worked in a school, in a role that empowers students and advocates for them so they are prepared for learning in the classroom and being engaged citizens beyond school. After looking into numerous education careers, I decided the best way I could be a change agent was to become a school counselor. I received my degree from Seattle University, where social justice is central to its mission and advocacy is discussed as an important piece of the professional school counselor's role. RDB: Why were you attracted to the public policy/legislative/lobbying side of counseling? JE: I enjoy working on big picture stuff and systemic change. I'm sure everyone has caught herself or himself saying, \"I hate politics!\" I know I have. But when it comes down to it, everything is political. At a time when the United States is deciding what programs will give us the most bang for the buck in regard to our nation's security and economy, school counselors have to step up with their advocate hats on and be ready to demonstrate that education is our greatest investment and that school counselors can demonstrate real, improved student-outcome goals. We will need to work together to do this at the federal level, the state level and in our school district board meetings. RDB: How is it different for you working as a lobbyist as opposed to practicing face-to-face counseling? JE: It's very different. My day can revolve around stats, numbers and reading wonky reports. It is on these days that I deeply cherish communication with school counselor members who can keep me grounded in the real work and outcomes that we want to reflect in public policy. On the other hand, it turns out there are plenty of opportunities to practice basic counseling skills such as active listening, open-ended questions, reframing, etc., during meetings with A voice for school counselorsCounselor Career Stories - By Rebecca Daniel-Burke partners and decision-makers. RDB: What was your favorite job, placement or internship? Why? JE: Hamilton International Middle School in Seattle. Middle schoolers are awesome. School counseling is greatly needed at this developmental life stage, and the kids' rapid growth and resiliency are outstanding things to witness. RDB: Is there one theoretical orientation that you gravitate toward more than others? Why? JE: I largely rely on Adler's individual psychology and Glasser's reality therapy as my theoretical foundation. Individual psychology's emphasis on cooperation, encouragement, natural and logical consequences, and its egalitarian approach provide many reasons for this theory to be used successfully in school. Identifying the basic needs that a student is struggling to meet, focusing on relationship dynamics, empowering a youth with choices and allowing room for humor are natural approaches from reality therapy that I also enjoy using with students. RDB: Was there someone in your life who saw something special in you early on? Who valued you as a unique individual? JE: I am very lucky to have a supportive and close-knit family. My father happened to be a school counselor, and my mother was an early childhood specialist. They always made me feel unique and introduced me to many different avenues as I was growing up. My high school advisory teacher, Mary Pratt, was also instrumental in piquing my interest in the environment, advocacy and community work. She was extremely supportive, even as I made my career moves after undergrad. RDB: Has being in the field of counseling been transformational for you?Jessica EagleDecember 2012 | Counseling Today | 19JE: Yes, the study and practice of counseling has helped me see the good in all people. RDB: Is there a saying, a book or a quote that you think about when you need to be inspired regarding your work? JE: From an early age, I have had a poster in my room with Margaret Mead's famous quote: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\" It was influential in setting me on the path of community organizing. Recently, during tough situations, I've been reflecting on these words: \"If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\" RDB: Your work can be intense. What ways do you find to take care of yourself and fill yourself back up? JE: Politics and policy work can really be overwhelming if self-care is dismissed. I've experienced burnout before, so now I am intentional with how I care for myself, especially mentally and spiritually. I take part in regular meditation sittings at the Shambhala Center [in Washington, D.C.], practice Kundalini yoga, enjoy the time I share with friends and family, and take walks and bike rides as much as I can. Mostly, I just remember not to beat myself up over the little things and try to practice gratitude every day. RDB: As you know, ACA now has more than 50,000 members. Is there anything else that you want our members to know about you and your work? JE: Meeting members is what I am looking forward to the most while working for ACA.

Order JUST RELEASED!Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.com, is author of the best-selling book Delivering Happiness. The book is a quasi- autobiographical account of Tony's entrepreneurial successes, including LinkExchange, an Internet-based company that he co-founded and sold to Microsoft for $265 million. Tony recounts that he decided to sell LinkExchange when the company's culture went downhill and he no longer felt a connection with his employees. Tony writes in his book that, to keep its culture strong, Zappos only hires people that its leadership team wants to hang out with \u2014 and it seems to work! Today, the Zappos culture is legendary. From impromptu zombie parades to \"bald is beautiful\" shave-your-head contests, Zappos seems a hybrid of fraternity, cult and family. The struggle to build culture Today, many group counseling practices have cultures that are struggling. Why? Consider these common scenarios: n The counselors in your group prac- tice are independent contractors, work several other jobs and have practices of their own on the side. They plan to quit your \"gig\" as soon as their solo-practice caseloads fill up. n The seasoned clinicians in a group practice won't abide by anyone's rules but their own. Clinical notes are late ... and in the wrong format. The clinicians aren't on board with company initiatives. In fact, they won't turn off a light or close a door behind them because \"that's not their job.\" n The psychiatrist in a group practice sees as many clients as possible, as quickly as possible, and then gets the heck out of the office as soon as possible. He has never attended a staff meeting. Stay away from his parking space, and you won't have a problem. n The manager/owner of a group practice is also a clinician with a caseload of her own. She is overworked, overstressed and struggles to juggle basic company operations. Building culture seems like an unaffordable luxury. Culture is not a luxury. It is a necessity. Culture is the glue that holds a company together. Without it, morale and quality suffer, employee turnover increases and recruiting new staff becomes more difficult. Zappos officials claim that culture starts with hiring, and they're right. At my company, we hire talented, experienced staff, but we also spend a lot of time making sure that new clinicians will be good fits for our culture. We hire those individuals who will get along with the team and who embody our mission of positive, empowering therapy. Unlike Zappos, however, we don't subscribe to the \"we must want to hang out with you\" philosophy (we've hired clinicians in their early 20s and in their mid 70s, and they're not hanging out). Instead, I prefer Tina Fey's rule from her book Bossypants: \"Don't hire anyone you wouldn't want to run into in the hallway at 3 in the morning.\" Culture starts at hiring, but it doesn't end there. As manager, it is your job to cultivate positive company culture. Things I tried that failed Company culture is a hot topic today, and if you read business books or magazines, you will encounter scores of methods on how to promote a positive one. Here are two currently fashionable suggestions that I tried ... and that flopped! 1) Transparent finances: Some contend that a company should share its finances with employees to cultivate a strong culture. That way, the reasoning goes, employees can rally with you when times are bad and rejoice with you when times are good. In fact, if finances aren't transparent, you likely have a \"control issue\" (for this side of the argument, read Eric V. Holtzclaw's article, \"Power of Financial T ransparency With Employees\" on Inc.com). I tried this. I drew up reports and charts and called meetings to explain company profits, losses, margins and payroll. The resounding response from employees: \"This has nothing to do with me!\" \"Of course it does!\" I said, pointing again to my spreadsheets. \"See!?\" In the end, I learned that my team members don't care how much money the company makes (or doesn't make) as long as they feel they are being well compensated for their roles. 2) Unlimited PTO: Today, it is in vogue to offer employees unlimited PTO (paid time off). The theory suggests that unlimited PTO promotes a culture of trust because, what does it matter how many days employees take off as long as they get their work done? So, I tried this with my admin staff. Surprise! Some people used a lot of PTO, while others felt cheated for coming to work while their counterparts were off. Morale didn't improve. Productivity didn't improve. It might seem obvious, but employees are more productive when they're ... well ... working. We have since switched back from \"unlimited\" to generous amounts of PTO, and our culture is better for it. (Proprietors of unlimited PTO will say I did it wrong, which is seemingly always the answer if unlimited PTO doesn't work for a company.) Things I tried that worked To date, we haven't held any zombie parades or \"bald is beautiful\" events. We don't have an office cat (allergies), and my idea of putting a 1980s arcade in the boardroom was vetoed. Still, we do a lot to build culture. 1) Respect and gestures of caring: At our company, more than half of our mission statement addresses our employees, and we mean every word. Here's an excerpt: \"Thriveworks, at its Creating culture in your group counseling practice 20 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Private Practice Strategies - By Anthony Centore core, is its team of people. ... We work to engender great loyalty in the team members of Thriveworks and hope that we are successful in developing and maintaining their loyalty to the point that they elect to stay employed with us for life\" (see thriveworks.com/professional- counseling/mission-and-vision/). We truly care about our team. If someone has a problem, at work or otherwise, we try to help. We respect our employees and value their contributions. We are honest. We strive to be generous. We are finally remembering to celebrate birthdays and employment anniversaries (and new babies). For a long time, I thought doing this was too much of a clich\u00e9. But we want to honor our employees at every opportunity, and they really seem to appreciate the acknowledgments. 2) Community: Counseling is an isolating profession. While you are with clients all day in session, the focus is 100 percent on them. Hence, many counselors in private practice apply to work with us because they are looking for colleagues to connect with in between sessions. At our practice, we try to promote co-worker interaction with weekly peer supervision, catered lunch on Fridays, after-work happy hours, holiday parties and even the occasional company event. 3) Mission: Mission affects culture. If your company leadership is serious about its mission, your team will get serious about it also. A company should always be able to answer the question \"Why are we doing what we're doing?\" If your employees believe the company is truly dedicated to a valuable mission, you have the genesis of a strong culture. 4) Progress: People need to feel that they are making progress in their careers. Up until recently with clinical staff, we would hire great counselors, pay them well and help them to fill their caseloads. Once their caseloads were full, however, there was little opportunity for progress. How demoralizing after two, three or five years to still be doing the same work, with the same title, without any path to something more. In response, we developed something we have never seen before in the industry: 10 levels of \"counselor rank.\" Now, clinical staff, through tenure and excellent performance, can be promoted 10 times, from \"fellow\" to \"senior\" to \"master\" clinician, and each level brings with it greater compensation, including perks ranging from paid education to paid vacations. Your practice, your culture Creating culture isn't easy, and there's no one right way to go about it. As you begin to build your company's culture, some things you try will work, while other things you try will likely flop. Even when you miss the mark, however, your team will notice your efforts and see that you care \u2014 and that is perhaps the most important culture-building ingredient of all. u Anthony Centore is the founder of Thriveworks, a company that helps counselors get on insurance panels, find new clients and build thriving practices.

Some families have used mediation rather than going through the traditional divorce process in court. A few of my colleagues are becoming involved in collaborative law as an alternative process. Can you explain what this is? Are there any risk management suggestions you have if I become involved in this process? Answer: Collaborative law, sometimes called collaborative process, is a form of alternative dispute resolution (often called \"ADR\" in legal circles). The aim of collaborative family law is typically to end a marriage and come up with workable solutions for families without going through our often expensive and stressful adversarial justice system. Although mediation is another form of ADR, it often is a one-time event in which a neutral party tries to achieve resolution of issues when trial is imminent. Collaborative law eliminates the intermediary. There are three basic premises that apply to the collaborative family process: 1) the parties pledge not to litigate the issues in court, 2) the parties agree to exchange relevant information promptly, voluntarily and honestly without going to court and 3) the parties commit to search for solutions that are in the best interests of the parties and children (for more, see nycourts.gov/ip/collablaw/faqs.shtml#Q1 and collaborativepractice.com/_FAQs.asp). The collaborative process in divorce situations often involves a team of professionals, not just an attorney for each spouse. Counselors and other mental health professionals may choose to become educated and trained to participate in this process. They may be particularly useful with issues of co- parenting, working out the children's needs and resolving conflicts. Financial professionals may also be involved. The goal is a solution that works for all, and that is memorialized in a written agreement that can be incorporated in a divorce judgment by the court. If the process breaks down, the collaborative lawyers must typically withdraw from representing their clients. This provides both parties with an incentive to cooperate and avoid going through the expense of getting new legal representation. The attorneys' withdrawal from representation also helps protect the confidentiality of the collaborative meetings. Collaborative practice can work even if parties harbor resentment and anger. Mental health professionals can often help with this side of the process. However, it does not always produce the intended results and, in some states, may not be an option in all cases. For example, in cases in which child abuse is an issue, the parties may be precluded from reaching a settlement through a collaborative process. Although collaborative practice may save litigation costs in many cases, it can be an expensive proposition in some situations. Counselors in many states can become involved in the collaborative process. You should first check to see if special training is required. If it is not mandatory, you would be wise to consider taking courses so you are prepared to deal with the clients, attorneys and others in an appropriate manner. One possible resource is the Collaborative Practice T raining Institute (collaborativepracticetraining.com); another is a state listing of collaborative professionals published by the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals (see collaborativepractice.com/ practiceGroupByCountry.asp?country=USA). You may also wish to see if local training is available through your state or local bar association. Additionally, you would be well advised to have your own local attorney to consult in tough cases and to make sure your professional liability insurance covers your activities. Finally, check to see if there are any laws, regulations or judicial orders that might govern the collaborative process in your state (for example, see the administrative order issued by a Florida judge on the issue of collaborative law that may be accessed at fljud13.org/Portals/0/AO/ DOCS/2012-041-S.pdf). w The question addressed in this column was developed from a de-identified composite of calls made to the Risk Management Helpline sponsored by the American Counseling Association. This information is presented for educational purposes only. For specific legal advice, please consult your own local attorney.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgDecember 2012 | Counseling Today | 25 26 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012If that headline caught your attention and you found yourself wondering, what does make a truly great counselor, you are not alone. In fact, many of today's leading counselors say it pays to never stop asking \u2014 and trying to answer \u2014 that very question. No matter where they are in their professional journeys, counselors can still benefit by learning from their colleagues' experiences and reflections, says Jeffrey Kottler, a professor of counseling at California State University, Fullerton, president of Empower Nepali Girls and a prolific author who has written and presented on master counselors. \"I've always mistrusted anyone who claims they understand what counseling is all about and how it 'really' works,\" Kottler says. \"The process is far too mysterious and complex to ever truly get a handle on all the nuances. Far too often, we don't trust ourselves when we totally buy into what supposed other 'experts' tell us is an approximation of so-called truth. Counseling is such a private enterprise that takes place behind closed doors. We rely on self-reports by counselors, and sometimes their clients, about what happened in the room, but I'm not sure those assessments are all that accurate and robust. So I think we are all works in progress, striving to do better. I think it's reassuring to most of us to find out that we are all dealing with similar issues and that we aren't alone in this struggle.\" The best counselors in the field aren't necessarily those who are most well known but rather those who are always reaching toward greatness and flat out working harder than everyone else, Kottler says. \"[These counselors] are constantly questioning what they do and why, being brutally honest with themselves about their work and its outcomes,\" he says. \"They are always soliciting feedback from their clients and colleagues, begging for the most frank assessments about what is working and what is not. Most of all, they are often so humble that they don't seek attention or the limelight but just quietly go about their extraordinary commitment to helping others.\" Is the topic of \"great counseling\" worth exploring? Absolutely, Kottler says. \"Heck, if we can't figure out what makes a counselor great, then how can we possibly ever work toward the goal of excellence?\" Counseling Today recently asked a diverse range of counselors to share, in their own words, the lessons they have learned in their professional journeys, the areas in which they are still striving for improvement and the key ingredients that, in their minds, make up truly great counselors. For a list of those who weighed in on this topic, see the sidebar on page 27. What, overall, makes a great counselor? Samuel Gladding: I think a willingness to listen carefully, form and maintain a strong therapeutic relationship, show care (empathize), be persistent (energy) and work with clients on mutually agreed upon goals are essential qualities of a great counselor. If the counselor is truly a wounded healer, he or she may well go beyond what would be considered exemplary practice because of increased sensitivity and understanding of what it feels like to be hurt and what it takes to heal. Counselors share their thoughts on the \"ingredients\" that make a difference Compiled by Lynne ShallcrossThe recipe for truly great counselingDecember 2012 | Counseling Today | 27 Jane Webber: I feel a great counselor's presence through their unconditional respect, authenticity, empathy and compassion. Great counselors build a safe therapeutic alliance where I feel connected, affirmed and validated. They are a witness and a partner, walking with me on my journey, empowering me to share my deepest feelings and to take risks to change. Mark Pope: I'm trying to go beyond the banal to have something especially pithy to say, but the truth is the foundation upon which all great counselors are built is a passion for helping others. We can teach knowledge and skills, and help our students gain awareness, but we can't teach this passion. When we admit applicants into our programs in counseling, that is what we look for. Also, being a great client. Great counselors really learn to be a great counselor by first being a great client. Anneliese Singh: Great counselors are those who make positive social justice change in their communities. We all know that so many of the concerns clients present with are related to multicultural and social justice issues, so we are truly at our best as counselors when we are working from a health promotion perspective both within and outside the walls of our offices. Sidney Shaw: The evidence-based paradigm that is dominant in the current therapeutic landscape doesn't address this question well, if at all, but \"practice-based evidence\" does. The counselor who gets systematic feedback from clients about outcomes, and helps clients achieve good outcomes, is a great counselor. Patricia Nunez: Overall, a great counselor is someone who is empathetic, creative and truly cares about others ... but cares about empowering others, not creating dependencies. Dee Ray: A great counselor is a master counselor \u2014 a person who concentrates on being effective, not on being great. A counselor is most concerned with developing and growing as a person throughout the professional life span. i Bradley T.

Manivong Ratts Jeffrey Kottler Dee Ray Bradley T. Erford 28 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Being great as a counselor is feeling secure in the knowledge that I will never reach greatness, but I will always strive to expand my personhood and my skills. The drive to grow is the force that inspires my desire to be in relationship. Being in relationship inspires my drive to grow. In my connection with others, I am encouraged to learn more, be more and engage more. These are essential to being a great counselor. Manivong Ratts: An effective counselor is one who is adept at both individual counseling and advocacy counseling. Individual counseling takes place in the traditional office setting. In contrast, advocacy counseling calls on counselors to work in communities to address systemic barriers that impede on client development. This approach requires counselors to examine how biological, psychological, sociological and issues of equity influence clients and their world. Jeffrey Kottler: T ruly exceptional counselors are those who live what they teach to others. They walk their talk and practice in their own lives that which they consider to be most important for their clients. As such, they are continually living on the growth edge, always looking for ways to become more effective as a professional and as a person. Such individuals would never consider themselves having \"arrived\" but rather see their own development and mastery as an ongoing process that will never end. What are the three most useful skills or attributes to possess as a counselor? Dee Ray: The top three attributes for a counselor are the ones we all learned and can cite, but do we really live them? I must be at home with myself, confident in my own skin and able to share who I am with others (genuineness). I must believe in the person of the client, secure in the knowledge that my client is capable of determining personal direction (unconditional positive regard). I must be at home in my client's world, able to inhabit my client's worldview, no matter how painful or different from mine (empathic understanding). Bradley T. Erford: Flexibility, empathy and advocacy. Cirecie West-Olatunji: The three most useful skills to have as a counselor are recovery skills, cultural competence and courage. Recovery skills are needed because, while we can be very capable in conceptualizing clients' problems, we still need to acknowledge that we are only guessing. This guesswork, no matter how skillful, will ultimately lead us to errors in conceptualization, hypothesis building and interventions. When this occurs, we need to artfully recover to close the space between our own reality and that of our client rather than lead the client away from expedient resolution of their issues. Cultural competence is needed to allow us to think \"outside the box,\" or at least outside of our own worldviews, in order to expeditiously assist clients in resolving their problems within their own context of healing (i.e., religious, spiritual, ethnic, engendered or sexual orientation). Lastly, courage is needed as a skill to brazenly and critically increase our self-awareness and confront biases that hinder our ability to develop rapport, accurately conceptualize, assess and formulate interventions for our clients. Courtland Lee: Empathy, multicultural competency [and] creativity. Samuel Gladding: Self-awareness \u2014 knowledge of self, including attitudes, values and feelings, and the ability to recognize how and what factors affect you as a counselor. Empathy and understanding \u2014 the ability to put oneself in another's place, even if that person is totally different from you. Flexibility \u2014 the ability to adapt what you do as a counselor to meet clients' needs so that you establish and maintain a therapeutic relationship and clients benefit. Marcheta Evans: [The abilities] to truly listen to the spoken and unspoken, advance accurate empathy [and] establish rapport with a diverse clientele. Rebecca Toporek: The ability to develop strong relationships, whether in one-session counseling, intermittent or long-term counseling with individual Sidney Shaw Gerald Juhnke Jane Webber Don W. Locke December 2012 | Counseling Today | 29clients, or with colleagues and communities. The ability to feel and convey compassion and humility, even in challenging circumstances, without being condescending; blending challenge and support for clients. The ability to convey to clients, as well as to policymakers, community members, administrators and funders, the importance of well-being and its determinants. Sidney Shaw: 1) Ability to elicit honest client feedback about the therapeutic relationship and whether counseling is proving helpful. 2) Empathic understanding \u2014 specifically finding out if the client experiences the counselor as empathic. 3) Flexibility \u2014 counselors, regardless of orientation, need to be able to match the counseling services to the client's values and preferences as opposed to having the client conform to the counselor's model. Manivong Ratts: Being able to connect with clients is the art of counseling. So much of what we do as counselors is based on human relations skills. Being able to make real human connections with clients can be a difficult skill to develop. However, when counselors are able to form meaningful connections with clients, they begin to see the potential impact they can have on a person's life. Another important skill is related to being grounded in multiculturalism and social justice. Counselors need to be both multicultural and advocacy competent in their practice. Anneliese Singh: The first is not a skill or attribute \u2014 or maybe it is: going to a counselor yourself. I had one of the best feminist counselors myself, and I learned more than any class could teach me about the actual practice of counseling. Second, and related to the first, is that idea of the \"wounded healer.\" Counselors \u2014 and counseling programs \u2014 need to be prepared to acknowledge that no one comes into counseling training unscathed by life. Third, we must be prepared to act when we identify injustices in the world. Don W. Locke: In addition to being genuine, the second most useful skill is to truly not only have empathy but [also] to be able to communicate that empathy to the client. A third critical skill is to be organized to the point that you can assist the client in viewing the presenting problem clearly and determining choices or options. Mark Pope: How about four? Being an authentic human being, having a sense of appropriateness, having perspective and having a big, inclusive worldview. What is the most overrated skill to have as a counselor? What is the most underrated skill? Jane Webber: Working with clients with trauma taught me that talk therapy is overrated. When I appreciate the power of listening and silence, clients share more and take charge of their therapy. The most underrated skill is asking clients for their feedback about how I am doing in the relationship and how I should adapt to their needs \u2014 Arnold Lazarus calls great counselors \"chameleons.\" Critical to adapting is collaborating with clients in choosing goals and treatments and in strengthening our working alliance. Also underrated are nonverbal, multisensory modalities \u2014 art, sand play, music and mindfulness \u2014 and neuropsychological techniques that open channels to the brain and promote client disclosure and healing. Gerald Juhnke: For me, the most overrated skill is active listening. Some counselors mistakenly believe that active listening means remaining silent throughout the counseling session. Thus, they fail to engage clients in meaningful treatment. Their clients capriciously ramble throughout session. These counselors also tend to utilize hazardous and inappropriate verbal encouragers like, \"How does that make you feel?\" Such hazardous encouragers victimize clients. They incorrectly imply clients should feel a certain way \u2014 depressed, anxious, etc. \u2014 based upon their experiences or life situations. Skilled counselors balance their techniques and interventions in a way that optimizes the counseling process and promotes client goal attainment without overemphasizing a single skill. John Sommers-Flanagan: The most overrated skill is any skill that gets Regine T alleyrand Patricia Nunez Cirecie West-Olatunji Daniel Weigel 30 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012in the way of counselors developing and maintaining positive therapeutic relationships with clients. One of the most underrated skills is the skill or trait of humility. Just as we should practice multicultural humility, we should also do as Adler suggested and not strive too much to perform or prove ourselves to our clients. We should win them over by adopting a friendly, helpful and optimistic demeanor, and be humble and not overconfident in our ability to be helpful. Regine Talleyrand: I believe that empathy is the most overrated and underrated skill since it is a term we use frequently without fully understanding or exploring the fact that empathy is more than just being \"nice\" to people or wanting to \"help\" people. A counselor's ability to emotionally connect with another person's emotional experience is one of the most difficult, yet necessary, skills in working with clients since it requires counselors to be able to recognize, put aside and/or resolve their own emotional baggage. Jeffrey Kottler: It's a belief or attitude rather than a skill: that interventions and techniques are what make the most difference to clients rather than those relational skills that build trust, confidence, optimism and caring. Bradley T. Erford: Rapport-building skills are important, but a great deal of the connection that leads to an effective therapeutic alliance was described by Freud as transference. This is one of the most difficult experiences for new counselors to handle, the \"Why couldn't I connect with that client\" conundrum. Sometimes the difficulty in connecting has more to do with characteristics (e.g., \"You remind me of ...\") than any skill or behavior. Experience is what you earn when you attempt something unsuccessfully. Great counselors have a lot of experience ... Daniel Weigel: Overrated: the temptation to fall into the myth that counseling is a pure \"science\" and the delivery of skills as a part of an \"empirically proven\" set of interventions will actually cause long-term change for a majority of clients. Although empiricism is essential to our field, claiming to provide successful counseling using only \"empirically validated\" interventions is a way of hiding from what truly affects change in counseling \u2014 a genuine human connection. As much as the mental health professions hide behind the gospel of empiricism, counselors who are most effective in the long term must learn, not feign, the art of listening, and the scientific model simply cannot wrap its numbers around this. Frankly, counselors must get back into the vulnerable seat of nonagenda- oriented listening. I say this as a practitioner and counselor educator who has tried with great resolve to make the surface-oriented, outwardly symptom-specific approaches work. Such approaches may lead to short-term changes but do so at the risk of disempowering our clients. This is a real repercussion of attempting to mesh the shortsightedness of the medical model with the depth of the wellness model (the root of our profession). This collision of a wellness focus of treatment paired with biological psychopathology is collapsing like a house of cards at an alarming cost (see, for example, the DSM-5 [the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders], the 18-year product of the psychiatry profession to which we are all expected to conform without question). Cirecie West-Olatunji: The most overrated skill to have is to accumulate a \"bag of interventions,\" while the most underrated skill might be to sit in silence with our clients. Patricia Nunez: Overrated and underrated: the ability to listen. Yes, I have rated the same skill as both underrated and overrated. Let me explain why. People who say listening skills are what make a great counselor are overrating the skill of listening. Yes, being a great listener is important, but there is so much more than just an auditory function. It is the ability to hear what is being said \u2014 and what is not being said, or what needs to be said, or what the implications are of what is being said. The mere act of \"listening\" is only a fraction of a skill needed by a counselor. And yes, the ability to listen is [also] underrated. When you consider that listening is more than auditory, or ASL Mark Pope John Sommers-Flanagan Anneliese Singh Samuel Gladding December 2012 | Counseling Today | 31(American Sign Language) communication, listening is the basis of all we do as counselors. Without it, we have no relationship with our client. We have no common ground on which to reach our client. We have no basis for development of the trust that is essential in a counseling relationship. Yes, definitely underrated. Courtland Lee: Overrated: unconditional positive regard. Underrated: a sense of humor. Dee Ray: Currently, our field encourages the overrated use of techniques with clients. Typically, these techniques have little theory or research base to support their use, yet new counselors are often sent to books full of ideas on what to do with a client. In contrast, the most underrated skill is intentionality. Counselors should know why they are taking actions with clients: What is the intended outcome? How does this benefit the client or the therapeutic relationship? What change construct underlies my action/response? How does this action/response meet the client's goals? Why do I do what I do? What skill or attribute have you had to develop within yourself in an effort to become a great counselor? Samuel Gladding: I have had to learn to be more patient and to listen more carefully while letting counseling sessions develop. Often, I can see what a client should ideally do before he or she reaches that insight. Coming to a decision and owning it is the client's job. My job is to provide the structure that will facilitate the client's development and empowerment. John Sommers-Flanagan: I'm not comfortable claiming the label of being a \"great counselor.\" Nevertheless, one thing that has helped me to become a better counselor is learning to contain my impulses to offer immediate insights or advice to clients. This has required me to look deeply at myself and recognize that what sounds good to me or what I think might be helpful may not be a good fit for the unique client who is sitting in the room with me. Bradley T. Erford: Patience. The client sets the pace of therapeutic change; the counselor needs to create the environment, structure the treatment and allow for clients to pursue natural change opportunities at a self-determined pace. Anneliese Singh: The majority of clients I work with are transgender youth and people of color, so much of the counseling centers around naming the injustices \u2014 such as transprejudice and racism \u2014 that influence their well- being. I guess this skill would be called \"truth telling.\" Seriously, so much pain is released and potentially healed for both the counselor and client when we can name the ways that people have internalized negative stereotypes and self- esteem related to systems of oppression. Don W. Locke: The most difficult skill I have dealt with throughout my career is having patience. By patience, I mean the ability to match the pace of the session to the client and not pre-diagnose or rush to assist in a decision or move in a specific direction before the client is ready. Mark Pope: Tolerance of intolerance (still working on it). Patricia Nunez: When I think back, I had to work the most on developing patience. I have always been more solution-focused than process-oriented, and it is natural for me to want to resolve issues brought to me. As a counselor, I had to learn to have the patience to let the counseling relationship develop and learn to facilitate my client's resolution of issues, rather than me fixing things for my client. Regine Talleyrand: Patience. The skill/attribute I've had to develop within myself when working with clients is the ability to wait in silence and \"trust the process\" so that clients can arrive at their \"aha\" moment at their own pace. Jeffrey Kottler: Most of my life and career I've carried around the secret that I never know enough, or can do enough, to help my clients the way I want. I've always searched for a safe and trusting environment where it is acceptable to talk about what I don't know and understand Courtland Lee Marcheta Evans Rebecca Toporek 32 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012\u2014 which is a lot. So I've learned to be as honest and open as I can about my mistakes, shortcomings and failures, which is so critical if I can ever attain that elusive goal of being a \"great counselor.\" Are there any additional thoughts you'd like to share on the ingredients of great counseling? Gerald Juhnke: Great counselors aren't \"born.\" Instead, great counselors develop and perfect the intricacies of their counseling skills over time. Counselors who merely replicate the same counseling elements over and over again likely are perfecting imperfection. Superior supervisors provide critical direction. They enable average counselors to become more satisfied and effective. Marcheta Evans: One of the important things I try to teach my students is remembering why you became a counselor in the first place. Don't ever lose that passion for what you do. Rarely do people come to see you because they are happy. This can pull on your soul if you let it. Remember your first love of counseling, and that will carry you through those dark moments of questioning why you are in this wonderful profession \u2014 to touch lives! Rebecca Toporek: Great counselors provide an anchor for clients, a place to belong, while they are in transition or navigating systems and while they are learning to establish, or reestablish, their own anchors and become agents of change and well-being. Sidney Shaw: Throughout counseling history, there have been numerous trends of what counselors need to do or how they need to be in order to be helpful. Though a framework for understanding great counseling is useful, counselors also need to be able to put those a priori assumptions aside to find out, from clients, if they are in fact being helpful. Daniel Weigel: It seems that most counselors claim to utilize Rogers' core conditions \u2014 a therapeutic \"given\" of sorts \u2014 as a foundation for the recipe of their symptom-oriented intervention strategies. But it has been my experience that many, but certainly not all, counselors of today do not actually understand that demonstrating these conditions is the most complex task a counselor can possibly endeavor to accomplish for the well-being of his or her clients. It is, after all, a way of being, not a set of skills to traverse like the rushed paperwork in an ER visit. And, as any humanistically trained and properly supervised counselor will attest, no counseling theory exists that is harder to truly epitomize and employ than that of pure person-centered counseling. I welcome anyone to convince me otherwise. Courtland Lee: It is important to remember that counseling is more an art than a science and that it is part of a worldwide, centuries-old helping/healing tradition. As such, as counselors, we are the inheritors and guardians of a timeless wisdom. People look to us to use this wisdom to help them solve problems and make decisions. Jane Webber: Being a counselor is a way of life and testimony to my belief in the power of the therapeutic relationship, which needs to be continually nurtured. It is a lifelong process of becoming and growing, and once I put on the coat, I can't take it off. Don W. Locke: Great counselors are always learning. Each client presents new challenges and experiences. Each workshop or conference or conversation with another counselor provides new insights and approaches. Great counselors are always open to another tool to incorporate into their portfolio. Great counselors realize that the next client will probably extend them in a direction that Want to read more about great counseling and contribute your own thoughts to the conversation?

Cowan Understanding bulimic dissociation to create new pathways for change Given the extensive research on eating disorders, motivated clients and a gold standard treatment \u2014 cognitive behavior therapy \u2014 it is perplexing that recidivism rates remain so high for bulimia. It behooves us as counselors to investigate possible hindrances to effective treatment and adjust our approach accordingly for those clients with bulimia who have not achieved long-term resolution. It is notable that, despite the substantial evidence linking dissociation and bulimia, many counselors remain unaware of this connection. Further, the nature of the relationship has not been sufficiently explored. In this article, we apply principles from self-psychology to bulimic dissociation and use this new understanding to inform clinical practice. When I (Rebecca) first met Sonya, she sat across from me tearfully expressing the shame she felt about her binging and purg- ing and the feeling of defeat she experienced from failed efforts: to stop thinking about food, to stop scrutinizing her body, to stop mindlessly gorging on food and then rush- ing to vomit. Sonya presented as many clients with bulimia do \u2014 she expressed a desire to change and a willingness to try whatever therapeutic assignments I may assign to her. Rather than engage with her in familiar and expected territory by focusing on food (nutrition, food journals and so on), I turned my attention to a different part of Sonya's experience, inviting into our conver- sation the part of her identity that up until then had likely been unacknowledged and invalidated repeatedly. We have labeled this the dissociated bulimia identity (DBI). To explain our reasoning for yet another coined term with a nifty initialism, let's shift gears and look at the underlining theory. Self-psychology and the vertical split Heinz Kohut proposed that children need specific interactions and feedback from caregivers to formulate cohesive, integrated selves. An important part of this process involves mirroring, in which caregivers demonstrate accurate, empathic affective attunement with the child. For example, a child may cry out upon seeing shadows in a dark bedroom at night. An attuned care provider might respond by giving language to what the child is experiencing (\"You are afraid\") and comforting the child. Through such interactions, the child not only learns language for his or her affective state, but also learns that he or she can be afraid and still be loved. Gradually, with additional interactions in which the caregiver reflects the child's fear in a nurturing manner, this affective state becomes identified and integrated into the child's sense of self. Assuming the care provider responds to the multitude of emotional experiences with validating, reflective attunement, the self then develops into a cohesive being where all affective states \u2014 love, joy, fear, grief, discouragement, excitement, loneliness and so on \u2014 have an identified and accepted place. The child has been welcomed into the world of shared meanings and connections and has formed a cohesive sense of self composed of, to use Harry Stack Sullivan's language, \"reflected appraisals.\" Further, the process that enables identification and integration also teaches the child about self-care; the nurturing and soothing interactions with the caregiver over time become internalized so that the child develops the ability to self-soothe and manage emotional experiences without relying on the caregiver's presence. Now imagine the same child in the frightening, dark bedroom, crying out at the lurking shadows. In this house, the caregiver responds with taunts, calling the child a scaredy-cat and snapping at her to go back to sleep \"or else.\" Continued interactions of this nature also identify the affective state while invalidating the experience of it. The child is taught that fear is not allowed and is shamed for experiencing it. There is no comforting hug or lullaby to internalize; there is only the message of rejection. There is a disconnect between the child and others, which results in a parallel disconnect from internal 34 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012thoughts and feelings. Dependence on the caregiver is crucial for survival, so anything that might threaten this relationship is sacrificed. Consequently, affective states met with invalidation become disavowed and denied integration into the \"socially acceptable self.\" But where do these affective states go? Kohut proposed that lack of adequate and empathic mirroring results in a \"vertical split\" \u2014 a metaphor for the partition between self-experiences integrated into the \"normal\" self and disavowed affects and frustrated developmental needs. Repression can be understood as a horizontal split, with unconscious desires tucked away deep in the psyche and blocked from the rest of the aware mind and body. The vertical split, on the other hand, designates a chasm between selves: the integrated affects and being states that were met with empathic mirroring and those that were sacrificed in an attempt to maintain the essential relationship with primary caregivers. Therefore, for clients with bulimia, validated affective states become integrated into the normal, socially acceptable self, while invalidated affective states are sequestered on the other side of the split, forming the unacknowledged, rogue DBI. Acknowledging this part of the self- experience has been deemed threatening and forbidden. Perhaps more important, the child never learns to effectively acknowledge, self-soothe and manage this part of self-experience. Needless to say, mere ignoring cannot relieve the emotional demands of loneliness, lust, anger, guilt, despair and other feelings. When the DBI demands attention, the now-adult client may address it in the one way she or he knows how \u2014 with food. Media teach us time and again that food is a source of comfort, pleasure and love. The absurdity of media campaigns goes so far as to sexualize food. Jean Kilbourne, in her \"Killing Us Softly\" lectures, observes the potency of a variety of media messages, including ones that offer food as a substitute for relationships. Food is also culturally anchored in our experiences: family gatherings, celebrations and times of mourning. Our bodies respond physically and physiologically to eating.

Cowan Rebecca Heselmeyer 36 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012basic sense, food literally fills a void within us. Binging provides momentary relief and escape, and the process at work is twofold. Dissociative symptoms are present throughout the binge-purge cycle, with peaks occurring during the binge and immediately after the binge. Dissociation is commonly thought of as an escape from painful psychological experiences. Dissociative symptoms are on a continuum ranging from minor alterations in perceptual functioning to significant disruptions, such as a dissociative fugue. The dissociation associated with bulimia is primarily categorized as mild to moderate. Clients may feel out of control or have a detached experience of watching themselves binge. Let's explore the dual process at play, using Sonya as an example. Dissociation, revisited Sonya would often report the quick onset of the urge to binge. As she began, her feelings of disconnectedness and lack of control grew, enabling her to eat beyond capacity by blunting both the physical and emotional discomfort she would otherwise experience. Psychologically, the dissociative symptoms she experienced also provided temporary relief from the triggering affective state. At the same time, the dissociative experience allowed Sonya to \"jump\" the vertical split and access the very region housing the unmet need that was triggering the binge \u2014 in her case, a deep sense of helplessness. This dis- integrated part of her self-experience that was reproached during her development has shown up in her adult life, but she lacks the ability to effectively identify, manage and attend to it. The binge-purge behavior brings with it dissociative processes that temporarily provide Sonya with both an escape from pain and access to the region where she can acknowledge and soothe that otherwise denied self-aspect. The function of dissociation is to \"escape\" to a very specific and important place: her DBI. In other words, while Sonya is desperately (and ineffectively) seeking physical comforts, her psychological self is likewise seeking to self-soothe the neglected and needy DBI. She is momentarily allowed access to this outlawed part of the self and can attend to the very real need for nurturing and validation. With the conclusion of the binge also comes the conclusion of dissociative symptoms. Sonya becomes more aware of her physical self \u2014 and simultaneously is returning to her socially acceptable, normal psychological self \u2014 and is swept by feelings of shame and guilt. Physically she feels great discomfort and embarrassment at the quantity of food she has consumed, while psychologically she has trespassed to visit and comfort the forbidden DBI. She has broken the rules \u2014 physically by food consumption and psychologically by traversing the vertical split. Guilt reigns supreme, and she purges to expunge herself of the harm done. Through this lens, the functionality of the binge-purge behavior and dissociation can be seen as the client's best effort to attend to a disorganized self-experience. For many clients, including Sonya, bulimia is a clinical presentation that, at its core, is a disorder of self rather than being fundamentally rooted in body image concerns. The clients' repeated attempts at self-care through the use of food fail because the core unmet developmental needs are never brought out of exile and given their rightful place in the integrated \"normal\" self. Symptom-focused counseling that serves largely as behavior management \u2014 food journals, nutritionists, love-my-body activities \u2014 prove ineffective for these clients because there is no room for the underlying disorder of self to emerge in the therapeutic dialogue. For this to happen, there needs to be a shift in the counseling mindset and conversation. Clinical applications If I had partnered solely with Sonya's desire to extinguish her bulimic behaviors, I would also have partnered solely with her \"socially acceptable\" self \u2014 that part of her that genuinely does want to stop binging and purging. Concurrently, I would have communicated to her that her DBI was not welcome. The DBI relies on the function of her behaviors for much-needed psychological care, so there is likely a very substantial part of Sonya that wants to binge and purge and has no intention of giving this up. Focusing the counseling conversation on ways to extinguish and change behavior, without also addressing the purpose of the behavior and offering an alternate way of accomplishing the function, invalidates the part of the client's experience that appreciates and needs the behavior. If approached in this manner, the client's DBI is likely to \"go into hiding\" for fear that successful counseling will result in its extinction (rather than integration). In effect, this guarantees an unsuccessful long-term counseling outcome. Instead, I invited Sonya to tell me about the part of her that wants to binge and purge. This is a potentially shame-laden and socially ostracized part of Sonya's being, so it is important for me to seek it out and welcome it rather than assume it will enter the therapeutic dialogue without active and sometimes repeated invitation. Counselors need to provide an experience in which all parts of the client's experience \u2014 both the desire to cease behavior and the desire to maintain it \u2014 are welcomed and validated. We encourage counselors to address the DBI directly (\"Tell me about the part of you that needs to keep doing this\") or by using third-person language (\"Tell me about her \u2014 the part of you that defies your attempts to control her\"). In addition, use language that demonstrates an appreciation for the adaptive function of bulimia that is, in a sense, trying to help. Occasionally, it may serve as a powerful paradoxical intervention for the counselor to urge the client not to give up the binge-purge behavior too quickly. Clearly, this intervention is not appropriate when working with clients who have significant health risks. But for clients in relative physical good health, and especially for those who have had extensive counseling, an intervention of this sort likely will be unexpected and get beyond psychological resistance by \"siding\" with the DBI against the socially conforming self. You can observe to clients how cruel they are to their bulimic selves when they use disparaging language (\"I'm such a fatso loser when I binge\"). December 2012 | Counseling Today | 37Once it is established in the therapeutic dialogue that all parts of the client's experience are welcomed and validated, new pathways for healing can emerge because the client, with the counselor's support, can begin to acknowledge and express the frustrated developmental needs that are the driving force behind the bulimic behavior. An important part of this approach is keeping the therapeutic conversation focused on the client's inner world of needs, feelings and thoughts, particularly those that are outside the client's normal experience, so the client can expand self-reflective awareness. Once clients gain insight into the role their bulimia has served in managing emotions and needs, a powerful experiential process unfolds as the counselor provides the empathic mirroring response that was previously withheld during the client's childhood development. Counseling provides the repeated, accurate, empathic attunement that the client's caregivers failed to supply. Just as over time the child internalizes the caregiver's ability to soothe and comfort, the client's new awareness of emotional triggers, coupled with the empathic, attuned response from the counselor, allows the client an opportunity to begin addressing and meeting her or his needs in a new, direct way. The ongoing process of welcoming the formerly forbidden self-experiences into the counseling relationship gradually breaks through the wall of the vertical split, allowing a merging of selves into a now fully integrated self. As this happens, the need for bulimic behaviors diminishes and, without a purpose, the behaviors eventually cease. Similar to the experiences of other clients, the turning point for Sonya came when she felt at liberty to speak about the part of her that could not imagine life without binging and purging. Gradually, Sonya's sense of inner connectedness and connection with others grew, and she became skillful at recognizing her emotional needs and attending to them in healthy ways. Her binging and purging has subsequently tapered. We hope you will find this conceptualization and the suggested techniques enriching to your counseling practice. u \"Knowledge Share\" articles are based on sessions presented at American Counseling Association Conferences.

His blood work showed an alcohol level of .16, two times the legal limit of intoxication. He fell off a ladder and has a mild concussion with a nasty cut above his swollen and bruised right eye. He probably won't be here in the hospital trauma center long. He is in the \"day\" hospital and represents one of the 1,000 people we have seen for alcohol screening and brief counseling interventions in the past five years at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. So, I walk toward him \u2014 toward hope that maybe, just maybe, this will become a memorable, teachable moment for him. And maybe, just maybe, this amazing set of professional counseling skills that I have acquired and honed over 30 years will be there for him in just the right way, at just the right time, to help him as he explores changing his risky drinking patterns. He is not diagnosed as an alcoholic, but he does infrequently overdo drinking and is assessed as a risky drinker. My route takes me past the waiting area for the intensive care unit (ICU). At least 30 people are here, speaking in hushed tones. I know intuitively why they left their cozy family homes so early on a Saturday morning to assemble here in these sterile concrete hallways where there is nowhere to suffer silently under the harsh lighting. I am struck by the sheer force and heaviness of their worry and pain. So many young faces are in this waiting area. They are here not for one of their own but for two: two teenagers, ravaged, lying in beds, surrounded by prayers and forever changed, the focal points of all the heroic efforts our highly specialized trauma surgeons and medical team can provide. The trauma surgeon's medical notes, written upon her initial exam of the teenage driver, rattle back and forth in my mind, like gravel pinging loudly in a tin can. They are reverberating words that cannot be erased or forgotten: \"Skull fracture, severe.\" The prognosis is dire. I can imagine the pure, carefree, wide- open joy this 19-year-old felt the previous night as he entered that twisting curve, the wind in his face, and popped the top as he rode that powerful rocket into the night. Knowing he had such power at his fingertips, heightened oh so sweetly by those liquid kisses from that last ice-cold blue can. Such total freedom \u2014 then. Now, he and his rider, an 18-year-old friend, lie in tubes and plastic in the ICU. Their connection to this day is tenuous at best. Will this be a teachable time for any of the caring neighbors, the classmates, the church members, the community leaders, the parents? So little is spoken about the drinking. Both the driver and his passenger had alcohol levels far exceeding the .08 legal limit to operate a vehicle, and both were under the legal drinking age. What do we make of this? Do we keep our silent vigil? We have learned through extensive research that approximately half of the patients admitted to hospital trauma centers have alcohol-related injuries. Now, as I go to see the man in the day hospital to provide alcohol screening and a brief counseling intervention, what will he see? How willing will he be to see the connection between his injury and his risky drinking? Will he be open to exploring change? There is an enormous weight attached to my work here at this hospital, teaching many counseling student interns and doing what many say shouldn't be done by counselors. Naysayers question whether anyone will really make changes to their drinking habits after just one counseling session. Yet quietly, and frequently, we see trauma unit patients making these healthier changes. Our own research, as well as the research of others, confirms that many of these individuals sustain those changes. So, I walk on. I walk on this Saturday morning, just like many other days, toward this injured person and toward hope that maybe, just maybe, this will be another memorable, teachable moment. The purpose of this article is to introduce counselors to a community context \u2014 the hospital trauma unit \u2014 in which counselors historically have not been represented. We believe, however, that counselors, because of their unique set of skills, can provide an invaluable service in these units. The individuals depicted in this account are based on composites rather than on any actual cases. Negative effects of alcohol According to statistics from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), approximately 65 percent of U.S. adults drink alcohol. An estimated 9 percent of U.S. adults drink in an addictive or abusive pattern, while an additional 19 percent drink in risky patterns, often involving binge drinking; 72 percent of U.S. adults either do not drink alcohol or do not exceed the NIAAA risk limits when drinking. NIAAA has indicated that males younger than 65 who drink more than four standard drinks in one day and 14 or more standard drinks in one week are more susceptible to alcohol-related harm, such as violence, accidents and alcohol dependence. (A standard drink equates to one 12-ounce beer or one 5-ounce glass of wine.) For females, NIAAA has indicated that more than three standard drinks in one day or more than seven standard drinks in one week constitutes \"risky drinking\" behavior that may lead to alcohol-related harm. NIAAA also has a resource for those exploring changes to their drinking habits, called Rethinking Drinking, which outlines a number of negative effects from alcohol. According to NIAAA, alcohol is a contributing factor in 60 percent of deaths resulting from burns, drowning or violence; 50 percent of severe physical traumas and rapes; and at least 40 percent of fatal car crashes, suicides and deadly concussions Knowledge Share - By Nathaniel N.

In addition, heavy drinkers often have a greater risk of physical deterioration such as cirrhotic liver failures, heart attacks, vascular strokes, insomnia, depressive disorders, gastric bleeding, numerous cancers and sexually transmitted diseases. Additional alcohol-related complications thwart effective management of diabetes, hypertension and anxiety. Drinking by pregnant women can cause serious brain damage and other complications to the unborn infant. In summary, negative effects from alcohol use are seen throughout the spectrum but particularly among the 28 percent of individuals who drink excessively or addictively. Our alcohol screenings and counseling interventions are focused on these individuals. The teachable moment A Level I accredited hospital trauma center provides the best in trauma care and is required to provide alcohol screening and brief intervention to patients when clinically indicated, such as when patients enter the unit inebriated. (Note: Given the context of this article and the language used by hospital staff, we will most often be referring to \"patients\" rather than to \"clients.\") In many hospitals, nurses and other staff complete these screenings and interventions. Our particular hospital is one of a very few in the nation engaging counselors to provide this service. We thought that counselors would be effective in this role because of their training in active listening, rapport building and empathy, their attention to multicultural considerations and their skills pertaining to alcohol and substance abuse. The motive behind providing this service in trauma units is simple. Faced with a crisis (in this case, the realization of being seriously injured and in a hospital as a result of alcohol use), patients may be more amenable to the idea of making healthy changes regarding their consumption of alcohol. Counselors can help patients explore their alcohol use and connect the dots between their alcohol use and their health risks. Without the screening and brief interventions, however, many patients may not consider the connection between their alcohol consumption and the injury that brought them to the hospital. Our T eachable Moment research study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The research team, led by physician Mary Claire O'Brien, also included co-investigators Beth Reboussin, Laura Veach and Preston Miller. The primary goal of the project was to analyze the effects of two brief counseling interventions on patients' alcohol consumption: a quantity/ frequency intervention and a qualitative intervention. An auxiliary goal was to determine the potential role counselors could play in providing brief alcohol screenings and interventions to patients in hospital trauma units. The quantity/frequency intervention consists of counselors focusing on how much alcohol patients consume (quantity) and how often they consume it (frequency) in a typical day and week. A key element of this intervention is providing education about risky drinking behavior based on research conducted by NIAAA. The qualitative intervention consists of counselors eliciting information about instances when patients have \"drunk too much\" or have \"overdone\" their drinking. Patients are also asked what they believe might have contributed to these instances of overdoing it or drinking too much. With both inter- ventions, counselors provide patients with screening results, ex- plore patient perspec- tives regarding their drinking behaviors, help patients to formulate goals for changing their alcohol behaviors (when desired) and emphasize the patient's options in making changes, if any. Screenings and brief interventions, which generally last between 20 and 40 minutes, are done in the patient's hospital room, usually at the patient's bedside. Patients with more serious or advanced problems associated with alcohol, such as alcohol dependence, are encouraged to seek additional help and are given referrals to licensed counselors who specialize in alcohol dependence. Cultural considerations Multicultural considerations are key in our hospital trauma center, which serves a vast geographical area and a diverse patient population. For example, one patient might be airlifted from rural Appalachia with severe stab wounds; another patient might be a gang member severely injured in a car wreck who is transferred from an urban hospital; yet another patient may be a college sophomore from a local private university who was admitted through the Emergency Department after a serious fall.

Cultural considerations are particularly emphasized when our patients speak a language other than English. In our region of North Carolina, this commonly involves Spanish- speaking patients. We have had the opportunity to serve a diverse group of English- and Spanish- speaking trauma center patients. These opportunities have provided us with some insights into cultural factors that potentially influence alcohol screenings and brief interventions. Particularly, we have recognized that patients' worldviews, or the way they make sense of the world, play an important role in how we assess and intervene with these individuals. Specific elements of worldview we have found helpful to consider include internal versus external locus of control, rugged individualism versus collectivism, high- versus low-context communication styles and personalismo. Locus of control refers to an individual's sense of control over and responsibility for circumstances in her or his life. Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe they are the masters of their destiny and that their choices determine their circumstances. In the 1994 film Renaissance Man, Danny DeVito's character expressed his internal locus of control orientation when he stated, \"The choices we make dictate the life we lead.\" Conversely, an external locus of control \u2014 sometimes referred to as fatalism or fatalismo \u2014 refers to a person's belief that life events or circumstances are attributable to external forces such as destiny, luck or God and are, therefore, beyond one's control. Individuals with a high external locus of control may not respond well to interventions that emphasize a future orientation and goal setting as a priority. Both the quantity/frequency and qualitative interventions described earlier are goal- and future-oriented in that patients are prompted to set goals for improving their drinking behaviors. This focus works well with patients who espouse an internal locus of control, but patients with an external locus of control may struggle with this approach. To further illustrate this point, I (Nathaniel) will share an instance from a few years ago when I was providing individual counseling services to a middle- aged Latino male. During one session, I was attempting to help this client create a therapeutic goal that was both measurable and realistic. Nonverbally, he demonstrated a lot of hesitation to formulating a goal. I was puzzled by this reaction, so I mentioned to him the nonverbals I was noticing and asked for clarification. He said he was uncomfortable setting goals because it made him feel like he was \"playing God,\" which, to him, was inappropriate and unreasonable. To be sensitive to his perspective, I decided that, rather than couching our work together in terms of goals, I would present it in terms of his values, which happened to be religion and family. Thus, instead of asking him to set goals, I asked what he believed his family or God would want for him and how he thought he could accomplish it. That approach seemed to work for him. In a similar vein, the values of individualism and collectivism influence our work with trauma unit patients. Rugged individualism places value on the individual; one's sense of meaning and worth comes from one's individual accomplishments. A common phrase used in the United States that illustrates the value placed on individual responsibility is \"He needs to pull himself up by his bootstraps.\" Thus, in individualistic cultures, the smallest unit of society is the individual. Collectivism, on the other hand, places value and responsibility on the collective, or group. In many cultures, the group is synonymous with the family. One's value and worth comes from honoring one's group or family. Familismo, a strong bond within a family, is common in Latino cultures. In a collective society, the smallest unit is the group, because individual values cannot be extricated from those of the group. Most counseling theories and interventions have been developed by and for people who espouse an individualistic worldview. Thus, when working with trauma unit patients who valued collectivism, we had to modify our approach slightly. Rather than discuss individual goals in isolation, we would help patients tailor their goals to fit those of their family or group. We also asked all patients if they had people on whom they could count to support them in their goals. I (Nathaniel) speak Spanish and provided alcohol screenings and brief interventions to Spanish-speaking patients. However, fluency in Spanish was not enough to be effective with these patients. It also was important to take into account high- versus low-context communication styles. In Beyond Culture, Edward T. Hall postulated that White Americans engage more frequently in lower-context communication than do ethnic minorities in the United States. In other words, White Americans often focus on what is being stated verbally and less on nonverbals and context. High-context communicators, on the other hand, place less emphasis on words and more on the context of the conversation, the paralanguage and the nonverbals being used. Latino immigrants, who made up the majority of the patients I served, often communicate from a high-context perspective. Thus, it was very important for me to assess the nonverbals, the tacit messages and the nuances these patients used in addition to the actual words being December 2012 | Counseling Today | 41 \"Knowledge Share\" articles are based on sessions presented at American Counseling Association Conferences.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgspoken. For example, it is considered rude in many Latino cultures to say no to a request or to refuse something outright. Because we were running a study as well as providing a service, we had to describe the study in detail and ask patients if they would consent to participate. In a few instances, patients verbally consented but, when presented with the informed consent form, decided they \"weren't feeling well\" or \"would prefer to look over it and get back to me later.\" In one case, a patient chose not to participate after giving verbal consent because he was not comfortable placing his signature on a white piece of paper (the informed consent form). Having lived in a Spanish-speaking country and having experienced high-context communication firsthand, I recognized that these comments, especially when coupled with the paralanguage and nonverbals, were polite ways for the patients to express they were not interested in participating in the study. Personalismo, the valuing and cultivation of an interpersonal relationship, also influenced our work with Latino patients. Personalismo often is developed through mutual sharing. Thus, a good way for counselors to foster personalismo is to open up and share aspects of their lives with clients. This is important because, regardless of the context, one's alcohol use is usually not a subject that people feel readily comfortable discussing. To help patients feel more comfortable discussing private, intimate and guilt-laden topics, we found it helpful to take a few minutes to connect with them by asking patients about themselves. With our Latino patients, that oftentimes meant sharing things about ourselves with which we felt comfortable, such as where we were from, where we learned Spanish, hobbies we might have in common with the patient and so on. Those few minutes were very helpful in breaking the ice and creating a sense of connectedness and trust that encouraged patients to discuss their drinking habits. Conclusion In providing this service to more than 1,000 individuals in an intense medical setting, it has become clear that offering alcohol screening and brief counseling interventions has substantial benefit to the recipients and to their loved ones. There is also benefit to the health care system in the form of reduced medical costs and reduced rehospitalizations for alcohol-related injuries. Then there is the benefit to society. Studies spanning several different trauma centers show a 50 percent reduction in subsequent DWIs when alcohol screening and brief interventions are provided. The majority of those receiving our bedside alcohol screenings and brief counseling interventions have never spoken with a counselor previously, yet they overwhelmingly rate these sessions as positive and beneficial. Further, in our six-month follow-up phone calls, former patients report substantial improvement in their quality of life (this result corresponds to other screening and brief intervention studies). The majority of individuals also report a substantial reduction in drinking, showing trends of drinking below at-risk levels or abstaining. We continue to increase our counseling services in a medical setting, placing emphasis on cultural competence, while also providing research, exemplary professional counseling and counselor education training opportunities. u STUDY GUIDE for the NCE & CPCE and GU\u00cdA DE ESTUDIO PARA NCE yCPCE Dr. Andrew Helwig's very popular Study Guide for the NCE and CPCE (2011, 6thed.) is also available in Spanish.

Opinion - By Stanley B. Baker Promotion of the evidence-based practice concept is widespread across the mental and behavioral health professions. Intrinsic motives include placing the well-being of our clients/patients/students at the forefront, desiring to discover and use the best practices available, and wanting to be respected as highly proficient professionals. Extrinsic motives include being eligible for insurance reimbursements, avoiding ethical and legal challenges, and saving one's job from funding cuts or other negative employment decisions. Unfortunately, too few counselors either conduct research or read research findings. Although they may value research intellectually, many lack confidence in their ability to use research findings. The responsibility for engaging in evidence-based practice falls primarily on counseling practitioners. Evidence-based practice requires application of practices for which the evidence was the product of rigorous scientific empirical studies \u2014 that is, outcome research. Outcome research is the domain and responsibility of trained researchers, who are usually employed in university settings. Therefore, counselor educators are included among those responsible for producing the evidence. The corresponding responsibility for counselors is to be willing and able to locate and use evidence-based interventions. Consequently, the two concurrent challenges are 1) having counselor educators (outcome researchers) produce sufficient volumes of evidence and 2) training counselor practitioners to find, interpret and use the evidence. Ironically, the circumstances create a codependency. Counselors are dependent on counselor educators to conduct the research and teach them how to find and use the evidence with confidence. Counselor educators are dependent on counselors to respond to training efforts enthusiastically, search for the evidence constantly, use the evidence appropriately and help the counselor educators to conduct the needed outcome studies. These challenges limit the range of interventions available to counseling practitioners. Accountability and action research Counseling practitioners who evaluate their local interventions can use the findings to improve their practices and to be accountable to their stakeholders. This accountability process involves action research as opposed to outcome research. Action research focuses on generating local rather than generalized knowledge (as is the case with outcome research). There are numerous approaches to and definitions of action research, but the common theme seems to be that it is not outcome research. That is, the demand for attention to rigor- ous research design controls and inferential data analyses is often not a requirement in action research. Action research seems to cover all data collection activities that lead to findings that are useful for evaluating local programs. Goals for action research include acquiring useful local knowledge for program improvement, involving local stakeholders in the process, being open to the viability of a variety of data sources and anticipating that constructive actions/ decisions will follow the data. Although action research typically is less rigorous and sophisticated than outcome research, the brunt of the responsibility for conducting the accountability process is also on counseling practitioners. Historically, counselors have been perceived as resistant to evaluation and accountability and need- ing to be coaxed or assisted in the process by counselor educators and local supervi- sors. This resistance was usually attributed to a number of supposed impediments, including a perceived lack of the requisite sophistication, insufficient time to do it, uncertainty about the value of the kinds of data being collected, the perceived cost of the process, uncertainty (and possibly fear) about how stakeholders would use the find- ings and a dislike of being evaluated. Counselor educators share the account- ability challenges with counseling prac- titioners. Counselor educators can and should address all the causes of resistance when training entry-level counselors. The evaluation/accountability competencies covered in the standards of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs fall within the action research domain. Therefore, the ability to conduct action research to achieve account- ability goals is not beyond the sophistica-tion of entry-level counselors. Teaching the necessary skills and influencing appropriate attitudes about action research and account- ability are important responsibilities held by counselor educators. Linking evidence-based practice with accountability and action research Evidence-based practice and account- ability appear to depend on different research paradigms and focus on different viewpoints. While evidence-based practice is a product of outcome research findings, accountability activities employ action re- search methods. Evidence-based practice is synonymous with aptitude testing, having a focus on how previously collected data can be applied to future performances. On the other hand, accountability is akin to achievement testing. The focus is on past performance to seek evidence of how well interventions have worked. Therefore, evidence-based practice and accountability appear to be two different concepts, each of which is very important for the counseling profession but apparently difficult for coun- seling practitioners to do well. My thesis is that the two concepts can be combined in a manner that might make it easier for counseling practitioners to be accountable and engage in evidence-based practice. The keystone of this idea is to view evidence-based practice more broadly than is currently the case. As mentioned earlier, evidence-based practice is the product of rigorous, sophisticated outcome research studies. My view is that evidence-based practice can also be the product of local action research studies that are a part of the counseling practitioner's evaluation/accountability function. If counseling practitioners are able to collect volumes of evidence that their local interventions work, then those data could also qualify as evidence to support their local evidence-based practice. The typical format for outcome research is to conduct tightly controlled studies A new view of evidence-based practice 42 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012with random sampling from targeted populations, control groups and inferential statistical analyses. Often, these studies are not replicated, and the findings are generalized to a population similar to the one used in the sample. These samples and populations may or may not be similar to those in many local settings. On the other hand, although local action research may be less rigorous, the samples and populations are indeed of interest to local counseling practitioners. And if the interventions are repeated and evaluated many times, evidence accumulates. Therefore, the action research paradigm provides volumes of relevant local data, as opposed to the findings of a single rigorous outcome study that may not always have applicable samples and populations. To be clear, I do not intend to replace or diminish the value of outcome research. It is important to understand, however, that rigorous outcome research has its limitations as a source of evidence-based practice in the counseling profession. My goal is to add local action research data to the evidence-based practice information that counseling practitioners are already able to locate in outcome research publications. Two examples T wo of the most common interventions are individual counseling and psychoeducational group interventions. How the action research framework can be used for evidence-based practice is described briefly for each practice. Individual counseling: My recommen- dation for individual counseling is to apply the AB single-subject design to counseling interventions and to encourage and assist clients in engaging in self-monitoring be- tween counseling sessions. Counseling goals would determine what behaviors are to be changed (for example, reducing the number of negative thoughts per day) and what at- titudes are to be influenced (for example, rating one's negative or positive affect about his or her job on a scale of 1 to 10). The clients would record the self-monitoring data. The data could be presented graphi- cally, starting with a baseline and then con- tinuing throughout the counseling process. The axes of the graph would be number of data-gathering points (horizontal axis) and points on the behavior or attitude scale (vertical axis). The evidence would be vis- ible in the graphic representations of the self-monitoring process. This process is clearly within the sophisti- cation domain of entry-level counselors and could be used in a number of individual counseling interventions. The data could be accumulated over time to provide both ac-countability data and evidence of the effectiveness of one's practice. Psychoeducational group interventions: I would recommend a pre- experimental pretest/posttest design for psychoeducational group interventions. Control groups are unnecessary in action research because multiple groups are presented with the same proactively planned interventions. Similar to the instruments that schoolteachers develop to test their students, practitioners can design instruments to assess knowledge and attitudes. Simulations can be established to assess acquisition of targeted behaviors. Pretest data can be collected before the intervention begins, and posttest data can be collected at the end of the intervention program. Correlated t tests can be used to compare the pretest and posttest scores to determine if desired changes occurred. Although the correlated t tests require application of statistical knowledge, that knowledge is within the competency range of entry-level counselors. Answering the challenge In his 2009 critique of the state of published research in counseling journals and of the attitudes of counselor educators toward research, David Kaplan, chief professional officer of the American Counseling Association and a past president of ACA, called on the profession to be primarily engaged in evaluating the effects of our counseling interventions. I do not know if he was promoting outcome or action research, but both paradigms are applicable to answering his call. Publication in the counseling journals requires outcome research studies conducted primarily by counselor educators. To meet Kaplan's challenge, however, a larger volume of counseling practice evaluations likely need to be addressed via the action research paradigm \u2014 and done so by counseling practitioners. It therefore behooves our profession to inform practitioners that action research is a road both to accountability and to evidence-based practice, and to encourage them to travel that road. It may currently be the road less traveled, but it does not have to remain so. u Stanley B.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org December 2012 | Counseling Today | 4344 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012NBCC awarded Minority Fellowship grant On Aug. 1, the National Board for Certified Counselors Inc. and Affiliates was awarded a Minority Fellowship Program grant of $1.6 million by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). After years of advocating for inclusion, NBCC was successful in opening the SAMHSA Minority Fellowship Program to the counseling profession. \"Over the past 40 years, SAMHSA has awarded funds to other mental health professions to help bring more minority professionals into positions of practice and education. NBCC has sought federal legislative requirements for many years so that counseling would benefit from new dollars set aside specifically for minority doctoral counseling students,\" said NBCC President and CEO Thomas Clawson. \"This grant is really important because it immediately brings $600,000 a year to support minority students in CACREP [Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs] doctoral programs. And we have to assume that this funding will continue for decades, thus helping prepare over 200 quality doctorate-holding counselors by the decade.\" The federally funded Minority Fellowship Program was created in 1973 \"to reduce health disparities and improve health care outcomes of racially and ethnically diverse populations by increasing the number of culturally competent behavioral health professionals available to underserved populations in the public and private nonprofit sectors.\" Professional counseling is the newest behavioral health profession in this program, joining five others: marriage and family therapy, nursing, psychiatry, psychology and social work. President Obama signed H.R. 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, into law (P .L. 113-74) on Dec. 23, 2011. The legislation was composed of nine appropriations bills, incorporating the House-Senate conference report with language suggested by NBCC that added professional counselors to the Minority Fellowship Program. Once mandated by Congress, SAMHSA issued a request for applications in April, and NBCC responded and was awarded the grant after a competitive process. NBCC received broad support for its application from national organizations important to counseling, including CACREP , the American Counseling Association, the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, Chi Sigma Iota, the American Mental Health Counselors Association and the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors. The NBCC Minority Fellowship Program will strengthen the infrastructure that engages diverse individuals in the counseling profession and that increases the number of professional counselors skilled in providing effective services to underserved populations. Working in partnership with related national organizations and accredited master's programs, the NBCC Minority Fellowship Program will strategically promote and provide as many as 24 fellowships to doctoral students in counseling. The fellowships will consist of an educational award of as much as $20,000 and additional stipends for expenses related to extended study. Basic requirements for fellowship eligibility include the National Certified Counselor (NCC) credential, enrollment in a CACREP-accredited doctoral program, demonstrated knowledge of and experience with racially and ethnically diverse populations, and commitment to providing mental health and substance abuse services to underserved minority populations. The fellows will obtain additional training in mental health and substance abuse, with specialty training in culturally competent service delivery. Fellows will provide leadership to the profession through education, research and practice benefiting vulnerable underserved consumers. The fellowship program will further increase system capacity by providing online and conference-based training to practicing professional counselors. T wo groups of seasoned professionals are providing guidance to the NBCC Minority Fellowship Program. The Minority Fellowship Program Advisory Council (MFPAC) was created to help select fellows and provide consultation to the program. The MFPAC is composed of three experts in the counseling profession with experience providing mental health and substance abuse to underserved minority populations and one public member who has experience as a consumer of mental health counseling. The inaugural chair of the council is Sandra Lopez-Baez, professor of counseling and educational leadership at Montclair State University. The NBCC Minority Fellowship Program has also engaged experienced doctoral-level counselors as mentors to support the fellows in their training and leadership efforts. The NBCC Minority Fellowship Program is administered by the NBCC Foundation, a corporate affiliate that provides master's-level scholarships for counselors-in-training. The first application period for the NBCC Minority Fellowship Program begins in early December and will run through the end of February. The awards will be made in April.

Our members have shared their concerns over recognition as providers, portability of licensure, employment assistance and their need for quality continuing education options. As our association strives to be the voice of the counseling profession, I feel that listening to our members and meeting their needs is paramount. Over the past 25 years I've had the opportunity to lead in numerous roles at the branch, division, region, and national level. All those experiences have allowed me to not only build my knowledge base in the profession of counseling, but also interact with hundreds of seasoned counselors, students, and new professionals. I feel I am now in a position to make use of my skills and abilities as ACA President and diligently serve our diverse membership. A valuable experience for this potential role has been serving as a member of the ACA Governing Council for the past five years. Being a member of the ACA Financial Affairs and Audit Committees has prepared me for the intricacies of running an association from a business perspective. I have also gained an intimate understanding of the policies and procedures of the organization by serving on the ACA Bylaws Committee. At the region and branch levels, I've served in a variety of positions where I focused on meeting member needs and encouraging the sharing of ideas and resources. My professional experiences have enhanced my ability to be responsive to both members and consumers, while balancing what is practically feasible. But it is my personal passion for the counseling profession that urges me to continue to be of service. It is my hope that I continue to find ways to positively impact the association and assist others in their journey to do so as well. Candidate questions As president of the American Counseling Association, delineate specific steps you would use to promote comparable reimbursement for professional counselors as paralleled to other mental health professionals. ACA has worked diligently in the federal arena to promote reimbursement parity, and I see this work as one of my top priorities if I am elected as ACA president. Promoting reimbursement parity needs to be a concerted effort at the local, state, and national level. Not only would I promote our continued national efforts in this area, but I would also focus my efforts to provide our members with the training and information necessary to effectively advocate for reimbursement parity. Utilizing the array of resources that ACA possesses, such as various technology avenues, we can reach deep within our membership to promote parity from the ground up. Guiding branches on how to best work with their government entities, and promoting the value of granting professional counselors the same reimbursement access as other professionals will be essential at the local level. At the national level, we need to continue to prove our credibility and competence as counselors by using evidence-based practice and outcome measures. Fostering relationships with government and private providers to communicate the essential role of the counselor as a mental health service provider, and lobbying for comparable reimbursement will be a primary goal in my agenda. Given the current economy, many new counseling professionals who have recently graduated are finding it difficult to find gainful employment in our field. What will you do as president to respond to this concern? There is nothing more disheartening than seeing passionate, capable new counselors not be able to find gainful employment, especially in an era when their services are so desperately needed. As president, I would work with ACA staff to continue expanding our job search resources for members. New graduates are in need of more support than just job searches \u2014 they need the tools to effectively market their services, communicate their essential skills, and make lasting connections in the field. I would seek ways to expand these services by working cooperatively with branches to coordinate resources at the local level, such as job listings on their branch websites and opportunities for professional contacts. I would additionally explore ways to meet their needs for competitive tools and strategies through tailoring materials and resources through ACA conference sessions, our online career resources, and outreach to our divisions, such as the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision. For six decades, the American Counseling Association has worked toward promoting the importance of multiculturalism in the practice of professional counseling. Please share your background, experience and opinion regarding multiculturalism in counseling. Additionally, what specific goals would you have as president to December 2012 | Counseling Today | 47continue to promote increased diversity in leadership positions and a diverse membership base? No matter what your work setting, multiculturalism is a core issue. ACA has been a leader in promoting the importance of multiculturalism, but I feel much work still needs to be done in this area. My research and work focus have revolved around first-generation, low income students and American Indian populations. I've seen firsthand the difficulties marginalized populations face yet also seen the rewards gained through education and awareness. The voices of those from underrepresented groups need to be heard. They provide important perspectives. To continue ACA's movement toward the goal of increased diversity in leadership, I would provide encouragement and mentoring to emerging leaders. I would continue the policies in place to ensure that we have underrepresented groups represented in leadership positions. The 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling initiative is currently focusing on issues of licensure portability, which includes title, scope of practice and academic requirements. How will you, as president of the American Counseling Association, work with sister organizations to have one voice now and in the future promoting these initiatives? License reciprocity is complicated by the fact that licensure titles, scopes of practice, and sets of education requirements vary greatly from state to state. Licensure is most definitely a public protection issue and it is going to take cooperation of those in various roles (state licensure boards, professional organizations, and etc.) to solve this problem. Standardizing counselor licensure requirements across states is the best way to insure those in need of services can be assured, regardless of the state in which they currently live, that they are accessing service from a qualified provider. The 20/20 initiative has brought together over 30 organizations that identify themselves as focused in some way on the profession of counseling. The group has been able to build consensus on an endorsed definition of counseling. They are now working to come to an agreed consensus on title, scope of practice, and educational requirements. If I am elected ACA President, I would work to continue to support this process by encouraging the work to continue, doing what I can to address concerns, and insure that all feel they have voice in the process.

For many years I have been an advocate of ACA, its divisions, regions, and branches, having served in the following leadership roles: * President of IAMFC * President of NCDA * Member, ACA Governing Council * Parliamentarian, ACA Governing Council. In addition, I have been an active participant in ACA regions (Southern, Rocky Mountain, Midwest) and branches (Texas, Colorado, Michigan). Collectively, the above leadership positions have provided me with experiences that prepare me for this position. My work experiences include: *counselor (LPC) in private practice, *school counselor, *counselor in a university counseling center, *counselor educator, *department chair, and *coordinator of PhD programs. Leadership and work experiences indicate my professional identity is a counselor. Further, I understand and identify with the needs of the ACA membership. If elected ACA President, I will advocate for * counselors in private practice, vying for recognition as LPCs, *school counselors whose positions are in jeopardy working with student ratios exceeding ASCA's recommendations, *counselor education programs that have lost faculty, and *students that are competing in a challenging job market. I enjoy a challenge, and these represent a few of the issues I will address as ACA President. My desire to serve is founded on the premise of advocating in the best interests of ACA, with its emphasis on inclusiveness, diversity, advocacy, social justice, professional counselor identity, and professional growth. It is for these reasons ACA membership has increased. I would like to continue the positive directions of ACA acting on the thoughtful, creative ideas, and suggestions voiced by ACA members.Candidate questions As president of the American Counseling Association, delineate specific steps you would use to promote comparable reimbursement for professional counselors as paralleled to other mental health professionals. Consistent and systemic advocacy efforts are needed in order for licensed professional counselors to reach and maintain comparable reimbursement with other mental health professionals. As President of ACA I will n establish online access networks so private practitioners and others can inform ACA and State Branches of LPC's not obtaining comparable reimbursement with other mental health providers n identify legislators, professional leaders, agency executives, national and state association leaders, and others establishing a collaborative team n work with the above leaders developing a consistent message to create change in policies by discriminating agencies, whether it be insurance providers, the Veterans Administration, or policies of Medicare coverage n orchestrate immediate action by the above entities using multiple methods (direct contact, email, letters, and phone calls) to discriminating agencies until equitable results are obtained. I have had the opportunity to meet with state and national legislators (most recently as part of the ACA Leadership Institute in Washington D.C.) and with insurance provider executives. As an advocate for counseling and licensed professional counselors I will emphasize the need for more financial resources to be directed to this issue. I believe I have the leadership and communication skills to effectively facilitate change. Given the current economy, many new counseling professionals who have recently graduated are finding it difficult to find gainful employment in our field. What will you do as president to respond to this concern? Having mentored a large number of students as a counselor educator this is a concern of mine. As a Past President of the National Career Development December 2012 | Counseling Today | 49Association I understand the importance of career and well being. I believe the mentoring process of helping master's and doctoral students obtain gainful employment begins as they enter their graduate program. I will collaborate with: The Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES), NCDA, the National Employment Counselors Association, and other associations as they have the resources and expertise to prepare students for gainful employment. Seminars at national and state conferences, career webinars', and the expansion of existing job search networks will be emphasized. I will expand the communication links and networks listing employment opportunities at the state, national, and international levels. As ACA President I will work with ACA and State Lobbyists advocating for hiring licensed professional counselors by the Veterans Administration and as Medicare providers. I will work with national and state school counseling associations, advocating hiring, not eliminating, school counselors. I will lobby for the support of the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program at and beyond its current funding of $52.3 million. For six decades, the American Counseling Association has worked toward promoting the importance of multiculturalism in the practice of professional counseling. Please share your background, experience and opinion regarding multiculturalism in counseling. Additionally, what specific goals would you have as president to continue to promote increased diversity in leadership positions and a diverse membership base? I believe and teach that multiculturalism within the practice of professional counseling is a fundamental principle of which we should adhere. This includes the endorsement of the multicultural competencies developed by AMCD. Besides demonstrating multicultural competencies, counselors can best serve others if their personal philosophy is from an open multicultural perspective advocating for individuals representing differences in ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, particularly with those experiencing fewer opportunities because of differences. In the academic setting I have a record of practicing what I believe including n establishing committees to develop strategies to increase student diversity n hiring diverse faculty and subsequently increasing student diversity. n working in a Hispanic serving intuition, graduating over thirty first generation Hispanic doctoral students working as professors across the country n hiring minority candidates in five of the last six faculty positions with one tenured and all moving toward tenure n mentoring and teaching diverse groups of students across the globe. As ACA President Goals of diversity include: n diversity representation on all committees and task forces n diversity representation on governance n diverse leadership representation in Divisions, Regions, and Branches n emerging leadership opportunities for diverse populations n mentorship of educators, counselors, and students in promoting multiculturalism. The 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling initiative is currently focusing on issues of licensure portability, which includes title, scope of practice and academic requirements. How will you, as president of the American Counseling Association, work with sister organizations to have one voice now and in the future promoting these initiatives? As a leader I have the following experiences: n Past President - two Divisions n Past President - Branch Division n Member - Southern Region n Past Member - Midwest Region n Past Member - Rocky Mt. ACES n Governing Council Member n CACREP Board Member n Parliamentarian - ACA Governing Council n Member of organizations outside of ACA These experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration and setting common goals. Licensure portability is challenging with States regulating the scope of practice or protecting the use of title \"Licensed Professional Counselor.\" Having served as a charter member of the Licensed Professional Counseling Board in Texas I am familiar with licensure issues and irregularities across States. I support collaboration with the American Association of State Counseling Boards in developing a model that can be expanded across states. As ACA President I will collaborate in an intentional manner with State Licensure Boards, AASCB, Accreditation Boards (CACREP), Legislators, Counselor Preparation Programs, NBCC, and other entities with the goal of licensure portability. I will advocate for Licensed Professional Counselors who have moved from a State where they were licensed to a State questioning their license. This issue borders on \"right to work\" practices needing the attention of state and national legislators.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office As a current graduate student and counselor, I share both empathy and compassion for the unique challenges and needs of today's graduate students in counseling. It takes great effort and sacrifice to balance school, work, family, and self-care while learning to be an ethical and skilled counselor, especially when overcoming barriers and social injustice. With my experiences as a counselor, volunteer and leader, I feel well qualified both personally and professionally to serve as the Student Representative to the Governing Council. Representing and giving voice to students was my passion as a school counselor. While representing and giving voice to school counselors was my dedication as Region Representative with the Colorado School Counselor Association. My experiences over the last 20 years have developed my collaborative leadership skills and my commitment to counseling advocacy at the individual, group, institutional and societal levels. I have read and understand the ACA Governing Council Member Code of Leadership, role description and functions and I am ready for the professional responsibility of representing the needs and views of a diverse ACA graduate student population. If elected, I will listen to graduate students and advocate for their needs, while remaining true to the ACA mission to \"enhance the quality of life in society by promoting the development of professional counselors, advancing the counseling profession, and using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.\" It would be an honor for me to serve in the role of Student Representative to the Governing Council and participate in the leadership of ACA.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Students are the future leaders and professionals of tomorrow. Thus, it is crucial that their voice and needs are clearly articulated to the ACA governing Council. Through my experiences serving in a variety of professional capacities, I have learned the value of being actively involved, keeping a strong work ethic, and working as a team player. I believe these life lessons would help me to be an effective Student Representative. My goal as the Governing Council Student Representative would be to engage ACA's students in order to clearly articulate their voice at the governing council. My hope would be that I could work diligently towards ensuring that governance, membership, and policy issues appropriately represent the needs and wants of ACA's student population. As the Governing Council Student Representative, I assume the responsibility of advocating for the ACA student population. On a more personal note, my experiences participating in ACA have been essential to my development as a counseling professional, and a student; it is my hope that all ACA students have similar experiences. Anna Flores Locke Professional background and experience My counseling experience focused on representing the needs of underrepresented populations and advocating for strength-based counseling practices. In my role as a counselor and supervisor, I specialized in child and family therapy, case management, and advocacy. The needs of the diverse clientele served at the non-profit urban agencies where I worked included: behavioral and emotional management, academic challenges, social skills building, and meeting basic living requirements. After six years in this role, I returned to graduate school to earn a doctoral degree in Counselor Education. I am currently in my second year, as a doctoral fellow, at Montclair State University (MSU) in New Jersey. I have a Master's degree in counseling psychology and am licensed as a professional counselor in New Jersey and Illinois.

I serve as a member of the NJCA Committee for Graduate Students and New Professionals and as a student representative for the Dean's Advisory Council and Committee on Increasing Doctoral Students-of-Color at MSU. December 2012 | Counseling Today | 51Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I have been grateful to be part of a growing profession that looks towards the future with hope and optimism. I commend ACA for continuing to focus on the needs of graduate students and encouraging active participation and mutual cooperation. I am seeking the position of the ACA governing council student representative because I am passionate about advocating for the needs of graduate students and providing multiculturally-competent service to our professional organization. As a Latina graduate student and community mental health counselor, I experienced many injustices and learned to become a strong advocate for myself and others. In my current role as a doctoral student, I have volunteered in multiple student leadership roles that have allowed me to be an advocate for graduate students. For example, as a member of the New Jersey Counseling Association (NJCA) committee for graduate students and new professionals, I organized the first social event at the 2012 NJCA annual conference. As a student representative on the Dean's advisory council and committee on increasing doctoral students-of-color, I provided insight into the graduate student experience and secured multiple resources to improve the graduate student experience at Montclair State University. For example, I was able to increase the amount of printing monies available for each student, and was allowed to maintain a student lounge that provides a coffee maker, refrigerator, microwave, and working printer. Additionally, I am involved in a student-led support group for graduate students-of-color. As graduate students, we face academic and professional challenges that require problem-solving. We are the future of our counseling profession and, thus, need support, guidance, and encouragement to become the best counselor, leader, and advocate that we can be. I welcome the opportunity to voice our needs to the ACA governing board so we can achieve our diverse academic and professional goals.Patrick R.

Julia remains active in the field, presenting at state, regional, and national conferences on topics such as self-injury, expressive therapy, and post- traumatic growth. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office For the past three years, I was fortunate to serve the Chi Epsilon chapter of Chi Sigma Iota as membership chair. During that time, I enjoyed the process of recruiting new members and educating students and professionals about the multiple benefits available to them as members of CSI. It was fulfilling to witness people join CSI and become part of our shared vision. If elected AACE Member-at-Large for membership, I will seek to increase new member applications among students and professionals and sustain current membership. I would like to focus on extending graduate student membership in AACE. I believe that graduate student participation is important for a number of reasons. Not only do graduate students bring motivation and a willingness to serve, but they also enter at the beginning of their career\u2014a time during which their professional identity and interests are in development. They may offer their organizations unique and creative perspectives on pre-existing knowledge, while also being prepared to contribute to the field for an extended period of time. Something that is particularly appealing to me about this position is the opportunity it would afford me to share with others the value of using assessment in research and clinical intervention. Through their participation in AACE, members may contribute in significant ways to the field of counseling. December 2012 | Counseling Today | 55Either through creating instruments, disseminating knowledge regarding responsible assessment, or helping to promote increased competence in assessment, AACE members can help ensures professional practice among counselors and researchers. It would be my distinct honor to be part of that process. On a personal note, I would appreciate the opportunity to serve AACE and the field of professional counseling through this leadership role. It is important to me to serve my profession and to take an active role promoting excellence in counseling. ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DEvELOPMENT AND AGING President-Elect Andrew P. Daire Professional background and experience Andrew P . Daire, Ph.D. is Assistant Dean for Research for the University of Central Florida (UCF) College of Education and Associate Professor in the Counselor Education program. Additionally, he co-founded and serves as Executive Director for the UCF Marriage and Family Research Institute (MFRI), an organization that conducts research on marriage and couple interventions and serves as a training site for counselors interested in working with couples and families.

In addition to mentorship awards from the UCF College of Education and UCF Office of Undergraduate Research, Daire was the 2012 recipient of ACA's Don Dinkmeyer Social Interest Award and ACES' 2012 Distinguished Mentor Award. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office As an AADA member and reviewer for Adultspan Journal, I recognize the importance of issues related to aging and development across the lifespan. Although our work and research as counselors and counselor educators address individuals across the lifespan, AADA (and Adultspan Journal) is sometimes still seen as the aging organization and aging journal. My primary goals as AADA President, if elected, are (a) to expand the perception and scope of AADA towards development across the lifespan, including adult aging, through awareness, education, and partnerships; and (b) boost research that improves skills and competencies addressing counseling concerns across the lifespan. Robert A. Dobmeier Professional background and experience I have practiced as a mental health counselor, clinical supervisor, and agency director in western New York prior to earning a Ph.D. in Counselor Education. In 2007, I was hired as an Assistant Professor in the Counselor Education Department at the College at Brockport, SUNY. In my career, I have had the privilege of providing counseling and working collegially with adults of all ages and from diverse backgrounds. I have published six journal articles and provided many national presentations on spirituality in counseling, mental health problems of young adults, and counselor identity. A book chapter was recently published on substance abuse relapse prevention strategies. In 2012, I completed a term as Secretary of AADA and have chaired AADA's Public Policy and Legislation and Professional Development Committees. I am currently president of the New York Association for Counselor Education and Supervision and in 2011 was a founding member of ACA-NY, a state chapter of the American Counseling Association. Earlier this year, I was honored to win the Thomas J. Sweeney Service Award from the New York Mental Health Counseling Association for my advocacy on the language of the Licensed Mental Health Counselor scope of practice in New York. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am honored to be nominated for President-Elect of AADA. I believe that I will be able to draw from my experiences as a leader in counseling organizations in working with AADA members to achieve the mission to promote standards for professional preparation for counselors of adults across the lifespan. Research studies in which I have participated on helping young adults to seek care for mental health problems, spirituality (as the search for meaning and connectedness) as a resource for everyone, and strategies for preventing substance abuse relapse throughout the lifespan have prepared me to support counselors who work with adults. Memberships in ACA, several of its divisions, and state counseling organizations, along with research on counselor identity have helped me to recognize the need for AADA members to be connected with each other. AADA is especially challenged now to help counselors to expand their readiness to work with adults who face unique challenges throughout the lifespan. Older adults face a Medicare program at risk and have greater life longevity while young adults have difficulty finding viable work when loans have to be paid off. While maintaining energies on behalf of the developmental needs of older and middle age adults, I would lead AADA to expand its focus on the mental health needs of young adults. To maintain this holistic view of needs across the lifespan it is important for counselors to be educated about new directions and to collaborate with each other. I envision the continued enhancement of the AADA website for its members and for the public. Webinars for AADA members would be a means to provide training about the needs of adults across the lifespan as well as a venue for members to develop professional relationships within and beyond their local practice communities. 56 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Governing Council Representative E.

NARACES Fall 2012, Niagara Falls, NY Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The ACA Governing Council IS the governing body of the American Counseling Association: the board of trustees, the legislators, those volunteer professional counselors we elect to provide vision and leadership in moving our professional organization forward. Together with the President, past- president, and president-elect - the Governing Council responds to the needs of ACA members, our constituencies, and sets a course for our future. When I served on the GC in the late 1990's, representatives received a large binder full of proposals and motions to be reviewed and acted upon over an intense weekend. I often wondered if the everyday membership knew or even cared about our efforts. The work accomplished does indeed \"matter\" - seen or unseen - the work of the GC supports the everyday efforts of every professional counselor's day-to-day work with clients and colleagues. With today's technology, meetings can be less intense, often done long-distance, and with more efficiency - all to serve our colleagues better. Yet, the need for informed representatives is essential. Representatives need to ask one another difficult questions, agree to disagree, and work towards resolution to move ACA forward as a crucial organization among our collegial human service provider organizations. I would like the opportunity to serve on the GC once again, in service to the members of AADA and ACA. If so honored I promise to become well versed in the issues coming to the GC table, to vote responsibly. I promise that if issues do not arrive on \"the table\" - I will raise the question/conversation when topics need attention. I will communicate with you, the AADA membership, requesting your input when necessary, and voting with your best interests in mind. Catherine B.

Catherine serves on various editorial boards for ACA journals, including the Journal of Counseling and Development and the ALGBTIC journal. Catherine has been awarded the AADA Distinguished Service Award (twice), and the Presidential Mentoring Award. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office It would be an honor to continue to serve AADA in the position of Governing Council Representative. Difficult economic times have caused many professional organizations to close their doors or limit service to members. It pleases me that AADA has not had to do that, and in fact, has increased or maintained some services. ADULTSPAN Journal and our AADA Newsletter, two of the most important member benefits, have successfully continued. Our AADA Summer conferences, in the past offered only every other summer, now seem to be every summer, signifying a deeper interest in adult development and aging, and the commitment of AADA Board to the effort necessary to mount excellent conference experiences as a member and community service. My goals for AADA and for myself in the role of Governing Council Representative encompass garnering continued ACA support for the divisions of the organization, to include equal and fair representation on any restructuring that occurs on Governing Council, as well as increased member services to smaller divisions such as AADA, so that we can continue to offer our AADA members necessary and helpful educational benefits. Since becoming a member of AADA in the early 1990's, I have been elected to various offices, been an active participant on committees, coordinated many AADA conferences, mentored emerging leaders to assume leadership roles in AADA as well as other December 2012 | Counseling Today | 57ACA divisions, and served on the Board in times of success and times of sorrow, as we encountered various tragedies, for example September 11 and Hurricane Katrina. My qualifications are embedded in my experience as a leader, a counselor and a Counselor Educator. My deepest professional commitment has always been to AADA, and will remain with AADA. I feel that is my greatest qualification for seeking the office of AADA Representative to Governing Council. Treasurer Robert Bracki No information received Meghan R.

To have the opportunity to work for an organization that focuses on professional development and advocacy for issues related to adult development and aging, is not only consistent with my research interests and passion, but my approach to counseling. As evidenced by my previously outlined experience, I view service to professional counseling organizations as both a privilege, and an important part of being a counselor. Beginning in my Master's program, I became actively involved in Chi Sigma Iota, as well as the Jefferson Counseling Association, the local chapter of the Virginia counseling Association. I served on the Chi Sigma Iota Awards committee, as well as the Events committee and played a pivotal role in several professional development workshops. I also demonstrated leadership abilities by becoming advocacy chair and then president of Jefferson Counseling Association. Since becoming a doctoral student in the Counselor Education program at Montclair State University, I have been an active member of the Association for Adult Development and Aging, as my biographical information suggests. Furthermore, my success in serving counseling organizations in the past, speaks to my ability to effectively communicate, organize and work collaboratively with others. As treasurer, I would proficiently handle the division funds in addition to working methodically and proactively to ensure that the Association for Adult Development and Aging moves forward in the most cost-efficient and profitable manner possible. Provided my experience, dedication to the study of adult development and aging, and my active involvement in the division, I would be an excellent choice for the position of treasurer.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The Association for Creativity in Counseling has been one of the divisions closest to my heart. There are several reasons why I sought involvement with ACC, including the division's wonderfully creative members and the mission they stand for: bringing creative approaches in the service of diversity and relational-cultural development and enhancing clinical therapeutic practice in the process. This interest started with an opportunity to learn about many of the creative interventions through ACC's Journal for Creativity in Mental Health and ACC's founder, Dr. Thelma Duffey's course on creative interventions in grief work. Many of the faculty in my doctoral program continued fostering this interest in creativity in counseling by planting the seeds of creativity and relational development in my professional identity and philosophy. When I had the opportunity to integrate many creative approaches with evidence-based approaches to counseling clients who have experienced eating disorders and trauma, I realized ACC's mission had become my mission. Some of the approaches that have changed my life and my clients' lives included movement therapy, narrative therapy and using arts. Furthermore, trauma-focused equine facilitated therapy (TF-EAP , developed by Natural Lifemanship) delivered life-transforming experiences for children and adolescents in therapy. In addition, many of the creative interventions integrate culturally-sensitive approaches which are responsive to the needs of diverse clients. These are just a few of the many reasons why I would like to stay involved with and advocate for ACC. Using my previous clinical, academic, research and service experiences in other organizations, I hope to serve the ACC by collaborating on developing and putting into practice ACC's visions and missions. This includes, but is not limited to, working with the Creative Interventions Clearing House, promoting creativity in mental health therapeutic process, and increasing our visibility as a division through education and service to the community.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office It is an honor to be nominated for President of the American College Counseling Association! It has never been a better time to be a college counselor and I believe that my past twelve years as Director of Counseling and Disability Services at the Savannah College of Art and Design have been the most exciting and fulfilling parts of my entire professional career. I have had the opportunity to grow my counseling center and to implement a wide variety of innovative student counseling focused initiatives. I take pride in the fact that our staff are known for their contagious enthusiasm and \"out of the box\" solutions. As we continue to face an increased acuity of our student population, limited financial and staffing resources, and an uncertain healthcare delivery system in our communities, it is more essential than ever before for us to continue to be creative, efficient, outcome focused and to share our successes and solutions with each other. As President of ACCA, I would strive to highlight the unique programs and models that are happening in many college counseling centers across the country so that all of us can benefit. While I believe my own unique background (in military psychology, corporate mental health and college counseling) would be an asset to ACCA, as President of ACCA, I will strive to create systems that further tap into the \"brainstorming power\" of the amazing group of professional college counseling colleagues that we have across the country. Regularly scheduled online \"drop in\" focused strategy sessions for members or even quarterly regional retreats would be a few possible formats to achieve this goal. Together, we can combine best practices with innovation to respond to an uncertain future and ultimately provide an even better quality of care for our students nationwide!

I am running to serve you, to understand you, your interests and to fight for you in ACA and beyond. My goals are simple, but they require hard work and perseverance.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office For the past three years I have served ACCA as the Governing Council representative to ACA. In that time I have focused on two major issues: insuring counseling continues to grow as a strong and vibrant profession within the mental health world and that professional college counselors have equal access to open positions within colleges and universities across the country. The focus of both of these issues is the continual professionalization of counseling through the promotion of a strong code of ethics, improved educational opportunities as we increase our skills and abilities, the relentless advocacy for professional counseling and college counseling, at the local, state, and federal levels, and increased opportunities for employment for all professional counselors. We are making gains on these are continuing challenges, but more work needs to be done, especially for college counselors. During my tenure as the ACCA Governing Council Representative, I have sought to build alliances with our sister divisions to enhance the services of the American Counseling Association for college counselors and all counselors. The Governing Council needs the stability of experienced members to finish our transition to a form of governance that is increasingly responsive to the needs of our members and the profession. I bring my experience as a former college counselor and now as a counselor educator who trains and consults with college counselors nationwide to this role. I ask to be returned for one more term to continue this important work.

Sylvia E. Shortt Professional background and experience I have served as a leader in ACCA since 1995. My first office was T reasurer and I also served as President (2001-2002) and Governing Council Representative.

T wo of my favorites are the Professional Leadership Awards from both ACCA and GCCA. December 2012 | Counseling Today | 63Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The American College Counseling Association (ACCA) had its very first conference in 2002 while I was President. We had the first conference in St. Simons Island, Georgia, and it was very successful. I served as the Co-Conference Coordinator that year and was proud to be a part of such a huge step forward for the organization. I have served as Conference Coordinator for every conference since. In 2004 (Biloxi, MS), and 2006 (Reno, NV), I volunteered to manage the conferences. In 2008 (Savannah, GA), 2010 (St. Louis) and 2012 (Orlando), I was paid a stipend to manage the conferences. ACCA has changed in many ways since I was a member of the board. The organization is growing and constantly striving to find new ways to support the profession of college counseling and its members. The board has voted to turn the conference planning over to a company that specializes in production of a large conference. t was time to make this move, as it was becoming very difficult for one person to do everything. I would like to be the T reasurer to aid in this transition from a single conference planner (myself) to a company. Having been the person to plan six conferences, I have an immense amount of knowledge to help ACCA move to the next level with the conferences. Having been responsible for the budget for these conferences, I also can help to make sure that we stay within the parameters needed for our membership. The T reasurer position is also something I really enjoy! The T reasurer needs to know all aspects of the organization to do a good job and I have an excellent current and historical knowledge of ACCA. I enjoy the members and hope to continue to give them what they want! Member-at-Large Joseph E. Bednorz Professional background and experience For over 15 years I have been a Community College Counselor. Prior to that time I worked in a Behavioral Health Agency for about 6 years, and was also in Private Practice for 7 years. Working in a Community College has been my dream job. As a counselor I am also a faculty member. In addition to counseling students I also have the privilege of being in the classroom teaching students. This is what makes this such a wonderful career. I get to do both. I teach students both in a face/face environment as well as online. When I am counseling students it usually involves issues related to careers, academics, or personal challenges. I have also served on numerous college/ district committees, been assistant-chair, and also chair of the department. I am a National Certified Counselor, a LPC, and have my Masters in Counseling and Ph.D. in Educational Psychology. I have also served as an adjunct faculty member at several different public and private colleges and universities. Member of the ACA, ACCA, and APA. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The main reason I am seeking this office is to be able to better serve and represent community/junior college counselors and the students they work with. Because there are so many students enrolled now in our two year colleges and many more will be enrolling in the future, I feel we need to pay greater attention to those students and the counselors who work with them. Work needs to be done to better assist our colleagues who work with this growing, diverse, and wonderful population. This is what I want to work on. Community college students are unique. They are different than students who attend residential four year institutions. They deserve the opportunity to participate in the best mental and educational services that are available now and will be in the future. They deserve a chance to be successful today and even better prepared for tomorrow. With over 15 years of experience working in a community college I have learned a lot about students, faculty, administrators, and counselors. I will use all that experience plus more to help my fellow community/junior college counselors be able to provide the best services and programs they can to assist their students. Thanks.James D. Carpenter No information received Melinda hawley No information received Mark M. Tovar Professional background and experience I have been a Licensed Professional Counselor and member of the American Counseling Association for over 10 years. I am also an LPC-Supervisor and National Certified Counselor. I first became a member of the ACCA in graduate school and have followed the progress of the division. I have counseled in community agencies, schools, colleges, correctional facilities, and private practice. College counseling has remained my specialty area. In the last 2 years I was asked to create a counseling structure for a campus of 16,000 students that follows the ethical, legal, and therapeutic practices laid out by the ACA, ACCA, and my state. I work directly with students and am on a behavioral intervention team that guides the campus in addressing students with behavioral, disciplinary, and mental health needs. This work requires me to remain current on ethical, legal, and therapeutic interventions. I walk a line between students' rights and the college administration's need for information. I am currently working on my dissertation about community college students with disabilities. I look forward to finishing my doctoral degree in 2013. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office My counseling experience at many levels of postsecondary education allows me to advocate for college counselors. I am continually educating faculty, administration, and students on the benefits of having counselors on campus. The college counselor's role is more important than ever before. The ethical, legal, and emotional support we provide to our campus should always be paramount, although responsibilities vary depending on the campus. Currently, budget and staff cuts are forcing some colleges and universities to serve more students with less support. Some 64 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012examples would be: implementing unreasonable session limits, refusing students with critical need, and outsourcing our students from campuses to community resources. Simultaneously, colleges and universities are facing more crises on campus than ever. College counselors are uniquely qualified to address these needs, however, unrealistic expectations of what counselors can do, and advocating for the rights of those we serve is always challenging. I wish to assist in the ethical political and social purposes in which we serve our campuses. I would welcome this charge to work on behalf of the college counselors of the ACCA.

My association with government service has been for just as long starting with my membership in the Army Reserve and the active Army. I have learned that what we can accomplish as a group is far more effective than trying to resolve issues by ourselves. I realize that we as an association have evolved; we are smaller, more diverse, but certainly still viable, as long as those who care want it to remain so.

My professional career has been dedicated to the professional development of counselors and counselor educators and as your president I will be able to continue my service to ACES. During my involvement as president of NCACES, and as part of the ACES Executive committee, I have seen the importance of creating a workflow for the association by documenting the annual work that we do and providing a legacy for future leaders. The recent employment of an ACES Executive Director provides us with an opportunity to enrich our member services and provide some continuity of our operations from year to year. I believe that I have the skills to lead our association in the digital world. My leadership role includes exploring how we communicate with members and the costs included in providing a professional journal. My leadership style as ACES president is to provide invested members the resources, risks, responsibilities, and acknowledgement of work well done. I see my role as president of ACES to encourage the engagement of graduate students and early career professionals through the support of veteran professionals. I benefited as a young professional from mentoring by faculty more seasoned than I, and I will seek ways to connect developing professionals with ACES leaders. I believe a sense of place is created through providing early career professionals with opportunities for involvement as current members and someday as our future leaders. I recognize the broadening diversity of the clients we serve and as an association we will be enriched by the broader inclusion of underrepresented professionals. I will take a proactive stance to encourage diversity at our table. ACES serves current professionals, as well as, future professionals. I am willing to take on this responsibility.

Dr. P\u00e9russe has several articles published about national trends in counselor education, and has co-edited two books. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am thrilled to have been nominated to run for President of ACES. I have been a member of ACES and NARACES since beginning my professional career as a counselor educator in 1997, and have enjoyed wonderful support from colleagues, and fantastic professional growth experiences at both the regional and national conferences. As I reviewed the Spring 2012 ACES Executive Council Meeting Minutes, I noted that ACES has a lot to celebrate. We have strong membership numbers, are financially stable, and the regions are planning their Fall Conferences. I would be honored to be part of the executive team as we plan for our national conference and beyond. Having served on the ACES Board for three years as both Secretary of ACES and President of NARACES, I see the role of the ACES President, not as a one-person leadership role, but rather as a team player. Further, I have recently been exposed to the concept of Policy December 2012 | Counseling Today | 67Governance, which holds as an essential tenant the idea that a president is only a president for a short while in the history of the association. Therefore, it is essential to establish long term \"End Goals\" for the association, and have each subsequent president and board work towards those end goals. Some of the end goals that have been articulated by our past presidents have included supporting our students, and creating authentic relationships with other counseling and non-counseling associations. I would see my role as carrying forward those same end goals already established, as well as soliciting from the board additional end goals that would encompass the views of all ACES members. This would enable us to create a vision of where we came from, where we are, and where we are going, for many boards to come. Governing Council Representative Gerard Lawson Professional background and experience I am an Associate Professor in the Counselor Education program at Virginia Tech, where I serve as the Program Area Leader and CACREP Liaison. I received my Ph.D. in Counselor Education from The College of William and Mary, and I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (Virginia), a National Certified Counselor, and an Approved Clinical Supervisor. I am on the Editorial Board for Counselor Education and Supervision and I was honored to be selected as the American Counseling Association's 2011 Robert Rencken Emerging Professional Leader award recipient. As a longtime member of ACA, ACES, and numerous other divisions, I have had the honor of serving in a variety of elected and/or appointed positions in the counseling field throughout my career. I served as ACES president (2011-2012), SACES President (2008-2009), and the Virginia ACES president (2007-2009), and I was president of the Virginia Counselors Association (2009-2010). In addition, I currently chair the ACA Taskforce on Crisis Response Planning, and I was the chair of the ACA Taskforce on Counselor Wellness and Impairment. These roles have allowed me a greater understanding of the ACA Governing Council process and the importance of the work that takes place there. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office In my several roles on the ACES Executive Council, I have worked closely with ACES' Governing Council Representatives, and I have come to understand the close partnership between ACES and ACA. I have seen ways in which the influence of ACES members can be appropriately channeled, as ACA considers issues and changes that will position the association for the next 60 years. My work as the Virginia Counselors Association president, as chair of two different task forces charged by ACA, and as ACES president has provided me with insight into the strategies for success in governing a diverse, vibrant, and growing organization. ACES members have been the driving force behind many of the positive changes in ACA. As the association responsible for the training of new counselors and the supervision of in-service counselors, ACES members understand the complexity of the counseling process and profession. Representatives serve for three-years and are able to see changes, not only for what they mean in the short-term, but also for how they will shape the long term growth and stability of ACA, and how the association will be best able to meet members' needs. Part of the reason that ACES has been so influential in the profession is that we have had the great good fortune of having several extraordinary Governing Council Representatives over the past several terms. I hope to be able to continue that tradition, and I would be honored to represent ACES as our Governing Council Representative. victoria Palmisano No information receivedSecretary Jennifer Jordan Professional background and experience I am an Associate Professor, field placement coordinator and Community Counseling Clinic Director at Winthrop University.

My leadership experience includes the following: T rustee for the ALGBTIC board; ALGBTIC and AMCD Committee Member for ACA's human rights and ethics committees; Awards Chair and Archivist for AMCD. I am a licensed professional counselor with more than 20 years of experience in the counseling field and clinical director of the McLean Counseling Group. Recent publication: McLean, R (2012).

Casebook for Counseling Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and T ransgender Persons and Their Families. Alexandria, VA: American Counseling Association. Recently received the UMES White Ribbon Campaign Appreciation Award for my efforts in promoting human dignity. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I joined ALGBTIC in 1995 when it was still an \"organizational affiliate\" of ACA. I can recall the validation and the affirmation I felt when I began to understand the full purpose of ALGBTIC \u2014 to promote awareness and understanding of LGBTQ people. I knew I wanted to be a part of this civil rights movement to change the culture of ACA and the counseling profession. During the past seventeen years, many changes have occurred within the division, ACA and, indeed, the world to expand freedom for sexual minorities to live healthier lives. I have served in a variety of capacities in ALGBTIC during my time as member. If I am elected to be your president I will continue to be guided by two primary goals: (1) to promote greater understanding and awareness of LGBTQ issues among counselors, related professionals, and citizens of good will, and (2) To provide resources to help advocates identify conditions which create barriers to the optimal development of LGBTQ people and use these resources to promote change. For example, I would like to see ALGBTIC play an integral role in preparing more counselors to be change agents in business and in the workplace to ensure that LGBTQ individuals have access to opportunities, privileges, goods, and services. In addition, I will work to continue to build our membership base and expand our revenue streams. Jane E. Rheineck Professional background and experience Jane E. Rheineck, Ph.D., LCPC, NCC is an Associate Professor at Northern Illinois University and has been a counselor educator for over seven years. Dr. Rheineck's has a clinical background that reflects a broad range of experiences that include adolescent inpatient residential treatment, outpatient counseling with adults and mental health counseling in the schools. Dr. Rheineck has been a member of ACA, AGLBTIC, and AADA for over 14 years. Dr. Rheineck's research and publications have focused primarily on lifespan developmental issues with the LGBT community. The broad range of LGBT topics Dr. Rheineck has presented and/or published in are LGBT advocacy on college campuses, career decision self- efficacy, and counseling gay youth and their families. Dr. Rheineck also created and developed an LGBT counseling course that is taught by her at NIU. Dr. Rheineck's leadership experience can be seen at the program level as a CACREP liaison and self-study author, as well at the national level as past treasurer and past president of AADA from 2007-2011. Other leadership experience includes, but not limited to career networking services at ACES (2005, 2007, and 2009) and at SACES (2012) as well as an executive board member of the LGBT studies program at NIU.Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am seeking the presidential office of the Association for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and T ransgender Issues in Counseling (AGLBTIC) because I believe a greater inclusion of lifespan diversity addressing the needs of the LGBT community is absent. I think my experience as past president of the Association for Adult Development and Aging and my perspective of developmental issues across the lifespan is a great asset to the members of AGLBTIC. I have been a member of the American Counseling Association and AGLBTIC for over 14 years. My experience as AADA president and treasurer has given me an understanding through practice how ACA divisions exercise their mission. As a lesbian, counselor educator, and professional counselor, I bring personal passion and professional experience. I have researched, presented, and taught on issues related to the LGBT community. As AADA president I co-created two events that focused on marginalized populations that generated over $5000 in revenue. Finally, as past president of AADA, I bring fiduciary knowledge, an understanding of organizational structure, and knowledge of the counseling issues pertinent to LGBT persons. In addition to endorsing the current initiatives and supporting the progress AGLBTIC has made, I also believe an integral component of progress is promotion through giving back. As president of AGLBTIC, I will coordinate a national conference providing development opportunities for counselors, students, and educators. I would also like to coordinate a fundraiser in the host community of the ACA conference during the tenure of my presidency to not only promote visibility of AGLBTIC, but also the LGBT community at large. I have a proven success record that I believe will open new doors for the counseling community and AGLBTIC's mission of providing ethically competent counseling practices pertaining to LGBT individuals and their families. 70 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Secretary Jeffrey D.

Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM) through the International Association of Exhibitions & Events (IAEE). Completed IAEE Future Leader's Institute (2007). Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I decided to return to the world of academics in 2011. With a history of interests in the social sciences, my self-administered career assessment indicated that the area of Community Counseling/Clinical Mental Health Counseling would be an excellent area of concentration for me. As I started taking classes, the majority of my projects focused on either the Elderly or LGBT issues; or sometimes a combination of the two. After an unsuccessful attempt to get involved in the newly-formed Illinois Counseling Association's IALGBTIC Division, I attended several functions of the ALGBTIC during the Annual Convention in San Francisco and was quite impressed with the division. During the convention it was brought to my attention that the division was looking for a candidate for the position of secretary. Knowing that I would like to focus on LGBTQIQA issues and having held the secretary position in my Kiwanis Club, I felt this would be a good opportunity to get effectively involved. If given the opportunity, I will commit myself to fulfilling the duties required by ALGBTIC for the position of secretary. I also hope that I get the opportunity to become involved in programs that will benefit the LGBT senior community. Whether I earn your nomination, am successful in the election, or stay as a regular member of the division, I hope I can play a role in making a difference for the LGBTQIQA population. Board Trustee I Joel Marc Filmore Professional background and experience I am an LPC and a Doctoral Candidate at Northern Illinois University. I've been involved in counseling leadership for the past two years on both state and national levels with my involvement in the Illinois Counseling Association's Governing Council as well as the Co- Chair of the Association for LGBT Issues in Counseling's (ALGBTIC) Affirmative Counseling and Social Justice Committee (a position I have held for two years). I have received numerous awards for my work with/within the LGBT community including the Emerging Leader Award 2011-12 presented by ALGBTIC at the annual ACA conference in New Orleans. I've also received a number of awards from my university for my work, including the Orville Jones International T ravel Scholarship to present on LGBT Issues in China, and the NIU Ally Award for advocacy work on behalf of the LGBT community. I am a member of ACA, AMHCA, AMCD, ALGBTIC, and numerous state-level counseling associations. I co-created the Illinois Association for LGBT Issues in Counseling for which I am the President-Elect and I've had the pleasure of co- authoring an article on LGBT issues with Dr. Michael Chaney and Dr. Kris Goodrich which was published in the May 2011 issue of Counseling Today. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I have been actively involved with ALGBTIC since beginning my doctoral program at Northern Illinois University. Prior to my participation I began an exploratory inquiry into the organization when Dr. Michael Kocet was president. Through my communication with Dr. Kocet I developed a strong passion for the work that ALGBTIC does in providing education and support to clinicians and students as a means of developing their attitude, knowledge, and skills related to the LGBT population. Since that time, I have been intentional about the work that I do, both in my academic and professional environment, not only increase to my knowledge and understanding of LGBT issues but also to become an emerging leader in the field of LGBT multicultural competency. I am seeking a position as Board T rustee as a means of continuing that educational growth process. I believe that as a biracial, gay, clinician I can bring a unique perspective to the leadership of ALGBTIC and it is my hopes that I can be a positive representative of ALGBTIC for years to come.

I have presented at APA, WPATH, and Southern Comfort Conference. I am December 2012 | Counseling Today | 71certified in nonviolent crisis intervention and suicide prevention. Since 2008, I have prized working as a volunteer facilitator for LGBTQ youth support groups in Atlanta. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Leadership within the LGBTQ community has been a long-time passion of mine, particularly where issues of wellness are concerned. I am excited for the possibility of extending my leadership knowledge, skills, and abilities to ALGBTIC as a Grad Student T rustee. I have four years of combined experience serving on two non-profit boards of directors, including serving as board president for one year. Furthermore, I am committed to promoting awareness of LGBTQ issues and individuals, including advancing standards of care, increasing scholarship, and expanding our conceptualization of LGBTQ individuals as people with complex and multifaceted identities, all of which are relevant to development and liberation. I would be thrilled to serve as a Grad Student T rustee! Michael Stephens Professional background and experience I am currently the graduate assistant at my university's (University of Illinois- Springfield) Lgbtqa Resource Office. I am also studying with a dual focus of individual counseling as well as Marriage and Family Systems. My undergraduate research was based upon multicultural topics as well. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office With my experience from working at my campus' LGBTQA Resource office, I think that I would be a really good candidate for this position. One of my main duties at my job is serving as a liaison between the students on my campus and raising their concerns with our administration. I also schedule, plan, coordinate, and run all of our offices' events. This year I also headed the Student Affairs LGBTQA task force looking for instances where offices of student affairs inclusion to lgbtq students could be improved. I think that I could do the same duty for graduate students issues within the ALGBTIC mission. I think a major interest to pursue in this position would be looking at counselor education programs and devise ways of better advocating for lgtbq students. I think this is something that is very needed and important depending on the location of the program and is something that I would be interested in helping with. ASSOCIATION FOR MULTICULTURAL COUNSELING AND DEvELOPMENT President-Elect Carlos P. h ipolito-Delgado Professional background and experience I am an assistant professor of school counseling at California State University, Long Beach. I earned my Ph.D. in Counselor Education from the University of Maryland College Park. I am the co-editor of the text Elements of Culture in Counseling and have published book chapters, journal articles, and opinion editorials on the topics of social justice and multicultural counseling. My research interests include the ethnic identity development of Chicanas/os and Latinas/os, the effects of internalized racism on communities of color, training to improve the cultural competence of counselors, and the sociopolitical development of students of color. I am co-primary investigator on a grant, funded by the Spencer Foundation that seeks to foster the sociopolitical development of marginalized youth. In March of 2011 I was honored with the Young Emerging Leader Award by AMCD. I served as the T reasurer for the Counselors for Social Justice for the past three years and as the Conference Planning Committee Chair for AMCD for the past two years. I serve on the editorial board for the Journal of Counseling and Development and as an Ad Hoc Reviewer for the Journal of Social Action Research in Counseling and Psychology.Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I seek the office of president to honor those who have paved the way for me and to expand opportunities for those who follow. If elected president, I see my role as being a servant to the general membership and responding to your needs and concerns. Further, I would do what is necessary to honor the beautiful history of this association and to position the association to be a leader in the multicultural counseling movement. If elected president of AMCD I would seek to n Increase fiscal and governing transparency, so that the membership knows how their dues are being spent and the decisions made by their elected leader n Provide opportunities for continuing education and professional development as part of your membership benefits throughout the calendar year n Expand the AMCD mentorship program so that more students could benefit from the wisdom and leadership training provided by our elders and so that we might expand the pool of future leaders. n Create a committee to revisit the multicultural competencies. These competences are one of the seminal works of our association. Given the advancements in the multicultural field, the changing demographics of the country, and the expansion of social media, it seems wise to re- examine best practices in multicultural counseling. I feel that my years of service to AMCD make me qualified to serve as president. As conference coordinator I have worked with the past two presidents and governing boards. Through these experiences I have learned the traits of a successful leader and the importance of communication. I have also served as a liaison to ACA and have developed excellent relationships with the staff. If elected president I will do my best to represent you proudly and to further the mission of AMCD. 72 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012Rosemarie Woodruff Professional background and experience Educational Background: PhD in Educational Psychology, Masters in Counseling, Bachelors in Secondary Education. Having worked for more than 40 years at the University of Hawai'i, Manoa (UHM) Campus, I have held positions in the counseling center of psychometrist, career placement specialist, learning assistance specialist, and outreach coordinator that included personal/ career counseling responsibilities. I continue to counsel students in my current position as director of the UHM Learning Assistance Center. Leadership and service positions include: Office of Student Affairs (OSA) Assembly Chair/ One of the Founders, OSA Faculty Senate Chair/One of the Founders, All Campus Council of Faculty Senate Chairs, Hawai'i Counseling Association President, ACA Western Region Chair and 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling Delegate, AMCD On-Site Conference Chair, AMCD Western Region Representative, College Reading and Learning Association T reasurer. I am also a member of the Association for Creativity in Counseling, American Educational Research Association, Association for Psychological Type, and Hawaii International Dyslexia Association. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Service defines my professional, personal, and spiritual life. When I was asked to run for AMCD president, I decided to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly support what I believe in. As a leader, my goal is to weave individual perspectives and needs into a coherent whole. It is my role to seek out and to develop the unique strengths of each individual so that one experiences a sense of competence, belonging, and contributing to the larger community \u2014 sprinkled with fun and laughter. The key is in a relationship with others that is grounded in awareness and understanding, and sustained by respect and appreciation for differences. Multiculturalism is an integral part of each human being and being human means to be open to contrasts that may generate conflict, and persist in welcoming and integrating these differences in a unifying whole. This process applies to the developing individual, family, community, state, country, and globally, as well as to the interaction among the multiple facets of our life. This is not a simple task. It is a constant striving for balance, rhythm, peace, harmony, and love. Many years ago attending a cross- cultural counseling training with Paul Pedersen, I recall him slowly looking around at the people in the session and saying, \"look to yourself.\" Much later in life in another training session I was given the task of approaching rather than avoiding the person in the room who was making me feel uncomfortable. These two gems of experience have taught me the need to be open to what is perceived negatively and examine what is in myself that may be preventing considering a different perspective, accepting another person, and developing as a multiculturally competent person. A fully functioning professional counselor is a multicultural being. Therefore, all members of ACA should consider joining AMCD. North Atlantic Regional Representative Tiphanie Gonzalez Professional background and experience Dr. Tiphanie Gonzalez is an Assistant Professor of School Counseling at CUNY Brooklyn College. She received a PhD in Counselor Education from the University of Central Florida and a MS in Counseling Services with an emphasis in School Counseling from the State University of New York at Oswego. Dr. Gonzalez is an active member of the American Counseling Association (ACA), Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development (AMCD), Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES), the North Atlantic Regional Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (NARACES), the National Association for Holmes Scholar Alumni (NAHSA) and the American Counseling Association - NY (ACA-NY), where she is currently serving as the organizations secretary. Dr. Gonzalez is passionate about working with at-risk youth and training professional counselors to work in underserved populations. She shares this passion through her teachings, writings, and presentations. She has been awarded the title as one of several 2012 Emerging Leaders by NARACES as a New Professional in the field of Counselor Education. She looks forward continuing to grow as a Counselor Educator in all of its many roles. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development (AMCD) is an organization that prides itself in working with the amazing diversity we encounter in our day to day lives both nationally and internationally. As a member of AMCD I have been given the opportunity to learn from scholars, colleagues, and mentors and in turn have been given the tools to share information with my colleagues, mentees, and students. Sharing information that can prepare for activism, an understanding of social justice and civil rights, particularly within the field of counseling. I am happy to be nominated for the position of North Atlantic Regional Rep. I have a strong appreciation for the work that is done through AMCD and believe that it is important that as Counselors and Counselor Educators we continue to advocate for equity across cultures. This begins with our ability to connect and communicate, to share services and programming. If given the opportunity to be the North Atlantic Regional Rep I gladly take on the task of communicating between my peers in the North Atlantic Region and those in AMCD leadership voicing opinions, concerns, hopes, and ideas. Southern Regional Representative Krystle Dorsey No information received December 2012 | Counseling Today | 73Student Representative Kristopher G. hall Professional background and experience I completed my graduate work at Seton Hall University earning both Masters and Education Specialist degrees in Professional Counseling. After graduation, I remained in the NY/NJ area while working for the Hudson County Child Abuse Prevention Center in Jersey City, NJ as well as the Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation in Queens, NY. My time with these agencies allowed me to work with very diverse populations ranging from at-risk-youth, to college bound youth, as well as families, and inmates. During this time I engaged in individual counseling, emotional growth groups, psychoeducational groups, and career/college planning. Currently, I am a second year doctoral student at the University of Central Florida studying Counselor Education and Supervision. I am a Licensed Associate Counselor in the state of NJ (where I hope to apply for full licensure in November) as well as a Registered Mental Health Intern in the state of FL. Additionally, I am a member of the AMCD branch of the ACA as well as a Holmes Scholar at my current institution. My research interests include applying microskills training to diverse populations, multicultural pedagogy, cultural empathy, and Relational-Cultural Theory. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office My experiences have afforded me the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients. During this time, I saw how important multicultural concerns were to the counseling profession. Although I was the same race as some of my clients, our experiences varied greatly. I came in contact with parents struggling to be reunited with their children as well as inmates who made too many wrong choices, and even teens struggling to find their identity. From these experiences I learned first-hand that our worldviews can be vastly different from the people who we are trying to help. During this time, I did not only learn about multiculturalism in the sense of an individual's race, I learned about true diversity. I would like to continue this leaning as the student representative of the AMCD. My commitment to understanding diversity and multicultural skill development is what primarily moved me to complete my terminal degree. This same commitment fuels my interest in being the student representative for AMCD. As the student representative, I can use my experiences and knowledge, from both my work as a counselor and my endeavors as a doctoral student, to represent the student perspective regarding diversity concerns as they relate to AMCD. I would like to expand the current mentoring program, linking more students with working professionals and those in the professorate. Co-directing a mentoring program in the field showed me how invaluable guidance and networking can be to career and personal development. My field experience has given me a unique perspective as well as created a commitment to diversity, which I feel would complement AMCD and I would be honored to the organization's student representative. Anna Flores Locke Professional background and experience My counseling experience focused on representing the needs of underrepresented populations and advocating for strength-based counseling practices. In my role as a counselor and supervisor, I specialized in child and family therapy, case management, and advocacy. The needs of the diverse clientele served at the non-profit urban agencies where I worked included: behavioral and emotional management, academic challenges, social skills building, and meeting basic living requirements. After six years in this role, I returned to graduate school to earn a doctoral degree in Counselor Education. I am currently in my second year, as a doctoral fellow, at Montclair State University (MSU) in New Jersey. I have a Master's degree in counseling psychology and am licensed as a professional counselor in New Jersey and Illinois. I am a member of the following organizations: American Counseling Association, Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development, New Jersey Counseling Association (NJCA), New Jersey Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, Chi Sigma Iota, and the University of Chicago Latino Alumni Affinity Group. I serve as a member of the NJCA Committee for Graduate Students and New Professionals and as a student representative for the Dean's Advisory Council and Committee on Increasing Doctoral Students-of-Color at MSU. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Information not provided vice President-Asian American Concerns Mei Tang Professional background and experience Mei Tang, Ph. D., Professor of Counselor Education, has been working at the University of Cincinnati for 16 years, and has actively published and presented in the areas of career development and assessment, counseling ethnic minorities, counseling school- age population, and cross-cultural issues in counselor education in ACA journals and conferences.

She has served on editorial boards of three ACA journals, as a committee member of ACA's Research and Knowledge Committee, NCDA/ACES commission on career development education and training. Her community services included consultation with local school district to help at-risk youth through guidance curriculum revision and grant funded prevention projects. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I have been committed to promote understanding of cross-cultural issues in counseling, particularly pertaining to Asian Americans, through my teaching, research and services for the past 16 years. Asian Americans are a diverse group, however, the awareness of the diversity within the group is still lacking. There 74 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012are multiple reasons for underutilization of mental health services by Asian Americans. As counseling professionals, we need to not only continually advance research about Asian Americans and educate ourselves and future counselors to be competent in working with diverse population, but also increase awareness of mental health issues and wellness among Asian American community. To achieve these goals, I think it is important 1) to broaden and deepen the research about Asian Americans; 2) to provide more resources and literature to dispel misconceptions and stereotypes about Asian Americans; 3) to lead the effort of developing best practice for counseling Asian Americans that are based on theory and evidence; 4) to increase community partnership inside and outside of the Asian American community to promote mutual understanding and wellness. AMERICAN REhABILITATION COUNSELING ASSOCIATION President-Elect Nathalie Mizelle No information received David Staten Professional background and experience I received my Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Counselor Education from the University of Iowa and my Master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling from South Carolina State University. I am a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC), National Certified Counselor (NCC), Board Certified Professional Counselor (BCPC), Board Certified Coach (BCC), and Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in South Carolina. I am currently an Associate Professor at South Carolina State University. I have worked as a Rehabilitation Counselor Educator for the past 12 years. Additionally, I have over 10 years of experience as the program director of a CORE accredited rehabilitation counseling program and several years of experience serving as Department Chair. I also have successfully managed several million dollars of external grant funds from agencies such as RSA, NIDRR, and USDA. Currently, I am the Project Director for two RSA Long-Term T raining grants. Moreover, in 2007, I received the RSA Commissioner's Award for Exemplary Rehabilitation Counseling Programs. I first joined ACA in 1993 and I am currently a member of several professional associations. My professional association membership includes ACA, ARCA, NRA, IARP , NAMRC, and ABVE. I also serve on the Board of Directors for the Orangeburg, South Carolina Chapter of Rotary International. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I embrace a vision of a unified profession for rehabilitation counseling. I will seek to build on the hard work of the past ARCA Presidents to move our organization closer to unification. Given ARCA's alignment as a subdivision of ACA, I believe that this organization is best suited to advance the agenda of the rehabilitation counseling profession. My goals as president of ARCA are threefold. First, I will actively promote the continued marketing and awareness of the rehabilitation counseling profession. This includes continuing to advocate for the inclusion of rehabilitation counselors as it pertains to credentialing and state licensure laws. Second, I will commit to developing a detailed recruitment and retention plan for ARCA membership. Several recent studies indicate that membership in rehabilitation counseling professional organizations have significantly declined over the past two decades. Given the many challenges facing the rehabilitation counseling community, we can no longer afford to be fragmented into separate organizations that ultimate dilute our voices as rehabilitation counselors. Thus, I will continue to advocate for the unification of the profession. Thirdly, as the President of ARCA, I will be afforded the opportunity to continue this organization's legacy of advocating for with individuals with disabilities and the promotion of excellence in the rehabilitation counseling profession. I have been extremely fortunate to have been mentored by some of the most successful rehabilitation counseling professionals in the nation, many of whom have been leaders in ACA, ARCA, and CORE. As a result of these mentoring, academic, and personal experiences, I believe that I am uniquely prepared to lead ARCA at this appointed time. If elected, I will work tenaciously to advance the mission and objectives of the organization. Secretary Quiteya D.

Practice CredentialsCertified Rehabilitation Counselor Licensed Professional Counselor Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Counting summer jobs as a high school and college student when I was a camp counselor at a community mental health center and an orderly at a rehabilitation hospital, I have worked in the field of rehabilitation for the past 44 years. Over that period, I have had the privilege to work with a wide variety of rehabilitation consumers, providers, and educators who have enhanced my understanding of the disability experience and strengthened my commitment to the rehabilitation counseling profession. The length of this involvement in the field has allowed me to cultivate a diverse network of colleagues in the disability, rehabilitation, education, and advocacy communities. It has also enabled me to develop many skills that I believe are needed in members of a professional association board. These include: listening skills (not just in meetings but also to the voices of constituents who are not present but who will be affected by the board's decisions); compromise and consensus-building skills; writing and editing skills; marketing and outreach skills. Since 2000, I have served as an Associate Editor of ARCA's peer-reviewed journal, Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin; for seven years before that, I was the Associate Editor of the peer-reviewed journal, Rehabilitation Education. In these roles, in addition to reviewing and editing manuscripts, I facilitated the submission and publication of contributions from individuals outside the traditional author and readership groups. The annual ACA conference is an important gathering and rejuvenating opportunity for ARCA members, and the ideal opportunity to spark or sustain collaborative relationships with other ACA partners. I have extensive experience in program planning and presentation at national conferences. I believe I will bring fresh ideas to the ARCA Board, as well as the benefit of decades of experience. Thanks for the opportunity to share my background and perspective. ASSOCIATION FOR SPIRITUAL , EThICAL AND RELIGIOUS vALUES IN COUNSELING President-Elect harriet L. Glosoff Professional background and experience I am a professor of Counseling at Montclair State University, an LPC, NCC, and Approved Clinical Supervisor. I received my PhD from American University (1994) and my M.A. from the University of Maryland (1977). My professional background includes teaching, research, and extensive experience in providing clinical 76 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012supervision and counseling services in a variety of practice settings including community agencies, inpatient mental health, school (K-higher education), and private practice. I have worked with a broad range of populations from diverse racial/ethnic, religious and socioeconomic groups and have published and presented on a variety of topics with a focus in the areas of ethics, spirituality, preparing counselors as social justice advocates, and clinical supervision. I am currently serving on the ASERVIC Board, as co-chair of the 2014 Conference Committee, and as a member of the Ethics Committee. I have served on the 2012 Conference Committee, and as chair of the Ethics Committee, chair of the journal editor search, and member of the Teaching Modules Committee. In addition to my affiliation with ASERVIC, I am a long standing member of ACA, ACES, AMCD, CSJ, ASGW, ALGBTIC, and CSI and have held numerous leadership positions, which I briefly describe in the next section. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am honored to have been nominated to be a candidate for the office of ASERVIC President-Elect. My qualifications for this office include previous work on the ASERVIC board and my participation in a variety of service leadership roles within ACA and its divisions. Examples of my service outside of my work with ASERVIC include being: a member of the ACES Best Practices in Clinical Supervision Task Force, ACES president and secretary, co-chair of the ACA Ethics Committee, member of ACA Code of Ethics Revision Task Forces (2005 and 1995 Codes), SACES President, and VA-AMCD Co-President. I first joined ASERVIC over twenty years ago because it is an organization that best fits with three key consistent themes in my own professional life: the exploration of ethical practice in counseling, supervision, and counselor education; the belief that counselors need to approach our work from a holistic perspective, addressing mind, body, and spirit; and a passion for finding effective ways to prepare counselors to address societal issues that interfere with the mental health and well-being of invidious and communities. If elected, I will strive to increase collaboration with other divisions and organizations to fulfill the mission of ASERVIC to explore, develop, and research \"evolving spiritual, ethical, and religious values as they relate to the person, to society, and to the profession ...\" I would also like to continue to build on initiatives already in place to enhance services to ASERVIC members (e.g., teaching modules, online professional development opportunities) and to increase support to state ASERVIC chapters. Finally, I will work to invite ever increasingly diverse voices to the table to guide the work of ASERVIC. I have been a member of ASERVIC for many years and I would consider it a privilege to serve ASERVIC in this role. W. Bryce hagedorn Professional background and experience Allow me to begin broadly and then I'll narrow to my work specifically with ASERVIC. First, my doctoral degree is from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I currently work as the Program Director of Counselor Education at the University of Central Florida. In addition to my work at the University, I maintain a small private practice as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, a Nationally Certified Counselor, a Master Addiction Counselor, and a Qualified Clinical Supervisor for the state of Florida. One of my areas of specialty is in spirituality and counseling. I have been actively involved with ASERVIC for 15 years, beginning in 1998 as the first webmaster for the association. Since that time, I have served on the Board of Directors; as a member of the Summit on Spirituality II; as the Chair for such committees as the Spirituality and Religious Values Committee, the Technology Committee, and the Convention Steering Technology Subcommittee; and as a member of the Strategic Planning Committee, the State Divisions Committee, and the Convention Steering Program Subcommittee. Finally, I was the grateful recipient of ASERVIC's Humanitarian Award in 2008 and the Biggs-Pine Award for Scholarly Contribution to Counseling and Values in 2010.Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I'd like to speak more specifically about several of my previous contributions as these have played an important role in my desire to lead ASERVIC as its future president. First, throughout my years as a Board Member, I had the honor of serving alongside three presidents and Executive Committees that navigated association changes, opportunities, and set-backs both decisively and with grace. Attending both Fall and Spring board meetings allowed me to see the continuity necessary to helping move the association forward (a lesson I hope to bring to my time as president). Another experience I'd like to share began with my invitation to serve on the Summit on Spirituality II. This group was tasked with using the collective knowledge and experience of experts in counseling and spiritualty to accomplish several goals. T remendous progress was made in each identified area and again, I was honored to serve alongside some of the most well-known and respected experts in our field. My hope, as your future president, would be to continue to pursue these initiatives by following in the footsteps of my predecessors. Specifically, I'd like to see elements of the Spiritual Competencies infused more into the ACA Code of Ethics, the NBCC Code of Ethics, and the CACREP Accreditation Standards. A loft goal perhaps, but I believe it's time to move forward. Similarly, I would like to see a set of established standards that can help inform clients as to those counselors who would be sensitive to their spiritual and religious preferences. Finally, our biannual conferences have been outstanding and I look forward to contributing to the next one wholeheartedly. Overall, I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experiences from the variety of positions that I've held with ASERVIC (as well as my other professional experiences) as its next president.

Community Service: President: Sikh Society of Kentucky Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am honored to be nominated for the president-elect of ASERVIC. Since 1996, when I started a graduate course in Spirituality in Counseling at the University of Louisville, I have become strongly committed and passionate about the significance and the cause of our association. Based on my personal interest and extensive experiences in teaching, research, and professional presentations, I feel that I am uniquely qualified to serve as the president of ASERVIC. If elected, I will focus on the multi-year strategic planning to build on the legacy of our leaders, teachers, and researchers, our shining luminaries and pioneers. To enhance our association's role, visibility, and importance in the field of counseling, \"Commitment, Collaboration and Competence\" will be the key words of my presidency.

Board of Directors Cecile Brennan Professional background and experience Presently, I am the coordinator of the Counselor Education Program at John Carroll University and a professional clinical counselor in private practice. I am a member of ACA, ACES, ASERVIC, and OCA. As a scholar, my areas of interest are in ethics education and in the way society influences healthy social and psychological development. My interest in the field of spirituality has led me to develop a certificate program at John Carroll University focusing on spiritual care & counseling. Prior to my employment at John Carroll, I have worked at a number of other educational institutions. My experience has ranged from counseling middle-school students, to teaching ethics to high school seniors, to training future business people in business communication. In addition, I have counseled in a number of different settings: schools, homeless shelters, agencies, and private practices. This diversity of experience has broadened me both personally and professionally. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office My longstanding interest in the convergence of spirituality and counseling has led me to seek greater involvement in ASERVIC. Both as a practitioner in private practice and as a counselor educator, I am struck by the need to educate counselors about the spiritual dimensions of their clients' lives. ASERVIC has been at the forefront of this effort with the development of the spiritual competencies and with their efforts, through the annual conference, to develop a forum where research and experiences can be shared. I would be honored to be given the opportunity to assist in this effort by supporting the organization and by promoting its work to the wider community of counselors. If I am fortunate enough to be elected to the Board, I will be willing to serve where needed. I do have a particular interest in trying to expand the annual conference in order to attract new members and promote the organization's mission. In a society where polarization is the norm, the ASERVIC mission of creating an environment that empowers and enables the expression of spiritual, ethical, and religious values is much needed. Both the conference and the journal, Counseling and Values, foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding very different from what usually occurs when religious or spiritual issues are discussed. In particular, the 78 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012conference provides a lived experience of the mission as participants see people with very different perspectives and beliefs listen and learn from one another. All counselors, and indeed all who work with others in an interpersonal way, would benefit greatly from this experience. Thank you for considering my candidacy for the Board of ASERVIC. Christopher Christmas Professional background and experience Christopher Christmas has been interested in integrating spirituality and religion into counseling for as long as he's been in the counseling profession.

He has also presented at national, regional, and state conferences including the ACA Conference, ACES Conference, and ASERVIC Conference on Spirituality, AMHCA Conference, SACES Conference, and the Florida Counseling Association Annual Convention. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am seeking to be a board member of ASERVIC because I am have been focused as a practitioner, and now as an emerging researcher and scholar, on the integration of spirituality and religion into counseling. As a practitioner, I have explicitly integrated spirituality and religion into individual, family, and group therapy with clients from diverse spiritual and religious backgrounds. As a scholar, I have recently published an article proposing a model for incorporating spirituality into group work and am currently studying demonstrated spiritual and religious competencies in advanced counseling students. I am also serving the members of the state branch of Florida as the FASERVIC President. With spirituality and religion contributing to the worldview of so many of the clients that practitioners and counseling students serve, it is important to develop and assess competence in this area. I am grateful to the leadership and members of ASERVIC who have already done so much work to bring the integration of spirituality and religion in counseling to the forefront in the counseling journals and in textbooks focused on this subject. My hope is to add to their work by: 1. Continuing to advocate for the spiritual competencies to be more consistently infused into counselor education programs. 2. Improving and developing and ways of assessing practitioners' and counselor educators' competencies for addressing spiritual and religious issues in counseling. 3. Researching the effectiveness of different approaches to educating counseling students and practitioners on utilizing spiritual competencies in counseling. 4. Supporting counseling programs and practitioners by sharing the developing body of knowledge on spiritual competence in counseling so that clients can be better served. Ryan D.

Dr. Foster is assistant editor for the Journal of Near-Death Studies. He is a member of ACA, the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, the Association for Spiritual, Ethical, and Religious Values in Counseling, and the International Association for Near-Death Studies. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am seeking the office of board member of ASERVIC for two primary reasons: first, I want to nurture the relationship between counseling practitioners and educators who are part of ASERVIC and recognize the contributions that practitioners make to ASERVIC's mission. Second, I want to increase graduate student involvement at the master's and doctoral levels. I am a counseling practitioner and a fulltime counselor educator. In this capacity, I have integrated my clinical work with emerging literature in spirituality and ethics. I am primarily interested in establishing best practices in working with clients who encounter spiritual and/or transpersonal concerns. Because of my commitment to both scholarship and practice, I first authored a book chapter directed at increased counseling practitioners' knowledge of spiritual and transpersonal development in the second edition of Integrating Spirituality and Religion into Counseling. December 2012 | Counseling Today | 79I also first authored a book chapter aimed at practical applications of research on near-death experiences in The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences. Furthermore, I am currently directing the ASERVIC monograph project which is designed as a resource for practitioners who may encounter clients who report a variety of spiritual and/or transpersonal experiences. Additionally, I am committed to graduate student involvement and awareness of ethics. Recently, I first authored an article published in Counseling and Values concerned with the ethics of student-faculty scholarly collaborations. Graduate students are the next emerging leaders in our field and I believe in the utmost importance of mentoring them based on aspirational values and ethics that support their services to clients and the counseling profession. As a counselor educator and practitioner, I believe in bridging the gap between research and practice. As a board member for ASERVIC, I would work to involve counseling practitioners, educators, and students so that we are all working toward strengthening ASERVIC's mission and competencies. victoria Junior Professional background and experience Victoria Junior, PhD, LPC, is an Associ- ate Professor for the Counseling program at Argosy University, Atlanta campus.

ASERVIC has a rich history and solid foundation and I look forward to continuing that tradition. I would like to work on developing policies and practices which will lead to greater inclusivity and will result in strengthening our organization.

There is magic in the way a group comes together for the mutual benefit of members. ASGW is well-positioned to be a global leader in the ethical and evidence-based practice of group work. Through the process of visioning and strategic planning, ASGW leadership has engaged in listening to our members and understanding their needs. I would continue to build on these gains made by previous leaders.

During the planning process, I have the opportunity to work closely with both the leaders and members of ASGW and I have gained immense insight into where our division is right now and where we can grow. In my role as President-Elect I will balance support with the challenge to grow. I have been fortunate to play a role in many of the Executive Board's decisions to strengthen the internal structure of our association. As the current chair of the ASGW Professional Development Committee I can also report that we are working to provide more benefits to existing members. Some of the challenges we face in moving forward are growing our membership and responding to the diverse needs of our members and the clients we serve. To grow our membership, I would like to see us collaborate more directly with other divisions in both research and practice and share our expertise December 2012 | Counseling Today | 81with other professionals. I would also like ASGW to have more presence as a leader and advocate supporting group work researchers and practitioners internationally. Responding to diverse needs of members and clients requires us to take an active and visible lead as advocates. As leaders and advocates we can connect to a wide range of professionals and settings where group work is practiced to expand our collective knowledge base and establish best practice guidelines wherever group work is practiced. I am excited and grateful for this opportunity. If elected as President-Elect, you can expect me to serve ASGW members and the association by effectively balancing serious leadership with warmth and enthusiasm.

Chinw\u00e9 Uwah Williams Professional background and experience I am currently in my third year as Assistant Professor in the Counseling Department at Argosy University, Atlanta. I graduated from Georgia State University with a Ph.D. in Counselor Education and a Master's degree in Community Counseling from the University of Georgia. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor and a National Certified Counselor. I have authored several articles in the areas of group work and school counseling. I have presented at numerous national and international conferences. My awards and honors include: the Association of Specialists in Group Work (ASGW) 2011 President's Award for service to the organization, selection for the Southern Association Counselor Education and Supervision (SACES) Emerging Leaders Program (2010); ASGW Emerging Leaders Workshop (2010); Courtland C. Lee Multicultural Excellence in Scholarship Award; Peg Carroll and Ross T rust Scholarship Awards; and Chi Sigma Iota International (CSI) Outstanding Research Award. In my professional career, I have been honored to serve in many leadership positions. I served as President of the Licensed Professional Counselors Association-Student Affiliate Organization. I served as T reasurer of Chi Sigma Iota (Chi Epsilon) and have been a CSI International Awards Committee member since 2009. I am currently Co- chair of ASGW's Graduate Student and New Professionals Committee. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I was introduced to ASGW as a graduate student and I can vividly remember attending my first ASGW conference in St. Petersburg, Florida four years ago. While participating in a session, I imagined how I might become more involved in this great organization. Since then, ASGW has been my professional \"home\" and a wonderful means of reconnecting with amazing professionals in our field. Shortly thereafter, I was fortunate to be selected as a participant in ASGW Emerging Leaders workshop hosted by the very talented duo Bree and Richard Hayes. At the close of the workshop, we were able to meet members of the Executive Board. My excitement grew and I was inspired to inquire about specific ways to get involved. I started my service assisting with aspects of the 2011 ASGW and ACA conference planning. Since then, I have had the opportunity to serve as Co-chair of ASGW Graduate Student and New Professionals Committee (2010-current). Our committee has encouraged opportunities for graduate student and new professional involvement in ASGW and ACA. My different roles in ASGW have sharpened my awareness of the needs of our members and have increased my desire to be even more active and connected with the organization's mission. As a counselor educator, my teaching methods are greatly influenced by many of the principles of group work. My interpersonal style is guided by values of relationship and community building. I believe that my organizational skills, 82 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012attention to detail and collaborative spirit are a good match for the position of Secretary. With a strong desire to give back to the association that has shaped much of my early career as a school counselor, mental health professional and teacher-researcher, I seek the position of ASGW Secretary to continue my service to this great organization, its members and our consumers.

I have had extensive administrative and consultation experience directing state and federally funded programs and holding administrative positions at 4 universities. Complementing the leadership experience is a comprehensive consulting/training background with over 100 organizations, providing a solid understanding of organizational development and change. Accompanying the leadership and consultation experience is my long standing commitment and work in social justice, beginning with Upward Bound (summer counselor and later Director). All of these experiences have contributed to my development and ongoing commitment as a multicultural social justice counselor, my ongoing leadership in CSJ Leadership Development Projects, Giving Back to the Community Projects, and Social Justice Academies, and my current work at George Mason University where I helped create a nationally recognized training program emphasizing social justice. Affiliated and supporting the GMU program is the Diversity Research and Action Center and Counselors Without Borders, two organizations that I founded and now direct. If elected as President of CSJ I would have 3 visionary goals. One is to expand membership by underscoring the uniqueness of CSJ and aligning us with our commitment to social justice. This involves redefining membership to include dues and a 5% commitment to social justice action in one's community. T wo, is to initiate social justice action projects and a website structure (low cost podcasts, webinars, and discussion boards) to support members' social justice action projects. Three is to develop a strategic plan in collaboration with the Board and CSJ members to achieve greater visibility and influence within the ACA community.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office As President-Elect for CSJ I would like to continue the focused efforts of looking at how advocacy affects our client's lives. Although my passion lies with children, teenagers, and families, I believe that an effective advocate is able to understand the multiple systems our clients face on a daily level. I would like counselors to share Best Practices when advocating within these multiple systems. Whether working in a rural, suburban, or urban environment each one of us have a specialized expertise that can be shared, as the common goal for CSJ is to increase advocacy on multiple domain levels. As a counseling practitioner, I envision a tighter community of colleagues in the field sharing and learning from each other. While the US is a wonderful December 2012 | Counseling Today | 83diverse community, I believe it is our job to ensure that socially just practices are being upheld \u2014 beginning in the community all the way up through legislation. Together we can continue to decrease the disparities that exist in our society; locally & globally. I look forward to moving our profession and dedication to a more socially just world forward. During my tenure, I would like to work with the members of CSJ to offer free web-based trainings, including: working with military personnel & their families, assisting with immigration advocacy, and working with foster youth & legislation to name a few. Practitioners and Counselor Educators across the US (and beyond) have a plethora of untapped advocacy strategies and I would like to facilitate the means of bringing everyone together. When working with children in San Francisco, CA I have a firm stance that they are all my children. I bring this to the field of advocacy in that I believe we can all work together to bring change.

Eva \"Dee\" Sloan Professional background and experience I am an Assistant Professor in the Counseling Department with the University of Houston-Clear Lake. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor, a National Certified Counselor, and a Registered Play Therapist. I am currently serving as the Secretary for the Texas Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (TACES), and co-chair for the Multicultural Interest Network for the Southern Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (SACES).

It is my belief that to truly be a representative of social justice, one has to serve as well as teach and research. My service to all organizations, as well as my research agenda, is guided by a desire to confront issues of marginalization and oppression in all areas of my work and my personal life. I continually strive to address the injustices in society, from microaggressions to humiliation in all forms and as an individual who trains future counselors; I strive to instill that passion in my students as well.

She currently serves on the CSJ Membership Committee and worked with the Award Nominating Committee. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am seeking the office of the Counseling Representative for CSJ because I believe I can add an innovative and creative perspective to an already superb group of people. I am active in the movement of social justice both in the counseling field and academia. Your mission: \"... to promote social justice in our society through confronting oppressive systems of power and privilege that affect professional counselors and our clients and to assist in the positive change in our society through the professional development of counselors\" rings true for me as it summarizes my approach when assessing clients and providing counseling services. I am not only committed to this mission, but the intent to expand the scope of social justice within the CSJ division and beyond. Because of my passion of advocating for the disenfranchised, I have conducted research on how fellow practicing counselors engage in and conduct social justice work. Continuing to inform counseling practice would be a primary goal, as well as offering information and creating ways to consider and include voices of practicing counselors. Further, in this office I wish to: Foster the efforts of the division to grow the professional development opportunities for counselors, Promote innovative social justice clinical interventions for counseling practice, Advancing CSJ's mission with a focus on ensuring that issues of social justice are disseminated among counselors.I would greatly enjoy the opportunity to apply my advanced knowledge of community and mental health counseling with children, adolescents, and families to promote social justice advocacy clinical interventions. The division's work to prepare counselors to impact the larger community highlights their commitment to excellence, and because of my strong professional identity as a counselor, I would welcome the opportunity to serve as Counselor Representative for CSJ. Community Representative Eric L. Rhodes Professional background and experience For the past 12 years, I have worked as a mental health and drug & alcohol counselor as well as an HIV case manager. I have a master's degree in Mental Health Counseling, am a National Certified Counselor (NCC), and obtained my Professional Counselor's License (LPC) in the state of Pennsylvania in 2008. I am a member of ACA, PCA, and their divisions: CSJ, ALGBTIC, PALGBTIC. At the 2011 Pennsylvania Counseling Association (PCA) Annual Conference, I presented a session entitled \"Empowering Counselors: Social Justice for the Intervention and Prevention of Suicide in LGBTQ Communities\". I have been actively involved with Hospice, AIDS Service Organizations, and an Affordable Housing Coalition. Presently, I am a Clinical Therapist with the Persad Center, a not-for-profit community mental health agency in Pittsburgh whose mission is to serve LGBTQ and HIV communities. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office The role of Community Representative is a vital position within CSJ. By bridging theory and practice, we can promote social justice at the community level, leading to a direct impact on marginalized and disenfranchised client populations. In order to facilitate this, we need to empower community-based counselors to adopt a social justice lens. I want to accomplish two goals as the Community Representative. 1) I want to give voice to the community mental health practitioners who strive for social justice but need opportunities to become involved. 2) As a community-based therapist, myself, I want to serve as a bridge between what we know are best practices in social justice counseling and how to empower counselors to address oppression for themselves, with their clients, and in their agencies. There are many barriers for community-based counselors in finding their social justice voice. It took me many years to know how to use my voice in calling for equality for marginalized and disenfranchised peoples. It became evident to me that part of the challenge was that I was a member of the marginalized. I was a disenfranchised counselor. The community agencies I worked for, as well as the managed care systems that paid me, were not interested in helping me have a voice. It took my acknowledgment of the oppression to finally allow me to speak. My intention is to help other counselors recognize the oppression that exists for themselves and in the lives of their clients. There is a lot of potential for community-based practitioners to impact the systems in which they operate. By finding one's voice and then using it, loud and clear, we can work together to bring equality and justice.

I have presented at the Western Psychological Association's conference, and am awaiting publication on a paper I collaborated on with one other person on Intelligence and Creativity. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office My hope for being a student representative for CSJ is to get a chance to learn from those that came before me, to advocate for and empower everyone I can, and to learn how to grow in my leadership skills. I would love to be a part of a movement to get more people involved with CSJ, as well as retention efforts and incentives for current members. I have a lot of ideas about how to bridge with other agencies and affiliations both stateside and abroad. I am passionate about helping and empowering people. I volunteer on a regular basis and love empowering my students to believe in themselves. I love helping them set goals and realize their dreams. I hope to use my experience in working with a diverse population here as well as my experiences abroad to bring a new perspective to CSJ. I have always been a leader; someone who speaks out against injustice and ignorance, but with CSJ I would have the opportunity and privilege to grow in those skills and contribute to a greater population of people than I could reach on my own. Amy B. Nerone Professional background and experience I am a full-time graduate student at Columbus State University, GA, a counseling intern at the Ft.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office It is truly an honor to be nominated as Student Representative to the Counselors for Social Justice. I am at an exciting point in my life's journey, having intentionally chosen a change in vocation. My professional life began in the corporate world. Though I enjoyed many of the people with whom I worked, the work itself and the mission were often incongruent with my intrinsic and evolving value system. As I began volunteering, and then working, in the faith-based nonprofit world I realized that I found this type of work much more meaningful and personally satisfying. In becoming a professional counselor I hope to serve others who are finding their own way, voice, and freedom. Counselors for Social Justice embody principles and actions to which I continually aspire. Angelica Tello Professional background and experience I am a doctoral student in Counselor Education and Supervision from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).

Moreover, I have presented at conferences on the state and regional levels. This year I was recognized by SACES as an Emerging Leader. My current fields of interest include first-generation college students, addressing microaggressions on college campuses, and bridging the education gap that impacts Mexican American students. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I am honored to be nominated for this position. Although I am new to CSJ, I am seeking leadership opportunities that will allow me to be actively involved in the division. Social justice and advocacy are central to my identity as a counselor. My passion for social justice work in counseling stems from my personal experiences. I am a second generation Mexican American who grew up in a low socio-economic environment. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school and college. As an undergraduate and graduate student I did not see many people from my background in academia. I knew this had to change, and I am working on becoming part of the change. I feel fortunate that I had mentors along the way who provided me with support, allowed me to develop my voice, and empowered me to be an agent of change. My experiences led me to pursue a Master's degree in counseling and now a doctoral degree in counselor education. For me, counseling transcends the therapeutic relationship that occurs in counseling sessions. Through my work, I help provide a voice to individuals who 86 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012have been marginalized and oppressed. As a student representative, I will assist CSJ is their mission to promote social justice in our society. In addition, I will help confront injustices and inequalities that impact clients. Since I will be representing CSJ student members, I feel it is my duty to work closely with CSJ graduate students. I will take an active approach in connecting with CSJ student members and relaying information. I believe in two-way communication from both the division to its members and from members to division leaders. More importantly, I want to assist in helping graduate students develop their identity as social justice counselors.

He has a special interest in on the impact of war on solders worldwide.Qualifications and reasons for seeking office During my entire counseling career, I have purposely taken actions towards one penultimate goal, to promote and advance the training, education, and supervision of addiction professionals. Ultimately, I serve others to ensure competent counseling practice in the specialization of addictions work. Further, in my research focus, my teaching passion, and my professional service, I specialize in the relationship between trauma and addictions. This includes examining the confluence of addiction as it relates to veterans, war, physical and sexual trauma; trauma and violence that particularly targets vulnerable populations. In my long and rich career I have been honored to serve in many leadership positions for professional organizations. I am an active member of the International Association of Addiction and Offender Counselors and I serve as Chair of the T rauma and Addiction Committee.

My primary mission is to educate all professionals regarding issues related to Addictions and T rauma and promote competence.Secretary Jane Warren Professional background and experience I received my PhD in Counselor Education from the University of Wyoming in 1987. I then spent 25 years in community mental health and substance abuse, additionally serving eight years in the Wyoming Legislature. In 2007 a dream came true and I was offered a full time assistant professor position at the University of Wyoming where I teach numerous classes particularly focusing on ethics and addictions education. I am a Wyoming Licensed Marital and Family Therapist (LMFT); Professional Counselor (LPC), and Addictions Therapist (LAT). My research and writing focuses particularly on experiential education in addictions and ethics and attitude changes towards addictions resulting in publications in the Journal for Creativity in Mental Health, the Journal of Addictions & Offender Counseling, and the Journal of Counseling and Values. I have been honored with recognition awards for my legislative work in Driving Under the Influence (DUI), by our community for my work to establish a program and shelter for abused persons, and by students for my teaching. In 2011 I was honored to receive the International Association of Addictions and Offenders Counseling (IAAOC) Research Grant. I completed the study; the sample was too small so we will revise the manuscript for publication. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office My work for more than twenty years in community mental health and substance abuse work inspired me to commit to enhancing counselor education in both addictions and ethics. I believe these two areas are critical to the counseling profession and both require practitioners to be well prepared with awareness, competencies, and wellness. Once I finished my one-year internship with Texas A&M University for my PhD program, I began fulltime in community mental health in 1985. In 1987, I completed my dissertation which focused on domestic violence. My focus in community work included December 2012 | Counseling Today | 87family, couples, addictions, and general mental health as well as intern and peer supervision. Daily I witnessed the destruction of addictions on lives, families, and society; yet, it seemed treatment was not well integrated with mental health work and in fact too often, there were negative stigmas and discrimination for those who suffered with addictions. In addition, it seemed the preparation for addictions work was limited, with poor credentialing, and at times the belief was only recovering persons can work in additions. This permeated staffing decisions and reduced funding for addictions treatment. As an advocate for mental health and substance abuse services, I was able to serve for eight years as a member of the House of Representatives in the Wyoming Legislature. Although my experiences grew, I had a dream to serve as a fulltime faculty in counselor education. This dream came true in August, 2007. Now, I wish to support addictions (and ethics) awareness and education both in my research and publication as well as being a part of national advocacy. The work with IAAOC can enable me to support awareness, compassion, and advocacy for addictions work. I will do whatever tasks are needed and will follow through with responsibilities for the IAAOC secretary position. NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT COUNSELING ASSOCIATION President-Elect Seneka Rachel Arrington Professional background and experience I am a graduate of Stetson University in Deland, FL with a Master of Science in Marriage and Family Therapy.

I also serve my community through various efforts including Back-pack Giveaways, Food Pantry organizations, and mentorship in local elementary, middle and high schools. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Renowned American Poet, Lecturer, and Essayist, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said these words: \"The crowning fortune of a man is to be born to some pursuit which finds him employment and happiness, whether it be to make baskets, or broad swords, or canals, or statues, or songs.\" As professional employment counselors we work to provide the best resources available to assist those who are searching for career options and meaningful work. As a professional association we seek to empower the counselors who provide these services. I believe it is imperative, when guiding those in need, to remain cognizant of emotional health and the role it plays on the ability to obtain and retain employment. My goals for the presidency include placing an emphasis on the marriage of emotional health and employment counseling. I want to encourage the further exploration of wellness and wholeness for counselors and their clients. I believe, as a professional organization, we are a team and a family of employment counselors. We have the power and tools to significantly help ourselves and others realize strengths and attain a sense of fulfillment and joy. By remaining mindful of not only the employment status, but the emotionality of the men and women we are and those we serve, we are, like Peter Scazzero says, \"encouraging ourselves and clients to both human-'do' and human-'be'.\" Trustee Devon Coughlin No information received Carolyn Greer No information received Linda Jameison No information receivedMIDWEST REGION Governing Council Representative Christopher P.

Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I would be honored to represent the Midwest Region on the Governing Council of ACA. I have been privileged to serve in a leadership capacity the past three years. I am excited about what the region and its branches have accomplished and am committed to continuing to advance our strategic goals. As change is inevitable, it is important to be informed, flexible, and goal-oriented. 88 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012The willingness of the region and its branches to share experiences, work together, and contribute goal-oriented ideas has resulted in the region's ability to positively anticipate, and put in motion, several initiatives. For example, a majority of branches have utilized the Texas Public Service Announcements, ACA Iowa is reactivated as a branch, and the Midwest Leadership Institute became reality. Our work is not done, we know history only provides us the perspectives to connect, learn, and improve. I believe the Midwest Region continues to lead in the ever-changing landscape of professional counseling. My experiences in leadership support my belief that leaders must be goal-oriented; taking responsible, deliberate, and actionable steps to advance the cause. I will work tirelessly to encourage collaboration and achieve our goals. Important to the relevancy and function of the region, we must increase our advocacy role to educate and appeal to federal and state legislators on issues related to professional counseling and the clients we serve. The Midwest Region will lead in vital strategic planning opportunities aimed at fostering communication among members, bringing more diversity into our organization and profession, being superior fiscal stewards of the association's resources, providing leadership and support to membership, and advancing research within the field. I am dedicated to supporting and advancing these goals through collaborative leadership and goal-oriented action. It would be a privilege to serve the Midwest Region and its constituency as Governing Council Representative. Jean Underfer-Babalis Professional background and experience Receiving the Susan Sears Counselor of the Year is my greatest accomplishment. It is the essence of who I am a professional counselor. I am the Director of Recovery Services at the Wellness Center. My previous position of Clinical Coordinator of NW Ohio Eating Disorders was a source of great challenge and fulfillment. Since 1994, I have had a thriving private practice. Helping to establish an inner-city center that assists the poor and \"at-risk children\" is a pet project of mine. We have conducted four-years of qualitative research regarding the community that has resulted in community improvement projects. Proudly, I say I am a Professional Clinical Counselor-Supervisor. Being a PC is my passion and greatest source of satisfaction. Additionally, I am involved in research regarding treatment for mental disorders. Other positions I have held include (there are others as well, however, I have been a PC for 24 years, that has allowed me much time to be active in this marvelous profession): Midwest Region Chairperson, Ohio Counseling Association President, and President of OACES, OASGW (twice), and NWOCA, and IAAOC, ACES, OACES, OASGW, NWOCA, and other professional organizations. Qualifications and reasons for seeking office Daily, I am on the front lines of professional counseling and mental health, because I am a full-time professional counselor and supervisor, period. I have direct knowledge, experience, and significant understanding of the day-to-day functions in professional counseling and mental health. Daily (24 years), I am directly involved with the realities and practicalities of federal regulations, the direct implementation of laws that govern counseling, addictions, and mental health, HIPPA, insurance companies, community mental health and the red tape of obtaining services that are best of clients. In Ohio, I organized a group that focused on warding off the potential encroachment of psychologists that were attempting to reduce PCs ability to diagnose, treat, and secure third-party treatment. I have testified in Ohio Legislature about laws regarding treatment and diagnosis and the qualifications of PC, mental health parity, laws regarding treatment for addictions and substance abuse, and laws regarding other mental health issues. The predominant reason I am seeking this position is because I believe that governing council has too few representatives that are front-line PCs; PCs who are actively engaged in counseling clients on a full-time basis daily. PCs that have counseling as their main identity and have a firsthand grasp of the realities that thousands of PCs face who work in community mental health agencies, various agencies, schools, hospitals, private practices, jails, prisons, veterans administrations, government agencies, clinics, outreach programs, and other institutions that employ PCs full-time and utilize our services. Goals: 1-A grassroots approach and being in touch with the body of PCs to hear their concerns and represent them. 2-Communicate with each state to grasp their viewpoints. 3-Be transparent about what I do. 4- Be the best and most passionate rep I can be. NORTh ATLANTIC REGION Governing Council Representative Terry Thurston Mitchell Professional background and experience My name is Terry Mitchell and I am writing you today to share information and convey my intent to run for NAR Governing Council Representative. I have been a member of ACA and a professional counselor for 28 years. The last 14 years working as a certified high school counselor. I have served as the president of Maine Counseling Association, Chair of the North Atlantic Region, and the past two years working as the NAR branch development representative. I have been a member of many different divisions, but the one that I have belonged to the longest is ASGW. In 2006 I started a division branch of the Association for Specialist in Group Work in Maine and served as their first president. MeASGW has since gone on to win an \"Outstanding Branch Award\" in 2010. In my community I serve as a committee member to our local Boy Scouts of America troop where my son is one merit badge away from earning his Eagle Scout. I also have a soon to be 16 year old daughter who is getting prettier every day. October 17th the love of my life and I will celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. December 2012 | Counseling Today | 89Qualifications and reasons for seeking office I have several reasons for wanting to represent the NAR at the governing council level. I want to help foster a supportive working climate where the exchange of ideas, resources, and services assist in the continuing growth of our professionals and is useful to the population we serve. I have enjoyed many years of ACA leadership experience. I consider the opportunity to serve our membership at this level an honor and privilege and will work to the best of my abilities. Some of my most exciting and rewarding leadership experience came from participating on the Council of Presidents and Region Chairs (COPARC) committees while serving as NAR Chair. The opportunity to gather and work together with so many talented career professionals is truly amazing. We discussed our challenges, visioned our possibilities, and collaborated to make changes happen. Some results of those meetings four years ago include formulating our first annual Leadership T raining Institute and participating in a \"trip to the hill,\" plus establishing a newly revised regional branch awards system which was fortified with financial incentives. It was extremely rewarding creating these organizational changes and with your help I welcome the opportunity to continue helping shape for future of ACA.NAR has the most inactive branches and I have worked on the branch development committee trying to change this statistic. I wrote an article for Counseling Today Magazine entitled \"Does Everyone Have a Professional Home?\" What does it mean to belong to a branch of ACA? How can we best serve the needs of those members? As a professional who has gained so much for my involvement with the Maine Counseling Association, I strongly support the need for branches. Our branches can and should be that one \"home\" for all counseling professionals regardless of their specialties. u unifying principles and the definition of counseling \u2014 two components critical to our shared professional identity, regardless of practice specialty. Now we are squarely focused on the building blocks to licensure portability, which will allow counselors from one state to transfer their licenses to practice in another state without having to jump through a new set of qualification hoops. The major stumbling block is the widely disparate licensure qualifications that currently exist. To practice in any state, a professional counselor must qualify under the laws existing in that particular state. Obviously, to achieve reciprocity and portability, some states are going to need to change qualification laws and regulations. It is unlikely that those states on the higher end of the continuum are going to lower their standards. Working collaboratively, the 20/20 delegates are attempting to reach consensus on a model licensure title, educational requirements and scope of practice that counseling advocates can use to change and better standardize state licensure laws. The 20/20 delegates already have gained consensus on the title licensed professional counselor, which currently appears in the laws of more than half of the states. The Scope of Practice Work Group and the Education Standards Work Group have completed their subgroup reports, and soon the full 20/20 delegation will take up these final two building blocks. It is our goal to reach consensus on the scope and education provisions at our meeting in Cincinnati in March during the ACA 2013 Conference and to conclude the work of this important consortium. After that meeting, the governing boards of all 31 counseling organizations will decide whether to endorse the proposals. Without a doubt, the products of this endeavor will not be universally popular. Anytime standards are increased and the bar is raised, some will feel left out despite best efforts to be inclusive and to provide ample transition time and provisions. But I encourage each of you to consider that where we are as a profession today is a far different place than where we were as a profession 30, 50 or 100 years ago. As we progress and reach consensus on important issues, the landscape shifts and new possibilities, initiatives and opportunities emerge and evolve. The 20/20 initiative was conceived to envision what we wanted the counseling profession to look like in the years beyond 2020. The ideas generated from this effort are just the next evolution of our profession, an opportunity to embrace change and truly practice what we preach to our clients and students \u2014 that we are all in the process of becoming, striving to become better people and better professionals. A more standardized approach to how we prepare professional counselors in the future will help us raise the bar of professional practice, better protect the public, and realize our mutual goals of portability and parity with other mental health disciplines. Throughout this process I have heard some colleagues say, \"But how we are training our counselors is already good enough!\" My grandmother had a saying: \"Good is the enemy of best, and best is the enemy of better.\" Where would we be today as a profession if we still trained our students according to the standards of 1960? Change is inevitable, but growth is optional. Raising the bar is good for the public \u2014 and for professional counselors. u 90 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012From The President continued from page 5December 2012 | Counseling Today | 91March 21-24 Pre-Conference Learning Institutes \u2014 March 20-21 Register by December 15 to receive the lowest rates on the counseling event of the year.

I didn't know anyone so I was a bit nervous. However, once I got there, I had a great time! The sessions were invaluable and I walked away feeling more excited about the profession I'm entering. I attended the graduate luncheon and met some really great individuals. The speaker made everyone get to know the people at their tables. Plus we had to get up and move and meet more people!

ACCA co-hosts webinar discussing violence on campus Submitted by T affey Cunnien tcunnien@scad.edu Open a newspaper or turn on the TV and we are no longer surprised to see a story of a shooter going on a rampage. College administrators, clinical counseling staff and student conduct officers are often placed in the difficult position of having to sort out what is truly dangerous and potentially violent versus what is merely a student acting out or in need of a more developmental and caring intervention to correct inappropriate behavior. Although there is no surefire method of predicting future violence, an awareness of the common risk factors is essential to carry out a more complete and thorough campus threat assessment. Join our expert presenter, Brian Van Brunt, as he provides clear, research-based questions that administrators, clinical staff and conduct officers should have in mind when assessing dangerousness in the student sitting across from them during the webinar \"Direct Threat: Assessing Danger on Campus.\" The American College Counseling Association and PaperClip Communications are pleased to co-host this webinar on Jan. 24 from 2-3:30 p.m. Eastern. Webinar participants will learn to: n Develop an understanding of what questions to ask students to better assess the likelihood of them carrying out a direct threat n Understand the components of a threat assessment and learn the importance of developing information conduits with the referral source to improve the quality of the assessment n Minimize the legal risk when working with these students n Review the best ways to involve social supports, case management and parents in the review of the student's concerning behavior n Understanding the dangers of zero- tolerance policies and how these can make a situation higher risk for all involved.

AACE renames itself AARC Submitted by Carl Sheperis csheperis@lamar.edu On Oct. 22, the Governing Council for ACA approved a motion to change the name of the Association for Assessment in Counseling and Education (AACE) to the Association for Assessment and Research in Counseling (AARC). Along with the change to our name comes a change to the mission and vision for our division. Our new mission is to promote and recognize excellence in assessment, research and evaluation in counseling. Our vision is to promote best practices in assessment, research and evaluation in counseling. We recognize that numerous discussions have been occurring at the national level about how research is missing from confer- ences and how counseling researchers have been feeling alienated. Although assessment remains a key focus of our division, we have decided to place an equal emphasis on research in counseling. As such, AARC is now the division home for all counseling researchers and assessment professionals. Although our name change is recent, AARC has been emphasizing research for a number of years. As an example, one of 98 | ct.counseling.org | December 2012division, region & Branch Newsour two exemplary journals is Counseling Outcomes, Research and Evaluation ( CORE). In addition, we host the National Research and Assessment Conference annually. We are also expanding the role of our Research Committee to begin developing various standards and resources for current and future members. This coming spring, as part of the launch for our new division name, we will begin a research and assessment webinar series. Our first webinar, hosted by Casey Barrio Minton, will focus on the evaluation of student learning outcomes. Details about the webinar will be released in the near future. Limited seats will be available for the live event, but the webinar will be available for recorded download. In addition to the webinar and other web-based resources, we are planning AARC conference-related dissertation-intensive workshops for students and tenure mentorship workshops for faculty members. If you are already a member, consider becoming more involved. If you haven't yet joined and want a division that values counseling research, then AARC is the right division for you. Join AARC today and find your new division home.ICA receives monetary gift, gathers for annual conference Submitted by Julia Yang loveworkfriends@gmail.com The Illinois Counseling Association Foundation received a gift of $1 million following a previous donation of $70,000 from our late colleague and past ICA president Marlin Schultz, who wanted to strengthen ICA as a professional organiza- tion and help its members to enhance the counseling needed by the citizens of Illinois. ICA celebrated its 64th annual confer- ence in Springfield Nov. 8-10 with world- renowned keynote speaker Nikki Giovanni, who spoke on \"The Courage for Equality: Love, Work, Society.\" This was made pos- sible by the generous monetary supports ICA received from three colleges of Gover-nors State University, a collaborative model of best practices of community power. Also featured at this year's conference were a leadership summit for ICA Governing Council members and the community lead-ership; a visit from Springfield's mayor; the use of music, arts and social media; and the publication of a special issue of the Illinois Journal of Counseling that addresses the conference theme. u December 2012 | Counseling Today | 99Submit your news and upcoming events All divisions, regions and branches of the American Counseling Association can submit monthly news articles of 350 words or less to \"Division, Region & Branch News.\" In addition, divisions, regions and branches are invited to list upcoming events in \"Bulletin Board.\" For submission guidelines, contact Lynne Shallcross at lshallcross@counseling.org.
