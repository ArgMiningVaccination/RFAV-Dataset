However, there isn't a significant amount of science to back the claims being aired on TikTok. Eating sea moss has been an alternative medicine practice for years Eating raw sea moss everyday for its health benefits is a new trend on TikTok, but the practice of using sea moss to heal has existed for centuries. According to [the International Food Additives Council](https://www.foodingredientfacts.org/irish-moss-the-history-of-carrageenans-roots/), people have been harvesting and eating Irish sea moss for 14,000 years. Irish sea moss became particularly important to [supplement people's diets in the 1800s](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/eating-irish-moss-100792221/) during the Irish potato famine. Irish sea moss made its way to Jamaica in the 1800s after the Irish potatoes famine, and became a remedy for colds and lung ailments. Sea moss has not been extensively studied for its health benefits Studies have found ingesting seaweed in your every day diet could [lower your blood pressure](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-seaweed) and better your heart health, and [past studies have suggested](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/923.html) blue-green algae can be effective in lowering high blood pressure. However, there are few long-term studies that support its health benefits. One [2015 study in rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535385/), published in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies, found sea moss may contain probiotics that are beneficial to better digestive health, though the study authors wrote there needs to be more research to say so conclusively, and whether it would apply to humans. Sea moss can contain heavy metals and iodine, which can lead to health complications when consumed in excess While ingesting raw sea moss in moderation is fine, doing so excessively could expose you to toxins and heavy metals. There is no recommended daily dose of Irish sea moss, but [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32803579/) published in the journal of [Environmental Science and Pollution Research](https://www.springer.com/journal/11356/) found taking up to two tablespoons a day did not have negative side effects on the body. [Sea moss contains iodine](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-sea-moss#1), a mineral necessary for hormone regulation. However, [studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976240/) ingesting too much iodine can damage your thyroid and interfere with the balance of your hormones. In addition, eating sea moss in excess can expose you to heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Pollution in certain areas can make sourcing uncontaminated sea moss a gamble. \"The shorelines where Irish moss grows are not certified clean of these toxic metals, or petrol products, or pesticides and herbicides for that matter, and for this reason, I would only suggest using certified organic Irish moss,\" Lisa "}
