NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE Mentoring in Medicine Giving Students a Vision of Healthcare Careers Research has shown that many students are unaware of healthcare careers other than those of nurse and doctor, and of the need to increase the diversity of students pursuing those careers. To help remedy that, a New York- based healthcare careers education program for underrepresented minority students recently expand - ed its pilot program efforts to urban Washington, D.C., and rural Hardin, Montana. Mentoring in Medicine (MIM), Inc. is a nonprofit organiza - tion that works with students in disadvantaged areas from 3rd grade through health professional schools. MIM is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the Friends of the National Library of Medicine (FNLM). More than 400 students\u2014many of them American Indians\u2014came to Hardin High School in mid-May for a three-day Healthy Living Week series of exhibits, hands-on demonstrations, and lectures about healthcare topics and career opportunities. At the same time, more than 500 students\u2014many of them African Ameri - can or Hispanic\u2014from a number of D.C.- area schools attended a similar series of presen - tations at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, according to MIM presi - dent Lynne Holden, MD. \"Mentoring in Medicine is a unique educational program that helps interest under - represented students in healthcare careers,\" says Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, NLM director. \"We are delight - ed to help promote this pioneering effort to bring more diversity into the healthcare professions. \" Among the presentations at Hardin High School was an iPad version of \"Native Voices: Native Peoples Concepts of Health and Illness,\" an interactive exhibit from the National Library of Medicine. Students at the NIH visited the actual exhibit in the National Library of Medicine display area. Mentoring in Medicine plans to continue its efforts in other venues in the future.

Collins Unlocking the Brain The National Institutes of Health is leading a bold new project to revolutionize understanding of the human brain. It is called the BRAIN Initiative\u2014short for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies. NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins recently outlined the challenge\u2014and its potential benefits\u2014for NIH MedlinePlus magazine.Photo: Official White House photo by Chuck Kennedy How difficult will it be to understand how the brain works? Given that a typical human brain contains 86 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections, it sounds like an impossible task. So what even makes such a challenge possible? New advances in computer science, math, nanotechnology, imaging, and data visualization are empowering us to study simpler neural systems, and ultimately the living brain as an entire organ. Like the heart, for example, and at a level of detail not previously imagined. By accelerating development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a picture of neural systems that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex nerve circuits interact in both time and space. So, what is the payoff to this? By exploring exactly how the brain enables the human body to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve vast quantities of information, all at the speed of thought, researchers will be able to develop new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.Why is the BRAIN Initiative needed? The human brain remains one of science's greatest mysteries and one of the greatest challenges in medicine. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological and psychological disorders exact a tremendous toll on us as individuals, our families, and society at large. Despite the many recent advances, the underlying causes of these conditions remain largely unknown. If we are to develop effective ways of helping people suffering from them, researchers need a more complete array of tools and better understanding of how the brain functions in both sickness and in health. What is the rush? Five years ago, a project like this would have been considered impossible. Five years from now will be too late. While the goals are profoundly ambitious, the time is right to inspire a new generation of scientists to take on the most groundbreaking approach ever contemplated to finding out how the brain works and how disease occurs.tPresident Barack Obama and Dr. Francis Collins, Director, National Institutes of Health, at the BRAIN Initiative event in the East Room of the White House, April 2, 2013. 2 Summer 2013 NIH MedlinePlusMPCould you describe some of the specific research opportunities you see? In the last decade alone, there have been a number of landmark discoveries that make unlocking the brain possible. We have sequenced the human genome, developed new tools for mapping neuronal connections, increased the resolution of imaging technologies, and witnessed the explosion of nanoscience. Integration across these and more scientific fields has become a reality. For instance, by combining advanced genetic and optical techniques, scientists can now determine how specific cell activities within the mouse brain affect behavior. Through the integration of neuroscience and physics, researchers can use high-resolution imaging technologies to observe how the brain is structurally and functionally connected in living humans. What do such advances mean for the future? While these innovations have expanded our knowledge of the brain, significant breakthroughs in how we treat neurological and psychiatric disease will require researchers to record signals from brain cells in much greater numbers and at even faster speeds. We can't do this now but great promise for doing so lies at the intersection of nanoscience, imaging, engineering, informatics, and other rapidly emerging areas of science. How will the BRAIN Initiative work? Given the ambitious scope, it is vital that a wide range of expertise and experience inform the initiative. Therefore, NIH is establishing a high-level working group, co-chaired by Dr. Cornelia (\"Cori\") Bargmann, of The Rockefeller University, and Dr. William Newsome, from Stanford University, to work out the scientific goals and develop a multi-year plan for achieving them, including timetables, milestones, and cost estimates. As part of the planning process, the working group will seek broad input from the scientific community, patient advocates, and the general public. By this fall, the group is supposed to make specific recommendations on high-priority investments for 2014.How will the BRAIN Initiative be supported? NIH intends to allocate $40 million for the project in 2014. Given the crosscutting nature, we will need the ideas of the best scientists and engineers across many diverse disciplines and sectors. Therefore, NIH is collaborating closely with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). There also is strong interest from several private foundations, including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, The Kavli Foundation, and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Many private companies are also interested in participating in this groundbreaking effort.pImage showing individual neurons in the brain using fluorescent colors.

Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, is still on the rise. More than 2 million people are treated each year for the most common forms of skin cancer\u2014basal cell and squamous cell. Basal cell skin cancer is several times more common than squamous cell skin cancer. Each year, more than 68,000 Americans are diagnosed with melanoma, and another 48,000 are diagnosed with an early form of the disease that involves only the top layer of skin. Melanoma is less common than the others, but far more dangerous \u2014 even deadly. It involves the cells that produce the skin pigment melanin, which is responsible for skin and hair color. Melanoma can spread very rapidly, and the incidence of melanoma in the United States is steadily increasing. It is the lead - ing cause of death from skin disease. The development of melanoma is related to sun exposure, particularly to sunburns during childhood. It is most common among people with fair skin, blue or green eyes, and red or blond hair.Skin Cancer Strike Anyone Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton both had basal cell carcinomas removed. That is the most common form of skin cancer and not as dangerous as melanoma.Senator John McCain of Arizona has had several melanomas re-moved, the most serious on his left temple.

Tissues make up the skin and other organs of the body. Normal cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When normal cells grow old or get damaged, they usually die, and new cells take their place. But sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor . Growths on the skin can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign growths are not as harmful as malignant growths. Benign growths (such as moles) are rarely a threat to life, generally can be removed, and usually don't grow back. They also don't invade the tissues around them and don't spread to other parts of the body. Malignant growths (such as melanoma, basal cell cancer, or squamous cell cancer): May be a threat to life Often can be removed but sometimes grow back May invade and damage nearby organs and tissues May spread to other parts of the body Risk Factors When you're told that you have skin cancer, it's natural to wonder what may have caused the disease. The main risk factor for skin cancer is exposure to sunlight (UV radiation), but there are also other risk factors. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease. People with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop skin cancer. Some risk factors vary for the different types of skin cancer. Studies have shown that the following are risk factors for the three most common types of skin cancer: 7Sunlight: Sunlight is a source of UV radiation. It's the most important risk factor for any type of skin cancer. The sun's rays cause skin damage that can lead to cancer. 7Severe, blistering sunburns: People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased risk of skin cancer. Although people who burn easily are more likely to have had sunburns as a child, sunburns during adulthood also increase the risk of skin cancer. 7Lifetime sun exposure: The total amount of sun exposure over a lifetime is a risk factor for skin cancer. 7Tanning: Although a tan slightly lowers the risk of sunburn, even people who tan well without sunburning have a higher risk of skin cancer because of more lifetime sun exposure. ThinkStock www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 5 Dr. Edward Long of Arlington, Virginia, for many years was the staff director of the United States Senate panel that is responsible for funding of medical research. Now a melanoma survivor, he is advocating for improved screening, prevention, and research. How did you discover you had skin cancer? It was 1996, I had just left the Congress and starting working as a healthcare consultant, when I finally decided to have a full-fledged physical. During the exam my doc - tor saw an irregular looking mole on my back and sent me to a derma - tologist to have it examined further. The dermatologist did a biopsy and based on that they found irregu - larity in the cells. Then he cut the mole out and made sure he had gotten all the irregular cells out at the margins. My melanoma was classi - fied as in situ (on the site)\u2014it hadn't penetrated below the surface of the skin before it had progressed to a Stage 1 mela - noma. So I didn't need to have chemotherapy after the mole was removed. About half of the melanoma cases diagnosed ev - ery year fall into this category. Did you have a history of lots of sun exposure? I had been a lifeguard when I was a teenager and, like a lot of people, had never used much sunscreen. But I had no family history of skin cancer. I had no idea I had a problem before I had the physical. If I hadn't gotten that physical the cancer wouldn't have been discovered until it was too late. I was very for - tunate it was discovered early. What were your first thoughts upon learning you had skin cancer? I remember lying there on the chair and I asked \"when will this become cancerous?\" And the doc - tor said, \"You don't understand, it is cancerous. But we caught it early. \" My first thought was disbelief. I didn't think I could get cancer. And the next thought was, \"I have cancer,\" and I had a profound sense of my own mortality. I recognized that I could die from this. That was shocking and very humbling. How did your diagnosis and treatment change your lifestyle and health habits? Ever since then I go to the derma - tologist every 4 to 6 months to get a full body check, and anything that looks strange is removed. I also began not only wearing sunscreen pDr. Edward Long, shown here with his two sons, survived melanoma because his physician caught it early during an office checkup.Timely Healthcare Checkup Catches Melanoma Early Photo: Dr. Edward Long Feature : skin cancer 6 Summer 2013 NIH MedlinePlusbut protective clothing\u2014hats, long-sleeved shirts. Also, as a father of two boys, I have really tried to make sure they wear sunscreen and long sleeve shirts whenever possible. How have you become involved in advocating for the fight against melanoma? I have tried to translate my knowledge of how gov - ernment works and my personal experience to work with organizations to improve melanoma screening, prevention, and research. I have tried to raise aware - ness about the importance of screening, particularly for men over 50 and young women under 29. There has been almost an 8-fold increase in melanoma since the '70s among young women, a dramatic rise that is in large part the result of increased use of tanning beds. I have also been working to strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of tanning beds. And I have been helping to advance research supported by the National Cancer Institute and private organizations like the Melanoma Research Foundation. Another important effort is to raise awareness about this problem among our military. With so many men and women having served long tours in the deserts of Iraq and high elevation regions like Afghanistan, we can expect growing rates of skin cancer from all that sun exposure as the warfighters of today become the veterans of tomorrow.NIH Research to Results Scientists are studying new ways of working with the immune system to fight cancer. This includes vaccines aimed at making a person immune to his or her skin cancer cells. Another method is to train a person's immune cells to attack the skin cancer cells. New melanoma drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved two new drugs, Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib), for patients with advanced (metastatic) or unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery) melanoma. Tafinlar is approved to treat patients with melanoma whose tumors express the BRAF V600E gene mutation. Mekinist is approved to treat patients whose tumors express the BRAF V600E or V600K gene mutations. Approximately half of melanomas arising in the skin have a BRAF gene mutation. Immune-system cells. A recent small study showed that treating patients with immune system cells found in tumors could shrink skin cancer tumors and possibly prolong life. Melanoma increasing among children. Although rare, melanoma among children is on the rise, according to recent research published in the journal Pediatrics. The biggest increase was among adolescent girls, ages 15 to 19, according to the study authors, including researchers from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). These increases, along with those increases among adults, are thought to stem from increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning booths. Sensitized T cells: NCI researchers recently genetically engineered some melanoma patients' white blood cells to recognize and attack their own cancer cells. The NCI researchers sought an effective way to convert normal white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the lab into cancer-fighting cells. The research demonstrated a successful regression of advanced melanoma. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. The two most common types are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. Melanoma, a more serious type of skin cancer, is less common. More than 2 million people are treated for basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer each year. Basal cell skin cancer is several times more common than squamous cell skin cancer. The number of cases of skin cancer has been increasing. Exposure to the sun is a major factor. Estimated new cases and deaths from melanoma in the United States in 2013: New cases: 76,690; deaths: 9,480.Fast Facts! www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 7 Skin and Sun\u2014Safety First Good skin care begins with sun safety. Whether it is something as simple as age spots or as serious as skin cancer, the simplest and cheapest way to keep your skin healthy is to limit your exposure to the sun. Yet, Americans spend billions of dollars each year on skin care products that promise to erase wrinkles, lighten age spots, and eliminate itching, flaking, or redness. As you age, your skin changes. It becomes thinner and loses fat, making your skin look less smooth. When your skin looks less plump, your veins and bones become more noticeable. You sweat less, which causes your skin to be drier. Also, your skin can take longer to heal from bruises or cuts as you get older. With all of these age-related changes, sunlight is a major contrib - uting factor. You can delay these changes by avoiding prolonged and regular exposure to the sun. Although nothing can completely undo sun damage, the skin sometimes can repair itself. So, it's never too late to protect yourself from the harmful effects of the sun.Treatment The most common treatments for skin cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. You may need a procedure called surgical lymph node biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. If it has, these lymph nodes may also need to be removed. A skin graft may be necessary after the surgery if a large area of skin is affected. Chemo (which is short for chemotherapy) is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells or to slow their growth. Some chemo can be given by I.V . (into a vein by a needle) and others are swallowed in pill form. Because chemo drugs travel to nearly all parts of the body, they are useful for cancer that has spread. Radiation treatment is also used to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells. It can be used alone or with sur - gery or chemo. Radiation treatment is like getting an x-ray. Or, sometimes it can be given by placing a \"seed\" inside the cancer to give off the radiation. Questions to Ask 7What treatment choices do I have? What do you recommend and why? 7What is the stage of the disease? Has the cancer spread? Do any lymph nodes or other organs show signs of cancer? 7What are the benefits of each kind of treatment? 7What can I do to prepare for treatment? 7Will I need to stay in the hospital? How long? 7What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? How can side effects be managed? 7What is the treatment likely to cost? Will my insurance cover it? 7How will treatment affect my normal activities? 7Would a research study (clinical trial) be a good choice for me?

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been developing rules about sunscreens over the past three years that manufacturers are now implementing. In short, sunscreens labeled \"Broad Spectrum\" will protect against all types of sun damage (including ultraviolet A and B) and have a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. A higher number means longer, stronger protection. Also look for products with a label that says water-resistant and either 40 or 80 minutes\u2014the amount of time before the sunscreen needs to be reapplied. 7Stay out of the sun. Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. This is when the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays are strongest. 7Wear protective clothing. A hat with a wide brim shades your neck, ears, eyes, and head. Look for sunglasses with a label saying the glasses block 99 to 100 percent of the sun's rays. Wear loose, lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and long pants or long skirts when in the sun. 7Avoid artificial tanning. Don't use sunlamps, tanning beds, tanning pills, or tanning makeup. Tanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. The FDA has not approved this for tanning the skin. Tanning make-up products will not protect your skin from the sun. 7Check your skin often. Look for changes in the size, shape, color, or feel of birthmarks, moles, and spots. If you find any changes, see a doctor. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests that older, fair-skinned people have a yearly skin check as part of a regular physical exam. 7Dark skin needs protection, too. The incidence of skin cancer in African Americans and other dark-skinned people is much lower than in Caucasians due to the additional melanin, a pigment, in the skin. While this pigment offers some sun protection, dark brown or black skin is not a guarantee against skin cancer.uThis photo (right) shows an asymmetric melanoma with irregular and scalloped borders. The color varies from gray to brown to black. The melanoma is about 1.2 centimeters. pRecent studies have shown that the use of indoor tanning devices increases melanoma risk, especially for those who use them frequently. tBe sure to wear sunscreen with a sun protective factor (SPF) of 15 or higher any time you're out in the sun. ThinkStock www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 9 1. A is the correct answer. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the U.S. It occurs in more than a million people each year, including many older people. 2. A is the correct answer. There are three main types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. They can develop from the uncontrolled growth of three different types of skin cells: basal cells, squamous cells, and melanocytes, respectively. 3. A is the correct answer. The most dangerous form of skin cancer is melanoma. It is the most serious and most aggressive (fastest growing) of the three main skin cancers. If identified early, it is almost totally curable. 4. C is the correct answer. 90% of skin cancer in the United States is basal cell carcinoma. 5. C is the correct answer. Men tend to develop melanoma more often on the trunk (the area from the shoulders to the hips) or the head and neck. Women more often develop melanoma on the extremities (arms and legs).6. A is the correct answer. The most common sign of skin cancer is a change on the skin. This may be a new growth, a sore that doesn't heal, or a change in an old growth. Not all skin cancers look the same. Sometimes skin cancer is painful, but usually it is not. 7. C is the correct answer. Surgery to remove the suspicious area of skin is usually the first step in skin cancer treatment and may have already occurred in the process of diagnosis. However, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be recommended first if the cancer has already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. 8. C is the correct answer. Cancer vaccines are similar to traditional vaccines, like those that prevent polio, but cancer vaccines are given as treatment to a person who already has cancer, rather than preventatively given before the onset of disease. These vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to fight against melanoma. Test Your Skin Cancer IQ 1. Skin cancer is A. the most common form of cancer in the United States.

ANSWERS ThinkStockMP Feature : skin cancer 10 Summer 2013 NIH MedlinePlusGenetics 101 Genetics is the study of heredity, the process in which parents pass certain genes onto their children. A gene is a short piece of DNA\u2014deoxyribonucleic acid , the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. There are about 30,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, these genes make up the blueprint for the hu - man body and how it works. pDNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. Base pairs Adenine Thymine Cytosine GuanineSugar Phosphate backboneThe Hereditary Material of Life A person's appearance\u2014height, hair color, skin color, and eye color\u2014is determined by genes. Other charac - teristics affected by heredity include the likelihood of getting certain diseases, mental abilities, and natural talents. An abnormal genetic trait passed down through fami - lies (inherited) may: Have no effect on your health or well being\u2014for example, it may just involve a white patch of hair or an extended earlobeBe of minor consequence\u2014for example, color blindness Have a dramatic effect on your quality or length of life For most genetic disorders, genetic counseling is advised. Many people may also want to seek prena - tal diagnosis if they plan to have children. The terms anomaly, abnormality, disorder, defect, disease, and syndrome are not used consistently, and do not have precise definitions.ThinkStock FEATuRE : gENETICS 101 www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 11 What is DNA? DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary mate - rial in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person's body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mito - chondrial DNA or mtDNA). The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet ap - pear in a certain order to form words and sentences. DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder's rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder. An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell. What is a gene? A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes, which are made up of DNA, act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases. The Human Ge -What is gene therapy? Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. In the future, this technique may allow doctors to treat a disorder by inserting a gene into a patient's cells instead of using drugs or surgery. Researchers are testing several approaches to gene therapy, including: Replacing a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy copy of the gene. Inactivating, or \"knocking out,\" a mutated gene that is functioning improperly. Introducing a new gene into the body to help fight a disease. Although gene therapy is a promising treatment option for a number of diseases (including inherited disorders, some types of cancer, and certain viral infec - tions), the technique remains risky and is still under study to make sure that it will be safe and effective. Gene therapy is currently only being tested for the treatment of diseases that have no other cures.nome Project has estimated that humans have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of the total) are slightly different between people. Alleles are forms of the same gene with small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These small differences contribute to each person's unique physical features.

For Kathryn Sander, a science teacher at Thomas S. Wootton High School in Rockville, Maryland, teaching her students about genet - ics has always had its challenges.\"With genetics, one of the dif - ficulties is that it's very abstract for a lot of students,\" she says. \"You can see organisms and body systems, but when you are talking about genetics, present - ing it to students in a way that's more visual is some - thing they really need. \" That's one of the reasons that Sander is teaching genetics using GeneEd Web, a website that helps educators teach genetics topics more ef - fectively. The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) of the Na - tional Library of Medicine, in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), teachers, and experts in genetics and genetic counseling released the website in 2012. GeneEd is a safe and useful resource for students and teachers in grades 9-12 to learn genetics. Topics include cell biology, DNA, genes, chromosomes, and much more. GeneEd also pro - vides lesson plans, genetic educational materials, printable activity sheets, and other teaching resources for educators seeking to increase genetic and genomic literacy.\"When I first looked at GeneEd, one of the things that struck me was how up-to-date the informa - tion was,\" says Sander. \" A lot of the topics we cover, there's not a lot of information because it's so new. The fact that GeneEd had that information and had it in a way the kids could understand really impressed me. \" Teachers can use the site to intro - duce topics, supplement existing materials, and provide as a reliable source to students conducting re - search. The site links to categories such as research articles, anima - tion, games, videos, interactive tutorials, and labs and experiments. 3D images, illustrations, and text from the NHGRI Talking Glossary (www.genome.gov/glossary/index. cfm) help to enrich the user experi - ence by providing vivid imagery to reinforce genetic concepts.

A genet - ics professional meets with you to discuss genetic risks. You may follow up with genetic testing. There are many reasons to seek genetic counseling. You may consider it if you: Have or are concerned you have an inherited disorder Are pregnant or planning to be pregnant after age 35 Already have a child with a genetic disorder or birth defect Have had two or more pregnancy losses or a baby who died Have had ultrasound or screening tests that suggest a possible problem Several resources for locating a genetics professional in your community are available online: The American College of Medical Genetics (www.acmg.net) The National Society of Genetic Counselors (www.nsgc.org) The National Cancer Institute provides a Cancer Genetics Services Directory (www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory)The Genetics Home Reference (GHR) website\u2014ghr.nlm.nih.gov\u2014is a free, trustworthy, patient-friendly guide to the science of genetics. The site has topics on genetic conditions and related genes, and an illustrated tutorial that explains the basics of genetics and a glossary of genetics terms. Summaries are written in lay language by Library staff, and each is reviewed by an expert in human genetics before being posted to GHR and again with each substantive update. In April, the GHR celebrated its 10th anniversary since being launched on April 25, 2003. GHR currently offers more than 2,000 total summaries of genetic infor - mation, comprising more than 850 genetic conditions, more than 1,060 genes, about 80 gene families, and all 24 human chromosomes, plus mitochondrial DNA. About 650 genetics experts worldwide have reviewed this information.

In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick described the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the chemical compound that contains the genetic instructions for building, running, and maintaining living organisms. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Energy joined with international partners in a quest to sequence all 3 billion letters, or base pairs, in the human genome, which is the complete set of DNA in the human body. This concerted, public effort was the Human Genome Project. The Human Genome Project's goal was to provide researchers with powerful tools to understand the genetic factors in human disease. All data generated by the Human Genome Project were made freely and rapidly available on the Internet. The Human Genome Project spurred a revolution in biotechnology innovation around the world and played a key role in making the U.S. the global leader in the new biotechnology sector. In April 2003, researchers successfully completed the Human Genome Project, under budget and more than two years ahead of schedule.Today The Human Genome Project has already fueled the discovery of more than 1,800 disease genes. As a result of the Human Genome Project, today's researchers can find a gene suspected of causing an inherited disease in a matter of days, rather than the years it took before the genome sequence was in hand. There are now more than 2,000 genetic tests for human conditions. These tests enable patients to learn their genetic risks for disease and also help healthcare professionals to diagnose disease. Having the complete sequence of the human genome is similar to having all the pages of a manual needed to make the human body. The challenge now is to determine how to read the contents of these pages and understand how all of these many, complex parts work together in human health and disease. With the drastic decline in the cost of sequencing whole exomes or genomes, groundbreaking comparative genomic studies are now identifiying the causes of rare diseases. Much work still remains to be done. Despite many important genetic discoveries, the genetics of complex diseases such as heart disease are still far from clear.Tomorrow An ambitious new initiative, The Cancer Genome Atlas (http://cancergenome.nih.gov), aims to identify all the genetic abnormalities seen in 50 major types of cancer. Based on a deeper understanding of disease at the genomic level, we will see a whole new generation of targeted interventions, many of which will be drugs that are much more effective and cause fewer side effects than those available today. NIH is striving to cut the cost of sequencing an individual's genome to $1,000 or less. Individualized analysis based on each person's genome will lead to a powerful form of preventive, personalized and preemptive medicine. By tailoring recommendations to each person's DNA, health care professionals will be able to work with individuals to focus efforts on the specific strategies\u2014from diet to high-tech medical surveillance\u2014that are most likely to maintain health for that particular individual.

Name ____________________________________ dosage Ask Your Pharmacist Your pharmacist is an important part of your healthcare team. If you have questions about your medicine after you leave the doctor's office, the pharmacist can answer many of them. For example, a pharmacist can tell you how and when to take your medicine, whether a drug may change how another medicine you are taking works, and any side effects you might have. Also, the pharmacist can answer questions about over-the-counter medications. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. The pharmacist will keep track of all your medications and will be able to tell you if a new drug might cause problems. If you're not able to use just one pharmacy, show the new pharmacist your list of medicines and over-the-counter drugs when you drop off your prescription. When you have a prescription filled: 7Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first finding out if the drug will still work. 7Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine and the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type. 7Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.7Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in a dry place? 7Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions given by your doctor. If it doesn't, don't take it, and talk with the pharmacist.

ThinkStock www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 25 Now, It's Your Turn Your doctor has prescribed a medicine. The pharmacist has filled the prescription. Now it's up to you to take the medicine safely. Here are some tips that can help: 7Make a list of all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter products and dietary supplements. Show it to all of your healthcare providers including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in your medicine cabinet and one in your wallet or pocketbook. The list should include the: name of each medicine, doctor who prescribed it, reason it was prescribed, amount you take, and time(s) you take it. 7Read and save in one place all written information that comes with the medicine. 7Take your medicine in the exact amount and at the time your doctor prescribes. 7Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicine or if you are worried that it might be doing more harm than good. Your doctor may be able to change your prescription to a different one that will work better for you. 7Use a memory aid to take your medicines on time. Some people use mealtime or bedtime as a reminder to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, and weekly pill boxes. Find a system that works for you. 7Do not skip doses of medication or take half doses to save money. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you can't afford the prescribed medicine. There may be less costly choices or special programs to help with the cost of certain drugs.7Avoid mixing alcohol and medicine. Some medicines may not work correctly or may make you sick if taken with alcohol. 7Take your medicine until it's finished or until your doctor says it's okay to stop. 7Don't take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else. 7Don't take medicine in the dark. To avoid making a mistake, turn your light on before reaching for your pills. 7Check the expiration dates on your medicine bottles. Your pharmacist can probably tell you how to safely get rid of medicine you no longer need or that is out of date. The pharmacist might be able to dispose of it for you. 7Make sure you store all medicines and supplements out of sight and out of reach of children. And don't take your medicines in front of young children. They might try to copy you.

Statins are drugs that lower cholesterol to prevent heart disease. The study found more than 90 percent of people who quit had success when they tried again (for example, with a lower dose or a different statin). \"There are potentially millions of patients who could take statins again and ultimately reduce their risk of heart disease,\" says researcher Alexander Turchin, MD., of Brigham and Women's Hospital. He suggests it's something doctors and patients should discuss. The research team examined the electronic medical records of people who had been prescribed a statin at two Boston hospitals. Researchers developed software that allowed them to scour more than 5 million notes on more than 100,000 patients covering nearly a decade. Researchers say a clinical trial would be an important next step. NIH's National Library of Medicine helped fund the study. Anti-Smoking Med Shows Promise for Treating Alcohol Dependence A smoking-cessation medicine may be a viable option for treatment of alcohol dependence, according to a study by scientists at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The study found that varenicline (marketed under the name Chantix), approved in 2006 to help people stop smoking, significantly reduced alcohol consumption and craving among people who are alcohol-dependent. The findings were published online in the Journal of Addiction Medicine. \"This is an encouraging development in our effort to expand and improve treatment options for people with alcohol dependence,\" says Kenneth R. Warren, Ph.D., acting director of NIAAA. This study is the first multi-site clinical trial to test the effectiveness and safety of varenicline in a population of smokers and nonsmokers with alcohol dependence. Alcohol craving was significantly reduced in people treated with varenicline. The study was conducted under the direction of NIAAA. pCLARITY provided this 3D view showing a thick slice of a mouse brain's memory hub, or hippocampus. It reveals a few different types of cells: projecting neurons (green), connecting interneurons (red), and layers of support cells, or glia (blue). Conventional 2D methods require that brain tissue be thinly sliced, sacrific-ing the ability to analyze such intact components in relation to each other. CLAR-ITY permits such typing of molecular and cellular components to be performed repeatedly in the same brain.Scientific Breakthrough: Creating a See-Through Brain Photo: Kwanghun Chung, Ph.D., and Karl Deisseroth, M.D., Ph.D., Stanford University Scientists have created a new way to study the brain. They replaced the fat that gives brain cells their structure with a clear gel. The end result is a whole brain that's see-through. \"This feat of chemical engineering promises to transform the way we study the brain's anatomy and how disease changes it,\" says Thomas R. Insel, M.D. He directs NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, which helped fund the research. Scientists studying cells, molecules, and other fine details have been doing it by slicing brain tissue into extremely thin sections. It's time consuming and difficult to relate the fine structure to the bigger picture of how the brain is wired. This breakthrough method, called CLARITY , allows scientists to see both the details and the big picture. There's no slicing. The gel holds the brain intact so it can be studied as the three-dimensional organ it is. The gel is permeable, so features such as proteins and genes can be highlighted with stains. \"CLARITY has the potential to unmask the fine details of brains from people with brain disorders without losing larger-scale circuit perspective,\" says NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. Researchers at Stanford University developed the technique. It's for use only on tissue recovered after death. The Stanford team has used it to study an intact mouse brain and portions of a human brain. 28 Summer 2013 NIH MedlinePlusinstitutes n National library of Medicine (NlM) www.nlm.nih.gov 1-888-FIND-NLM (1-888-346-3656) n National Cancer Institute (NCI) www.cancer.gov 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) n National e ye Institute (NeI) www.nei.nih.gov (301) 496-5248 n National Heart, l ung, and Blood Institute (NHlBI) www.nhlbi.nih.gov (301) 592-8573 n National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) www.genome.gov (301) 402-0911 n National Institute on a ging (NIa) www.nia.nih.gov Aging information 1-800-222-2225 Alzheimer's information 1-800-438-4380 n National Institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (NIaaa) www.niaaa.nih.gov (301) 443-3860 n National Institute of allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIaID) www.niaid.nih.gov (301) 496-5717 n National Institute of arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases www.niams.nih.gov 1-877-22NIAMS (1-877-226-4267) n National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) www.nibib.nih.gov (301) 451-6772 n Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) www.nichd.nih.gov 1-800-370-2943 n National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) www.nidcd.nih.gov 1-800-241-1044 (voice) 1-800-241-1055 (TTY) n National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) www.nidcr.nih.gov (301) 480-4098 n National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) www.niddk.nih.gov Diabetes 1-800-860-8747 Digestive disorders Overweight and obesity 1-877-946-4627 Kidney and urologic diseases 1-800-891-5390n National Institute on Drug abuse (NID a) www.nida.nih.gov (301) 443-1124 n National Institute of environmental Health Sciences (NIeHS) www.niehs.nih.gov (919) 541-3345 n National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) www.nigms.nih.gov (301) 496-7301 n National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) www.nimh.nih.gov 1-866-615-6464 n National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) www.nimhd.nih.gov (301) 402-1366 n National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) www.ninds.nih.gov 1-800-352-9424 n National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) www.ninr.nih.gov (301) 496-0207 centers & o ffices n Fogarty International Center (FIC) www.fic.nih.gov (301) 402-8614 n National Center for Complementary and alternative Medicine (NCC aM) www.nccam.nih.gov 1-888-644-6226 n National Center for a dvancing translational Research (NC atS) www.ncats.nih.gov (301) 435-0888 n NIH Clinical Center (CC) www.cc.nih.gov (301) 496-2563 n Office of aIDS Research (O aR) http://www.oar.nih.gov (301) 496-0357 n Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) http://obssr.od.nih.go v (301) 402-1146 n Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) http://rarediseases.info.nih.go v Genetic and Rare Disease Information Center 1-888-205-2311 n Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) http://orwh.od.nih.go v (301) 402-1770 Info to Know For more information or to contact any of the following NIH institutes, centers, and offices directly, please call or go online as noted below:NIH MedlinePlus advisory Group Marin P . allen, Ph.D., Office of Communications and Public Liaison, NIH Joyce Backus, National Library of Medicine (ex-officio) Karina Boehm, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Christine Bruske, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Vicky Cahan, National Institute on AgingKym Collins-l ee, National Eye Institute alyssa Cotler, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Kathleen Cravedi, National Library of Medicine (ex-officio) Marian emr, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Jody engel, NIH Office of Disease PreventionClaudia Faigen, NIH Office of Dietary Supplements Martha Fishel, National Library of Medicine (ex-officio) lakshmi Grama, National Cancer Institute thomas Johnson, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and BioengineeringKathy Kranzfelder, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Carol Krause, National Institute on Drug Abuselonnie lisle, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disordersann l ondon, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesNaomi Miller, National Library of Medicine (ex-officio) trish Reynolds, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin DiseasesMark Siegal, National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ann t aubenheim, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutelarry t hompson, National Human Genome Research InstituteNIH Quickfinder www.medlineplus .gov Summer 2013 29 Launched April 25, 2003, the NLM's Genetics Home Reference is a free resource about human genetics created for patients, families, and the general public (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/).
