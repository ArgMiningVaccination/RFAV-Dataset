My first memories of tasting sauerkraut, the supermarket variety, as a teenager are uninspiring at best. I shudder recalling the taste. What could possibly make me think it would be worth revisiting eating such a thing, let alone making my own fermented vegetables? As it turns out, there are SO many reasons. Trillions of them on my body alone. There is a term being flung around the worlds of nutrition, psychology, epigenetics, health, even environmental research. Microbiome. What is your microbiome? Why is it important enough to make me want to eat fermented cabbage? There are literally trillions of microbes that live in and on our body. They include bacteria, fungi like yeasts, parasites and viruses. They outnumber our human cells 10 to one and their genes outnumber our genes one hundred fold. Scientist are discovering that it's in fact a beautiful symbiosis between our bodies and our microbes. We can't exist without them and they need for us for survival. Microbes perform functions like digest certain carbohydrates. This community of microbes regulate things like our digestive processes, our hormonal and immune systems and even our brains. Microbiome issues could also be behind diabetes, obesity as well as certain cancers and mental disorders. The optimal balance of the numbers and types of microbes do matter and many bacteria keep us healthy by controlling the right human genes for healthy human functioning. Consuming foods rich in healthy bacteria (pre- and probiotics) have the potential to heal and help us maintain a beneficial relationship with our microbes on a daily basis. Still curious about the Human Microbiome? Check out this YouTube video for a bit of fun: We'll be talking more about the effects of fermentation on health in the weeks coming up to the classes.
