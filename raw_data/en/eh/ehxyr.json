I have also recently learned fresh instructional methods and technology in this new age. As a college student and a postgraduate, I endured some teachers who delivered lectures in an unclear and unattractive way. As a new learner of innovative instructional methods and technology, I love gradually applying these more distinct methods to leverage my teaching delivery, making my teaching more visual and the teaching content clearer. I have been revamping all PowerPoints by choosing unique backgrounds, selecting images to illustrate the content, utilizing an overview and summary, and using diagrams instead of lines of text to make students' brains more active and the learning materials easier to understand. For asynchronous online courses, I apply an intro and outro video, annotate instead of reading from notes, and use well-prepared narratives to keep students engaged. I also make mini videos instead of one long recording. I set up the Moodle page in an easy-to-navigate format for students by using books, folders, images in banners, etc. I try to develop objective questions for quizzes and exams using a variety of question formats from factual statements to storylines, which can enhance students' critical thinking. I also encourage students to ask questions in person or via Q&A forum and Teams meetings. I am enthusiastic about ancient art-Chinese Medicine, and I believe that instructors who demonstrate curiosity and passion about a subject area motivate students to learn. I have tried to convey this by explaining the theory and presenting real-life cases to students to influence their interest and motivation in their studies. Chinese Medicine represents the accumulated years of experience and practical knowledge, a great treasure that deserves digging, inheriting, and promotion. I believe that education is not the offering of a meal but teaching one how to hunt. It is the lighting of a fire to instill enthusiasm for learning. My goal as an instructor is to ignite in my students a zeal for Chinese Medicine study by delivering my teaching in a straightforward, thorough, practical, yet fun learning process. This method fosters students and helps them become lifelong learners. What students say about me: How Dr. Wang taught Tai Ji class changed my life. At first, I was not sure if I could handle this rigorous Chinese medicine curriculum. After my first Tai Ji class with Dr. Wang, I knew I was in the right place. It grounded and centered me. The PDF slides and lecture were excellent. I appreciate that Dr. Mei Wang used many different ways to talk about the herbs. Great thought and effort have been put into the presentation. I am so excited to learn more. I can do this! Dr. Wang is such a great Professor. I am very grateful that Dr. Wang taught Herbal Review and Synthesis. Her new PowerPoint slides are great learning tools that complement her teaching style. Mei knows how to teach and how to help students understand the content. Thank you!
