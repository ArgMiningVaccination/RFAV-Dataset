Keywords: vaccine allergy, vaccine adverse event, anaphyl axis, polyethylene glycol, anti-PEG antibodies, liposome, mRNA vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer incorporate d in the form of lipid-PEG conjugates in both of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pzer/B ioNTech and Moderna to stabilize the lipid nanoparticles carrying the mRNA ( 1-3). PEG is routinely used in the formulation of protein drugs and nanomedicines to reduce agg regation and improve distribution and elimination kinetics ( 4-8). Allergic reactions to PEG have been noted for several PEGyl ated drugs,leadingtoadverseeventsrangingfrominfusionreac tionstoanaphylaxis( 9-13).Therehave also been numerous reports of allergic responses to PEGs presen t in a diverse group of goods, rangingfromosmoticlaxativestosoaps,lotions,andcosmet ics,aswellastootherpharmaceuticals such as analgesics, depo injections, laxatives, and various t ablet formulations of drugs such as antacidsandantibiotics,whichmayincludePEGasanexcipie nt(14-17).McSweeney et al. COVID Vaccine Anaphylaxis PEG Allergy Since allergic reactions to vaccines are exceptionally rare [1.3 cases per million doses ( 18)], when several cases of anaphylaxis to the Pzer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were noted soon after rollout, there were speculations that t he responsemightbeattributedtoPEGsensitivity( 19-21).Thelink between anaphylaxis to the vaccines and PEG-hypersensitivit y was recently reported for one individual in the U.K. ( 22). Here, we report another case of an individual with a PEG- allergy that was identied after experiencing anaphylaxis to the Pzer/BioNTechCOVID-19vaccine. InFebruary2021,thepatient,a20-year-oldfemale,presented to an emergency room via emergency medical services due to anaphylaxis following administration of the Pzer/BioNTec h COVID-19vaccine.Approximately10minaftervaccination,sh e developedheadacheandelevatedheartrate,whichsheattrib tofeelingsofanxietyregardingvaccination.However,5mi nlater, the pain. She self-administered intramuscular epinephrine and or al diphenhydramine,andemergencymedicalserviceswerenoti ed. The patient's past medical history included allergic and hypersensitivity reactions to foods, moderate persistent as thma, atopic dermatitis, seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis , disorder, and obesity (BMI 45 .2 kg/m2). Specically, the patient had previously experienced anaphylaxis to yeast, buckwheat, cantaloupe, as well as serio us, but non-anaphylactic, reactions to corn. The patient was also allergic to feathers, pet dander, dust mite, grass, and trees . The patientreportedsensitivitytoscentedcosmeticsandsoaps,s ome ofwhichledtourticaria. The patient had previously noticed topical allergic reactions to an oral osmotic laxative, polyethylene glycol 3350 Da (PEG 3350). Upon preparation of the oral osmotic laxative for her occupation (as a residential technician working with adults with developmental disabilities), she had skin contact with small amounts of PEG 3350 powder and developed signicant local urticaria, which occurred on at least 3 separate occasi ons. However, despite these prior events, at the time of COVID vaccine administration, the patient was not aware of a potenti al allergytoPEG. MEDICATIONS The patient regularly takes dextroamphetamine spra y contains polysorbate-80, and levocetirizine dihydrochlor ide contains PEG 400 Da. The patient has not previously noticed hypersensitivity to either medication. It should be noted th at priorworkhasshownthatatleastsomeAPAmoleculesrequirea PEGepitopethatspans 12-16repeatethyleneoxideunits( 23), which translates to PEG MW generally in excess of 500-700 Da. However, SPT testing with PEGs as small as 300 Da have shownoccasionalpositiveresponses( 14).EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND HOSPITAL COURSE AND FOLLOW-UP In the emergency department, patient had worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, including emesis. An additional dose of epinephrine was administered. No serum tryptase was taken in the acute phase. The patient was admitted for observation overnight. On the day of discharge, the patient' s gastrointestinal symptoms had resolved, although she conti nued to experience headache, dizziness, and generalized weaknes s. Thepatientwasprescribeda5-daycourseofprednisone. The patient was seen by their allergy and immunology specialist 3.5 weeks after vaccination, who performed a skin prick test (SPT) to assess hypersensitivity to PEG 3350 and polysorbate-80. Polysorbate 80 contains PEG moieties and ha s been reported to be cross reactive in some patients with PEG hypersensitivity ( 16). The patient did not take antihistamines for 1 week prior to SPT. A 1:10 solution of PEG 3350 was prepared for SPT by diluting 17g PEG 3350 in 8 ounces of water (i.e., the preparation of a dose of Miralax laxative) and then adding 1 part of that solution to 9 parts saline. Upon PEG SPT, the patient had a 8-10mm wheal and 8-10mm flare. A polysorbate-80 solution was prepared for SPT using a stock of polysorbate-80 solution (compound #62 on the NAC80 tray). Upon polysorbate-80 SPT, the patient had a 5-10mm wheal andflare. DISCUSSION This report describes anaphylaxis to the Pzer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a patient who was later conrmed to be allergic to polyethylene glycol. This report adds to several o ther recent publications describing PEG allergy-related reactio ns to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines ( 22,24,25), supporting the need for individuals with suspected allergy to PEG to consult an allergist prior to vaccination. Individuals with a history o f anaphylactoidreactionstoseveraldierenttypesofdrugssho uld raise suspicion for allergy to excipients that may be common acrossformulations,suchasPEG. One recent report describing a patient who experienced anaphylaxis following receipt of the Pzer-BioNTech vaccine conrmed PEG sensitivity via basophil activation test (with positive signal upon stimulation of whole blood in vitrowith PEG 4000 at 0.2 mg/mL) ( 24). However, a prior study including 10 PEG-sensitive patients and 16 controls demonstrated that in vitrotestshavepoorsensitivityfordetectionofPEGallergyifno t conductedwithinafewmonthsofareactionandcannotbeused to rule-out PEG allergy ( 14). To minimize the risk of causing a serious systemic reaction through SPT with high concentrati on, highMWPEG,andtoalsoreduceriskoffalsenegativendings, it has been suggested that PEG SPT should be conducted in a stepwisefashion,startingwithlowerMWPEGs(300,2000,3000 Da), increasing up to 20,000 Da, and then stepwise increasing the concentration of PEG used for SPT ( 14). Given the noted risksofsystemicreactionsfromPEGSPT,suchtestingshould be performedinasettingwell-equippedtomanageimmediate-type Frontiers in Allergy | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2021 | Volume 2 | Article 715844McSweeney et al. COVID Vaccine Anaphylaxis PEG Allergy allergicreactions.Thatsamereportfoundthatsomepatients lose reactivity to PEG SPT over time, starting with loss of SPT res ult to lower MW PEGs ( 3,000-6,000 Da), but maintain reactivity on SPT to higher MW PEGs ( 20,000 Da). This presents the risk that a diagnosis of PEG allergy may be missed if a single concentration of low MW PEG is used for testing. Indeed, a recentreportofapatientwhoexperiencedanaphylaxisfollowing SARS-CoV-2vaccinationshowednegativeSPTresultswithPEG 2000 at 0.1% and with residue from the vaccine vial. However, SPTwasrepeatedwithahigherconcentrationofPEG4000(1%) and triggered anaphylaxis ( 22). In that patient, SPT only with PEG 2000 at 0.1% prior to vaccination would have failed to indicateriskofhypersensitivity. We are routinely exposed to PEG in daily settings due to the broad inclusion of PEG in hygiene products (e.g., toothpastes , shampoo, soap), skincare products (e.g., body lotion, cosmeti cs) and processed foods, among other things ( 16,26). Very large doses of PEG are used as laxatives in children and adults and as part of bowel preparations prior to colonoscopy ( 27). Despite this, diagnoses of PEG allergy remain rare, which is consist ent with the still very low rates of anaphylaxis and injection sit e reactions with both Pzer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Nevertheless, given that the large Phase 3 vaccine trials fo r the mRNA vaccines were restricted to patients without a prior history of allergy to any vaccine components (including PEG) , the actual rates of anaphylactic responses to the COVID-19 vaccinesinthissubpopulationremainsnotwell-understood. Not surprisingly,sincerollout,patientswithapriorhistoryofa llergy to vaccine components have been advised to choose a dierent vaccineoption. We emphasize here that iduals, withthebenetsfaroutweighinganypossibledownsides,despi te rareallergicresponsessuchastheoneinthisreport.Inlight ofthe severe long-term health consequences of COVID-19 observed even in some recovered patients ( 28-32), the small risk of PEG allergy (which can be readily cared for when it occurs) is justiable. It should be further noted that the majority o f the population already possesses low levels of APA of varying isotypes[perhaps >70%ofpeople( 33)].Thus,themerepresence of pre-existing APA (particularly low titers of APA) does not imply appreciably greater risks for anaphylactic response to vaccination. Instead, it is likely that only the small numbe r of individuals with very high titers of APA are at elevated risks for PEG allergy. However, in people with pre-existing APA, administration of PEGylated liposomes may induce the production of higher levels of APA, as seen with various anima l studies (26). It remains to be determined whether the vaccines may induce elevated levels of anti-PEG antibodies (APA: IgE , IgG, or IgM) that, in turn, could theoretically increase the r isks of adverse reactions or loss of ecacy in a subset of individu als who are also treated with other PEGylated medicines. Given t he largefractionofthepopulationwithlowlevelsofpreexisting APA that may predispose them for induction of higher titers of APA, webelievethisisaquestionthatshouldberigorouslyinves tigated goingforward.It might be expected that PEG sensitivity to the rst dose of mRNA vaccine might predispose similar reactions to additional doses of the vaccine, raising concern for booster shots inten ded to enhance immunity against viral variants. However, a rece nt case series of patients who experienced anaphylaxis at their rst mRNA vaccination found that 19 of 19 patients who still chose to receive the second dose did not experience anaphylaxi s on the second dose, possibly suggesting a role for an allergic , but non-IgE-mediated mechanism, such as mast-cell activat ion or complement activation to a lipid or PEG component of the vaccine, as has been occasionally observed with other PEGylated lipid nanoparticles ( 34,35). Determining the titers of isotypes of APA in these individuals would allow us to better understand whether circulating APA may be an eective marker forpredictingPEGsensitivity. Currently,screeningforPEGallergyatthetimeofvaccinat ion remains prohibitively challenging to perform and of uncertain benet/cost ratio, given the low rates of anaphylactic react ions observed to date and generally good outcomes among patients who experience anaphylaxis. It remains to be determined whether APA levels could predict potential allergic responses to mRNA vaccines formulated with PEGylated lipids. Finally, it may be important to improve awareness of PEG allergy amongpharmacistsandphysicians,aswellasawarenessofwhich medications contain PEG ( 36), as PEGylated therapies are used with increasing frequency in the clinical setting. This is mo re relevant now than ever; more individuals have been treated withaPEGylatedintervention(namely,thePzer/BioNTecha nd Moderna COVID-19 vaccines) in the past year than in the 25 + yearhistoryofuseofallpriorPEGylatedtherapiescombined.
