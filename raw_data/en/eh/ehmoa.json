Conjugated hemo-globin is also in ongoing clinical trials. Meanwhile,recombinant Hb has been modied to modulate theeffects of nitric oxide. Other systems contain antioxidantenzymes for those clinical applications that may havepotential problems related to ischemia-reperfusion inju-ries. Other developments are based on hemoglobin-lipidvesicles and also the use of nanotechnology and biode- gradable copolymers to prepare nano-dimension articialred blood cells containing hemoglobin and complexenzyme systems. hemoglobin (1-5) only started when native hemoglobin wasshown to be toxic for human use. Research usingnative hemoglobin started in 1937 when Ambersonprepared a hemoglobin solution obtained by lysingred blood cells for experimental transfusion in ani-mals (6). It delivered oxygen but was highly toxic tothe kidney and causes hypertension. Removal of thered blood cell membrane stroma resulted in stroma-free native hemoglobin that had less renal toxicity inthe animals (7). However, Savitsky's Phase-I clinicaltrial in 1978 showed that this still showed renal tox-icity in addition to vasoactivities (8) The use of nativehemoglobin was therefore discontinued. MODIFIED HEMOGLOBIN Since native hemoglobin was found to be toxic, researchers turned to Chang's earlier basic study ofencapsulated and crosslinked Hb started many yearsago (9-11). Unfortunately, efforts to develop modi-ed hemoglobin were not seriously attempted untilafter the disaster of HIV in donor blood. By then, it was already too late. Modied Hbs that have beendeveloped and tested clinically 1). Polyhemoglobin Bifunctional agents were rst used by Chang to cross-link the reactive amino groups of Hb, produc-ing polyhemoglobin (polyHb) 2) and glutaralde-hyde (11). Glutaraldehyde-cross-link material that has been developed inde-pendently by Gould's group at Northeld for trials (12-15). Theirpyridoxalated glutaraldehyde humanpolyHb is in advance stages of This preparation contains less than 1% ofcross-linked tetrameric Hb (12). Their clinical trialsinclude the use of high doses (up to 20 units or 10 L)of this preparation in trauma surgery (12,13). extensively tested in clinical trials. It has beenapproved for routine clinical applications in SouthAfrica (16) Another Biopure bovine polyhemoglobin aor_7394.fm Page 1 Friday, June 18, 2004 5:38 PM 2T .M.S. CHANG Artif Organs, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2004 with slightly higher percentage of cross-linked tet- rameric Hb has been approved for routine use foranemia in dogs in the US. In another approach, Hsiauses a 2,3-DPG-pocket modier prepared using dial-dehyde derived from o-rafnose forming polyhe-moglobin (17,18). The group from Hemosol has beenusing this to form human polyHb containing 36%cross-linked tetrameric hemoglobin but clinical trialhas been temporarily suspended pending furtherstudies. Conjugated hemoglobin Basic research from Chang's group shows that Hb can be cross-linked to polymers to form an insolubleconjugated (9,10). This rst by Wong's groupusing dextran, DeAngelo, and More recently, Winslow from the San-gart group has developed a new Maleimide PEG-hemoglobin that is now in Phase II clinical trial Cross-linked tetrameric that mod- ies the 2,3-DPG pocket (25). However, clinical trialsshow that there were substantial vasoactivities andclinical studies were suspended. Recombinant human hemoglobin Hoffman et al. successfully prepared recombinant human Hb (26). This was developed by the groupfrom Somatogen for clinical trials (27) Clinical trialsshowed substantial vasoactivities and a new recom-binant hemoglobin was therefore developed tochange the reactivity of Hb for nitric oxide to preventvasoactivities (28). Vasoactivities We still do not know the exact reason why some of the modied hemoglobin solutions cause vaso-constriction and why there are variations between FIG. 1.

Karger Publisher, (1997). polyHb 1964 Chang - Diacid 1971 - Recombinant Human Hb 1990 et Friday, June 18, 2004 5:38 PM HEMOGLOBIN BASED RED BLOOD CELL SUBSTITUTES 3 Artif Organs, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2004 different types of modied hemoglobin. The most commonly accepted theory is as follows (5,12,13).The intercellular junctions of the endothelial lining of vascular wall allow single tetrameric hemoglobinto enter into the interstitial space. There, hemoglobinacts as a sink in binding and removing nitric oxideneeded for maintaining the normal tone of smoothmuscles. This results in vasoconstriction and the con-striction of other smooth muscles especially those ofthe esophagus and the GI tract. The evidence for thisis as follows. Gould's group using polyhemoglobinwith < 1% tetrameric hemoglobin did not report vasoactivities even when large volumes of 10 unitswere infused. With Biopure's bovine polyhemoglo-bin containing less than 5% tetrameric hemoglobin,there were only slight vasoactivities when very largevolumes were used. With another type of polyhemo-globin containing 36% tetrameric hemoglobin, sig-nicant vasoactivities and increased smooth musclecontractions could be observed when using largervolumes. In the case of 100% tetrameric hemoglobin,even smaller volume would cause vasoactivities andincreased smooth muscle contractions. Modied tet-rameric recombinant hemoglobin that did not bindnitric oxide, also did not cause vasoconstriction (25).Furthermore, Winslow uses a conjugated hemoglobinwhere all the hemoglobin molecules are crosslinkedto a soluble polymer, PEG. With the high waterhydration of PEG, the resulting conjugated hemoglo-bin has a high molecular radius and thus does notcross the intercellular junction and this preparationdid not cause vasoconstriction. There is anotherschool of thought especially that from Winslow andhis colleagues. Their theory is that, unlike hemoglo-bin inside red blood cells, modied hemoglobin beinga solution is in close contact with the vascular wall.In addition they propose that modied hemoglobinin solution increases the rate of release of oxygenfrom red blood cells by facilitated diffusion. Theypropose that, the premature release of oxygen at highconcentrations results in vasoconstriction. Wilsonwill be expanding on this in his article. MODIFIED HEMOGLOBIN WITH ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES Red blood cells contain antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase. Most of themodied-Hb blood substitutes are prepared usingultrapure hemoglobin containing no enzymes. Theyare effective as oxygen carriers in conditions with noprolonged ischemia as in routine surgery. However,in condition with prolonged ischemia, there is poten-tial injuries (29,30) Compared to polyHb, PolyHb-SOD-CAThas much lower tendency to generate free-radicalsin-vitro and in-vivo (30-33). In a combined PolyHb-SOD-CAT, unlike notcause disruption of the blood-brain barrier or brainedema (33) (Fig. 3). Another group is studying theuse of polynitroxylated hemoglobin with antioxidantactivity (59). This chemical modication gives rise toSOD-CAT like activities. Nanodimension encapsulated Hb The rst encapsulation of the contents of red blood cells, including Hb and enzymes, inside articial redblood cells with articial membranes was reported byChang in 1957 (35). Red-blood-cell enzymes such ascarbonic anhydrase (9) and catalase (35) have beenincluded in these articial red blood cells. The majorproblem was a short circulation time resulting fromrapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (10).One of the problems was that the diameters of themicrocapsules were relatively large(1-5 m m). Hemoglobin lipid vesicles In 1980, Djordjevich used lipid membrane lipo- somes to encapsulate hemoglobin with a diameter of0.2 m m (36). These remained in the circulation for a longer period than those described above. The 21 FIG. 3.

CHANG Artif Organs, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2004 groups of Rudolph and Tsuchida have carried out extensive research using lipid-encapsulated hemo-globin (37-39). Philips' group showed that PEG-lipid vesicles are especially effective in increasing thecirculation time (38) Hemoglobin lipid vesicles havebeen used successfully to replace most of the redblood cells in rats and also for the treatment of mas-sive hemorrhage (37-39). Tsuchida and his collabo-rators are completing detailed safety and efcacypreclinical studies in animals with promising results(39). Biodegradable-copolymer membrane nanocapsules containing Hb and red blood cell enzymes Polylactide and polyglycolide are biodegraded in the body into water and carbon dioxide. Chang hasearlier used a biodegradable polylactide polymer toencapsulate Hb and enzymes in the micron range(40) and more recently, in the nanodimension, 0.08-0.180 m m in diameter (41-43) (Fig. 4). able to are permeable to FIG. 4.

This makes possible the preparation of Hb nanocapsulescontaining the methemoglobin reductase system(42,43). Reducing agents can also diffuse into thenanocapsules to convert metHb to Hb as has beendemonstrated by in vitro studies (42-45). We synthesized of new polylactide-polyethylene glycol copolymers (PEG-PLA). One ofthese when used for the membrane of nanocapsulescan increase the circulation time of the nanodimen-sion articial red blood cells to double that of poly-hemgolobin (44-46). Infusion of one third the bloodvolume into rats did not result in vasoactivities.Long-term follow up has been completed and theresults show that these PEG-PLA nanocapsules con-taining hemoglobin did not result in any changes inbiochemistry, enzymes, or histology. Oxygen therapeutics In addition to their use to support the oxygen- carrying function of red blood cell substitutes, thereare other potential clinical applications. As dis-cussed earlier, polyhemoglobin-catalase-superoxidedismutase has been used in a rat stroke modelto supply the needed oxygen without causingischemia-reperfusion injuries (33). Another exam-ple is that tumors are not well perfused by bloodbut radiation therapy would be more effective withbetter supply of oxygen. Thus animal studies showthat polyhemoglobin being a solution can betterperfuse tumors for radiation therapy (14). Morerecently, we developed a polyhemglobin-tyrosinasecomplex that can supply oxygen for radiation ther-apy and at the same time markedly decrease sys-temic tyrosine (47). In a mouse model, intravenousinjections signicantly decrease the growth of mela-noma since melanoma requires tyrosine for growth(47). DISCUSSION In summary, Polyhemoglobin is already well into the nal stages of clinical trials in humans. One ofthese has been approved for routine clinical usesin South Africa. Meanwhile, new generations ofmodied Hb are being developed that can modu-late the effects of nitric oxide. Other systems arealso being developed to include antioxidant prop-erties for those clinical applications that may havepotential problems related to oxygen radicals. Afurther development is the use of lipids or bio-degradable polymer membranes to prepare arti-cial red blood cells containing and complexenzyme systems.
