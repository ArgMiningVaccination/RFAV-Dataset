The immunity ofthe vaccinated also protects others who cannot be safelyor effectively vaccinated \u2014including infants and the immunosuppressed. When vaccination rates fall, diseaseslike measles can rapidly resurge in a population. Thosewho cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons are at thehighest risk of severe disease and death. They thus maybear the burden of others 'freedom to opt out of vaccination. It is often asked whether it is legitimate forstates to adopt and enforce mandatory universalvaccination. Yet this neglects a related question: arethose who opt out, where it is permitted, morally responsible when others are harmed or die as a result of their decision? In this article, we argue that individualswho opt out of vaccination are morally responsible forresultant harms to others. Using measles as our mainexample, we demonstrate the ways in which opting outof vaccination can result in a signi cant risk of harm and death to others, especially infants and theimmunosuppressed. We argue that imposing these riskswithout good justi cation is blameworthy and examine ways of reaching a coherent understanding of individualmoral responsibility for harms in the context of thecollective action required for disease transmission.Finally, we consider several objections to this view,provide counterarguments and suggest morallypermissible alternatives to mandatory universalvaccination including controlled infection, self-imposedsocial isolation and nancial penalties for refusal to vaccinate. INTRODUCTION Vaccine-preventable infectious diseases Many vaccine-preventable infections are transmitted between human beings and can cause serious harmor death. Measles, for example, is one of the mostinfectious known human viruses. It is transmittedvia the airborne route, and outbreaks can resultfrom minimal social contact between contagiousand susceptible individuals. 12In most people, measles causes mild disease, but in some cases there are serious sequelae including lung in flammation (pneumonitis), brain in flammation (encephalitis), permanent disability and death. US historical data suggest a death rate of about 1 in every 350 -1200 cases.13Risks of both complications and death are highest in infants, young children, the malnourishedand the immunosuppressed. 3Prior to widespread measles vaccination, there were, on average, >500 000 cases of measles and 400 deaths per yearin the USA. 1Measles previously also accounted fora signi cant proportion of deaths among young people undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemiai.4 Currently , measles continues to cause >100 000 deaths per year worldwide \u2014mostly in children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa andIndia, in communities where vaccination ratesremain suboptimal. 5 Modern inoculations for many common diseases are extremely safe and effectively prevent illness in the vast majority of those vaccinated. Vaccines haveplayed a major role in the eradication of smallpoxand near eradication of polio. High rates of vaccin-ation against such diseases also protect those whocannot be safely vaccinated, such as infants and the immunosuppressed, through promotion of herd protection (or 'herd immunity '). 6 The measles vaccine is especially safe and effective, with signi cant side effects from vaccination being exceedingly rare. A careful long-term follow-upstudy of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)vaccination found zerodeaths due to the vaccine and a less than one in a million chance of encephalitis. 7 There are several groups that cannot be safely or effectively vaccinated with some vaccines (eg,infants, the immunode cient and the immunosup- pressed). 89The only way these vulnerable indivi- duals can be effectively protected against commoninfections, apart from extremely onerous social iso-lation (eg, 'boy in a bubble 'scenarios), is through herd protection (achieved by high vaccinationrates). iiHerd protection models for measles suggest that well over 90% of a population need to be vac-cinated in order to reliably prevent sustained trans-mission. 10-12Recent outbreaks have shown that measles can spread quickly and cause signi cant harm when vaccination rates fall.23The presence of such vulnerable individuals raises questions as towhether these people should bear the burdens ofthe decisions of others not to vaccinate and to whatdegree the latter should be considered morallyresponsible for resultant harms to the former. In this article, we propose that those who opt out of vaccination are morally responsible (and in particular, blameworthy) for the harms suffered byothers as a result of infectious outbreaks. In otherwords, non-vaccinators are morally blameworthyfor the morbidity and mortality caused by iMeasles still poses signi cant risks in this context despite prior vaccination of patients with cancer. iiThat is, a suf ciently high proportion of those with whom they come into contact must be vaccinated or immune from past infection: to minimise risk, this proportion must approach 100%. 762 Jamrozik E, et al.J Med on February 3, 2017 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/ Downloaded from infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccination. Exactly how blame should in practice be apportioned among differentindividuals is a question that is beyond the scope of thisarticle to resolve: but we show that there is at least one plausibleand morally defensible way that blame could be ascribed to non-vaccinators. If our argument is sound, it joins other signicant grounds that support public health intervention in this area. 13-16 W e focus on the example of measles because it is highly con- tagious in social situations where people merely share the sameair. Similar considerations apply to many other commoninfections transmitted in similar ways, but we leave asidediseases with other modes of transmission, noting that thesedifferences and their moral aspects have received some attentionelsewhere. 16 17 One way to support our thesis would be to analyse the concept of moral responsibility so as to identify suf cient conditions, and then to show that these conditions apply tonon-vaccinators and the harms they cause. While we think thisroute is defensible, it is dif cult to frame in a way that is not question-begging. Any account of suf cient conditions (for moral responsibility) that supports our conclusion is likely to bemore contentious than the conclusion itself. Instead, we adopt the following, two-pronged strategy. First, we simply conjecture that non-vaccinators are responsible forharms and present some relatively uncontentious necessary con-ditions of moral responsibility. W e consider some possible objec-tions to our responsibility thesis, organised around theseconditions, and show that they all fail. Thus, we show that thereis no knockdown objection to our claim. Second, we argue thatthere are a number of cases where we do in fact consider indivi-duals blameworthy for harms that bear important similarities tothe harms caused by non-vaccinators. The legitimacy of consid-ering individuals responsible in these other cases suggests that itis analogously legitimate to consider non-vaccinatorsresponsible. MORAL RESPONSIBILITY, BLAME AND RISK Those who are morally responsible for an outcome are propersubjects of praise or blame for that outcome. So, for our pur-poses, to say that someone is morally responsible for anoutcome O is equivalent to saying that they are worthy of (ie,deserve) praise or blame for O. The project of analysing thenecessary and suf cient conditions for moral responsibility, however, remains contentious. W e do not hope to offer a com-plete account here. Instead, we propose three necessary condi-tions for moral responsibility. The conditions will be speci ed only roughly , but with enough precision to ensure that they canbe uncontroversially applied to the vast majority of cases ofharm caused by refusal to vaccinate. An agent A is morally responsible for outcome O only if (Cause ) Agent A performs an action that is a relevant part of a causal explanation of O. (Salience) Outcome O is morally salient \u2014it is a good or bad outcome. (Foreseeability ) Outcome O is a predictable or foreseeable outcome of action . Evidently , refusal to vaccinate frequently satis es the salience condition: the harms caused by infectious diseases are highlysignicant. Further, we see no dif culty meeting the foreseeabil- itycondition. No doubt, when inoculation was a novel inven- tion and mechanisms of transmission were less widely understood, refusal of a vaccination would not have always satis-ed the foreseeability condition. But now, at least in thosecountries where vaccination is widely available, it is practically common knowledge that non-vaccination can have dangerousconsequences for oneself and for others. The most serioussource of potential resistance is the causal condition. Although it is undeniable that some individuals 'refusal to vaccinate is part of the causal explanation of some infections, it might be dis-puted whether the 'relevant 'sort of causal connection required for moral responsibility is present. For the moment, we put thisobjection to the side: it will be addressed in a section below. These conditions provide a natural way to identify possible sources of objection to our conjecture that non-vaccinators areresponsible for harms that result from their resultant lack ofimmunity. In the following sections, we consider and addressthe following purported objections:1. Non-vaccinators lack the relevant sort of agency to be con- sidered responsible for harms that result from a failure tovaccinate. The harms do not arise from anything that non-vaccinators do. 2. Harms due to a failure to vaccinate are due to collective behaviours of many individuals, and consequently the causal condition for responsibility is not satis ed. 3. Non-vaccinators may be morally responsible for the decision whether or not to vaccinate, but there is no duty to vaccin- ate. V accination is supererogatory, and so failure to vaccinate is not blameworthy . OBJECTION: NON-VACCINATION AND AGENCY T o legitimately consider someone morally responsible for anoutcome, it is necessary that the person had a relevant form ofagency , and that this agency was involved in the appropriate way in the outcome for which they are attributed responsibility. It is for this sort of reason that it does not make much sense toconsider someone responsible for the fact that 2 is a primenumber; nor for the actions of their ancestors of 20 generationsearlier. These states of affairs do not stand in the appropriatecausal relationship to the agency of an allegedly responsibleperson. No one can causally in fluence what happened 20 gen- erations earlier, nor can one in fluence a mathematical fact. In non-vaccination cases, it might be objected that the harms that result from non-vaccination are not harms that the non-vaccinator has caused to occur; they are, rather, harms that the non-vaccinator has merely failed to prevent . Or a somewhat dif- ferent claim might be made: that the agent has not intended the harm. For one or both of these reasons, it might be argued,the agency of the non-vaccinator is not suf ciently involved in the harm for us to hold the agent responsible. Considered generally, this type of objection relies on two claims. First: a conceptual claim is required, distinguishing two types of harm, such that stereotypical wrongful harms fall inone category , while harms suffered as a causal consequence ofnon-vaccination fall in the other. As already suggested, allmanner of distinctions might be used in this way: we can distin-guish between harms that are a result of doing versus allowing ; or harms that we commit rather than those that we omit to prevent ; or harms that we intend versus those that we do not intend. 18Call this rst part of the response the conceptual claim. Second, it must be argued that the distinction identi ed in the conceptual claim separates states of affairs for which we may be held responsible and those for which we cannot. \"W e can be held responsible for the harms that we in flict on others, but not for those that we merely fail to prevent \", or something to this effect. Call this the moral signi cance claim. Jamrozik 3, 2017 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/ Downloaded from This response is implausible because there are numerous examples\u2014 unrelated to vaccination \u2014which illustrate the cred- ibility of considering individuals responsible for harms that they both (i) did not intend and (ii) did not cause directly by theiractions, but merely failed to prevent. Consider: Intoxicated driver. A driver is driving while intoxicated at a safe and reasonable speed. Due to her intoxication, however, she blacks out brie fly . During the blackout, she runs a red light, and her vehicle collides with a pedestrian, killing him. In such cases, the relevant agent does not intend the harm: the harm comes about as a result of failures to act. Indeed, atthe crucial time of the red light signal, the driver is not capableof acting in the required way because she is unconscious.Perhaps in some cultures, and in some historical periods, thisdriver would not be considered responsible for her carelessbehaviour; but in many cultures and jurisdictions she would be,and it is not credible to suppose that some conceptual error isoccurring in such cases. If it is coherent to consider individualsresponsible in cases like this, then there is no principled basisfor objection that non-vaccinators cannot be considered respon-sible because they lack appropriate agency for the harms thatthey transmit to others. That said, it remains very plausible thatintentionally caused harms warrant more blame than uninten-tionally caused harms. W e might think that the person who acci-dentally forgets to get vaccinated deserves less blame than theperson who actively decides against vaccination. In addition, insome countries vaccination is dif cult to obtain, and where it is not universally and freely available (or heavily subsidised), somepeople may have dif culty paying the nancial costs. Cases like these would seem to be much less culpable, especially wherevaccines are not available, and blame may be attributable tolocal or international public health agencies. But this is noobjection to our thesis that non-vaccinators (with easy access tovaccines) can legitimately be considered responsible. OBJECTION: COLLECTIVE ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY T ypically, one person being unvaccinated is extremely unlikely to cause harm to others because the probability of having directcontact with both a contagious person (to become infected) anda vulnerable person (infecting them) is low, at least in popula-tions where vaccine uptake levels are high. Actual transmissionsto vulnerable individuals will typically involve a chain of trans-mission involving dozens of unvaccinated individuals. Is the collective nature of the harm-causing process compat- ible with considering individuals responsible? W e might have concerns about overdetermination (where multiple chains oftransmission within an outbreak are suf cient to cause a given harm) or because of more general concerns that our ordinary assumptions about individual responsibility are not appropriate to collective causation. T o address the concern about overdetermination rst: this will depend to a large extent on disease epidemiology. T ake twoextreme cases: iii(i) endemic malaria: each sick person 's clinical case of malaria is likely to be overdetermined since they will be infected with parasites transmitted to them by many otherpeople, and each episode of transmission is itself potentially suf-cient to cause clinical malaria; and (ii) measles in a country with a high vaccination rate: here each sick person 's clinical case of measles is much more likely to have been transmitted tothem by just one other person, and each sick person is unlikely to have had suf cient contact with more than one infectious case. iv In cases like the former (endemic malaria), our ordinary ascriptions of responsibility might seem inappropriate. Blaming someone for a bad outcome usually implies that, had the blamed party behaved otherwise, the bad outcome would not have occurred. This is precisely what fails to hold in overdeter- mination cases. Legal doctrine has evolved ingenious strategies to address this sort of concern so that parties who participate in multiple, sim-ultaneous wrongs (eg, Jones burns down the factory from theoutside, Smith blows it up from the inside; had one of them notacted, the factory would have been destroyed anyway) cannotbenet from the overdetermination of the damage they collect- ively do. In dealing with overdetermination of risks, the mea- sures become even more conceptually sophisticated. 19 20We suggest something similar should happen here: we should adjustour understanding of causation so as to ensure that overdeter-mined harms are still caused in the relevant sense. Blind adher-ence to a counterfactual test of causal responsibility will give anabsurd answer to questions of blameworthiness. That suggestswe should reject the counterfactual test rather than denying thatanyone should be blamed for overdetermined harms. v Overdetermination aside, the question of how to apportion individual responsibility in cases where one group (those whoopt out of vaccination) collectively causes harms to anothergroup (those who are vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease)remains. Even for cases like measles in high-income countries,one individual alone opting out of vaccination is rarely suf cient to cause infection in another. Such transmission will most com-monly involve a causal chain leading back to many other suscep-tible people, some of whom have chosen to remain susceptibleby opting out of vaccination. vi Suppose a chain of transmitters (T1 T2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7T100) infect an immunosuppressed victim V . Suppose all T1 -T100 opted out of vaccination, knowing that this might cause harm toothers. Suppose further that they all engaged in similar risk- creating behaviours: they had similar exposure to immunosup- pressed individuals and took similar precautions with washinghands and the like. Had T100 obtained a vaccination, V wouldnot have become unwell. viiBut it is also the case that had T99 obtained a vaccination, V would not have become unwell. Andso on, for every member of the chain. So who is responsible? At this point, it is helpful to stress the distinction between moral responsibility for conduct versus moral responsibility for consequences of our conduct. It is possible to think that iiiNoting that a wide range of cases exist between these extremes.ivAlthough for both malaria and measles there is some evidence of a relationship between pathogen 'dose 'and severity of disease. vEven where overdetermination applies, other authors have provided a coherent account of moral reasons not to contribute to collective harms where those harms are likely to be overdetermined (eg, climate change). Barry C & Overland G. Individual Responsibility for Carbon Emissions.In: eremy Moss (ed), Climate Change and Justice, Cambridge UniversityPress, Cambridge, UK, 2015:165 -183. Similar reasoning may apply to infection, and this may be a fruitful path for future enquiry . viIt is not merely that these events are earlier in time to the ultimate transmission event of interest (eg, to a vulnerable person) but that it isthe combined actions (ie, refusals to vaccinate) of the collective involved in the chain that are together suf cient to cause harm. viiW e here assume, for illustrative purposes, that V 's infection is not overdetermined \u2014that is, V would not have been infected by another chain of transmitters if the chain of infection from T1 to T100 to V hadnot occurred. on February 3, 2017 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/ Downloaded from someone is blameworthy for their conduct without holding them blameworthy for all the bad consequences of theirconduct. The distinction is philosophically important becausethe outcomes of our actions are never entirely under ourcontrol, whereas our conduct is \u2014at least to a much greater degree. If we consider individuals responsible to differentdegrees because their conduct, though similar, led to differentoutcomes, then we introduce an element of luck into our systemof moral judgement. This 'moral luck 'is a pervasive feature of normal moral practices involving praise and blame, but it is con-troversial among theorists whether it can be justi ed. 21 So, in the present case, with respect to their conduct, ex hypothesi , each of the 100 individuals is equally blameworthy. They all imposed similar risks and had similar foreknowledgeand control over those risks. Their moral responsibility forharm to others will be affected by moral luck because not every-one who behaves in a similarly blameworthy way will cause thesame harms. While all non-vaccinators are guilty of equally blameworthy conduct (ie, they have all behaved equally badly), only those who are actually involved in chains of transmission to vulnerable individuals end up being morally responsible/ blameworthy for harm because causation is a necessary condi- tion for blameworthiness; and the causal difference between these groups is a matter of sheer luck. With regard to moralresponsibility for harm, therefore, moral luck is inescapable. W e claim that those non-vaccinators involved in a chain causing harm are blameworthy for avoidable harms arising fromnon-vaccination and, in practice, this means that they could legitimately be blamed for these harms . viiiW e do not claim that there is a uniquely appropriate way , in theory or practice, toassign blame for the eventual harms, at least in part because ofthe element of moral luck that in fluences the outcomes of risky behaviours. With regard to theory, there may be multiple plaus-ible views about the degree of blame that the 100 individuals inquestion deserve for harm to V . With regard to practice, indeter-minacy could be resolved by adopting particular conventions orlaws. There are numerous examples of stable moral practices inwhich we hold people blameworthy for the outcomes of their collective risky behaviour and we see no reason to think that an appropriate custom could not be devised for non-vaccination. T o illustrate, consider three ways (not exhaustive) in which we might ascribe blame to those involved in chains of transmission: i. Nobody among T1 -T100 is blamed for the harm to V . ii. Only T100 is blamed for the harm to V (proximate cause).iii. All individuals, T1 to T100, are blamed to an equal degree for the harm to V . With regard to the rst option: is it plausible to think that no one is blameworthy for the harm? A crucial requirement for any credible account of individual and collective responsibility isthat individuals are not left with perverse incentives to (collect-ively) impose large risks on others for little or no bene tt o themselves. Allowing non-vaccinators to escape allresponsibility for subsequent deaths fails this basic test. 22The second of these policies (blaming the proximate cause T100) might be appealing in practice because of its convenience: it requires only one individual be found to receive the warrantedblame. Theoretically , however, it is implausible to consider the proximate cause more blameworthy (for harm) than any other member of the chain. Of 100 individuals who imposed similar risks and had similar causal involvement in the death, it wassheer luck that made T100 the ultimate transmitter of the harmto a vulnerable person. 23There would thus be a very strong element of moral luck, making it, on some views, unfair toblame only T100, given that T1 -T99 were all similarly blame- worthy . Nevertheless, a moral community could have practicalor policy reasons (eg, deterrence) to blame only the proximatetransmitter \u2014even if this blame were out of proportion to her causal role in the harm. ix The third policy would regard each individual in the chain (who had reasonable opportunity to act otherwise) as blame-worthy for the harms that arise. By considering each morallyresponsible, we acknowledge that each is implicated in causingavoidable harm. x That said, there remain many unresolved questions about how to apportion blame in collective action cases. In our con-trived example, the causal roles of T1 -T100 are all similar. But in cases where the contributions are heterogeneous (eg, somebetter foresee harms than others, some take more/better infec-tion control measures than others, etc), we may need to discrim-inate different degrees of blame deserved by the various agents.For instance, one fundamental issue is whether it is possible tomeaningfully quantify the degree of causal contribution that anagent (or chance) makes to an outcome. Intuitively, we can atleast make a partial ranking of contributions in multiagentcases: some contribute more than others, though some contribu-tions may be incomparable. While we may take some guidancefrom this partial ranking information, it will leave some issuesindeterminate. For instance, if A makes a greater contributionthan B, this may constrain us to ascribe a greater quantum ofdeserved blame to A. But suppose that a third agent C isinvolved, and neither A 's contribution nor B 's contribution is comparable to the contribution of C. (T o illustrate with anexample: T ransmitter A may have made a greater contributionthan transmitter B, because although both refused vaccinations,transmitter A made more reckless visits to hospitals and otherenvironments in which immunosuppressed individuals reside.T ransmitter C took the most stringent hygiene precautions ofall, but C was also the blogger who spread 'antivaccination ' ideas to A and B, such that they would have been much morelikely to get a vaccination had C not written the blog. W e mightthink that C 's contribution is so different from A 's and B 's that it cannot obviously be rated as greater, less than or equivalent in magnitude to either of them.) How much blame does C deserverelative to these others? Any particular answer will involve somearbitrariness. At least one further question remains: does the blame deserved by one agent change, depending on whether other agents (or chancy processes) are involved in causing the harm? viiiHere, and below, we distinguish being blameworthy (or being morally responsible) in theory from being blamed (or being held morally responsible) in practice. While the moral practice of blame might often map onto theoretical accounts of blameworthiness, this need not alwaysbe the case. For practical reasons, for example, we may sometimes choose not to actually blame those who are blameworthy (for harm). While the majority of this article focuses on the question of who ismorally blameworthy for what (in theory), in what follows we alsoconsider suggestions regarding who should be blamed for what (in practice).ixAnd following David Lewis, it could be argued that this practice does treat all wrongdoers equally: they are all subjected to equivalent risks of being blamed.24 xIt also anticipates a potential objection in that we need not trace the causal chain back ad in nitum since only some members of the chain had reasonable opportunity to act otherwise: for example, when an outbreak in a high-income country begins with an imported case from a low-income country or a community with poor access to vaccination. Jamrozik E, et al.J Med Ethics 3, 2017 Published by http://jme.bmj.com/ Downloaded from Suppose that an agent 's causal contribution to an outcome (including the degree to which he foresaw and intended the outcome) is the same in two scenarios S1 and S2, but that in S1the outcome is facilitated (or hindered) by another agent,whereas in S2 he achieves the outcome alone. Does the agent deserve the same or a different degree of blame for the out- comes in these alternative scenarios? One possibility is to treatthe total quantum of blame deserved for a given harm as con-stant, regardless of the number of agents, and to distribute itamong the agents who causally contribute (eg, if three playsimilar roles in collectively causing a death, they may eachdeserve a reduced share of the blame that would ordinarily beascribed to one individual for that death). This is what typicallyhappens with liability to pay compensation. The amount ofcompensation required is constant, and mechanisms like jointand several liability allow that constant sum to be distributed ina variety of ways over the liable parties. On this approach, thepresence of an additional agent will lead to a reduction indegree of blame deserved. Another possibility is that the blamedeserved by the agent is identical in the two cases: despite thefact that our agent had an accomplice in his blameworthy deed,the degree of blame he deserves for the harm remains thesame. xi Regardless of how we resolve these issues, it should be stressed again that any such proposal that makes causation anecessary condition of blame for harm will be affected by moralluck ( just as in the case of blaming the proximate cause T100).Given this, we may wish to consider whether it is preferable (inpractice) to adopt other policies \u2014such as vaccine mandates \u2014 which would arguably involve a fairer distribution of risk andavoid the case where an unlucky subset of risk imposers wouldbe blamed for their chance involvement in harms. While it may not be possible to prescribe one uniquely pre- ferred approach to apportioning moral responsibility to indivi-duals in cases of collective responsibility , we believe that at leastone of the above methods of attributing blame is defensible, andthat is all we require for the defence of our thesis. While theincompleteness of our account may leave some degree of arbi- trariness in the choice of rules to ascribe responsibility in theory and practice, this is no worse than the degree of arbitrariness inextant norms and laws: we punish attempted murderers lessharshly than successful ones; we blame reckless drivers whocause injury much more harshly than those who luckily avoidinjuring anyone; and we are of course resigned to blamingmuch less harshly those who simply evade detection. OBJECTION: VACCINATION IS SUPEREROGATORY The nal objection we consider concedes that non-vaccinators are responsible for imposing risks on others, but denies that they are blameworthy. The idea is that while it might be praise- worthy to obtain a vaccination, it is strictly supererogatory to do so. Refusal to vaccinate is permissible either because vaccin- ation comes at a signi cant cost to oneself or because the magni- tude of risk imposed is not considered morally signi cant. This latter argument might proceed either by asserting that the abso- lute risk is small or by asserting that the overall risks and bene- ts of some social practice are equitably shared across the population.Partiality to self It is unreasonable to expect individuals to do everything theycan to minimise risks to others. In particular, it is hard to acceptthat individuals have to bear signi cant risks of injury to them- selves in order to achieve modest risk reductions for numerousothers. Even if the net effect of the action is to reduce levels ofexpected harm to others, we might hold that \u2014in some cases \u2014 there is a reasonable degree of partiality to oneself, such that it is merely supererogatory to undergo the risk in question.Serving as an experimental subject in a new drug trial might bean example where the risks are distributed in this fashion. Having stated this objection, it is evidently implausible in the case of vaccination. First and foremost, non-vaccinators usually make themselves worse off by refusing a vaccine. So it is simply not the case that they would have to undergo a signi cant cost in order to reduce risk to others. But suppose we defer to asincere non-vaccinator 's claim that they believe it to be an undue hardship to receive a vaccine. How then do the burdensof vaccination compare to the potential risks to others? T akingmeasles as an example again, the risk of death due to vaccin-ation is zero and the risk of serious vaccine reaction requiringhospitalisation is around 0.003% per dose, 7whereas the risk of death due to measles in an immunocompetent person is up to 1in 350 -1200 per infection and the risk of signi cant disease requiring hospitalisation is approximately 20%. 3Thus, in terms of hospitalisation, it is around 6000 times more dangerous tohave measles than to have a dose of measles vaccine (and interms of risk of death, the comparison is even more stark).Since the virus is so infectious, the risk of transmitting it whileinfected is high, and so the risk of harming or killing others isnot negligible. For the risk of harming others to be so low as tobe commensurate with the risk of vaccination, the lifetime odds of being part of a chain that reaches a non-immune person would have to be signi cantly lower than 6000 to 1 against (which could, admittedly , be the case if vaccination rates are suf-ciently high and stable). Second, even if it could be shown that the requisite probabil- ities are met in one place and at one point in time such caseswill be exceedingly rare and dif cult to identify. The risks change as a greater or lesser number of others opt out of vaccin-ation, and as more people travel and cases are imported fromother populations (which frequently occurs for many vaccine-preventable diseases). Finally, non-vaccinators will tend to bene t from the herd immunity that is achieved by others undertaking vaccination, giving rise to a free-riding concern. 26Partiality to oneself is a much less plausible reason for failing to do good if one isalready bene ting substantially from the equivalent sacri ces of others. Small risks Once herd protection is established at some level, the individualrisk contributed by one non-vaccinator is admittedly small. Itcould be argued that it is therefore inappropriate to regard theserisks as blameworthy. But this is, to use a term from DerekPart, a mistake in moral mathematics. 27Even small contribu- tions are morally signi cant, especially (i) when small risks are run many times, as when the unvaccinated have social contactwith many others, and (ii) where, taken together, they causegreat harm. Herd protection is not binary \u2014that is, it is not 'present' or'absent ', depending on whether some threshold rate of vaccination has been achieved. Herd protection is a probabil-istic phenomenon re flecting a higher or lower level of the xiCf. Robert Nozick: \"Responsibility is not a bucket in which less remains when some is apportioned out; there is not a xed amount of punishment or responsibility which one uses up so that none is left over for the other. \"25 766 Jamrozik E, et al.J Med on by http://jme.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 'background 'risk of sustained transmission of infection. Unless or until an infectious disease has been eradicated worldwide, there is thus no level at which the risk of harming others byremaining unvaccinated is zero. Further, if the number of non-vaccinators is small, then although the total risk of harm to others will be small, each individual will be responsible for a sizeable proportion of that total risk. Distribution of risks In some cases, societies allow small risks to be imposed on othersbecause these risks are part of a social system of mutual risktaking that, overall, produces signi cant bene ts; driving per- sonal automobiles may be one example. Y et, for such a system ofshared risk to be justi able, the risks and bene ts must be shared equitably. 28Systems that allow non-medical exemptions for vac- cination blatantly fail this requirement. Infants are vulnerable inmultiple ways and many immunosuppressed people are alreadybadly off in terms of health. The burden of risk will fall inequit-ably on these groups. Both the probability of infection and theprobability of severe disease and death (upon infection) arehigher for the vulnerable. By contrast, a system of mandatoryvaccination (except for those excluded for medical reasons)involves sharing the small risk of vaccination equitably across thepopulation, for signi cant health bene ts, shared by all. ALTERNATIVE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS It might be wondered what concrete assignments of rights andobligations would be morally acceptable ways to address the riskof infectious diseases. In the absence of mandatory vaccination,should non-vaccinators be required to take other steps to reducethe risks they impose on others? Or should systems of liability hold all non-vaccinators to account for their risk imposition, whether or not speci c harms arise? 20 An argument that the present assignment of obligations is inad- equate can be made from considerations of economic ef ciency . The risks imposed by non-vaccinators constitute a cost that is notconsented to. In the jargon of economics, this is an externality :a cost that falls on people not participating in the relevant activity .And where there are externalities, there will often be inef ciency: people will choose a balance of activities that does not optimisewelfare. 29In this case, the cost to the immunosuppressed of being exposed to a risk of infection is greater than the value to the unvaccinated of remaining unvaccinated. T o identify how toremove the inef ciency , we can imagine various thought experi- ments, regarding what would happen if it were possible to nego- tiate a mutual agreement without excessive transaction costs,assuming a determinate division of rights. On one salient alternative, imagine that the unvaccinated have a right to remain unvaccinated, but that the immunosuppressed can band together to purchase the compliance of the unvaccin-ated with a universal vaccination scheme. Given the very signi - cant gains that the immunosuppressed stand to achieve, it is plausible that they would be willing to pay more than enough toobtain the compliance of at least a very large proportion of theunvaccinated community. The result would be to improve theposition of the immunosuppressed, who are now better pro-tected from immunity, and to improve the position of the unvac-cinated, who have been adequately compensated for frustratingtheir preference for non-vaccination. This is a Pareto superioroutcome, and the inef ciency has been removed. A scheme like this, on the other hand, could create perverse incentives forpeople to cultivate or imitate a preference not to be vaccinated. Another salient possibility is to allocate the immunosup- pressed an enforceable right not to be exposed to (avoidable)infection risks. In this case, the immunosuppressed coulddemand that those who chose not to be vaccinated (i) remainabsent from public life, (ii) provide monetary compensation forthe risks they impose on the immunosuppressed, (iii) undertakecontrolled infection xiior (iv) become vaccinated. It is very plaus- ible that (iv) is the most preferred option for the non-vaccinators, given the very high costs of the other options. So,again, the inef ciency will have been removed: the immunosup- pressed will enjoy the bene ts of universal vaccination, and a scheme like this would not obviously create perverse incentives. Both of these scenarios give very clear support to the intuitive claim that it is unreasonable for some to impose the risks ofnon-vaccination upon the immunosuppressed. It is unreasonablebecause it is possible to bring about other arrangements thatmake some better off, and nobody worse off. Both of the above scenarios are admittedly unrealistic because it would be intolerably costly to engage in all the relevant trans-actions involving everyone with whom we might need to inter-act over the course of our lives. But a more realistic, centralisedproposal is that those who refuse vaccination might merely begiven the choice between (i) providing monetary compensationfor the risks they impose on the immunosuppressed or (ii)becoming vaccinated. Monetary compensation could beachieved in practice via imposition of a new (non)vaccinationtax. Those who are vaccinated could receive a rebate for the taxin question, so only those who remain unvaccinated end uppaying. The revenue raised could be paid out in individual com-pensation settlements for infection-related harms or couldsimply be paid directly to vulnerable individuals as compensa-tion for exposure to risk itself. CONCLUSIONS A typical person transmitting infection may seem innocentbecause they do not choose to contract or transmit the infec-tion, just as the driver of a car rarely chooses the moment whenhis brakes fail. Y et we are all at risk of being both the victimsand vectors of infectious disease, and by taking reasonable steps,where possible, to ensure that we are immune from being avictim, we also prevent ourselves from being a vector. 23 V accination is a prime example of an action that, in this way ,prevents harm to oneself as well as harm to others. W e haveargued that those who opt out of vaccination and transmit pre-ventable disease to others can be considered morally responsiblefor the harms and deaths that result. Our current practices ofattributing blame may not regard the avoidable transmission ofvaccine-preventable disease as villainous behaviour, but thearguments of this article demonstrate that this attitude mightwarrant change.

Competing interests None declared. xiiControlled infection would aim to make the person immune and thus pose no risk of transmitting the disease. This would involve intentional infection with medical oversight in an isolated environment where transmission is prevented. Medical oversight decreases risks to the infected individual, but it is worth noting that for manyvaccine-preventable diseases there is no curative treatment for mostcomplications, should they arise, which would limit the application of this approach (and demonstrates another advantage of vaccination).
