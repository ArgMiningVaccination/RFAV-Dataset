In 1927, the school attained junior college status and changed its name from Buies Creek Academy, Incorporated to Campbell College, Incorporated. In 1961, Campbell became a four -year senior college. After the charter law class graduated on June 6, 1979, the name was changed to Campbell University, Incorporated. 12 Campbell University is a faith -based institution in the Baptist tradition and informed by a biblical worldview. Throughout these transformations, the university has remained true to its foundin g principles to address the most pressing needs of North Carolina and to educate men and women for Christian service around the world. A testimony to how these founding principles still guide Campbell University today is the establishment of its School of Osteopathic Medicine. When Campbell University's medical school enrolled its first class of students in August 2013, it was the first one to open in North Carolina in 35 years. It emphasizes preparing primary care physicians to practice in underserved and rural areas. The School of Osteopathic Medicine is the seventh school at Campbell University. The others are the College of Arts & Sciences, the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (1976), the Lundy -Fetterman School of Business (1983), the School of Educat ion (1985), the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (1985), and the Divinity School (1996). In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has extended campuses in the Research Triangle Park, Camp Lejeune, Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Ba se, and Raleigh, where the law school relocated to in 2009. Since 1979, Campbell has also partnered with Tunku Abdul Rahman College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to offer a Bachelor of Science degree. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 6,000 stu dents, including 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. Students are studying across nearly 100 disciplines in the liberal arts, health sciences, and pro fessions -- and continuing the U niversity's tradition of excellence i n faith, le arning, and service.

In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medical practices of his day. He developed a new theory of medicine, which he called osteopathy. He based his new approach to health care on the conce pts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the optimum conditions, and on the proper alignment and function of the musculoskeletal system. CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophies of Dr. Still to North Carolina. Over th e years, the practice of medicine has evolved and so has the practice of osteopathic medicine. Today, doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.s) serve the public with full medical practice privileges. Osteopathic physicians are trained in all the modern pra ctices science has to offer in medical and surgical care while incorporating the concept of treating the whole person throughout the training. Osteopathic physicians believe hands -on examination (palpation) is an essential part of making a physical diagnos is. In addition to pharmacologic treatment and surgery, manipulative medicine remains an important therapeutic tool utilized by osteopathic physicians in alleviating pain and treating illness. The training of osteopathic physicians has always stress ed a p rimary care orientation. 15 Four Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 1. The body is a unit; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self -regulation, self -healing and health maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatment is based on the above three principles 1.7 Osteopathic Oath I do hereby affirm my loyalty to the profession I am about to enter. I will be mindful always of my great responsibility to preserve the health and the life of my patients, to retain their confidence and respect both as a physician and a fr iend who will guard their secrets with scrupulous honor and fidelity, to perform faithfully my professional duties, to employ only those recognized methods of treatment consistent with good judgment and with my skill and ability, keeping in mind a lways nature's laws and the body's inherent capac ity for recovery . I will be ever vigilant in aiding in the general welfare of the community, sustaining its laws and institutions, not engaging in those practices, which will in any way, bring shame or discredit upon my profession or myself . I will give no drugs for deadly purposes to any person, though it be asked of me . I will endeavor to work in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of p rogressive cooperation and never by word or by act cast imputat ions upon them or the ir rightfu l pract ices. I will look with respect and esteem upon all those who have taught me my art. To my college I will be loyal and strive always for its best interests and for the interests of the students who will come after me. I will be ever alert to further the app lication of basic b iologic truths to the hea ling arts and to deve lop the pr inciples of osteopathy, which were f irst enunc iated by Andrew Tay lor St ill. 16 2.

An app lication may be submitted online at www .aaco m.org or may be obtained by contacting: AACOMAS P.O. Box 9137 Watertown, MA 02474 Telephone (617) 612-2889 To initiate the application process, applicants must apply directly to AACO MAS. AACO MAS is available to the students for the entering class from May through to March of the year applying. Detailed instructions can be accessed through www .aaco m.org. Applicants must request all official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the AACO MAS office. Students should also ensure all MCAT scores are forwarded directly to AACO MAS from the AAMC. Applicants who have taken course work and/or have earned a degree from a foreign institution must also submit to AACO MAS an e valuation of their transcripts in a course-by-course fashion from one of the AACO MAS approved evaluation services. Step 2: CUSOM Secondary Application Process After receipt of your primary application, CUSOM will do an initial screening of your application. A pplicants who meet all admissions requirements (via the AACO MAS ap plication process) will be invited to sub mit an electronic secondary application and supp orting documents. Please note CUSOM screens all applications and not all applicants will receive the invitation to submit a secondary application. Applicants will receive an email notification inviting them to sub mit a second ary application. This email will contain information and instructions regarding how to complete the secondary application. A non -refundable fee of $50.00 will be payable upon submission of the secondary application for admission. Instructions on how to submit the fee are included in the invite for secondary application email. CUSOM will waive the secondary application fee if the a pplicant has an approved AACOMAS fee waiver document. The secon dary app lication process consists of the CUSOM second ary application, a non-refundable processing fee, and two required letters of recommendation. L etters of recommenda tion may not be written by a relative, including relatives through marriage. The first letter must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an os teopathic physician is not required, it is strongly recommended . While shado wing of a DO is not required, ap plicants who have shado wing experience with a DO demonstrate commitment to the profession and unde rstanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine. The second letter must be from a premedical advisory committee or science faculty member (PhD) familiar with the acade mic work of the applicant. 20 Letters of recommenda tion which are included as part of a the pre-health committee packet or letters from an official evaluation collection service recognized by CUSOM (AACOMAS, Interfolio or VirtualEvals) which are part of their official packet will be accepted without signature or letterhead as long as the letters are sent directly from the authors to the pre-med ad visors. CUSOM will accept letters through AACOMAS, VirtualEvals, Interfolio and mail. CUSOM welcomes additional letters of support or recommenda tion from those who are acquainted with the student's acade mic or professional ability. All additional letters of recommendation must be originals on professional or co llege/university letterhead, signed by the evaluator and sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Applicants who are of Permanent Residency Status must provide a copy of their Green Card for consideration for admissions. Candidates born outside of the United States who have beco me United States Citizens sho uld provide a copy of their Citizenship Certificate. 2.7 CUSOM Selection Process To be considered for an interview, an applicant must meet all the preceding admissions requirements and technical standards for admissions and have a complete file, including the AACOMAS application, a secondary application, a form/letter of recommendation from either an osteopathic physician or allopathic physician, a recommendation form/letter from a pre -medical or pre -health committee, and the processing fee. After the Office of Admissions receives these materials, the applicant's file is reviewed to de termine eligibility for an interview, based on the established criteria of the Admissions Committee. The Admissions Committee will review each applicant who interviews with CUSOM and make a recommendation to the Dean. Once the Dean has reviewed the reco mmendations of the Admissions Committee the decision will be made to accept, deny or waitlist the candidate. The decision will be pro vided to the applicant in a timely manner, usually within 2 -3 weeks of the interview date. Intentional misrepresentation or omission of information on any form relevant to admissions or records will subject the student to dismissal. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any reason it deems sufficient. Matriculation will be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance and/or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance and their matriculation at CUSOM. At the conclusion of the interviews, the interviewers forward their recommendati on to the Admissions Committee. The Admissions Committee may make any of the following recommendations: to accept, to deny, or to place the applicant on an alternate or hold list. 2.8 Transfer Applicants CUSOM will consider acceptance of transfer applicat ions. Potential transfer students must submit certified and official transcripts from all post -secondary educational institutions; complete CUSOM's transfer application; achieve passing grades in all subjects at the time of transfer; have an overall 3.2 G PA or higher at the current medical school. Transfer students leaving an accredited medical school must request a letter from both the Dean and one Associate Dean from all prior medical schools attended, and complete CUSOM's transfer recommendation form. Transfer credit will be dependent on coursework completed by the applicant and will be subject to the final approval from the Dean based on the recommendation of the CUSOM Admissions Committee. Students who have completed two years of course work at anoth er medical school will not be considered if they have not passed COMLEX -USA Level 1. 21 Credits may only be transferred from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathic Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of me dicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). An ad hoc committee appointed by the Dean will conduct evalua tion of courses for transfer. Students transferring from another medical school to CUSOM will be required to complete at least the last two years at CUSOM prior to graduation. In addition, all transfer students must meet CUSOM's osteopathic manipulative medicine training requirements, including the understanding and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy prior to graduation. Each applicant will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee and interviewed prior to the approval to transfer. CUSOM will have the right to require additional courses be taken or rotations added if deemed necessary to ensure the potential graduate will be of the highest quality and contribute to CUSOM successfully meeting its mission. The Dean will determine satisfactory completion of these requirements. 2.9 Transfer of Credit Credits may only be transferred from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathi c Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of medicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Students wishing to transfer must have completed all course work with passing grades and ha ve at least a 3.2 or greater GPA. Each course will be evaluated as to its course content, equivalency, and credit hours prior to any credit being waived. The CUSOM Admissions Committee will conduct this evaluation.

If the student wishing to transfer has passed all course work with passing grades and has at least a 3.2 or greater GPA, all coursework from the transferring school will be credited to the student. Each course will be evaluated as to its course content, equivalency, and credit hours prior to any credit being wa ived. An ad hoc committee that will be appointed by the Dean will conduct this evaluation. Any course the transfer student has not taken will need to be taken at CUSOM prior to third year rotations. Regardless of credits, the last two years of instructi on must be completed at CUSOM, and all requirements for graduation must be fulfilled, in order for the student to be eligible to receive the DO degree. 2.11 Transfers from LCME -Accredited Schools of Medicine For students who will be transferring from an LC ME-accredited school of medicine, at least the last two years of instruction must be completed at CUSOM. In addition, LCME transfer students must complete the CUSOM requirement for osteopathic manipulative medicine including the understanding and knowledg e of osteopathic philosophy prior to graduation.

The letter must state that the student is eligible for readmission to the previously attended school(s) of medicine accredited by LCME and is in good standing with the institution from which the student is transferr ing. 22 2.12 International Student Applicants Applicants who will require the F -1 Visa should contact the Executive Director for Student Affairs for requirements at the time of application. CUSOM policy requires applicants who have completed coursework a t foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. equivalence by one of the evaluation services listed on the AACOM web site http://www.aacom.org . The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US college or university in a course -by-course fashion. Once students are deemed academically eligible, the file is forwarded to the Campbell University International Admissions Office. The Inter national Admissions Office works in conjunction with academic departments to ensure all documents are in order and in compliance with all federal guidelines and regulations including those of the Department of Homela nd Security (DHS) and U.S. Immi gration and Customs Enfor cement (IC E). This school is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant students. Questions regarding international compliance should be directed to International Admissions at (800) 334-4111 or (910) 893-1417. Health Insurance for International Students The University requires international students, their spouses, and dependents living in the United States to have a minimum of $50,000 in health insurance coverage including medical evacuation and repatriation. Health insurance is available through the University. An insurance waiver for existing comparable insurance is coordinated through the Office of International Admissions. Student Services The Campbell University Office of International Affairs serves international student s on campus. It shares responsibility for processing all international acceptances and serves as liaison between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and all international students on campus 2.13 Technical Standards for Admission to CUSOM The requirem ents to succeed at CUSOM will be those necessary to successfully complete the curriculum and to practice osteopathic medicine with full practice rights. Students must be able to function in a variety of learning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accu rately, and consistently learn and process data. Osteopathic physicians utilize touching as part of the osteopathic approach to treatment. As part of the educational process, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate being touched and to touch others in ord er to acquire the skills necessary for palpation and examination. This palpation is performed in a professional and appropriate manner. Additionally, CUSOM utilizes cadavers as part of anatomy laboratories. As such, CUSOM students must be able to tolerat e working with and touching cadavers. CUSOM students also participate in ultrasound labs and, as such, may be required to perform ultrasound exams on each other. Acquiring the skills to palpate and examine patients requires a student to examine disrobed patients of both genders and is mandatory for successful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. In physical diagnosis and osteopathic manipulative medicine laboratory experiences, as well as other clinical laboratories where skills are acquired, students are required to participate in the examination of fellow students of both genders who may be 23 partially disrobed. Students need to wear attire such as shorts and partially disrobe for certain laboratory experiences. Please refer to 5.3 Dress Code Policy for additional information. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural beliefs, in order for the student to acquire the skills necessary to practice medicine. Students who have any concern should discuss them with the Executive Direc tor for Student Affairs prior to applying . CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations for students whose handicaps allow them to accomplish a successful career as an osteopathic physician. Students, however, are required to function with independence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mandatory for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM is committed to patient safety and assuring a safe and effective environment that does not place patients, students, or others at risk. Each technical standard has been chosen from standards osteopathic physicians deem necessary for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. Applicants who do not meet the above technical standards should not app ly to CUSOM. Applicants must possess the abilities and skills in the following five areas: 1. Observation The student must be able to visually observe laboratory demonstrations, microscopic tissue with the aid of the microscope, and computer based pictures used in laboratory demonstrations. The student must be able to visually and accurately observe physical signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and management. The use of a trained intermediary in such cases would compromise performance, as i t would be mediated by another individual's power of selection, observation, and experience. Observation requires the functional use of vision and somatic sensations and is enhanced by the sense of smell. 2. Communication The student must be able to commu nicate effectively in English as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered in English. Students are encouraged to learn other languages for medical communication; however, all curriculum and assessment are given in English. CUSOM requires the f unctional ability to speak, hear, and observe patients in order to elicit accurate medical information. The student must be able both to describe changes in mood, activity, posture, and other physical characteristics and to perceive nonverbal communicatio n. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in verbal and written form. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with the patient and with all members of the health -care team in order to successfully complete the curriculum. 3. Motor Students must have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic measures. The student must have sufficient motor function to carry out maneuvers of ge neral and emergency care and of osteopathic manipulation. Examples of emergent motor functions are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administration of intravenous fluids and intravenous medications, management of an obstructed airway, hemorrhage control, closure by suturing of wounds, and obstetrical deliveries. In addition, the delivery of osteopathic manipulation requires the use of extremities in palpation, positioning, and carrying out maneuvers of manipulation. These actions require fine and gross motor and s ensory function, as well as the senses of touch and adequate vision for inspection. 24 4. Intellectual Students must have the ability to reason, calculate, analyze, measure, and synthesize information. The student must be able to comprehend, memorize, synth esize, and recall a large amount of information without assistance, to successfully complete the curriculum. The student must be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and to understand spatial relationships to succeed in school and to adminis ter medical care. The student must be able to gain knowledge through all types of learning materials that the CUSOM curriculum offers and must be able to perform pattern identification, memorization, recall information, and to identify and discriminate important information, to problem solve, and to calculate and make decisions in timed situations and in the presence of noise and distraction. The above intellectual abilities are necessary, as students and graduates will be expected and required to perform pattern identification, immediate recall of memorized material, identification, and discrimination to elicit important information, problem solving, and decision -making as to emergent diagnosis and treatment of patients. Students must be able to recall i mportant information for diagnosis a nd to calculate therapeutic management of emergent conditions. This type of demonstrated intellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time - efficient manner so as not to place patients in emergent conditions at risk. It is common for emergent situations to occur in the presence of visually distracting and noisy environments. Such emergent situations include, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary compromise, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, obstetrical and neon atal emergencies, trauma presentations, poisonings and toxic exposures, shock, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must have the emotional health needed for full use of his/her intellectual capabilities at all times. The emotio nal health required for effective communication and for professional, mature, sensitive, and compassionate patient/physician or patient/student relationships must be present. Students must be able to function effectively under stress and with physically taxing workloads. Students must have the emotional health to be able to function without the aid of medications that are known to effect intellectual abilities and judgment. The student must have the emotional stability and motivation to deliver patient care and to make emergent decisions at all times. The ability to adapt to changing environments and stressful situations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the necessary intellectual capaci ty to care for patients is one observed dur ing the interview process and throughout the progress in medical school. An ability to demonstrate the emotional health necessary for the delivery of quality and safe medical care is mandatory throughout medical school. CUSOM considers drug and alcohol a ddiction or abuse as a risk factor for unsafe care. If an applicant has a question as to his/her ability to meet the mi nimal technical standards , the applicant is required to notify the Office of Admissions in advance of applying so reasonable testing may occur. Applicants must ident ify to the Office of Admissions all areas where there is question in meeting these technical standards. 2.14 Americans with Disabilities Act CUSOM is operating in compliance with the timeline established by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, both as amended, to assure that its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Students and app licants w ith spec ific needs shou ld contact the CUSOM Office of Student Services. The University's ADA Coordinator is Robert C.

Campbell University Behavioral Intervention Team for the School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUBIT -SOM) Purpose In order to ensure the safety and continued success of our medical student body, the Campbell University Behavioral Intervention Team for the School of Osteopathic Medicine ( CUBIT -SOM ), a sub -committee of the APPS Committee, serves osteopathic medical students by working with them and faculty to address and/or remediate any concerning event or pattern of personal behavior and/or professional interaction. Composition CUBIT -SOM is composed of: Ex-officio Members Director of Behavioral Health for CUSOM Vice President for Student Life Campbell University legal counsel Voting Members Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs Executive Director of Student Affairs All other members will be ad hoc and cont ingent upon the faculty/staff that are pertinent to the case. To initiate a referral, concerned faculty/staff may contact the Director of Behavioral Health by email (marlowed@campbell.edu ), phone ((910) 814-4959), or by filling out the online or PDF case referral form on the Behavioral Health portion of the CUSOM webpage (http://www.campbell.edu/cusom/current -studen ts/cusom - behavioral -health/cubit -som/ ). Once a report is received , the referring faculty will be contacted with 24 hours for follow -up regarding the situation, and a team meeting will be scheduled. During the meeting, team members who have had interaction with the student , as well as other pertinent campus and community individuals will present information. 35 Upon conclusion, the CUBIT -SOM team may choose one of the following options: make a recommendation on the student's continued enrollment or dismissal; continue to gather information and meet again; or monitor the situation for new developments. A formal letter detailing the team's decision will be sent to the st udent and appropriate academic D ean. The CUBIT -SOM will use policies outlined in th e CUSOM Academic Bulletin and the Campbell University Student Handbook as a framework for its recommendations; however, the team reserves the right to utilize creativity to find the most appropriate solution as long as it falls in line with the policies of Campbell University and the School of Osteopathic Medicine. All discussions and deliberations of the CUBIT - SOM shall be in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 4.5 Substance Abuse Screening Protocol Substance abuse screening is becoming mandatory at many healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care, either as a learner or as a staff member. In light of this development, a negative substance abuse screening test is required before matriculation into osteopathic m edical school , and again before advancement to year three . Therefore, applicants to osteopathic medic al school will be notified of the background check and substance abuse screening protocol requirement as part of the application process. Additional scre ening tests may be required as determined by CUSOM or the clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require drug or alcohol testing on any student when reasonable suspicions exist. Refusal or failure to submit to screening may result in discip linary action up to and including dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol , illicit substances or prescription medications without a valid prescription may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Clinical education sites may require CUSOM to provide them with a copy of the results of any substance abuse test performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the r equired personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical educatio n site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. Procedure for incoming students : A substance abuse screening (urine drug screen ) test will be completed on all applicants to CUSOM prior to matriculation. The letter sent by CUSOM to each accepted applicant, as well as to selected wait -listed applicants, will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will b e made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's substance abuse screening test report. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to in itiating a substance abuse screening test. Prospective students must have the sample collected a t a facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is positive, the Dean will appoint a subset of the CUSOM Admissions Committee to review the information and t he application. Substance abuse screening results will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Depending on the recommendation of the subset of the Admissions Committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded . All substance abuse screening tests are maintained in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to the Director of Admissions, the Executive Director for Student Affairs, the CUSOM Dean, and the Campb ell University General Counsel. The cost of the test is the responsibility of the student. The Dean will make the final determination regarding the applicant's status. 36 Prior to starting year 3 : Students must have the substance abuse screening sample colle cted at the Campbell University's Health Center or another facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is positive, the Dean will appoint a subset of the CUSOM Admissions Committee to review the information and make a recommendation to the Dean regardin g the appropriate action . Depending on the decision, the student's advancement to the clinical year may be delayed based on the results. All substance abuse screening tests will be maint ained in a secure location to en sure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to the Executive Director for Student Affairs , the CUSOM Dean, and Campbell University General Counsel. Results from positive drug/alcohol screens will be shared with the Director of Behav ioral Health in the event the student requires drug/alcohol counseling . The cost of the test is the responsibility of the student. 4.6 Infection Control Students exposed to infectious diseases should consult the Campbell University's Health Center ((910) 893-1560) for information. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable disease should consult with Campbell University's Health Center or the infection control office at the clinical site , about the advisability of working wit h patients and when it is safe to return to patient care. Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases to both students and patients. These include: Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items Immediately after removing gloves Between patient contact Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and contaminated items For co ntact with mucous membranes and non -intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood and body fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluid 37 Linen Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre -rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipment in a manner to p revent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending, breaking or manipulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in puncture -resistant containers Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth -to mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential e xposure to blood borne pathogens require immediate action to protect a student's health and safety.

A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to Campbell's Student Health Services (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. L anier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). 4.7 OSHA and HIPAA Training CUSOM requires that all students receive training on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). CUSOM ensures the privacy and se curity of patient health information. In the normal cou rse of business and operations, individuals receive requests to disclose patient health information for various purposes. To support our commitment to patient confidentiality, CUSOM ensures that the appropriate steps are taken to verify the identity and a uthority of individuals and entities requesting protected health information, as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164. 514(h) and o ther applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations. Additionally, ens ures the con fidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic protected health information by implementing policies to prevent, detect, mitigate, and correct security violations. CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Se rvices' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, co llection, use or disclosure of all individual health information (whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in conne ction with CUSOM. In addition, CUSOM requires that all students who have contact with patients receive OSHA Blood B orne Pathogens (BBP) training and be trained to prevent transmission o f communicable pathogens. Students annually review OSHA rules and requirements and complete a yearly r eview of appropriate plans and practices. CUSOM has in place the following: Blood Borne Pathogen Ex posure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan The intent of these plans is to prevent blood borne infections by e liminating or minimizing e mployees and students exposu re to blood, blood products, and other potentially infectious materials. 4.8 Professional Liability Insurance In the event of incidents involving patients during clinical training, students are covered by professional liability insurance. Any incidents that occur in the clinical interaction with patients should be reported to the clinical supervisor on -site, and the Campbell University General Counsel's Office at PO Box 116, Buies Creek, NC 27506, (910) 893 -1217. 39 4.9 Exercise and Fitness CUSOM students have access to all Campbell University recreational facilities, which include: Student Fitness Center, Aquatic C enter, Running and Walking Track, Keith Hill Golf Course, Tennis Courts, Carter Gym, Cross Count ry Course, Disc Golf Course and other recreational facilities .

The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. Many CUSOM students will be actively involved in at least one organiza tion, and some students may be members of several. CUSOM's students also may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level. The goals of stude nt clubs and organizations relate to the mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As such, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA) Dermatology Club Emergency Medicine Club (American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP)) Family Medicine Club (ACOFP and AAFP) Internal Medicine Club (ACOI and ACP) Medical Missions Club Neurology Club Obstetrics and Gynecology Club Pathology Club Pediatrics Club (American College of Osteopathic Pediat ricians (ACOP)) 40 Preventative Medicine Club Psychiatry Club Sports Medicine Club (American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine (AOASM)) Student Advocate Association (SAA) Student American Association of Osteopathy (SAAO) Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (SAMOPS) Student Government Association (SGA) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) Student Osteopathic Surgical Association (SOSA) Ultrasound Club Wilderness in Medicine Club Grade Requirements Students must h ave at least an overall 3.0 grade point average, no course failures, and be in good academic standing to: Serve as an officer in SGA Serve as an officer of a CUSOM club or organization Serve on a CUSOM committee Attend any off-campus conference/meeting Participate in medical mission trips Serve as a teaching assistant CUSOM Student Government The Stu dent Government serves as a voice for all students.

At the end of the academic year, all stud ents will be asked to remove the locks and empty the lockers for the summer. 4.17 Student Conduct All CUSOM students are expec ted to co nduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and p ersonal integrity during medical school training is critical to the training of physicians. It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM. 42 Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM student, I will... Be guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the advancement of knowledge and recognize the special responsibilities placed upon me; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly competence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical standards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster honest academic conduct and ensure student evaluations reflect the student's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction be tween students and faculty, students and administration, and students and staff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inquiry of associates' exchange of ideas and show respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private persons, they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As citizens enga ged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public und erstanding of academic freedom. Respect for Patients Take the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students need to demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non- threatening and non-judgmental. Patient privacy and modesty should be respected as much as possible during history taking, physical examinations, and any other contact, to maintain professional relationships with the patients and their families. It is important for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient that only the patient's physician should reveal. Studen ts should always consult more experienced members of the medical team regarding patient care or at the request of the patient. Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personne l, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hosp ital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and pee rs, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, expe rience or 43 capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduc t. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students need to respect the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local co mmunity. If a matter arises which may be considered to be a potential violation of law, the Dean (or Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the Dean's absence) will be notified as soon as possible for referral to appropriate law enforcement authorities. All CUSOM students, faculty, and staff witnes sing a crime in progress are expected to notify law enforcement immediately, while taking personal safety precautions. 4.18 Accommodations Policy Students requesting accommodations or special services from CUSOM because of learning disabilities are required to submit documentation in writing to determine eligibility for the accommodations and services in accordance with Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A diagnosis of a learning disability does not necessarily qualify a student for academic accommodations under the law. To establish a student is covered under section 504 of the ADA, the documentation must include the disabi lity substantially limits some major lif e activity, including learning. All students who seek an accommodation must submit documentation in writing to verify the existence of a disability. The documents serve to determine eligibility for accommodation(s) and the type of accommodation CUSOM can reasonably provide. The student will be asked to complete and sign a Release of Information Form. This form will allow the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss the accommodations requested by the studen t with the appropriate members of CUSOM administration The following guidelines are provided in the interest of assuring documentation of a learning disability is complete and supports the students request for accommodations. CUSOM will determine eligibil ity and appropriate services, case by case, based on the quality and completeness of the documentation submitted. Documentation must be less than one year old and must be provided by an appropriately credentialed healthcare professional. CUSOM reserves t he right to verify any written documentation. The following requirements provide students, schools, and professional diagnosticians with a common understanding of the components of documentation that are necessary to validate the existence of a learning disability, the impact on the individual's educational performance, and the need for academic accommodations for the purp ose of the ADA and Section 504. Learning Disability Documentation Requirements Qualified Person Must Conduct the Evaluation A trained, qualified, and licensed professional (e.g., psychologist or psychiatrist) who has direct experience with adolescents and adults with learning disabilities must administer the assessment . 44 Documentation Must Be Current Reasonable accommodations are based on the current impact of the disability on academic performance. In most cases this means that a diagnostic evaluation should be age appropriate and relevant to the student 's learning environment, and show the student 's current level of functioning. If doc umentation does not address the individual 's current level of functioning, a re -evaluation may be required. Medical students must submit their evaluation and supporting documentations thirty days prior to matriculation. Documentation Must Include Specific Diagnosis The report must include a clear and direct statement that a learning disability does or does not exist, including a rule out of alternative explanations of learning problems. Terms such as \"learning difficulty\", \"appears\", \"suggests\" or \"probable \" do not support a conclusive diagnosis. Documentation Must Be Comprehensive The documentation must include a summary containing relevant historical information, instructional interventions, related services and age of initial diagnosis. The documentation must also include objective data regarding aptitude, achievement and information processing. Test scores (standard scores, percentiles, and grade equivalents) must also be included in the documentation. Recommendation for Accommodations A diagnostic report may include specific recommendations for accommodation(s). A prior history of an accommodation, without a demonstration of a current need, does not in and of itself warrant the provision of that accommodation. Each accommodation recommended by an evaluato r should include a rationale. The evaluation should support the recommendations with specific test results or clinical observations. If an accommodation is not clearly identified in the diagnostic report, CUSOM will seek clarification and/or additional inf ormation either from the student's evaluator or from another trained professional chosen by CUSOM. CUSOM will make the final decision as to whether appropriate and reasonable accommodations are warranted and can be provided. CUSOM reserves the right to re quest reassessment of the student's disability when questions arise regarding previous assessment or provision of services or accommodations or when the student requests additional services or accommodations above and beyond what has been prev iously provid ed to the student. Process for Receiving Reasonable A ccommodations All documentation related to the students disability and accommodations shall be maintained by the Executive Director of Student Affairs in a secure location. Student Affairs must receive all requests including supporting documents no later than July 1st of the year of matriculation. Upon receipt of the documentation, the Executive Director of Student Affairs will meet with the Dean, Director of Behavioral Health and the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs to determine what reasonable accommodations can be given or whether to deny the request. The student will then be contacted to discuss and arrange for the accommodation should it be granted. Additionally a letter will be given t o the student advising the student of the outcome of the meeting. Accommodations requested after matriculation will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. If a problem arises concerning reasonable accommodation, the student should contact the Executive Dir ector of Student Affairs. 45 5. Academic Information and Policies 5.1 Advising and Faculty Access Students are assigned a faculty advisor upon matriculation who serves as the advisor for all four years. Additional advising on clinical rotations will be coordinated through the Regional Deans and Office of Clinical Affairs. The students will be assigned a clinical academic advisor, which will be selected from regional site's clinical faculty. The advisor/advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institutio n as needed. The feedback to academic advisors on their advising performance will be provided at the end of the school year. The feedback will be collected using standard survey methods. Individual advising performance will also be reviewed by the Assistan t Dean for Faculty and Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. The data will be kept on secure online database and will also be made available to the Dean. Both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advisement. This relationsh ip endeavors to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. Significant personal or behavioral health problems will be referred to the Behavioral Health Services for assessment and potential referral for counseling. Students are also encouraged (not required) to develop relationships with biomedical/clinical faculty mentors of their choice. Academic advisor/advisee relationship consists of institutional representative giving insight or direction to a college student about an academic, social , or personal matter. The nature of this direction might be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The Executive Director of Student Affairs and Assistant Dean for Faculty assign faculty advisors to each student. The list is approved by the Dean. Advisors provide guidance while students are attending the school. The faculty advisor, the Dean, and the staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise and provide guidance and/or referrals to other re sources as necessary. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors is as follows: During Blocks 1and 2, students will meet with their advisor at least once individually and once in a group setting. During the rest of academic bloc ks and during rotations the students will meet with their advisors at le ast once a semester in a group setting. The students who require individual advising sessions can schedule the meeting with their advisors at any time regardless of their academic per formance. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less in any integrated exam are required to contact their academic advisor for individual meeting. The frequency of follow up meetings will be determined by the advisor. Students on academic probation will meet with faculty advisors at least twice a month or more frequently as required by the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. In addition to their role as student advisors, faculty will also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty will publish office hours for students during specific courses and will make sure to be available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling will be either directly with faculty or through the ap propriate administrative assistant. CUSOM is a student -centered institution. As such, all administrators will be accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Additionally, administrators will strive to have informal meetings on a regul ar basis, such as \"Breakfast/Lunch with the Deans\", a twice -monthly meeting of small student groups with the academic Deans. 46 5.2 Attendance Attendance Policy Attendance of MS -1 and MS -2 students is required at all lectures, labs, and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance will be monitored u sing electronic verification. Absences for illness or emergencies will be considered appropriately. Any falsification of attendance will be viewed as an Honor Code violation and dea lt with accordingly. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and S tandards (APPS) Committee. Attendance of MS -3 and MS -4 students is required for all requisite clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with structured time away from the rotation at the discretion of the clinical site director. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on -call assignments, case presen tations, etc. Multiple violations may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, loss of remedial privileges, removal from any leadership position with any student club, o rganization or student government office, and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program . MS-1 and MS -2 It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, the student who misses a lecture, laboratory, workshop, or rotation is not excu sed from the subject materials or duties of that particular period. The student may be required to make-up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Makeup laboratories will be condu cted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director with approval of the appropriate Associate or Assistant Dean . Each request for excused absence will be judged independently on a case -by-case basis. The total combi ned excused and unexcused absences must not exceed 15% of a course lecture time ; exceptions to this 15% rule include the following approved excused absence requests: (1) For medical condition/illness that is two days or greater, notice must be received prior to the missed class or activity, and a note must be submitted from the examining physician upon the student's return to class. (2) For personal leave that is two days or greater, unless it is emergent in nature, the a bsence request must be submitted at least 7 days prior to the anticipated absence. (3) For Jury duty, the a bsence request must be submitted at least 7 days prior to the anticipated absence. (4) For attending CUSOM-related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence must be submitted, in writing, to the appropriate Associate or Assistant Dean at least 7 days prior to the anticipated absence. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted. CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans. In the event of any absence from an exa mination, quiz, or mandatory Inter -professional Education (IPE) activities, excused absence must be obtained to arrange a make-up. It is essential that each student makes every effort not to miss any examination. Requests for make-up exa ms or quizzes must be made in a timely manne r. An une xcused absence from an exa mination, quiz, laboratory, IPE, or assignment may result in a grade of zero for that exercise. For any absences to be considered excused, students must notify a Medical Education (Med Ed) representative and complete an \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. The Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or the Assistant Dean for Curriculum will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of the decision by Med Ed in a timely manner. If a student is failing in any course, they may not be approved for an excused absence . 47 MS-3 and MS -4 Students in third and fourth-year rotations must abide by the additional attendance r equirements described in in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Ma nual. Tardiness Promptness is another trait health-care professionals must display. Additionally, tardiness to class disturbs both the professor and the students in class, and is thus markedly incon siderate and disrespectful . Repeated violations will be considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on -call assignments, case presen tations, etc. Multiple reported violations from Med Ed, faculty, staff, and/or classmates may result in disciplinary action by the Academic Performance, Promotion and S tandards (APPS) Committee including, but not limited to: loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, o rganization or student government office; and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program . Consequences of Non -compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For MS -1 and MS -2 students any absence which exceeds 15% of a course lecture tim e may be considered violations of CUSOM policy and result in disciplinary action by the Academic Performance, Promotion and S tandards Committee including, but not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, o rganization or student government office; and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. In ex treme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program . For MS -3 or MS -4 students any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure or incomplete for that rotation as prescribed by the APPS Committee. Official Holidays CUSOM observes standard University holidays. The following days are currently observed: New Year Martin Luther King Day Easter Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Christmas Holidays falling on the weekend will be observed either on the Friday before the holiday or the Monday after the ho liday. 48 Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he or she should advise the respective Associate or Assistant Dean as soon as possible. 5.3 Dress Code Policy Students must maintain a professional appe arance. Professional attire must be maintained whenever the student is on CUSOM grounds including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examination s, laboratory classes, or workshops. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM labs, Clinical Skills labs, and Gross Anatomy labs. Students do not need to maintain professional attire after the normal en d of the school day, Monday through Friday, or on weekends, except when notified by the school administration to be professionally attired. All students must have at least one short, white consultation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable conditio n. A clean and well -cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well groome d, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear a ppropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length (no higher than 2\" above the knee when sitting) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Hairstyles should be clean and neat, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothin g is unacceptable. Beards and mustaches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body piercings are not acceptable. Shorts, jeans, T -shirts are not permitted except in the OMM lab and clinical skills when appropriate. Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap , hoodie or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students who have tattoos must ensure they are covered at all times on -campus, unless required for OMM or Clinical Skills labs. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus and not return until appropriately attired. Any class missed during that time will be considered an un excused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated episodes may result in the problem being viewed as an issue to be addressed with the Academic Performance, P romotion, a nd Standards (APPS) Committee. Additional Dress Code Requirements : Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills. OMM Laboratory Dr ess Code (adapted from nationally accepted standards) The dress requirement in the clinical skills training sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clot hing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. 49 Appropriate attire must be clean and includes: Shorts which are several inches above the knee (mid -thigh). - No jean shorts, cut -offs, thick -seamed shorts, spandex, short shorts or knee length shorts. T-shirts. - Both sexes will be asked to remove t -shirts while acting as patients. - T-shirts and tops should be plain. No offensive words, emblems, or decorations of any kind. Sports bras or bathing suit tops for women. - These should expos e the spine and ribs (not wide T -back styles). Remove shoes when you are the patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). Student Doctors may wear scrubs (or other apparel approved by the Course Director) over laboratory attire when not in the role of t he patient. Hats or head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in OMM lab. Religious head coverings will need to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back). They may be immediately replaced after this portion of clinical skills training. Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. Students must wear appropriate footwear that meets the needs of the environments. No flip-flops or open toed shoes are all owed in the anatomy laboratory. 5.4 Global Assessment Throughout the medical curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic board examinations. The Direc tor of Assessment, Planning and Accreditation, as well as the Office of Academic Affairs, work collaboratively to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports conce rning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through relevant processes described elsewhere in this Academic Bulletin. For example, u nder certain circums tances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action and/or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication . 5.5 Credit s, Grading , and Grade Point Average ( GPA ) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours as described below. Credit assignments are continually evaluated and t he credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Ost eopathic Medicine: COM Standards and Procedures : http://www.osteopathic.org/inside -aoa/accreditation/predoctoral% 20accreditation/Pages/standards -and- procedures -disclaimer.aspx 50 The CUSOM Curriculum Committee, the Campbell University Curriculum Council, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) have approved the CUSOM curric ulum. The SACSCOC is the institutional accrediting body for Campbell University. CUSOM 's integrated approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty who explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to become more clinically adept as they progress towards clinical rotations. The third and fourth year clerkships provide opportunities for in-depth clinical exposure in a variety of core and elective rotations. CUSOM Credit Calculation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes an approach by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study: six are nine -week Blocks, the fourt h Block is ten weeks and the eighth Block is eleven weeks. For the third and fourth years, each clinical rotation is a four -week Block of time. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits are determined based on contact hours for each course. The CUSOM c redit hour calculation process is consistent with US Dep artment of Education standards. Credit Review Process CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards Block credit values to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Asso ciation of Collegiate Registrar' s and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as wel l as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a system, in keeping with the CUSOM mission and objectives, to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effective per formance as an osteopathic physician. Throughout all four years , students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum may be offered r emediation. Under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the APPS Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX - USA Level 2 PE, and COMLEX -USA Level 3 passage rates; licensure; geographic of obtainment and completion of a postdoctoral program; and AOA or ABM S board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining grading. 51 CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining l etter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and MS -2 QP MS-3 and MS -4 Traditional Rotation Grades QP Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H Honors 4.0 I Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 HP High Pass 3.5 IP In Progress C 70-79 2.0 PC Pass Clinical 3.0 W Withdraw C* 70 2.0 PC* Pass Clinical 2.0 F <70 0.0 FC Fail Clinical 0.0 P >70 4.0 P* 70 2.0 * passed after remediation aThe maximum percentage cannot exceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, therefore 82.50 - 82.99 = 83 while 82.01 - 82.49 = 82. QP = Quality Points Assessme nt Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they will be covered, and evaluation strategies will be used to ensure that all graduates achieve t he intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment P lan summarizes additional methods and metrics that are tracked for continual progr am evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled and random intervals. Laboratory and clinical skills assessments are in written and/or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end -of-rotation exa minations , preceptor evaluations and related methods. Grading For Years O ne and Two Evaluation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of educational effort, with the maximum percentage of the final course grade allowed by each category as delineated below: i. Integrated examinations, t ypically multiple choice questions (MCQs): 90% ii. Laborator y practical examinations: 50% iii. Quizzes : 30% iv. Other (e.g., SIM performance, Early Clinical Experiences, Projects): 70% 52 The total for a course must equal 100% and can be comprised of any combination of the above designated components as determined by the faculty with approval from the respective Associate Dean. Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grade s through assessment venues for the four categories identified previously, yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams occur three times in each Block in years 1 and 2. FMP , PCC , OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not included on the integrated exams except where they are consistent with discipline content in other courses. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills may have se parate didactic exams , as well as their Practical and Lab exams, as required. Quizzes are administered each Friday morning of the MS-1 and MS -2 curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from multiple lectures given in the previous week. Quizz es may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty; however, the total percentage value of quizzes towards the total grade must not exceed the maximum identified above. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage or total points , and the percentage of total points earned. Each Course Director, in consultation with other faculty, propose to the Dean's Council a grading plan for her/his course. This must be submitted no later than one month prior to the start of the co urse. The Dean's Council reviews each submitted grading proposal to ensure it is consistent with the CUSOM Grading Policy. The Course Director, in turn, is advised if the proposed grading plan is appropriate, or if changes need to be made. Grades are defi ned by the course -grading plan approved prior to start of the course. As such, bonus points are not permitted. In rare instances, there may be exceptions to the established Grading Policy, which require justification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive their course grades. The Dean authorizes any exception to the Grading Policy upon recommendation from the Dean's Council. Grading for Years Three and Four The primary basis for the core rotation grade is the \"CUSOM Stude nt Evaluation Form\" and the end -of-rotation exam. The end -of-rotation exam will be given at the end of the four week block during core rotations. The CUSOM Student Evaluation Form is completed by the attending physician and discussed with the student before submission. For non -core rotations, the student's grade will be based on the preceptor evaluation of the student. 1. End-of-rotation examination - A post -rotation exam (e.g., COMAT, NBME Shelf Exam or equivalent) will be administered after the following third - and fourth -year rotations: Internal Medicine I and II, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Emergency Medicine. New post -rotation exams will be added as they are developed and released. Students must pass the end - of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass a post -rotation exam may be allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake , the highest grade possible would be a Pass Clinical (PC) and they are not eligible for H igh Pass (HP) or Honors (H). If the exam is failed twice, the student will receive a failing grade and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If remediation of the rotation is permitted and the student passes, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remediation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. Each student, for core 53 rotati ons, is required to pass an end -of-rotation exam to assure that the expected medical knowledge has been acquired. In addition to the experienc es received in the clinical training sites, students are expected to read the assigned text and complete all curricular assignments to prepare for these exams. 2. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor - All evaluations m ust be completed within 7days of completion of each rotation. Courses of 8 weeks (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of each 4 week block. If a student has a rotation that is approved and scheduled for 2 weeks, th e evaluation is to be completed at the end of the 2 week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end -of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation. Competency -based rating forms are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical knowledge in the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a ro tation will enter into a Modified Course of Study, delaying graduation, and they will be required to repeat the failed rotation. The CUSOM competency -based evaluation is based on the following core competencies in each area: Osteopathic Philosophy and Ost eopathic Manipulative Medicine Medical Knowledge Patient Care Interpersonal and Communication Skills Professionalism Practice -Based Learning and Improvement Systems -Based Practice To receive a grade for each rotation, the student is responsible for ensuring the student evaluation form, site evaluation form, end -of-rotation examination, and the clinical experience database (logs) are received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Items which may also be used to determine grades on clinical rotations: 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other forms of delivery are used in the third and fourth year curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students are expected to submit clinical patient logs and procedure logs. 3. Question Bank Review - Students are required to complete the 150 COMBANK questions during all clinical rotations in order to receive credit for the rotation. 4. Osteopathic Manual Medicine - Completion of OMM special assignments and participation lab during Call Back Fridays for core rotations is required . 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examinations (OSCE) and Standardized Patients (SPs) - OSCEs and SP exercises demonstrate the studen t's ability to perform clinical skills and to evaluate patient presentations for the most common disorders found in adult and pediatric patients. Multi -station OSCEs will be given at end of first, second, and third years. These include taking a medical his tory, performing a physical examination, evaluating signs and symptoms to formulate a differential diagnosis, performing or assessing the results of diagnostic exams to evaluate and narrow a differential diagnosis, and common early management scenarios. 54 Preceptor Evaluation of Student Performance A preceptor will evaluate a student's performance for all clerkships. The student evaluation will be completed by supervising physicians and other appropriate hospital staff with direct knowledge of student 's performance. Based on the grading rubric, a grade will be submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the questions on the electronic student evaluation form (grade form), site evaluation forms, and clinical experience database. Du ring the last week of each rotation block the student must meet with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluation. Student evaluations are due in the Office of Clinical Affairs at the completion of the rotation. If the student was with several physicians, the student should have the principal evaluator submit a composite evaluation. Attending evaluations of student performance must be completed by the principal evaluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as the primary evaluator. S tudents are not permitted to self - complete the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature . Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) committee and may result in a failure or incomplete grade. Any incomplete grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and may also alter / delay their graduation date. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or turned in to the Clinical Affairs Office at the completion of each rotation. It is the student's r esponsibility to expediently inform the Clinical Affairs Office of any difficulty in obtaining an evaluation from the preceptor at the end of that rotation. The overall responsibility to ensure that evaluations have been completed and returned to CUSOM (o r site coordinator) remains with the student. For this reason, students are responsible for setting up a time for final evaluation during the final week of the rotation, requesting such a meeting at the beginning of the final week of the rotation. It is C USOM policy for students not to leave a rotation without the evaluation being discussed and signed by the preceptor. If a rotation form is not completed and turned in to the site coordinator or Director of Clinical Rotations within 90 days of the rotation , the rotation may be considered not completed or failed. Students should check with the site coordinators monthly to assure they have received the evaluation. Clinical Affairs staff may assist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor is neg ligent by refusing to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the regional coordinator. Comments from the evaluations will be included on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE, also known as the Dean's Letter). The Honor Code applies to all examinations, including the end of rotation examination . Students not achieving the minimum passing score on the end of rotation examination will be allowed one retake. Students failing the exam a second time will receive a failing grade and will be referred to APPS Committee. The committee will review each student's overall academic performance on an individual basis to determine whether, and under what stipulation s, the student may continue in the academic program. Rotations, Course Remediation and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation re quires repeating the rotation and the student will be put on academic probation. Mandatory repeating of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a modified course of study which may result in a delay of graduation. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeat rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and may result in dismissal. 55 Stude nts will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failing to successfully remediate an end -of-rotation exam failure. 2. Failing a clinical rotation. 3. Failing a preceptor evaluation for any rotation. 4. Failing two end -of-rotation exams for any two rotations. Student s who fail a clinical rotation will come before the APPS Committee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in which items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"Unsatisfactory\" or \"Marginal or Needs Improvement\" w ill be reason for remediation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the clinical chair, the preceptor, and/or the APPS Committee. In general, students should show a progression of improvement in performance on clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform s atisfac torily on clinical rotations will be referred to the APPS Committee and may result in additional required curriculum, repeat of an academic year, or dismissal from CUSOM. Poor ratings on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. In the case of concerns in professional and/or ethical areas, the Associate Dean may refer the student to the Dean for an APPS Committee hearing. The Dean will act upon this referral depending on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings in th is area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating. Documentation: Students are expected to maintain a log to identify the procedures performed and the number of essential patient encounters. Rotation Evaluations: Clinical rotation evaluation begins the first week. Students are to request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") by the end of the first and every week of each clinical rotation, in order to continually addre ss areas that need improvement. This provides students an opportunity to improve while on the rotation, and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rotation. Students bear total responsibility to seek this ongoing feedback. Ranking Studen ts will be provided their class rank at the end of each Academic Year ; however, they may request their class rank at any time by contacting the Registrar . Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average (GPA) is the sum of earned grade points divided by the sum of Block -hour credits passed and failed. Students may be required to remediate all courses within a Block where the student's grade falls below 70. Students are required to remediate or complete coursework where the student's grade falls in I (In complete) or IP (In Progress) status. For purposes of GPA calculation, a grade of W is not included in the semester hours attempted. Students who do not successfully complete or remediate these courses are awarded an F or failing grade. A student will re ceive a gra de of C (asterisk) for a remediated course as per the CUSOM grading protocol. Exceptions may be granted to students repeating an entire academic year. 56 For the first two years, most courses have a traditional letter grade (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. For the third and fourth years, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade and all core rotations have clinical modules/exam grades. The clinical rotation grade and the module exam grade use the Honors, High Pass, Pass, Fail s ystem. Successful completion of the rotation requires students to pass both the educational module and rotation portions of the course . All rotations on which a student receives a failing rotation grade must be repeated. As a PC* is the highest grade that can be obtained on a repeat ed rotation , that grade will be recorded on the transcript. The final grade for each rotation during the third and fourth years is calculated into the GPA. Students failing a module or post -rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within 30 days of notification. If the student fails the second attempt at the post -rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade, and the rotation must be repeated. Students who fail one or more rotations or more than one post-rotation exam will be reviewed and acted upon by the APPS Committee . No grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to t he Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that the remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration only after the APPS Committee has met. Assessment of performance compared to national cohorts is through the end of rotation exam and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination s (COMLEX -USA Levels 1, 2 and 3 ). 5.6 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's grade status at any time within a given block or rotation. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses or rotations at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferences, student organizations etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations and/or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 to be considered. The Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs may grant exceptions for participation in unique circumstances . Academic progress for students in years 1 and 2 includes passage of all courses in all Blocks, successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, passing all components of the end -of-year testing, and/or meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee (for those students in a Modified Course of Study). Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the f aculty and admini stration. In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must achieve a score consistent with \"Acceptable or Good Performance\" as defined by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) for the College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE) (see http://www.nbome.org/comsae.asp ). Each student must pass COMLEX - USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to full MS -3 status. Successful academic progress for students in years 3 and 4 includes successful completion of rotations and post - rotation exams, and/or meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Commit tee for those students in a Modified Course of Study. Each student must pass COMLEX -USA Level 2 Cognitive Evaluation ( CE) and COMLEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) exams prior to graduation. 57 Students who experience difficulty successfully completing elements of the CUSOM curriculum or COMLEX exams in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Course of Study). Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must sign and agree to comply with the plan approved by the Dean recommended by the Associate Dean. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress, they will remain in a full -time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study or who do not make academic progress on the modified course of study may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or dismissal from CUSOM. Fourth year students should refer to the Graduation Requirements section for information about further graduation requirements. Students who are not making academic progress will be placed on academic probation and may be dismissed from CUSOM. 5.7 National Board Exams Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior to graduation as outlined in the table of milestones below . Milestones for Each CUSOM Student Successful Completion of Preclinical Courses Satisfactory Completion of COMSAE Examination Successful Completion of COMLEX Level 1 Successful Completion of COMAT or Equivalent Subject Examinations for Core Rotations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rotation Successful Completion of a Third -Year OSCE that Assesses the Core Entrustable Professional Ac tivities for Entering Residency Successful Completion of COMLEX Level 2 CE Successful Completion of COMLEX Level 2 PE Accommodations on COMLEX Exam s Students who request accommodations for COMLEX -USA Level 1 (COMLEX 1) must submit their applications directly to the NBOME at least 90 days prior to their COMLEX 1 date in order to allow time for NBOME's decision. Therefore, students must request COMLEX 1 accommodations from NBOME in writing by April 1 5th to meet the end of July deadline for taking the e xam. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information. 58 COMLEX -USA Level 1 CUSOM students will complete the Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I and II (CABS II) course s in Block s 5 and 8, respectively , and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to July 1 in the period between the second and third academic year. Prior to receiving their COMLEX -USA Level 1 scores , all students, including those on appeal for failure to complete required coursework , may be considered \"provisional \" third year students. Full third year status is granted to all students passing COMLEX -USA Level 1. In order to sit for COMLEX 1, the student must achieve a pre-identified \"passing \" score on a qualifying exam, such as the College of Osteopathic Medicine Self-Assessment Exam (COMSAE). CUSOM identifies the passing parameters by the end of Block 5. CUSOM will pay for the first CUSOM proctored COMSAE Exam with students responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. Students will have three attempts to pass this exam . Students will be permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing this qualifying exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum pre-identified score will not be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students will be provided a mandatory course within Block 8 which should assist in final preparation for national boards . This course of study is credit -bearing and will be provided by CUSOM. Students who do not pass the qualifying exam after three attempts (including after the required review course) will be placed on a modified course of study , during which they will be required to complete, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp .com), at the student's expense and not to exceed 12 weeks duration. Upon successfully completing the remedial program, the student will be required to take COMLEX -USA Level 1 within 12 weeks. Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 will be immediately placed on probation and, as determined by the APPS Committee, may be withdrawn from clinical rotations until they re-take the exam. Any student who fails their initial attempt on COMLEX -USA Level 1 will be immediately placed on probation and, as determined by the APPS Committee, may be withdrawn from clinical rotations until they successfully pass the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 must meet with the Associate Deans for Biomed ical and Clinical Affairs within 7 days of receiving a failing score. The Associate Deans for Biomedical and Clinical Affairs will assist the student in analyzing their deficiencies and assigning a remediation plan. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 1 w ill be required to complete a remedial program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com), at the student 's expense and not to exceed 8 weeks duration. Upon successfully completing the remedial program, the student will b e required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1within 8 weeks. Students who have been taken off rotations for a COMLEX -USA Level 1 failure may be permitted to return to clinical rotations while waiting for release of their score. Students who are unsuccessful on t he second attemp t of the COMLEX -USA Level 1 may be placed on suspension (ineligible for financial aid) or may be placed on a modified course of study (residential program at student's expense, possibly eligible for financial aid) . Students who do not pass COMLEX -USA Le vel 1 after three attempts may be dismissed from school. 59 COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE, and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE Third year students must take and pass an end of rotation exam after each core rotation. In addition to demonstrating the student has learned the appropriate materials on the rotation, the exams function to prepare students for COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE. In addition, students must take and pass Standardized Patient (SP) and Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs) . These exams are administered to assure the student has competently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and to prepare the student for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE testing. Students who fail the SP or OSCE exams will be required to remediate the exam a minimum of 14 days prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. Students who do not successfully remediate will have their COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE release withdrawn. Students are strongly recommended to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE by the end of December in their fourth year. This is recommended as it takes a minimum of 90 days to receive scores for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. If students fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE, they must have ample time to schedule and retake this exam prior to graduation. Passing of both COM LEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE is required to graduate. In addition, most residency programs require passage of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE to match with their program. Some residencies also require proof of passing COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior to interviewing for residency. Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE or COMLEX Level 2 PE Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA PE is required in order to graduate. Students who do not pass both CE and PE by graduation will be suspended. Students on suspension do not qualify for financial aid. Students will not be removed from suspension until they demonstrate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on suspension for a period exceeding six months will be reviewed by the APPS Committee and may be dismissed from CUSOM. Any student who fails their initial attempt on COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE will be immediately placed on probation and, as determined by the APPS Committee, may be withdrawn from clinical rotations until they success fully pass the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE must meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs within 7 days of receiving a failing score. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will assist the student in analyzing their deficien cies and assigning a remediation plan. Students who fail COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE will be required to complete a remedial program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com), at the student's expense and not to exceed 12 wee ks duration. Upon successfully completing the remedial program, the student will be required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE within 12 weeks. Students who have been taken off rotations for a COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE failure may be permitted to return to clini cal rotations while waiting for release of their score. Students who are unsuccessful on the second attempt o f the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE may be placed on suspension. Students who do not pass COMLEX -USA Leve l 2-CE after three attempts may be dismissed from school. A modified course of study is individually planned based upon the student 's performance and needs. Students are required to complete the modified course of study designed by the Dean (in consultation with the Associate Deans). Students not following the individualized plan for remediation may be suspended at any time. If a student decides upon an immersion course and is removed from fourth year clinical rotations, a Modified Course of Study may be designed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs upon approval by the Dean. Students must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and PE. They will be allowed a maximum of three attempts for each of these exams. Failure to pass each of these exams may result in dismissal. 60 5.8 Academic Probation In addition to the policies above, students will be automatically placed on academic probation for the following reasons until the deficiency is rectified or unless otherwise designated by the Dean : the student receives an \"F\" at the end of the Block in any course or clinical experience, or the student fails to score a 70% or above on the post rotation exam on the second attempt, or the student fails to successfully complete a portion of the COMLEX exam in the expected timeframe The record of eac h student on academic probation will be reviewed by the APPS Committee each Block or clinical rotation to evaluate the student's academic progress. At the end of any block where the student on academic probation earns grades below 70%, the APPS Committee may recommend promotion to the following year, repetition of the year just completed, repetition of a specific course or system, make -up examinations, summer courses, or dismissal. In general, students are not allowed to repeat a n entire course more than o nce. The APPS Committee may , on a rare occasion , allow a studen t to repeat a course or Block. Students may appeal the decision of the APPS Committee to the Dean based upon new and compelling information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the decision. NOTE \"F\" grades: A student who earned a grade of \"F\" initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as In Progress (\"IP\") on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current \"IP\" grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at t he time the \"IP\" is assigned. Once an \"IP\" grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of \"IP\" c ourses as part of the academic record. The appropriate Associate Dean, however, maintains a listing of previously satisfied F grades in courses and will report such grades to the APPS Committee as needed for assessment of the student's overall aca demic pe rformance and progress. Students who fail to successfully remediate a grade of \"F\" will have failed the course and re ceive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be given for a remediated course is 70% . The new grade, if remediated succ essfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course. A student may receive any of the following grades for a clinical rotation: Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail. A successfully remediated clinical rotation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated rotation . 5.9 Modified Courses of Study Students who are placed into a Modified Course of Study by the Dean must agree to and comply with the Modified Course of Study. Students who do not comply with the Modified Course of Study may be suspende d at any time by the Dean for failure to follow the plan. If a student has difficulty in following the assigned Modified Course of Study, they must meet with the Dean, or appropriate Associate Dean. In the clinical years, s tudents following a Modified Course of Study should be aware that th ey must complete all requirements to graduate, enter ERAS and the Match. Students who fail COM LEX Level 2 PE or CE after the Match may lose their matched position . In addition, students who fail to meet their gradua tion requirements in adequate time to start their residency program may also lose their matched position. These decisions are made by the residency program director and/or director of medi cal education at the respective hospital. 61 5.10 Academic Performance , Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs monitors the academic progress achieved by students throughout the academic program. The APPS Committee meets at the end of any block or rotation in which a student has achieved a failing course grade, failed to success fully remediate an F, failed a course while on Academic Probation, when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or when deemed necessary . The Dean or the appropriate Associate Dean for the acade mic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by leaves of absence or other similar factors. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism) or nonprofessional conduct. The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medic ine Honor Code published elsewhere in the Academic Bulletin shall guide this review . The APPS Committee is composed of following voting members: the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research, the Executive Director for Student Affairs and at least four faculty members to include clinical and biomedical faculty members. The Dean appoints faculty members . A quorum is defined as a simple majority of members present in person or by teleconference. The committee chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite n on-voting members to attend. As this is not considered a legal hearing and is instead an academic proceeding, attorneys or other representatives are not allowed. Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting APPS Committee meetings are held at the end of each block , after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and/or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades , or as needed . Additionally, the Senior Associate Dean for Ac ademic Affairs and Research may call for an APPS Committee hearing and serve as the Chair of the APPS Committee if a student has: Failed a course Attempted and failed to remediate a course resulting in an F Failed to pass any courses while on Academic Probation Failed any clinical rotations Failed a post -rotation exam twice Experienced repeated failures in the end of year testing exams Suspicion of any violation of the CUSOM Honor Code or other policies/procedures after appropriate preliminary procedures have occurred Failed to pass COMSAE Failed to pass an appropriate COML EX-USA in the timeframe required Demonstrated inability to make academic progress by any other academic measures the faculty and/or administration have approved or for remediation programs including an altered degree plan, remediation courses assigned on or off campus, and/or other directed CUSOM curriculum. APPS Committee P rocedures for Academic Performance Matters The Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research will Chair the APPS Committee. 62 Members of the APPS Comm ittee have the following ro les: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved will report on the academic progress of the student(s) , as necessary . The Associate Dean may submit a written repo rt documenting assistance that the student has received or been offered, including but not limited to tutoring or advising. The Course Director, Department Chair, and/or the student 's Faculty Advisor may be asked by the APPS Committee to comment on student performance and related topics, as necessary . The Executive Director for Student Affairs may report on documentation that the Office of Student Affairs may have , which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar will have the student's entire academic record available (course evaluations, performance asse ssments and the student's transcript) for the members to reference if needed. The Executive Assistant to the Dean shall serve as the secretary recording minutes and en suring all communication occurs in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Com mittee will be given the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten-minute presentation of any issues or considerations that they wish to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then direct questions to the student. This is the on ly portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. For issues arising from Honor Code violations, the Executive Director for Student Affairs will report on documentation that the Office of Student Affairs may have which may be releva nt to the alleged violation of the Honor Code. This may include a verbal report from faculty involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are involved with reporting the breach, confidentiality of the reporting student will be maintained and the Executive Director for Student Affairs will represent the student's testimony. See below under Non -Academic Matters. For students deemed to not be making academic progress, including multiple grades in the I or IP range in one block or across more th an one block or an F grade, following deliberations the APPS Committee may make recommendations including but not limited to the following for final action by the Dean: Award of a satisfactory grade (70%) and promotion to the next block following satisfac tory remediation Require remediation, further coursework, or repeat of a course Require one or more additional clinical rotations with satisfactory performance Place, not place, or extend the student 's term on academic probation Require more frequent meetings with faculty advisors with those students on academic probation Specify a timeline or manner in w hich any remediation must occur Make a determination for dismissal, or repeat of academic year Request further assessment prior to making sure the student has the ability to make satisfactory progress to become an osteopathic physicia n including but not limited to: psychological evaluations, drug or alcohol screening / testing, or other evaluations . Such testing will be at the student's expense. Suspend with reinstatement p ending satisfactory performance Suspen d with reinstatement decisions pending f urther evaluation and treatment Repeat of multiple courses in which the student initially earned a failing grade Repeat an entire academic year Assign a Modified Course of Study that may delay promotion and graduation until satisfact ory a progress through a directed remediation program has occurred, or dismissal 63 The APPS Committee may recommend dismissal of a student when the student demonstrates that h e/she is unable to make academic progress through: Multiple failures in a preclinical Block An F grade on a modified course of study A history of multiple conditional grades and an F Failure of two or more clinical rotations in one academic year Failure to pass any courses while on Academic Probation Failure and cumulative evidence that demonstrate the student is not gaining the appropriate knowledge and/or qualifications to become an osteopathic physician Any other issues deemed relevant. The appropriate APPS Committee Chair will notify the student of the outcome of the APPS Committee meeting and any sanctions if applicable. Upon notification, the student may appeal the decision in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of notification . The a ppeal should be based upon new and relevant information. The Dean will normally reply within 14 working days of receiving the written appeal. The Dean will not meet with the student prior to receiving the written appeal material. In the case of an appeal , the student may appeal to the Dean based only upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee . The Dean's decision will be final. APPS Committ ee Procedures for Non -academic M atters Charges of misconduct may arise from a student ( or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within three (3) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct, the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with the Executive Director for Student Affairs. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. All instances of suspected misconduct by a student must initially be reported through the Executive Director of Student Affairs. The Executive Director will in turn notify the Dean and appropriate Associate Dean of the suspected misconduct. The Dean then constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the charges. The ad hoc committee investiga tes the charges and reports back to the Dean in a tim ely manner. Whenever possible, the investigation should include a personal interview with the student(s) , witnesses and others, as necessary. If the student(s) admit s to the charges, the Dean may either render adjudication directly or refer th e case to the APPS Committee for resolution. If the student(s) does not admit to the charges, the case is referred to the APPS Committee for review. The Chairperson of the APPS committee will notify the accused student(s ) and will schedule a hearing with the Committee. This hearing typically will be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the Committee. Findings of the investigation shall be presented by the ad hoc committee to the APPS Committee at the hearing . The accused student(s) sh all meet with the APPS Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him/hersel f. Although the hearing 's purpose is fact-finding , the accused student (s) shall have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his /her position. All sessions of the Committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No attorney shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding . All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. 64 Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. The testimony of each witness shall be giv en while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room . The Committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided that the evidence is relevant to the question before the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with taking evidence. Timeframes for in vestigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant. Deliberation of the Committee shall take place in private and r emain confidential. Voting on decisions of whether misconduct has oc curred shall be by secret ballot and determined by a simple majority. If the Committee determines that the student was in violation of the Honor Code, it will consider and recommend an appropriate penalty. The APPS Committee forwards its recommendations to the Dean for action. The CUSOM Dean may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the Committee. The student will be informed of the decision and if violation (s) is dete rmined ; the recommended penalty. A letter from the Dean's office will serve as the official notice of the outcome of the proceedings. Penalties for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student are also civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student leaving CUSOM, grades will be assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy. The APPS Committee may recommend to the Dean imposition of one or more of the following sanctions , which may appear in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation MSPE (Dean's Letter), upon individuals determined to have violated the Honor Code: Admonition: This consists of a verbal or written warning . Admonitions will not become a part of the student's longitudinal record and may not be reviewed or appealed by the student. Ineligibility for election and/or removal from student office or organizational office for specified period of time. Withholding o f official tran script, barring re -admission to CUSOM, and/or blocking a student from enrolling for a specified period of time. Restitution, whether monetary or by specifi c duties, or reimbursement for damages to or misappropriation of CUS OM, student, staff , or faculty property. Academic sanctions: Writing a paper, reduction of grade on an examination, assignment, or course; repetition of a course(s); being assigned additional clinic or laboratory activities or coursework; repeating of an exam, coursework, or even an entire academic year or semester or other appropriate penalties. Conduct Probation: A penalty levied for a specific time, the duration of which will be determined by the seriousness of the circumstances. It carries with it a warning that any f urther violations of CUSOM regulations will result in more serious disciplinary action. If no further conduct or behavioral infractions occur, the conduct probation will be removed from the student's longitudinal record in the Office of Student Affairs. Disciplinary Probation: A penalty for a definite period determined by the circumstances of the case. This is the mos t severe penalty under which a student may remain at CUSOM. Disciplinary probation may result in a warning that further violations may be c ause for disciplinary suspension or expulsion. A record of the disciplinary probation remains a part of the student's longitudinal record in the Office of Student Affairs . Suspension: This penalty may be imposed for continued and/or flagrant violation of the disciplinary probation terms, or it may be imposed directly in first offense cases that warrant such action. In the case of suspension, the student will be barred from all campus and non -campus activities. 65 Withdrawal: Withdrawal is administrative removal of a student from a class or from CUSOM and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial obligation to CUSOM . The withdrawn student may also be barred from re -enrollment until such time as specific conditions have been m et. Expulsion: Expulsi on is permanent severance from CUSOM. Revocation of Degree: The revocation of degree may occur for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, will be considered by the Dean. All m inutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the APPS Committee, and a copy will be sent to the Dean's Office where it shall remain until the student graduates or leaves CUSOM. Special Meetings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a mee ting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, or has been on suspension to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any a dditional action is needed. 5.11 Withdrawa l/Leave Procedures Withdrawal All requests for withdrawal must be made in writing to the office of the Executive Director for Student Affairs and must follow the following steps: A voluntary withdrawal is requested in writing through the Office of the Exec utive Director for Student Affairs . The student must complete an Change of Status Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of the Registrar before the student will be considere d \"withdrawn in good standing\" The date fo r a voluntary withdrawal will be the date of the student's written request. Upon receipt of the completed Change of Status Form and CUSOM issued items, the student will be voluntarily withdrawn (in good standing) from CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readmission or an official transcript if requested. Any pre -approved leave of absence (to extend no longer than six months) will require completion of an Change of Status Form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM i ssued items (depending upon the specific circumst ances of the leave of absence). The Dean ; however, makes the final d ecision regarding withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, will be required to complete a withdrawal or Change of Status Form. Medical Leave of Absence (absence of less than 180 calendar days) A medica l leave of absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide documentation and are deemed to have a valid medical reason requiring the leave. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and/or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may make the initial determination . The medical l eave is determined by the Dean. A medical leave of absence may last no longer than six months. A medical leave of more than 180 calendar days will require the student to withdraw. 66 For students who are in good academic standing and returning from a medical leave, the Dean, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will determine the student's placement within the curriculum upon the student's return from the approved medical leave of absence with a physician release to return. Medical Withdrawal (absence greater than 180 calendar days) A medical wit hdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medica l reason that exceeds 180 calendar days . Students may apply for re -admission through the CUSOM Admissions process if granted a medical withdrawal , but are not guaranteed a seat in a future class . The Admissions Committee will determine acceptance; the Associate Deans will determine placement for all students who have withdrawn for medical purposes and are in good academic standing. Military Withdrawal Military withdrawal is granted to students whose military reserve obligations may require a period of absence from the academic program when they are called to extended active duty. Readmission is guaranteed pending proof of compliance with the minimal techn ical standards and the Honor Co de. If the student returns within five years, they will be placed in the curriculum as close to their current position as possible in order to provide them the appropriate continuum in the curriculum and the training required to be successful, competent, and a ble to perform well on their board exams. In any case, the student will not be charged any additional tuition from their original obligation. The Dean and Associate Deans will meet with the individual student to determine the appropriate curriculum to be completed in the remainder of the degree program that will bring the student to a competency level equal to his or her peer. Personal Withdrawal Personal withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed withdrawing in good standing, the student must complete all paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. Administrative Leave of Absence An administrati ve leave of absence is granted by the Dean. An administrative leave may last no longer than six months as dee med appropriate and necessary. An administrative leave of absence is rare and is present to address such situations as a death of a spouse, child , or such other severe circumstance that would i nterrupt a student's education. Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution. The duration of the suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee or the Professional Ethics Standards Board, or CUSOM's Honor Code Committee. Students may be assigned independent studies during suspension to remain current; however, these independent studies do not replace course attendance or r otation requirements. While on suspension, students are not eligible for financial aid and should not represent themselves as CUSOM students. They should not participate in any clinical activities and should not wear their CUSOM white coat. If the terms set out under the suspension are not fulfilled and the period of suspension is six months or greater, the student may be dismissed from CUSOM 67 Dismissal Dismissal from CUS OM will be based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean . Unofficial Involuntary Withdrawal (Pending) Any student who ceases to maintain adequate academic attendance in CUSOM will be considered for an involuntary withdrawal. General Withdrawal Failure to complete a Change of Status Form and to obtain the proper signatures will result in a hold placed on all academic records. o Tuition refunds will be based upon the schedule shown under the section on Refund Policy. o For any withdrawal, voluntary or involuntary, CUSOM recognizes and follows the date of determination as defined by the U.S. Department of Education in its Code of F ederal Regulations. For any withdrawal, voluntary or involuntary, the student must return the following to Student Affairs at the time of departure: o Identification card o Parking decal o All computers and peripherals including, but not necessarily limited to, laptops, iPads, ARS/clickers, chargers o White Coat, if applicable o Any other CUSOM -supplied items Withdrawal must be completed no later than two (2) business days prior to the end of a Course or clinical rotation. Failure to withdraw by this date will resul t in issuance of a grade of F for all Courses in that Block, or for that rotation, which will adversely affect the student's GPA. Withdrawal from a Course or Rotation after an exam has been administered and/or a rotation completed, will result in the final grade being the gra de of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F. In instances when the Dean extends an offer of readmission, that offer may be rescinded if the student fails to provide requested documentation and written acceptance of t erms in a timely manner as defined in the offer. NOTE : Although different categories of Withdrawal are identified, the student transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 5.12 Graduation Requirements The degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to and conferred upon candidates who: Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; Have satisfied all academic requirements; Have passed the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX 2 CE, and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE; and Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during as a result of the academic program. Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligat ions with CUSOM and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during as a result of the academic program. 68 To become eligible for graduation, each fourth -year student must have successfully completed all the above requirements within six years of matric ulation. The six years allow for the student to have been in a delayed program due to medical, academic, and/or behavioral leaves of absence. Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and profe ssional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these competencies are not met. A student must have completed all curricular requirements at CUSOM, or a minimum of two years at CUSOM and another eligible institution which is accredited by the Commission o n Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this requirement, the stude nt must have been enrolled full -time at CUSOM during their third and fourth academic years. A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of faculty, as determined by the individual course directors and clinical rotations supervisors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to gradu ate. The Dean makes the determination on any appeals from promotion board recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee a t the time of the deliberation. The Dean makes the determination on any appea l from the Dean's recommendation, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the Dean at the time of his or her decision. Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit for ms in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must also attend the exit process and the commencement program to receive a diploma. Upon passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1 and Level 2 CE and Level 2 PE requirements, and all other requirements as delineated i n the Academic Bulletin, the faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the DO degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 5.13 Delayed Graduation Policy If an osteopathic medical student is suspended, takes a leave of absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall acad emic performance, then a delay in scheduling clinical rotations will occur and the student's graduation will be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals, temporary leaves of absence or suspensions secondary to academic, administrative suspensions or as a res ult of failure to pass boards consistent with CUSOM policy will also cause a delay in scheduling clinical rotations and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based financial aid. In addition, the placement on an altered degree plan may impact the student's ability to participate in the match process. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the School's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial A id for a particular situation. 5.14 Clinical Policies and Procedures Please see the CUSOM Clinical Clerkship Guide and Rotation Manual for Student Policies relating to all clinical rotations. This manual is made available to students during year 2. 69 5.15 Academic Freedom Policy Academic freedom refers to the environment provided by the University that permits faculty and students to engage in their scholarly pursuits of teaching, research, and related activities at institutions of higher education. Academic freedom embodies the University's mission of creating new knowledge and the effective communica tion of cumulated knowledge. This policy applies to faculty members and students at CUSOM . As an academic institution, CUSOM exists to educate and prepare community -based osteopathic physicians in a Christian environment to care for the rural and underser ved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States and the nation. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of CUSOM's goals. As members of the academic community, faculty and students are encouraged to develop t he capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The freedom to learn depends upon appropriate opportunities and conditions i n the classroom, on the campus, and in the larger community. The University, the faculty and students have a responsibility to protect and promote the learning process in all endeavors. CUSOM affirms its commitment to academic freedom, and adopts the foll owing statement of academic freedom principles applicable to faculty and students. Faculty and students are expected to remember the public may judge the profession and institution by their utterances. Hence, faculty and students agree at all times to be accurate, to exercise appropriate restraint, and to show respect for the opinions of others. CUSOM subscribes fully to the 1940 Statement of Principles of the American Association of University Profess ors regarding academic freedom: Faculty is entitled to freedom in the classroom. The faculty member is responsible ; however, for maintaining academic standards in the presentation of course materials. As members of the academic community, students should be encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for the truth. Faculty and students in the classroom and in conference should encourage free discussion, inquiry, and expression. Student perform ance should be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the information or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgme nt about matters of opinion, but students are responsible for learning the content of the course of study in which they are enrolled. Students should have protection through orderly grievance procedures against prejudiced or capricious evaluations. At the same time, students are responsible for complying with the standards of academic performance established by the School. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in research or other services of his/her own undertaking, and in the publication of the re sults, subject to the adequate performance of other academic duties. When faculty and students speak or write as members of the community, they are free from institutional censorship or discipline, but they are expected to remember the public may judge the profession and institution by their utterances. 70 Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University and/or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell U niversity or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the School. 6. Osteopathic Medicine Curriculum 6.1 Years 1 and 2 The first two years of CUSOM's curriculum focus on teaching students fundamental principles of biomedical science with significant emphasis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism. Historically, the first two years of medical school instruction have bee n viewed as \"pre -clinical\" with the remaining two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUSOM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong biomedical principles in addition to a robust found ation in clinical sciences and o steopathic principles , principles of clinical practice, and professionalism. Curricular Content Overview All semesters of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9 -week blocks, with the exception of ten weeks for Block 4 and eleven weeks for Block 8. Within the first two blocks, the students are introduce d to the foundational concepts of Anatomy, Biochemistry/ Cell Biology , Microbiology /Immunology , Cellular and Metabolic Pathology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. Anatomy continues throughout the first year, integrating wherever possible with the systems approach of the remaining three semesters of the first two years. In Blocks 3 through 8, the CUSOM curriculum uses an organ -systems approach to medical education. Lecturers present instructional materials that go beyond the basic principles mastered during the first semester. Basic scientists, primary care physicians, and sub -specialty physicians deliver this material as it relates to the particular system. Clinical Skills and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine address content that wi ll allow CUSOM students to learn and thrive in the basic philosophy, pr inciples, and practice of osteopathic medicine. Hands -on diagnosis and treatment is the foundation of osteopathic wh ole-person health care. L ectures and labs incorporate state of the art instruction . Additionally, simulation and standardized patient exp eriences, allow students to enhance their clinical skills such as physical exam techniques, interviewing, counseling, and medical reporting skills necessary to progress to the 3rd an d 4th years. S tudents are also introduced to Early Clinical Experiences (ECEs) with community physicians within the region. The Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) course provides CUSOM students with clinically relevant knowledge and instruction in topics directly related to competent medical practice. Through the use of lectures, cases, and self -directed learning modules, students through all semesters of years 1 and 2 l earn relevant applicable skills in evidence -based medical practice, the effective use of bioinformatics, epidemiology, evidence -based diagnostics, as well as basic biomedical research skills and methods. The Professional Core Competencies (PCC) course is presented through all semesters of the first and second year curriculum, and is designed to teach those core competencies necessary throughout the physician's career. Through the use of lecture, discussion, and other unique activities, students are introdu ced to and master such topics as medical humanities, biomedical ethics, medical law and jurisprudence, global health issues, and professionalism. 71 Sample weekly calendar Academic calendars are made available to all students. Actual weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs. Lectures primarily take place in the morning, with labs and clinical skills typically taking place in the afternoons. MS-1 sample week: Morning lecture -discussions are complemented by afternoon labs and skills sessions, with embedded study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinally throughout the two years in a progression designed to integrate with and provide seam less entry into the third and fourth years. Content is presented by physician s and basic scientists using concepts of t eam teaching and team learning. Evaluation includes integrated exams, quizzes, and end -of-block and end -of-year evaluat ions. Weekly clinical case exercises , with a team -based approach, help students remain on top of material presented during the week, and provide faculty with a ssessment of student progress. 72 MS-2 sample week: 73 6.2 Years 3 and 4 Rotation Structure Minimum requirements for clinical rotations are 160 hours each for four-week rotations.

NOTE : The most up -to-date information will be available at: http://www.campbell.edu/cusom . Course Overview and Philosophy of Clinical Training : The philosophic framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become osteopathic physicians possessing the highest competencies in the profession. The program will educate students to be c ompetent physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and providers of comprehensive healthcare to the individual, to the family as a unit, and to the communities they serve. Osteopathic physicians must be able to function in the role of leader of the healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individual to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to prepare patient -centered physicians who will impact positively on the equality of healthcar e and healthcare delivery systems, and will improve access for individuals and their families. In pursuit of the goal of excellence, the CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of the traditional and innovative, designed to: Foster the analytic a nd problem -solving skills requisite for physicians involved in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients, in families, in communities, and in populations at large; Ensure the acquisition of basic clinical knowledge and essential c linical skills; Develop an understanding of contemporary health care delivery issues; Cultivate effective physician -patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, and compassion; Develop high ethical standards; and Promote a lifelong commitment to le arning. 2 Other electives not included may be arranged on a case -by-case basis if approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 77 As a result of the 2 years of clinical training, students will see the primary care physician as being able to: Demonstrate clinical excellence, using current evidence based medicine, and biomedical knowledge in identifying and managing the medical problems presented by his/her patients. Provide continuing and comprehensive care to individuals and families. Demonstrate the ability to integrate the behavioral/emotional/social/environmental factors of families in promoting health and managing d isease. Recognize the importance of maintaining and developing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for the best in modern medical practice in a rapidly -changing world. Pursue a regular and systematic program of lifelong learning. Recognize the ne ed and demonstrate the ability to use consultation with other medical specialists while maintaining continuity of care. Share tasks and responsibilities with other health professionals. Be aware of the findings of relevant research; understand and critical ly evaluate this body of research; and apply the results of the research to medical practice. Manage his/her practice in a business -like, cost -efficient manner that will provide professional satisfaction and time for a rewarding personal life. Serve as an advocate for the patient within the healthcare system. Assess the quality of care that he/she provides and actively pursue measures to correct any identified deficiencies. Use current medical knowledge to identify, evaluate, and minimize risks for patient and family. Recognize community resources as an integral part of the health care system; participate in improving the health of the community. Inform and counsel patients concerning their health problems, recognizing and valuing differences in patient and physician backgrounds, beliefs, and expectations. Develop mutually satisfying physician -patient relationships to promote comprehensive problem -identification and problem -solving. Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropriate i nterventions. Integrate and effectively utilize osteopathic principles and practices in the delivery of optimal patient care The general expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the fundamental skills of medical problem solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Some focus on data acquisition (medical history, physical examination, laboratory data, or literature review), while others deal purely with psychomotor skills or attitudes and feelings. Clerkships are under the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has made affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering diverse training opportunities. The program has been organized to permit the greatest degree of educational exposure in a practical, clinical environment and to develop expertise in the area s of patient diagnosis and management. The rotations provided at each affiliated site, and the number of students assigned to each affiliated site from CUSOM, are determined by mutual agreement with CUSOM, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Hospi tal Administrator(s), Regional Dean, Vice -president for Medical Education (VPME) / Director of Medical Education (DME), Clinical Faculty and the Office for Clinical Affairs. Whenever possible, CUSOM uses hospitals with accredited postdoctoral programs app roved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for post -doctoral training to provide assurance of adequate teaching material and faculty. 78 Clinical Modules Clinical Modules/Videos/Lectures will be made available on clinical rotations. These modules are designed to be appropriate for both third and fourth year students and offer the flexibility to fit student's schedules and needs whether traveling, on rotati on, or at home. They are meant to supplement topics which should be covered on clinical rotations. They are also meant to act as study guides for both the end of rotation exams , as well as COMLEX USA Level 2. Clinical Modules are an important supplement to a student's education, but are not meant to are not meant to replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations. Students are provided with required curriculum during the third year and fourth year . Learning objectives are provided for the core discipline rotations , as well as reading assignments. Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to identify a residency position for each graduate. The Associate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is tasked with facilitating graduate placement, and Regional Deans are in place to oversee student rotations and assist in the development of residency programs. As of July 2015, there are 19 AOA -approved postgraduate programs in 7 separate organizations (Campbell University, FirstHealth, Harnett Health, Novant Huntersville Medical Center, Sampson Regional, Cape Fear Valley Health, and Southeastern Health), representing 363 approved positions in the following specialties: Dermatology, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Sports Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Neuromuscular Medicine, and traditional rotating internship. Additionally, there are 300 residency positions in the various stages of development. Our goal is to have a minimum of 450 approved positions by 2020. These programs will provide CUSOM graduating students postgraduate training opportunities , as well as help meet the need for future physicians to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States and the nation . 6.3 Schedule of Course Offerings Fall Semester, Year 1 Block 1 Course Number Course Title OMED 500 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 501 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 502 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 503 Professional Core Competencies OMED 511 Cell Biology and Biochemistry OMED 524 Microbiology and Immunology OMED 530 Anatomy and Lab 79 Block 2 Course Number Course Title OMED 504 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 505 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 506 Foundations of Medical Practice OMED 507 Professional Core Competencies OMED 522 Pharmacology OMED 540 Physiology OMED 550 Cellular and Molecular Pathology OMED 560 Anatomy and Lab Spring Semester, Year 1 Block 3 Course Number Course Title OMED 508 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 509 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 513 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 514 Professional Core Competencies OMED 570 Musculoskeletal System OMED 590 Anatomy and Lab Block 4 Course Number Course Title OMED 515 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 516 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 517 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 518 Professional Core OMED 581 Neurosensory System OMED 583 Psychiatry OMED 594 Anatomy and Lab Fall Semester, Year 2 Block 5 Course Number Course Title OMED 600 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 601 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 602 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 603 Professional Core Competencies OMED 610 Cardiovascular System OMED 611 Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I OMED 620 Respiratory System 80 Block 6 Course Number Course Title OMED 604 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 605 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 606 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 607 Professional Core Competencies OMED 630 Blood/Lymph/Immune OMED 640 Renal System OMED 650 Integumentary System Spring Semester, Year 2 Block 7 Course Number Course Title OMED 608 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 609 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 613 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 614 Professional Core Competencies OMED 670 Endocrine System OMED 680 Gastrointestinal System Block 8 Course Number Course Title OMED 615 Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Lab OMED 616 Clinical Skills and Lab OMED 617 Introduction to Clinical Clerkships OMED 618 Foundation of Medical Practice OMED 619 Professional Core Competencies OMED 690 Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II OMED 695 Reproductive System Fall and Spring Semester, Year 3 Course Number Course (Rotation) Title OMED 710 Internal Medicine I OMED 712 Internal Medicine II OMED 714 Medical Selective OMED 720 Surgery OMED 730 Family Medicine OMED 740 Pediatrics OMED 750 Obstetrics and Gynecology OMED 760 Psychiatry OMED 770 Simulation Medicine OMED 780 Rural/Underserved/International OMED 790 Elective OMED 795 Clinical Academic Assessment 81 Fall and Spring Semester, Year 4 Course Number Course (Rotation) Title OMED 810 Medical Selective I OMED 812 Medical Selective II OMED 820 Surgery Selective OMED 830 Primary Care Selective OMED 840 Geriatrics OMED 850 Emergency Medicine OMED 860 Elective I OMED 862 Elective II OMED 864 Elective III OMED 866 Elective IV OMED 870 Residency Development OMED 890 Sub Internship Course Descriptions Specific Course Overview, Year 1, Semester 1, Blocks 1 and 2 The curriculum in Block 1 and 2 of the first year is designed to introduce students to the basic concepts of Cell and Molecular Biology, (Genet ics and Biochemistry), Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, Immunology, Microbiology, Pathology, Pharmacology an d Physiology.

Throughout the second year, the students will gain a de eper understanding of body system dysfunction and homeostasis and the role of osteopathic medicine in managing disease entities throughout the various systems and/or specialties. Student s will become more adept at utilizing these skills in managing all st ages of patient care through infancy, adolescence, geriatrics, and pregnancy. The OMM lab will also introduce students to more common techniques used to manage problems such as short lower extremity, tension cephalgia, and cervical/thoracic/lumbar dysfunct ions. Years Three and Four : CUSOM has taken a structural rather than a functional approach to osteopathic (OMM) integration in the clinical years. The assessment of the cognitive learning and practical application of osteopathic manipulation will consist of evaluation and assessment of students' psychomotor learning through practical hands -on and oral evaluations under the supervision of clinical faculty. This will assist students in their preparation for both the complex CE and PE exams. Opportunities for \"hands on\" OMM experience are included during the third and fourth year. Osteopathic education plays a key role in the entire curriculum and students will gain an understanding of the osteopathic profession regarding all aspects of health care. Knowled ge consists of: Concepts basic to osteopathic health care including: the self -healing tendency/processes, The unity of the organism in its environment, and diagnostic and therapeutic manipulative processes, and when and how to apply them. The philosophy a nd principles of osteopathic medicine. The history, growth, and development of the profession. The effects of growth, development, and aging on the musculoskeletal system (normal and variations of normal). Topical anatomy and neuroanatomy correlated with structural anatomy. Anatomy and physiology of component parts and their inter -relationships within the musculoskeletal system. Most frequently encountered structural anomalies and functional abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system at each age level. Somatic changes which occur as a result of distant disease processes and the relationship of these changes in delaying the resolution of the disease process. Musculoskeletal evaluation procedures suitable for each age group/situation. Primary somatic changes resulting from anatomical syndromes and their relationship to other syndromes. The applications of philosophy and principles in special situations within the life cycle. Understanding will be of: The relationship of the philosophy and principles of osteopathic medicine to concepts of health and disease. The relationship of the philosophy and principles of osteopathic medicine to patient management. 100 The relevance of the philosophy and principles of osteopathic medicine to situations in e ach of the various specialties. The impact of the philosophy and principles of osteopathic medicine on the practice of sub -specialty areas. During years three and four students are required to demonstrate: Application of basic osteopathic concepts to hea lth care (diagnosis, treatment, variations, when and how to apply). Use of osteopathic manipulative techniques in diagnosing/treating problems in special situations (e.g., pregnancy, labor, pediatrics, surgery). Using indications/contraindications for oste opathic manipulative techniques in situations unique to the various specialties. Using a variety of techniques in osteopathic manipulative medicine applied/ adjusted to the unique needs of the individual patient (e.g., in terms of age, development, disorde r). Recognizing the relationship of disease/disorder of the musculoskeletal system to total wellbeing. Writing of appropriate orders and progress notes relevant to the use of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment. In the clinical years, students and preceptors comprise the primary targets for OMM integration. Students have had substantial experience in developing an osteopathic approach to common medical problems in their first and second year. Students have also p erformed and recorded at least 10 treatments per academic year using a standard SOAP note format. The purpose of clinical integration is to provide a major incentive to keep active with hands -on treatments throughout rotations. 101 7.
