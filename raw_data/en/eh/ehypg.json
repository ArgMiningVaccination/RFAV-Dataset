It is a combination of various therapies such as herbs, acupuncture, massage, exercise, and nutritional counseling. This approach works on several principles and believes that healing is possible without undergoing invasive surgeries. What are the Principles of Naturopathic Medicine? Self-Healing It helps to identify and remove all the obstacles to recovery, thereby allowing natural healing and reducing the consumption of medication. Underlying Symptoms Instead of stopping the symptoms of a particular health condition, we resolve underlying physical or mental issues that you may be suffering from. Harmless Treatment The treatment plans should not pose harmful side effects or control your symptoms negatively. Holistic Treatment Naturopathic medicine is all about adopting holistic approaches to effectively treat all your body's aspects. Prevention Prevention is better than cure. Hence, this approach intends to remove all the toxic substances from your lifestyle to prevent health-related problems from occurring. What are the Treatments of Naturopathic Medicine?

The treatment under naturopathic medicine may range from diet and nutrition recommendations, behavioral change, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, manipulative therapy to establish balance in the body, detoxification of the body, herbal dietary supplements, psychotherapy, and so on. We also treat your condition using extracorporeal shockwave therapy. This non-invasive approach saves you from undergoing painful surgery. The technique uses low-energy, mechanical and audible sound waves to increase the blood flow in your injured area and provide fast healing. Shockwave therapy has been considered an effective treatment of various tendon complaints like tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy. In some cases, we combine your naturopathic treatment with craniosacral therapy. This gentle hands-on technique uses a light touch to examine your membranes and the movement of the fluids in and around your central nervous system. It promotes a feeling of overall well-being by eliminating pain and boosting your health and immunity. The therapy addresses conditions such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, fascial adhesions, multiple sclerosis, neuralgia, speech impairment, post-concussion syndrome, etc. What are the Uses of Naturopathic Medicine?

Naturopathic medicine is considered effective in cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal pain, polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, and anxiety, as well as other chronic conditions in your body. What are the Benefits of Naturopathic Medicine? - Naturopathic medicine works on a personal level. When you visit us for consultation and treatment, we discuss your individual needs and then create a treatment plan considering all the aspects. - This type of treatment can be helpful alongside modern medicine. According to some studies, naturopathic medicine activates your body's self-healing mechanism. - It is a more affordable alternative to conventional healthcare. - Naturopathic medicine improves your overall quality of life and is prevalent as a part of preventive care for your body. What are functional Lab Ranges? Labs values are based on population norms NOT based on individual norms. The literature reveals there are optimal ranges for most if not all labs that can be applied to an individual. Several large and respected organizations recommend utilizing this concept. There currently, however, is not complete agreement as to what those ranges are between groups. There is, however, significant overlap between the recommendations allowing us to adjust values accordingly. Intervening to adjust things to \"optimal ranges\" can have profound benefit for many people, though not all labs need to be in that range. As example, if a lab is within normal but below what we consider optimal and the person has no symptoms related to the lab, it may not be necessary to adjust. Functional medicine is an approach offering patient-centered services to manage chronic diseases. This field aims to find the root cause of the problem and then provide suitable treatment. It involves listening to your concern and gathering your medical history. It may include triggers like stress, poor diet, toxins, genetics, allergens, or the presence of the microbiome in your body. After identifying the trigger, we customize a treatment and healthy living plan for you. This plan will address various aspects of your life, including your physical needs like nutrition, exercise and sleep, mental and emotional stressors related to community life, and social work. While designing your treatment plan, we will combine your lifestyle with behavioral interventions, thus helping you take charge of your health. Why Opt for Functional Medicine? - Functional medicine focuses on patient-centered care. During the consultation, we take account of your comprehensive medical history and lifestyle assessment to check your health. We use such assessments to identify your disease triggers, thus building a treatment plan. - Our functional medicine treatment uses a multi-disciplinary approach to treating your problem. Most of these approaches are less invasive and holistic. - We focus on chronic conditions and study the effectiveness of functional medicine on your health issues to provide you with long-term relief of the problem. We have many specialty options to facilitate your health journey What are functional Lab Ranges? Labs values are based on population norms NOT based on individual norms.

Metabolic Restoration program Struggling to lose weight? You can benefit from our Metabolic Restoration program. Also called MedFit-MR, this program can aim to help people manage weight after identifying their calorie needs and the muscle and fat percentage in their body. This is accomplished through a series of lab tests and scientific measures, and we call these tools BioMetrics, the numbers that objectively show one's progress in weight management. Since everyone's metabolism is different, their diet and exercise need to lose weight will also be different. MedFit-MR, which is a customized solution for weight management, identifies each individual's calorie needs scientifically and helps them define a healthy lifestyle tailored to their unique requirements. Low Dose Naltrexone The term 'LDN' refers to the use of Naltrexone at doses below 10mg per day. Naltrexone exhibits novel and paradoxical effects when administered as these low doses. Naltrexone blocks the euphoric sensations associated with narcotic and alcohol use. Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is being used as a regulator of the immune system, providing relief to patients with autoimmune diseases, and central nervous system disorders. The apparently diverse conditions in which LDN appears to have a therapeutic effect are united by their ability to benefit from increased levels of endorphins (naturally occurring opioids - specifically OGF). It is non-addictive and produces no narcotic-like effects. Researchers believe that naltrexone modulates the release of inflammatory chemicals in the central nervous system. The drug temporarily binds to and blocks the Mu opioid receptors (MORs) which are central to pain control. When these receptors are blocked, the body responds by producing more pain-relieving endorphins. When used for the management of addiction, the typical daily dosage of naltrexone is 50-100 mg per day. For chronic pain relief, the dosage is typically less than 8 mg per day. Patients may start off with a dose as low as .01 mg. A more typical starting dose is 1.5 - 2.25 mg. According to a 2020 review, \"Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has shown promise to reduce symptoms related to chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel conditions, and multiple sclerosis.\" When it comes to treating some patients with complex chronic pain, low-dose naltrexone appears to be more effective and well-tolerated than the big-name opioids that dominated pain management for decades. In this article Dr. Bruce Vroorman, associate professor at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and the author of the above-mentioned 2018 review, is interviewed.

People call post-COVID conditions by many names, including: long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), long-term effects of COVID, and chronic COVID. People with post-COVID conditions can have a wide range of symptoms that can last more than four weeks or even months after infection. People with post-COVID conditions may develop or continue to have symptoms that are hard to explain and manage. At MediPro our team can assess and determine the best options for you to recover. Our strategy is to reduce neural and systemic inflammation, enhance [mitochondrial production](https://gp-assets-1.growthplug.com/website_files/3827/Mitochondrial_Dysfunction_and_Chronic_Di.pdf) and modulate the vagal nerve.

VieLight NeuroDuo The loss of brain cells from brain injuries is a well-documented phenomenon. In moderate to severe cases of brain injuries, the generalized loss could amount to 5% of brain cells per year. These are cells that include those in the areas of the brain that affect cognition and memory functions. In a recent study, a professional hockey player, with multiple concussions and generalized loss or atrophy of the brain cells, was observed. These deficiencies were the results of injuries received during his hockey career. Professor Linda Chao of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) was the lead investigator in the study. The subject was treated with two Vielight transcranial-intranasal devices \u2014 the Neuro Gamma, followed by the Neuro Alpha, over a period of eight weeks. The results of this study showed improvements in learning, memory, executive functions, attention, and mental processing speed. This is a very significant finding because, for the first time ever, a study was able to show measurable growth of gray matter due to transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM), in some important areas of the brain, in a human. The growth was present in the hippocampus and thalamic areas. The study provides significant evidence that PBM helps the brain to repair itself! Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure the growth of neurons. In addition to growth and repair of damage in the brain cells, the brain was observed to perform more efficiently. The study was published in the September issue of Frontiers in Neurology.

The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve in the body, with branching nerves that go to the heart, lungs, stomach, and many other organs. It is for reporting information to the brain and transmitting instructions back to the body. Think of the vagus nerve as the nervous systems \"super-highway\", sending important communication back and forth between your brain and parts of the body. The vagus nerve modulates systemic inflammation having an effect on the autonomic, enteric (Gut-Brain Axis) and peripheral nervous systems. Because of this broad influence it is useful to treat in many conditions including central pain, headache disorders, inflammatory conditions, gastrointestinal disorders and less defined conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and [Long-Covid](https://www.gammacore.com/covid-19/) To find out more about the healthcare services we offer at MediPro Pain & Performance, Beaverton, OR, call (503) 828-9265 or schedule an online consultation.
