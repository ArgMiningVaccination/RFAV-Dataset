Vicki McWilliam Peanut and tree nut allergies are the most common ly reported trigger of food induced anaphylaxis and fatalities . Whilst most childhood allergies are outgrown by school age, peanut and tree nut allergy resolution has been reported to be as low as 10%. Despite the potential severity and lifelong nature of both peanut and tree nut allergy much of the literature to date has focused on peanut allergy epidemiology, and tree nut allergy prevalence, natural history while adverse events have been under studied. There is very limited data on the prevalence of allergies to the individual tree nuts nor the factors related to development of tree nut allergy. Therefore, this thesis explores several key areas regarding tree nut allergy including the prevalence, elements of the natural history and development of tree nut allergy, as well as the frequency of adverse food reactions to tree nuts. This PhD has utilised data from the population-based HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies and the Royal Children 's Hospital allergy clinic populations all based in Melbourne, Australia. In a systematic review I published, I found limited tree nut allergy prevalence estimates based on challenge-confirmed outcomes with current estimates less than 2%, while probable tree nut allergy prevalence ranged from 0.05 to 4.9% . Prevalence of individual tree nut allergies varied significantly by region with hazelnut the most common tree nut allergy in Europe, walnut and cashew in the USA and Brazil nut, almond and walnut most commonly reported in the UK. There was no challenge-confirmed Australian tree nut allergy data. Among 6 year old children in the HealthNuts study , 3.3% had challenge confirmed tree nut allergy and 2.6 % of 10 to 14 year olds self-reported one or more tree nut allergies in the SchoolNuts study. Cashew was the most common tree nut allergy both at 6 and 10 to 14 years of age. Among those with peanut or egg allergy at 12 months of age in the HealthNuts study, sensitisation rates to tree nut were as high as 48%, with 39% of those tree nut sensitised at 12 months tree nut allergic at 6 years of age. Confirming other reports of adverse food reactions, the work conducted as part of this PhD has found peanut and tree nut the most common triggers of adverse food reactions in the pas t year for children aged 10 to 14 years, with cashew the most common individual tree nut trigger reported. Finally, a cashew SPT wheal size of 10mm was found to have 95% PPV to challenge confirmed cashew allergy using the population based HealthNuts and SchoolNuts cohorts. In summary, the results presented in this thesis have reported the first challenge confirmed tree nut allergy prevalence rates in Australia and have highlighted one of the highest reported tree nut allergy rates in the world to date, with cashew the most common tree nut allergy. With up to half of those with food allergies already sensitised to tree nuts as early as one year of age, improved methods for identifying and targeting children at highest risk of tree nut allergy along with development of early prevention strategies are desperately needed, with cashew allergy a priority tree nut in Australia.

Signed: Date: v vii Preface This thesis is based primarily on data collected by the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies. The HealthNuts study was developed and conducted by Professor Katie Allen (Principal Investigator) in collaboration with Professor Shyamali Dharmage, Associate Professor Lyle Gurrin, Dr. Nicholas Osborne, Professor Melissa Wake, Professor Mimi Tang, Professor Anne- Louise Ponsonby, Dr Melanie Matheson, Dr Adrian Lowe and Dr David Hill. Waves 1, 2 and 3 of the HealthNuts study, including recruitment, clinical assessment and some data cleaning was completed by the HealthNuts study team and past PhD students prior to the commencement of this PhD. I contributed to data entry and data cleaning of wave 3 data as well as all of the data analysis that was included in this thesis. The SchoolNuts study was also developed and conducted by Professor Katie Allen (Principal Investigator) in collaboration with Professor Shyamali Dharmage, Associate Professor Lyle Gurrin, Professor Susan Sawyer, Professor George Patton, Professor Jo Douglass, Associate Professor Peter Vuillermin and Dr Jennifer Koplin. I participated in some of the recruitment school visits, data entry and cleaning and the data analysis included in this thesis. This thesis contains four publications of which I am primary author, conducted the data analysis, wrote the first draft of the manuscript, responded to peer review and contributed more than 50% of the work. The systematic review of tree nut allergy prevalence, presented in Chapter 4, was planned together with Katie Allen, Shyamali Dharmage, and Jennifer Koplin. Caroline Lodge and Shyamali Dharmage provided methodological and statistical support for the analysis of the data. All named co-authors contributed to interpretation of the results and provided intellectual input on drafts of the manuscript and response to peer review. The publication on self-reported adverse food reactions and anaphylaxis, presented in Chapter 5, was planned together with Katie Allen, Jennifer Koplin and the SchoolNuts Investigators. Shyamali Dharmage and Jennifer Koplin provided statistical support for the analysis of the data. All named co-authors contributed to interpretation of the results and provided intellectual input on drafts of the manuscript and response to peer review. The publication on the prevalence and development of tree nut allergy, presented in Chapter 6, was planned together with Katie Allen and Jennifer Koplin. Jennifer Koplin, Shyamali Dharmage and Ann-Louise Ponsonby provided statistical support for the analysis of the data. All named co-authors contributed to interpretation of the results and provided intellectual input on drafts of the manuscript and response to peer review. The final publication on cashew oral food challenge outcomes and positive predictive values for cashew SPT, presented in Chapter 7, was planned together with Katie Allen, Jennifer Koplin and Rachel Peters. Data from HealthNuts and SchoolNuts was combined with data from two allergy clinics -The Royal Children's Hospital and Melbourne Allergy and Children's Centre (MACCS). Use of the RCH data required an ethics application which was prepared by myself with input from all named authors. All RCH and MACCS data was collected and analysed by myself. Lyle Gurrin and Rachel Peters provided statistical support for the analysis of the data. All named co-authors contributed to interpretation of the results and provided intellectual input on drafts of the manuscript which has recently been submitted for publication. My PhD was funded by a scholarship from the Centre for Food and Allergy Research (CFAR) a National Health and Medical Research funded Centre for Excellence. I also received a Royal Children's Hospital travelling scholarship to present my research at an international conference. Over the course of my PhD I have been involved in ten additional papers as a co-author. I have also participated in two Centre for Food and Allergy Research Summits and been involved in the write up and publication of proceedings. Details of all co-authored manuscripts published over the course of my PhD are listed under the other co-authored publications in the Publications and Presentations section. Finally, I acted as a peer reviewer for several journals including Clinical and Experimental Allergy, Paediatric Allergy and Immunology and the Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics. ix Acknowledgements My PhD journey has been a long one intertwined with my ongoing clinical work as a food allergy dietitian and all the personal roles we collect along the way (wife, Mum, friend, sister, daughter etc, etc). I have been privileged to have an extremely experienced group of PhD supervisors and I would like to take this opportunity to thank, Professor Katie Allen, Dr Jennifer Koplin, Professor Mimi Tang, Professor Shyamali Dharmage and Dr Kirsten Perrett for their guidance and support over the past 5 years. Their collective experience in food allergy, epidemiology, statistics and conducting and publishing research has provided me with an amazing foundation on many aspects of research. I would particularly like to thank my primary supervisor Katie as without her initial support and encouragement that I could work a PhD into my life this would not have started. She is one inspirational person with extensive expertise and an enviable drive and passion for clinical allergy and research. I would also like to thank Jennifer Koplin who has walked me through all aspects of statistical analysis and scientific writing her advice, guidance and patience are an asset to the research group and wer e invaluable throughout my PhD. I would like to thank Shyamali for the scientific rigour she has taught me regarding the application of epidemiological concepts and publishing research and Mimi for her clinical and research expertise. I would also like to thank Harriet Hiscock for her guidance and support as Advisory panel chair and my colleague and fellow dietitian Heather Gilbertson as an advisory panel member. I would like to thank the study participants and families of the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies for their time and participation and the various funding bodies that made these studies possible: the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the Ilhan Food Allergy Foundation, the Centre for Food and Allergy Research, The University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. I would also like to formally acknowledge and thank the NHMRC funded Centre for Food and Allergy research for my PhD scholarship funding and scientific oversight of my PhD. I also thank the Gastro and Food Allergy Research group members at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute not only for your commitment and dedication to your work but for embracing and supporting me as a PhD student within your group. Similarly my colleagues in the departments of Allergy & Immunology and Nutrition & Food Services at the Royal Children's Hospital who have either directly participated in my research, co-authored papers or just kept checking in on how things were tracking. Finally and most significantly I would also like to thank my family, my husband Steve and my children Tom and April. I know it has been hard when I have been working long hours on something or was away at conferences but your patience and love has been noted and so appreciated. I am blessed with a great family and awesome friends who may not have got this but they have come along for the ride and supported me all the way. xi Summary of Publications and Presentations First author publications 1.McWilliam VL , Peters KJ.

Cow's milk and egg are reported as the most common IgE-mediated food allergies in children, however the prognosis is good with resolution expected for the majority of children by school age. Peanut and tree nut allergies on the other hand tend to be lifelong and are the cause of most food related anaphylaxis and deaths.5 Tree nut is the collective term used to describe an edible range of seeds and fruits that predominantly grow on trees. Tree nuts most likely to result in IgE-mediated food allergy reactions are almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio and walnut. Contrary to popular belief peanuts are not tree nuts and are in fact a groundnut and classified as a legume however, although botanically unrelated, tree nut and peanut allergies share many clinical similarities and are also reported to commonly co-exist. Despite the potential severity of both peanut and tree nut allergy much of the literature to date has focused on peanut allergy epidemiology while tree nut allergy prevalence, natural history and adverse events have been under reported. There is very limited data on the prevalence of allergies to the individual tree nuts. This may be due to the fact that historically, patients diagnosed with peanut and/or tree nut allergies were advised to avoid all nuts. This stemmed from clinical assumptions regarding taxonomy, that tree nuts from similar families would have similar allergic capabilities and the high level of cross reactivity that had been established between peanuts and tree nuts 6. The clinical dilemma is that these cross reactivity relationships do not always result in co-sensitisation on allergy testing or actual allergic reactions. Practical considerations also impacted advice to avoid all nuts. These considerations include potential difficulty for patients to distinguish one nut from another,7,8 the potential cross contamination of nuts in food processing and the often lengthy and time consuming process of having to perform individual nut food challenges. However, clinical practice is now evolving with prevention strategies for food allergy around delaying the introduction of common allergens failing to show a benefit. Further a recent systematic review and meta-analysis summarising results of RCTs exploring timing of introduction of allergenic solids and food allergy outcomes supports the protective effect of earlier introduction of common allergenic foods9. Additionally, tree nuts have become an increasingly common part of our diet and there is increasing acknowledgement of the cardiovascular health benefits of consuming nuts.10-12 The culmination of this is clinical management of peanut and tree nut allergy is evolving and we can no longer base our assumptions of tree nut allergy on what we know of peanut allergy. This thesis aims to explore the prevalence, elements of the natural history and development of tree nut allergy and the frequency of adverse food reactions related to tree nuts in the population-based HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies and the Royal Children 's Hospital allergy clinic populations. This thesis has the following objectives. 1.2 Objectives Tree nut allergy prevalence 1.What is the worldwide prevalence of tree nut allergy? 2.Does tree nut allergy prevalence vary by region? 3.What are the most common individual tree nut allergies around the world? In the HealthNuts study: 4.What is the prevalence of tree nut allergy in Australian children aged 1 and 6 years of age? a)What is the prevalence of parent-reported tree nut allergy at age 1 year? b)What is the prevalence of challenge-confirmed tree nut allergy at age 6 years? c)What are the most common individual tree nut allergies in children at age 6 years?Chapter 1 - Introduction 3 Tree nut allergy adverse events In the SchoolNuts study: 1. Do food allergic sufferers have more reactions or more severe reactions when peanut or tree nut allergic versus other food allergies? a)What is the prevalence of self-reported adverse reactions for peanut, tree nut and other foods in 10 to 14 year old allergic children? b)What is the prevalence of self-reported anaphylaxis for peanut, tree nut and other foods in 10 to 14 year old allergic children? c)What factors are associated with adverse food allergy reactions and anaphylaxis in 10 to 14 year old allergic children? Develop ment of tree nut allergy In the HealthNuts study: 1.What proportion of those with challenge-confirmed food allergy at age one year are tree nut sensitised? 2.What is the relationship between tree nut sensitisation at age one year and tree nut allergy at age 6 years? 3.What is the relationship between food allergy type at age one year and development of tree nut allergy at age 6 years? 4.What is the frequency of co-allergy to peanut and other nuts at age 6 years? Cashew nut oral food challenge outcomes 1.What are the SPT wheal sizes that correlate with a 95% positive predicative value (PPV) of a positive oral food challenge for cashew 2.Do these thresholds differ when stratified by allergy clinic or general population cohorts? 3.Do cashew SPT thresholds differ when stratified by known risk factors including co- existing peanut allergy, coexisting other food allergies, coexisting atopy, previous reaction history, age and gender. LITERATURE REVIEW This chapter firstly provides a broad overview of food allergy diagnosis, treatment and risk factors and then secondly outlines the background literature specific to the research questions addressed in this thesis regarding tree nut allergy prevalence, natural history and adverse events. 2.1 Food Allergy Overview Food allergy is common, affecting up to 10% of children and 2-3% of adults, and appears to be increasing in prevalence.2-4,13 Food allergy is characterized by an adverse reaction to food proteins, mediated by immunological mechanisms.14 Symptoms occur quickly and can include multiple body systems. Food allergies can occur to any food, however in children 90% of all reactions are due to one of eight foods: cow's mil k, egg, wheat, soy, seafood, fish, peanuts and tree nuts.5 Food allergies are generally divided into two types - immediate (Immuno-globulin E or IgE- mediated) and delayed (non IgE-mediated). IgE-mediated reactions are more common and can be life threatening (Figure 2.1). Cow's milk an d egg are reported as the most common IgE-mediated food allergies in infants and young children, however the prognosis is good with resolution expected for the majority of children by school age.15 Peanut and tree nut allergies on the other hand tend to be lifelong and are the cause of most food related anaphylaxis and deaths.16 5Chapter 2 - Literature Review Figure 2.1. Classification of adverse react ions to foods Sourced with permission from Turnbull JL , et al. Review article: the diagnosis and management of food allergy and food intolerances. Alimentary Pharmacology & action/symptoms The gastrointestinal mucosa is the principal site for the immune systems ' interaction with any ingested substances and consists of a single layer of columnar epithelium. The enteric immune system has the important task of policing the mucosal boundary distinguishing necessary and harmless food proteins and commensal enteric microbiota from potentially harmful pathogens.14 This process is known as oral tolerance and to date the precise mechanisms of oral tolerance are not fully understood.18 IgE-mediated allergic reactions occur when there is a breakdown of oral tolerance mechanisms and the mucosal immune system responds inappropriately to ingested food proteins. Absorption of food proteins through the intestinal epithelium and access to the mucosa and blood stream where immune effector cells reside is thought to be one step in the breakdown of oral tolerance mechanisms and is enhanced in those with food allergy.19 The allergic response is separated into two phases, the sensitisation phase and the effector phase. Sensitisation is the production of IgE-antibodies to usually harmless food antigens.20 The food protein is digested by the gastrointestinal tract where some proteins may enter the blood stream. Antigen-presenting cells present the circulating proteins to T cells stimulating the production of specific cytokines. T cells in turn interact with B cells and induce the production of food-specific IgE antibodies. These antibodies then circulate in the bloodstream and bind to receptors on mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract, skin and respiratory tract. The presence of food-specific IgE antibodies is called sensitisation. Sensitisation is a harmless process and a person can be sensitised with no clinical signs of food allergy on ingestion of the food proteins to which they are sensitised. The effector phase occurs at subsequent exposures where food antigens bind to IgE receptors on the surface of mast cells. This causes degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators and metabolites from the mast cells . These mediators and metabolites can act locally in the gastrointestinal tract or be distributed systemically resulting in a broad range of symptoms (Figure 2.2).14 It remains unknown how and where food sensitisation occurs, however several RCTs exploring introduction of food allergens for food allergy prevention have shown sensitisation to food allergens prior to any known ingestion in the infants diet21-23 suggesting exposure through breast milk or the placenta. An alternate suggestion is that dermal contact of food antigens can be a route of sensitisation.24 IgE-mediated reactions usually occur within minutes of ingestion (although they can occur up to 1-2 hours after exposure) and result in a range of symptoms that can involve the skin, gastrointestinal, resp iratory or cardiovascular systems.25 Gastrointestinal symptoms can include itching or tingling of the tongue and lips, tightness in the throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Cutaneous symptoms include urticarial lesions (hives), pruritus, angioedema and eczema flare. The most severe allergic reaction is anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. Anaphylaxis involves multiple body systems and symptoms may include wheeze, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock.17 The combination of symptoms used to define anaphylaxis vary slightly among key allergy bodies around the wo rld 26-29 (Table 1) . 7Chapter 2 - Literature Review Table 1.

Mechanism of IgE-mediated food allergy reactions and symptoms Sourced with permission from Renz H, Allen KJ, Sicherer SH, et al. Food allergy. Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2018;4:17098.14 Food Allergy Diagnosis Food allergy diagnosis is complex with no single diagnostic test providing a definitive diagnosis. Clinically, diagnosis is based on a stepped approach with the starting point a detailed medical history and physical examination which guides diagnostic testing for specific IgE levels. When necessary OFCs are used for confirmation. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges are recognised as the gold standard for clinical diagnosis.31however due to the time and labour-intensive nature of these tests, open food challenges are typically performed in the clinical setting . Figure 2.4 outlines the diagnosis of food allergy. Medical History Key aspects of the medical history that point to a reaction being IgE-mediated include the time interval between exposure and onset of symptoms, the type of symptoms experienced, duration of symptoms and the type of food32 (refer to page 7 for a description of IgE mediated food allergy symptoms) . Mild reactions, such as hives or skin rashes, can occur from touching foods. However, a contact reaction that is localised is no t diagnostic of a food allergy and an ingestion reaction is required to confirm allergy.25 Specific IgE testing In the presence of a history suggestive of a reaction, IgE testing can confirm that the adverse reaction is likely IgE-mediated through the detection of allergen-specific IgE either in the skin via skin prick testing (SPT) or blood (serum specific IgE, sIgE). IgE testing has limitations, firstly a positive result merely indicates the presence of IgE antibodies. Without a history of a reaction, IgE testing cannot distinguish between clinically allergic versus sensitised tolerant.31Negative results however, are valuable for excluding food allergy with greater than 95% certainty.33 Secondly, IgE levels can only be used to predict the likelihood of a reaction not the severity of a reaction. SPTS are generally performed in preference to sIgE in most tertiary paediatric allergy clinics in Australia as the results are immediately available. SPT involves introducing small amounts of allergen into the epidermis which interact with specific IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells.33 SPTs can be performed either with commercial extracts or with fresh foods. A positive result occurs within 15-20minutes when histamine and other mediators are released leaving a visible \"wheal\" reaction which is measured and results expressed as the mean diameter in millimetres (mm).A positive SPT is generally considered a wheal with a mean diameter of 3mm or greater than the negative control.30 Oral Food Challenge Oral food challenges (OFC) remain the most definitive diagnostic method for food allergy. They are performed by feeding the suspected allergen, in gradual increasing amounts, under medical supervision. OFC are usually performed to determine if a known food allergy has resolved or in the context of positive allergy testing and no known history of reaction or ingestion of the suspected allergen. An OFC can be performed as either an open challenge (both the clinician performing the challenge and the patient are aware of the challenge food), a single-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (the clinician is aware of when allergen or 11Chapter 2 - Literature Review placebo is being administered but not the patient) or the gold standard double-blind placebo- controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) (both clinician and patient are unaware of when the active or placebo challenge is performed). A DBPCFC removes measurement and reporting bias for the observer and the psychological effect from the patient. To date DBPCFC are only preformed in some allergy centres or limited to research purposes due to labour, time and cost constraints. There is huge variability among allergy centres and research studies regarding OFC protocols used and the symptoms that correlate with a positive food challenge. In 2008, a group of food allergy experts from Europe and the United States proposed a standard procedure for conducting DBPCFC with the aim of standardising the procedure for research purposes but this is also a useful framework applicable to open OFCs used in the clinical setting (Figure 2.3).34 Figure 2.3.

Current clinical diagnostic tools of sIgE testing cannot reliably determine those patients that are clinically allergic from those that are sensitised tolerant. Diagnosis is reliant on time intensive, costly and potential ly risky OFC. The application of 95% PPV cut-off values to current IgE testing and the use of invitro techniques such as component resolved diagnostics and basophil activation testing are all potential options for improvements in food allergy diagnosis and each will be discussed in further detail in the following sections. The diagnostic value of SPT for food allergy diagnosis The diagnostic value of a test is determined by comparing the test results to that of the gold standard. With regards to food allergy and the test studied in this thesis, the standard test is the SPT and the gold standard is the OFC. The diagnostic value of a test is typically determined based on the statistics described below and can be summarised using a two- by-two table (Table 2). Tabl e 2. Determining the diagnostic value of a test Gold Standard (Oral food Challenge) With Disease (Food allergic ) Without Disease (Tolerant/Not allergic) Test positive (SPT) True positive a False positive b PPV=a/(a+b) Test neg ative (SPT) False negative c True negative D NPV = d/(c+d) Sensitivity =a/(a+c) Specificity =d/(b+d) -specificify) Negative likelihood ratio= (1 -senstivity)/specificity Sensitivity : the ability of a diagnostic test (SPT) to correctly classify an individual as having a disease (allergic). Specificity : the ability of a diagnostic test (SPT) to correctly classify an individual as tolerant or not allergic. Likelihood Ratios : combines sensitivity and specificity and provide a summary of how many times more/or less likely patients with food allergy are to have a particular SPT than patients without food allergy. Positive predictive value (PPV): the percentage of patients with a positive SPT who are actually allergic. The higher the percentage the closer the test (SPT) is to the gold standard test (OFC). Negative predictive value (NPV): the percentage of patients with a negative SPT who are not allergic. The higher the percentage the closer the test (SPT) is to the gold standard test (OFC). To estimate sensitivity and specificity, each individual needs to be classified definitively via a gold standard test (OFC) as a true positive (allergic) or true negative (tolerant/not allergic) and, in addition, be classified according to the test being assessed (SPT). SPT has high sensitivity, but low specificity to clinical food allergy. This means that while SPT is accurate in identifying allergen-specific IgE, which will be present in all individuals with IgE-mediated food allergy, detectable SPT does not necessarily equate to clinical food allergy, as some children are sensitised yet able to tolerate the food.31 Negative results however, are valuable for excluding food allergy with greater than 95% certainty.33 Sensitivity and specificity describe the quality of the test, they do not describe an individual patient's risk of the outcome and therefore have limited clinical usefulness. To interpret the results of an SPT a clinician will want to know the probability that a patient is truly allergic if the test is positive (positive predictive value) and similarly the probability that the patient is truly tolerant if the test is negative (negative predictive value). As SPT results are quantitative and the magnitude of the test is correlated to the risk of clinical reaction,31 diagnostic cut-offs (SPT wheal size) that have 95% positive predictive value to clinical food allergy can be determined and have been reported for some common food allergens.36-47 These values vary for different allergens and across different studies however, 95% PPVs have been adopted as a tool for clinicians to more accurately determine when an OFC should be performed. In general terms a SPT wheal of 8mm is commonly used as the 95%PPV for clinical food allergy. There are however several methodological considerations that will impact the pre-test probability of food allergy and therefore the reliability of PPVs such as age, food allergy definition, SPT method and the population SPTs are performed on hence the variability in figures reported.48 A common limitation of allergy studies is they recruit participants from high-risk settings such as children attending tertiary allergy clinics, as it is an easy and feasible means to recruit a large sample of cases. However, children recruited from one clinic setting may not be generalisable to another clinic and allergy clinic cohorts will have higher allergy prevalence than those of community based settings. Secondly, food allergy research can include variable definitions of food allergy. Relatively few studies are based on the gold standard OFC due to cost or impracticalities. Studies instead may rely on suggestive clinical history, SPT or sIgE levels or self-reporting. These measures are known to overestimate the prevalence of food 15Chapter 2 - Literature Review allergy, and in turn may bias the association between predictors and food allergy.2,4 In particular, SPT or sIgE thresholds used as a proxy for food allergy diagnosis in studies assessing the predictive value of these tests, significantly limits the value of these studies and overestimates the PPV.49 Although SPT wheal thresholds with high predictably have been reported for several common food allergens these values should not be applied to populations where there are differences in population characteristics, allergy prevalence, allergy definitions and SPT methods from the population in the published study.50 To overcome the methodological limitations of predictive values, likelihood r atios (LR) can be used as the y are independent of disease prevalence . Likelihood ratios provide a summary of how many times more (or less) likely patients with a disease are to have a particular result than patients without the disease .49 However, t he calculation and application of li kelihood ratios is complex and this has limited the use in clinical practice. It requires clinicians determining a pre-test (SPT) probability of their patient having food allergy based on clinical history and risk factors. The SPT result is then used to mo dify the pre- test probability of having food allergy. A positive SPT may increase the pre -test probability and a negative test may reduce the pre -test probability. The patient's probability of allergy after SPT is the post -test probability. To utilise like lihood ratios in clinical practice a graphical tool known as a Fagan's nomogram is needed which allows the pre -test probability in conjunction with the LR, to determine the patient's' post -test probability i.e. their probability of being clinically allergi c.49,51 It has been proposed that likelihood ratios should be the test applied to determine the probability of allergic disease,49 however PPVs remain more commonly used in clinical practice. It has been previously reported that PPVs for sIgE derived from clinic populations cannot be meaningfully applied to general populations. To date this has not been explored for SPT.52 A compromise may be the estimation of PPVs in population-based settings, utilising OFC outcomes, therefore a ddressing the impact of selection bias and allergy definition on prevalence estimates and PPVs reported in previous research. Component Resolved Diagnostics Routine SPT and sIgE rely on crude food extracts and do not differentiate which particular proteins w ithin a food are interacting with a patient's IgE antibody and driving the allergic response. Advances in protein purification and molecular biology techniques have led to an improved understanding of which particular proteins are more strongly associated with clinical reactivity. Component resolved diagnostic tests (CRD) determine the individual allergen to which a patient's IgE is directed. Whilst 100% efficacy has not been demonstrated for CRD and the gold standard for allergy diagnosis remains an OFC, a number of studies have demonstrated that CRD may improve the specificity of allergy testing to a variety of food allergens with peanut allergy the most extensively studied to date.53 There are at least ten known sub-components of the peanut allergen with Ara h 2 the predominant allergen.54,55 For patients with SPT and/or sIgE levels that indicate a likelihood of allergy resolution, Ara h 2 levels can be measured to further inform the decision whether to proceed to an OFC. Dang et al reported Ara h 2 sIgE levels were more accurate in determining peanut allergy compared to whole peanut sIgE levels. An Ara h 2 s IgE level of 0.46 kU A/l provided 95 % specificity and 73 % sensitivity, whereas a peanut sIgE level of 6.2 kU A/l provided 95 % specificity, but only 44 % sensitivity. When using a peanut sIgE level of 15 kU A/l, providing a 95% PPV and 98 % specificity, the sensitivity of the peanut sIgE drops to 26 %. An Ara h 2 level of 1.19 kU A/l was also found to provide 98% specificity, but offered a much better sensitivity of 60%. Given the improved accuracy found in the Ara h 2 sIgE diagnostic testing, they concluded that this test should be considered the preferred diagnostic tool for determining peanut allergy.56 Whilst CRD is a very significant development in food allergy research and management and has the potential to help determine those individuals who have a higher likelihood of severe reactions, multiple food allergies or more persistent food allergies it is not yet an alternative to existing methods of allergy testing, as it not as sensitive, not widely available, and investegations of component testing for a number of major food allergens (including tree nuts) are lacking. The application of CRD for tree nut allergy is discussed further in section 2.2.7. Basophil Activation Testing (BAT) A second invitro technique has also been explored for food allergy diagnosis known as the basophil activation test (BAT). Basophils are the mast cells involved in acute allergic reactions. The BAT is a flow cytometry-based assay where the expression of activation markers is measured on the surface of basophils following simulation with an allergen.57 The performance of BAT as a measure of food allergy has been tested most extensively for peanut allergy to date58-62 and has shown high specificity (96%) and 95% positive predictive value59. The advantages of BAT are that it can be used for patient not suitable for SPT due to with extensive eczema or recent antihistamine medication and it has a reported high safety profile.63The 17Chapter 2 - Literature Review downsides are the need for fresh blood and the cost of resources a nd technical expertise to perform.57 The diagnostic accuracy and superiority over SPT and sIgE needs to be assessed with other allergens and in a wider range of clinical settings but again is another significant development in food allergy research and management. For now the diagnosis of food allergy is limited to specific IgE and SPT based on crude food extracts with OFC to confirm diagnosis for those that are sensitised. Further research is required to improve our understanding of the application of additional invitro tests such as CRD and BAT for food allergy diagnosis. Food Allergy Treatment To date, treatment options for food allergy remain limited and primarily involve allergen avoidance and administration of medical treatment in the event of an accidental exposure, such as antihistamines and adrenaline.64 On receiving a diagnosis of food allergy, parents or guardians should receive comprehensive advice on allergen avoidance, interpretation of food allergen labelling and identification of potential sources of cross- contamination. Advice regarding adequate replacement of excluded foods to ensure nutritional adequacy of the diet is also important as poor growth and nutritional deficiencies in children with food allergies, particularly multiple food allergies has been well documented.65-74 Therefore, parents and guardians should receive appropriate education and for those with multiple food allergies in particular, referral for management by a dietician.73 Clinical trials are underway exploring new therapeutic treatments for food allergy with most o f the work focusing on systemic, epicutaneous, subcutaneous, sublingual and oral immunotherapy (OIT) . Immunotherapy is a process by which desensitisation to the allergen and development of oral tolerance is sought through continuous low-dose exposure to the allergen. All forms of immunotherapy have been shown to improve a patient's reaction threshold and/or achieve desensitisation in the context of ongoing ingestion of the allergen however, the challenge is achieving true oral tolerance (sustained unresponsiveness) . That is, an ability to not react to the allergen even after periods of not being exposed.75,76The downsides of all forms of immunotherapy for food allergy to date are the intensive treatment regimens and particularly for OIT the high frequency of significant allergic reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms reported.64 The balance of allergic side effects and the need for ongoing ingestion of the allergen versus the protection from severe reactions will be an individual decision for each patient and his or her family. Further work is required to evaluate long term effectiveness and safety before immunotherapy for food allergy is available for clinical application. Risk factors for development of food allergy Over the past decade, the risk factors for developing food allergy have become better understood. Factors both intrinsic to the individual and related to environmental exposures appear to influence the development of allergy and current evidence suggests that the risk is multifactorial. Evidence currently centres around three main hypotheses: 1. the vitamin D hypothesis; 2. the hygiene hypothesis; and 3.the dual-allergen exposure hypothesis. 1.The v itamin D hypothesis Ecological and epidemiological evidence suggest a potential link between low vitamin D and allergy risk.77 A strong latitude and food allergy association has been observed with regions further from the equator, a proxy for low vitamin D levels, reporting higher rates of food allergy, adrenalin-auto injector prescriptions and hospital admissions for food-related anaphylaxis.78-85Season of birth (eg winter), another proxy for vitamin D exposure has also been associated with increased risk of eczema, food allergy and adrenalin auto-injector prescriptions.86-89 Indirect evidence studies reporting on vitamin D levels and the risk of allergies have produced conflicting results. The Australian HealthNuts study, provided the first evidence that vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk of food allergy, reporting that vitamin D insufficiency (<50nmol) in the first year of life increased the risk of challenge confirmed peanut allergy at age 1 year by 11-fold (aOR 11.51; among those infants with Australian-born parents.90 In contrast, a smaller case-control study also in Australia did not find an association between Vitamin D insufficiency and food allergy.91While a cross-sectional study in New Zealand 19Chapter 2 - Literature Review reported a 2-fold increased risk of parent-reported, doctor-diagnosed food allergy in pre- school aged children with vitamin D levels >75nmol/l, compared to those with levels between 50-74nmol.92 This observation has led to the suggestion of a U-shaped association, that is, an increased risk in individuals with both low and high levels of vitamin D.93 The underlying mechanisms of vitamin D and food allergy development are not yet understood, largely due to limited studies collecting well defined clinical measures of food allergy, along with serum vitamin D measures and detailed immunological responses. There is however some evidence to suggest that vitamin D is important in several immune functions, particularly in the development of effector T cell subsets.94Work from the HealthNuts study has revealed that immune responses associated with the development of oral tolerance to foods in childhood positively correlated with increased serum vitamin D supplementation.95 There are RCTs addressing supplementation in pregnancy and lactation on allergic outcomes96- 99 and one study underway in infants, the VITALITY stu dy.100However, to date there is a lack of direct evidence to guide recommendations regarding vitamin D supplementation for food allergy prevention. Interestingly there has been recent work published that suggests that direct UV exposure appears more beneficial than vitamin D supplementation in early infancy but this also requires further research.101 2.The hygiene hypothesis The hygiene hypothesis proposes that a lack of exposure to microbes and infections in childhood increases susceptibility to allergic disease via modulation of the developing immune system.102,103 Observational studies have shown that factors associated with increased microbial exposure, such as exposure to pets104 or farming environments105-108, the presence of older siblings or communal childcare attendance103,104,107 and mode of delivery109 may have protective effects on the development of food allergy. These assumptions are further supported by studies showing significant differences in the gut microbiota profiles between allergic and non-allergic infants and children.110-112 However data directly characterising the microbiota of patients with food allergy are still preliminary. At this time there is no direct evidence to support the use of specific nutritional or dietary factors to manipulate the gut microbiome and immune system to prevent or treat food allergy at this time.111A summary of microbial factors and risk of food allergy are summarised in Figure 2.5. Figure 2.5. Environmental and lifestyle factors related to microbial exposure and their effect on the risk of developing food allergy Sourced with permission from Aitoro R, Paparo L, Amoroso A, et al. Gut Microbiota as a Target for Preventive and Therapeutic Intervention against Food Allergy. Nutrients. 2017 ; 9(7).113 3.The dual-allergen exposure hypothesis The dual-allergen exposure hypothesis proposes that sensitisation to food allergens may occur through low-dose cutaneous exposure in infants with altered skin barrier function, such as eczema. It is hypothesised that oral tolerance development is dependent on initial exposure of food antigens via the gastrointestinal tract and with eczema food antigens instead bypass the oral route and penetrate the disrupted skin barrier and are taken up by Langerhans cells, stimulating a TH2 response and the production of antigen-specific IgE antibodies and the development of food allergy.114 Therefore, development of food allergy depends on the timing and balance between cutaneous and oral exposure. Observational and randomised controlled trials have shown that the early introduction of allergenic foods into an infant's diet is associated with the reduced risk of food allergy, demonstrating that this is an important step in inducing oral tolerance.22,115,116 Timing of solids 21Chapter 2 - Literature Review as well as prevention of eczema are central to this theory with studies also exploring the prophylactic use of emollients for the prevention of eczema and allergic sensitisation. Early studies have shown that emollient treatment is associated with a trend towards reduced incidence of eczema and food sensitisation.117-119 2.2 Tree Nut Allergy Tree nut and peanut allergies share many clinical similarities in the severity of reactions and their lifelong nature and are also reported to commonly co-exist.120However, despite the potential severity of both peanut and tree nut allergy much of the literature to date has focused on peanut allergy epidemiology while tree nut allergy prevalence, natural history and adverse events have been under reported. There is very limited data on the prevalence of allergies to the individual tree nuts and factors related to the development of tree nut allergy. The paucity of studies of tree nut allergy are likely due to the fact that previous allergy management advice for patients diagnosed with peanut and/or a single tree nut allergy was to avoid all nuts regardless of whether they were clinically allergic. This stemmed from assumptions regarding taxonomy, that tree nuts from similar families would have similar allergic capabilities and the high level of cross reactivity 6reported between peanuts and tree nuts. The clinical dilemma is that these cross reactivity relationships do not always result in co- sensitisation on allergy testing or actual allergic reactions. Practical considerations also impacted advice to avoid all nuts. These considerations included potential difficulty for patients to distinguish one nut from another,7,8 the potential cross contamination of nuts in food processing and the often lengthy and time consuming process of having to perform individual nut food challenges. It was also hypothesised that progression to further nut allergies could be prevented through blanket nut avoidance.121 However, there has been a paradigm shift in clinical practice with prevention strategies for food allergy around delaying the introduction of common allergens failing to show a benefit and observational studies30,116,122 and a recent randomised controlled trial looking at the timing of introduction of peanut in high risk infants demonstrating that earlier introduction is protective.22 Additionally, tree nuts have become an increasingly common part of our diet and there is increasing acknowledgement of the cardiovascular health benefits of consuming nuts.10 It is also postulated that inclusion in the diet of non-allergic nuts improves the quality of life of those with nut allergies through less restrictive dietary avoidance.123-125The culmination of this is clinical management of peanut and tree nut allergy is evolving and we can no longer base our assumptions of tree nut allergy on what we know of peanut allergy. What is tree nut allergy? To date , there is no standardised definition of what constitutes a nut. According to the botanical definition, nuts are a particular type of fruit, however, in culinary terms the term is used more broadly to include a ny large, oily kernels found within a shell and used in food .126 The culinary nuts m ost likely to res ult in IgE -mediated allergic reactions are peanut and what is collectively referred to as tree nuts. Botanically peanuts are a legume, however we consume them like a nut. What constitutes a tree nut ho wever, varies from country to country. For labelling purposes, pinenuts are considered a seed in Europe, but as a nut in North America. In the U.S. several additional foods are considered tree nuts including beechnut, butternut, chestnut, chinquapin, coconut, nut .126In Australia , the most common definition of tree nut and that adopted by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) includes the culinary nuts: almond, This is the tree nut definition that will be used throughout this thesis . Tree nut allerg enic proteins Tree nuts have two major types of proteins, metabolic and storage proteins.128To date, 38 of these tree nut proteins have been shown to be reactive with IgE from allergic patients.55 The seed storage proteins are the allergens associated with many cases of severe, anaphylactic tree nut allergies and include the prolamin superfamily (the 2S albumins) and the cupin seed and 11s129 Other allergens known as the pan-allergens are similar to proteins in pollens, seeds, fruits and vegetables and are associated with IgE-mediated cross reactivity and include pathogenesis related proteins, PR-10 and the non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTP).130 A final group of recently identified allergens are the oleosins, which stabilise oil bodies in the seed. Among the tree nuts, oleosin has only been identified as an allergen in hazelnut.131,132A summary of the tree nut proteins identified to date is outline in Table 2. Considerable research has gone into determining the biochemical and immunological characteristics of identified tree nut proteins. This has led to improved understanding of which 23Chapter 2 - Literature Review particular proteins are most strongly associated with clinical reactivity. Knowing which particular proteins are reacting with IgE may prove to be of diagnostic use in identifying those patients who have more severe and/or persistent food allergies. It has also allowed for greater understanding of the cross reactivity relationships between various nut proteins, with other food and inhaled allergens and analysis of effects such as processing, denaturation and the food matrix on allergenici ty.129 Types of allergic reactions to tree nuts There are two types of allergic reactions that can occur to tree nut proteins. Firstly the more immediate and severe IgE-mediated allergic reactions and secondly a milder form of IgE- mediated reaction known as oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen food syndrome (PFS). OAS/PFS is a type of food allergy where botanical plant family relationships and cross reactivity relationships are important and translate into clinical allergic reactions.133OAS/PFS occurs mainly in adolescents and adults with allergic rhinitis who are sensitised to particular inhalant allergens such as pollen, particularly birch pollen (Bet v1).134Foods within the same botanical family as the inhalant allergen can cross-react resulting in a localised oral allergic response. Symptoms consist of itching, burning, tingling and sometimes angioedema of the lips, tongue, roof of the mouth and throat. Cross-reactivity was once thought to be limited to the heat and gastric-labile PR-10 proteins within fruits, vegetables and nuts and explained the absence of gastrointestinal or systemic reactions and individuals being able to tolerate cooked forms of the foods. Labile profilins, or relatively heat stable lipid transfer proteins, have now been found to be cross-reactive and it is reported that 8.7% of OAS/PFS patients may experience co- existing gastrointestinal symptoms and 1.7% systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis.135 OAS/PFS is more prevalent in countries and regions where birch trees are commonly present, such as northern Europe, where up to 40% of patients with pollen allergy are said to be affected.135 Australian reports of OAS/PFS are limited but range from 5-23%.136,137 OAS/PFS reactions to tree nut will not be explored as part of this thesis.

Determining tree nut allergy prevalence at a population level can be complex. As described previously the definition of a tree nut can vary with regional variations common. Some studies include peanut and tree nuts together as \"nuts\", while other studies only include one or two tree nuts. Few studies investigate allergy to all eight common individual tree nuts. Secondly, as discussed in section 2.2.3 allergic reactions to tree nuts can result from primary IgE-mediated mechanisms or alternatively, via secondary cross reactivity mechanisms to birch pollen known as Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS) or Pollen-Food-Syndrome (PFS). Finally, the method of tree nut allergy diagnosis may vary from self-reported methods such as surveys and questionnaires (which have been found to overestimate the true prevalence of food allergy)139,IgE testing (which are limited to IgE-mediated food allergy and are indicative of sensitisation not clinical allergy), to the most objective but time consuming and cumbersome methods of OFC and double-blind- placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC). One previous systematic review of studies published between 1990-2006 by Zuidmeer et al, reported the prevalence of perceived reactions to tree nut as ranging between 0-7.3%. However, most studies included in this review (n=27 of 36) were based in Europe where the prevalence of OAS/PFS is high, and few studies used objective definitions of tree nut allergy such as challenge confirmed outcomes.140 A more recent systematic review by Nwaru and colleagues reported a pooled prevalence estimate of tree nut allergy of 0.5% (95%CI 0.08-0.8) but was confined to European studies only and did not distinguish between individual tree nuts3. A large randomised, cross-sectional survey of 38,480 household in the U.S. between 2009-2010 reported parent-reported tree nut allergy prevalence among children of 1.0% (95%CI 0.9-1.2) and again did not distinguish between individual tree nuts. 13 There is limited evidence to determine if the population prevalence of tree nut allergy is increasing. The only longitudinal data to date on tree nut allergy prevalence is limited to three studies in the United States that utilised random-digit telephone surveys in 1997, 2002, and 2008.141-143 Study design was consistent across each sampling period and included a large number of participants (n=4374; 13,493 and 5300 respectively), however data was limited to self-reported tree nut allergy. No significant increase in adult self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence was found over the three time points. However, the prevalence of self-reported tree nut allergy in children younger than 18 years had increased significantly (0.2% in 1997, 0.5% in 2002 and 1.1% in 2008). Proportionally, the increase was greater than that observed for peanut over the same time periods (0.4% in 1997, 0.8% in 2002 and 1.4% in 2008). Using emergency department visits as a proxy for increasing food allergy prevalence Dyer et al reported a 32% annual increase in emergency department visits for tree nut anaphylaxis in children over a 4 year period (2008-2012) in the U.S. state of Illinois. This observation may be a result of increased severity of tree nut reactions and therefore resulting in hospital presentation compared to other food allergens or a reflection of the increased usage of tree nut in our diets over this time period, however tree nut anaphylaxis was the highest increase in food-induced anaphylaxis reported in this study.144 To date there is no data on changes in tree nut allergy prevalence over time in Australia and it will not be studied as part of this project. My aims are to: 1.Review and summarise the worldwide prevalence of tree nut allergy. 2.Determine if tree nut allergy varies by region. 3.Identify the most common individual tree nut allergies around the world. 4.Determine the prevalence of tree nut allergy in Australian children. 5.Determine the most common tree nut allergies in Australian children. This work will provide the first population-based, challenge-confirmed estimates for overall tree nut allergy and individual tree nut allergy in Australia. Adve rse events related to tree nut allergy Adverse food reactions are common and hospital based admissions for food induced anaphylaxis are increasing in the UK and Australia.145- 147 However, reassuringly fatalities are rare with a systematic review in 2013 calculating that food allergic people would be at least 10 times more likely to die in an accident than of fatal anaphylaxis.148 Food-induced anaphylaxis fatality rates have been reported as stable in the UK despite increasing admission rates for anaphylaxis147but fatalities have reportedly increased in Australia.149,150 Peanut and tree nuts have been reported as the most common trigger of adverse food reactions and fatalities.147,151- 27Chapter 2 - Literature Review 153 The challenge with food induced anaphylaxis is the unpredictability of severe reactions and there are currently no clinical or biochemical tests that can help clinicians predict which food- allergic patient is likely to develop anaphylaxis.154 Current allergy tests can predict the likelihood of reaction, but not the severity.31 Tree nut anaphylaxis fatalities Food induced anaphylaxis fatalities are rare with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis reporting an incidence rate in children (0-19 years) of 3.25 per million person-years (1.73, 6.10; range 0.94, 15.75; sensitivity analysis 1.18 -6.13).148 Case reports from the United States and the United Kingdom Fatal Anaphylaxis Registry (UKFAR) show that peanut and tree nuts account for 70-90% of reported food-induced anaphylaxis fatalities, with tree nuts accounting for around 18-40%.147,155- 158 Although there is no formal reporting system for anaphylaxis fatalities in Australia, the patient advocacy and support group Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia claim that between 2005-2016 there have been 14 cases of food-induced anaphylaxis deaths in Australia with five of those attributable to tree nuts (one of each for macadamia, pistachio and hazelnut and 2 due to walnut).159 Published Australian data in 2016 reported 4 of 6 anaphylaxis fatalities in those <20 years of age were due to peanut or tree nuts between 1997-2013.149 A summary of worldwide case reports for food induced anaphylaxis are outlined in Table 3. Factors associated with increased risk of fatal anaphylaxis include the following: a)Delayed or no administration of adrenaline during an episode of anaphylaxis.149,155,156 b)Age: the teenage and young adult age group (12-25 years old) constitutes the highest proportion of deaths from anaphylaxis (70-85%). 156 c)Peanut or tree nut allergy with 70-90% of deaths from fo od-induced anaphylaxis due to these foods.155-157,160 d)Co-existing and poorly controlled asthma.149,161 It is important to note however, that factors that increase the likelihood of death from anaphylaxis have never been formally explored in a population setting and are limited to retrospective assessments of case series of fatalities and as such conclusions must be drawn with caution. Exploration of risk factors for tree nut allergy fatalities will not be part of this thesis. Table 4.

Few population studies have described the frequency of adverse food reactions, including anaphylaxis. Although clinical samples have the strength of more robust diagnosis and definition of adverse reactions and anaphylaxis, they miss capturing those who do not present for medical care and are likely 29Chapter 2 - Literature Review to over represent those with more severe food allergy phenotypes, higher socioeconomic status, and greater access to specialised medical management and education. Collectively peanut and tree nuts are the most common food trigger of anaphylaxis for emergency department presentations and hospital admissions.144 Research over the past 25 years has estimated the annual incidence rate of accidental exposure in children with peanut and/or tree nut allergies in the U.K, the U.S and Canada to range widely, between 3-55% (Table 4). Estimate variations are likely a reflection of differences in study designs, age of participants and level of allergen avoidance education provided. To date, estimates are not available from population cohorts, nor is there Australian data. My aims would therefore be to explore the frequency, type and severity of reactions that occur to tree nuts in the population-based SchoolNuts cohort compared to other types of food allergy and determine if more reactions and/or more severe reactions are occurring to tree nuts as has been previously reported in the literature in retrospective case series reports based on clinical cohorts .

Peanut allergy natural history has been retrospectively reported on selected clinic populations171-175 and more recently prospectively at the population level and resolution is reported at around 20%.176 Tree nut allergy natural history Tree nut allergy natural history is less well understood with around 10% resolution often reported. This figure, however is based on one study in a tertiary level allergy clinic in the US in children (3-21yrs).177 Studies recruited from tertiary clinics are likely to over represent those with more severe allergic disease and not necessarily reflective of the spectrum of cases presenting at the population level and as a result may under estimate the resolution of allergic disease. Confirmation of tree nut allergy at baseline in this study was based on known history of a reaction to tree nut however, 63% of participants who were eligible for a follow up food challenge refused a formal OFC. Resolution of tree nut allergy will not be studied as part of this thesis. Co-allergies to nuts Allergies to peanut and tree nuts are reported as commonly co-existing as well as multiple tree nut allergies, however estimates in the literature vary considerably largely due to variations in allergy definitions and have been limited to tertiary allergy clinics which may over represent participants with multiple food allergies . Invitro cross-reactivity between peanuts and tree nuts has been reported as high as 86%178 and tree nut sensitisation among those with peanut allergy as high as 87%.179 However, the coexistence of clinical peanut and tree nut allergy is lower with estimates based on self-report between 20 and 60% 122,142,180,181 and OFC confirmed outcomes much lower. A retrospective review from the United Kingdom showed that among a group of 94 patients with peanut allergy, 23% were found to be sensitised to one or more tree nuts yet only 7.4% were allergic.182 A more recent retrospective review in the U.S reported a co-allergy rate of only 4% of those with peanut allergy and tree nut sensitisation, however it must be noted that many of those undergoing tree nut OFC had low level sensitisation (SPT<3mm and/or sIgE <2KuA/L) and no history of tree nut ingestion.183 A retrospective review in France reported a co-allergy rate to tree nut among those with peanut allergy significantly higher (43.2%), with hazelnut the most common tree nut allergy observed. However, northern France is an area with high rates of birch pollen allergy and the form of tree nut allergy was not defined as part of this study and is likely to include a high proportion of OAS/PFS.179 Studies of co-allergy among the individual tree nuts are limited but the same observation of higher levels of co-sensitisation and lower rates of clinical allergy reported for peanut and tree nut are reported, highlighting the limitation of sensitisation data alone and the need for OFC confirmed allergy outcomes.121 The strongest cross reactivities among tree nuts appear to follow botanical family associations, for example walnut-pecan in the Juglandaceae family and cashew-pistachio in the Anacardiaceae family.178,184 The NutCracker study, a single centre, prospective cohort study of 83 children with tree nut allergy in Israel reported two thirds of those with walnut and cashew allergy were also allergic to pecan and pistachio respectively, while all those with pecan and pistachio allergy were allergic to walnut and cashew, respectively.185. Andorf and colleagues, in a study of 60 selected multi-food allergic patients reported all those allergic to walnut had co-existing pecan allergy. Interestingly, they reported a uni-directionality of the co-allergies with only two thirds of those patients allergic to walnut and cashew allergic to pecan and pistachio respectively suggesting that some allergenic proteins are shared while others are unique to cashew and walnut resulting in mono-allergy.186 Although studies to date on nut co-allergies are based on retrospective allergy clinic data where significant selection bias may occur, it does suggest that OFC confirmed tree nut allergy among those with peanut allergy and the prevalence of multiple tree nut allergies may not be as high as commonly reported and may be influenced by region. Studies in unselected population-based cohorts based on objective food allergy definitions, such as OFC, inclusive of tree nut ingestion history are needed. Development of tree nut allergy Development of tree nut allergy in childhood is also understudied. The first presentation for children with food allergy is often via reactions to milk, peanut and/or egg in infancy and early sensitisation to tree nuts has been reported in 19% of those with food allergies by 2 years of age.169 How this early sensitisation relates to the subsequent development of tree nut allergy is 33Chapter 2 - Literature Review uncertain and has not been studied at the population level nor systematically assessed using protocolised challenges. The Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial demonstrated that in infants at high risk of developing peanut allergy (patients with egg allergy and/or eczema and a subgroup already peanut sensitised), regular peanut consumption before the age of 12 months reduced the risk of peanut allergy at 5 years by 81%. However, extension of this concept to other food allergies, such as tree nut allergy has not yet been explored.22The current clinical dilemma remains as to what should be done regarding tree nut allergy testing and introduction advice for those with either peanut allergy or other forms of food allergy in infancy.120,187 There are currently no data on the primary or secondary prevention of tree nut allergy and clinicians are currently limited by the diagnostic testing available for tree nut allergy. Diagnosis of tree nut aller gy As for other forms of IgE-mediated food allergy, the diagnosis of tree nut allergy is reliant on a detailed medical history in conjunction with IgE testing via sIgE or SPT.188 The clinical dilemma for tree nut allergy diagnosis is that for many patients with an existing food allergy they have no prior history of ingestion or reaction to tree nuts and the challenge is how to safely guide the introduction of several individual tree nuts. Allergy testing for tree nuts is limited to SPT and sIgE with other in vitro tests such as specific IgE to allergen components and basophil activation testing not available for all tree nuts or limited outside research settings. Therefore, current testing methods cannot differentia te between clinical cross-reactivity and co-allergy, versus serological cross-reactivity and co- sensitisation in a given patient. Given that there is a high degree of co-sensitisation among the various nuts, yet likely lower levels of co-allergy, OFC is the only way to reliably determine individual tree nut allergy status for any tree nuts to which a patient is sensitised . Patients either continue to follow multiple nut exclusion diets based on sensitisation status alone or have to undergo multiple tree nut challenges to determine the allergy status of each individual nut, which is expensive, labour intensive and can place patients at risk of severe reactions. Some centres have trialled food challenges incorporating low risk nuts in a combined or multiple nut challenge to more efficiently determine individual tree nut allergy status.182,189,190 Allergen components associated with clinical allergy to tree nuts have been studied for cashew, pistachio, Brazil nut and walnut and sIgE cut-offs predictive of allergy have been reported (Table 6).191To date the application of sIgE to individual tree nut proteins for tree nut allergy diagnosis is limited to research settings and some larger tertiary allergy centres. Table 6. Tree nut allergen components associated with clinical allergy with a reported cut-off for specific IgE testing Tree nut Component associated with clinical allergy Specific IgE cut -off (kU/L) (% PPV) Reference Cashew Ana o (95%) et al, JACI 2015192 Lange et al, Allergy 2017191 Brazil nut Ber e 1 0.25 (94%) Rayes et al, CEA 2016193 Walnut Jug r 1 0.1 (91%) Blankestijn et al, JACI 2017194 Similarly, there are limited studies exploring the application of BAT to tree nut diagnosis, with hazelnut studied most extensively195-197and additional tree nuts limited to one study published in abstract form to date.198 An alternative in the absence of CRD and BAT for tree nut allergens is the use of 95% PPVs for sIgE and SPT to assist clinicians with the diagnosis of tree nut allergies or to determine allergy resolution and guide the decision of when to perform an OFC . PPVs for SPT have now been widely published for peanut, egg, milk and sesame in both clinical and population cohorts. However, 95% PPV data for tree nuts remains limited. Only one study has reported a 95% PPV for walnut sIgE of 18.5kUA/L, however data for other tree nuts could not be calculated due to small numbers.178 Ho and colleagues have reported the only published 95% PPVs for SPT of 8mm for tree nuts from the a llergy clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne between 1995 and 2005. Their results were limited to cashew, hazelnut and walnut and again calculation of 95% PPVs for other tree nuts was limited by small sample size.38 There is a paucity of data reporting the association between SPT responses and the risk of challenge confirmed tree nut allergy in clinical cohorts and to date, no reports in population 35Chapter 2 - Literature Review samples. One of the limitations is access to sufficient sample sizes utilising the same SPT methods for calculation of 95% PPVs for each of the individual tree nuts. I will begin to begin to address this in the final study of this thesis by: 1.Determining the SPT wheal sizes that correlate with 95% PPV predictability of a positive oral food challenge for cashew in two allergy clinic cohorts and two population-based cohorts of children, and secondly 2.Determine if these thresholds differ when stratified by allergy clinic or general population cohorts, and finally 3.Determine if these thresholds differ when stratified by known risk factors including co- existing peanut allergy, coexisting other food allergies, coexisting atopy, previous reaction history, age and gender. This study will be invaluable in informing clinical practice in the care of children with food allergy allowing for more accurate, timely and cost effective diagnosis of cashew nut allergy. It will be the first study to validate clinic derived 95% PPVs for cashew SPT with population based data and will build on previously published work by this group on the use of 95% PPVs as predictors of peanut, egg and sesame allergy in infants. Chapter 3 - Methods 37 METHODS This thesis explores the prevalence, elements of the natural history and development of tree nut allergy and the frequency of adverse events related to tree nut allergy primarily. It utilises data from two population-based studies: the HealthNuts study a population-based study of children recruited at 12 months of age with follow up to 6 years of age and secondly the SchoolNuts study a population-based study of 10 to 14 year olds both done in Melbourne, Australia. A final study was undertaken as part of this thesis investigating cashew nut oral food challenge outcomes in the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts cohorts and two allergy clinic cohorts based at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. The methods for the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies will be described in detail in this chapter together with the methods for the final study investigating cashew oral food challenge outcomes. 3.1 The HealthNuts Study Overview The HealthNuts Study is the largest single-centre, population-based, longitudinal study of paediatric food allergy recruiting children at 12 months of age and followed up at 4 and 6 years of age. The primary aims of the HealthNuts study are to measure the prevalence of IgE- mediated food allergy at the population level and assess modifiable risk factors. In brief, 5276 12-month-old infants were recruited from council-run immunisation centres in Melbourne, Australia, between August 2007 and September 2011. Infants were offered SPT to four common food allergens and any infant with detectable SPT ( 1mm) invited into the Royal Children's Hospital , Melbourne for an OFC to test for food allergy long with 200 randomly selected SPT negative infants as controls. When the participants turned 4 years of age, their parents were contacted and invited to be part of HealthNuts wave 2, which involved a parental questionnaire for all participants and clinic assessment for children who underwent OFC at age 12-months or reported new food reactions since 12 months of age . At age 6 years the entire cohort (n=5276) were invited to participate in questionnaire and SPT assessment. Questionnaires were mailed to all participants capturing demographic details, history of food allergy and new food reactions, common allergen exposure information, history of asthma/wheeze and eczema. All participants were invited for an allergy/health assessment which included SPT to a predetermined panel of 8 foods (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, sesame, cashew, almond, and hazelnut). Assessments were conducted either in the child's home or at the Royal Children's Hospital. Those with positive SPT (>1mm) or pa rent-reported reactions to foods (consistent with an IgE-mediated allergy) were invited for a clinic appointment with a specialist allergy nurse and OFC were conducted when indicated by a standardised protocol (Table 7). The HealthNuts study has reported challenge-proven food allergy prevalence and natural history data for egg, peanut and sesame at 12 months and 4 years of age, however tree nut allergy details have not been collated, analysed and reported to date. This thesis will report parent-reported tree nut allergy prevalence at 12 months of age and OFC confirmed tree nut prevalence at 6 years of age. The development of tree nut allergy among those with food allergy at 12 months will be explored as well as co-allergy patterns among peanut and tree nuts at age 6 years. The resolution of tree nut allergy is not possible with the current HealthNuts study data as tree nut allergy OFC were not performed at 12 months of age. HealthNuts study sampling frame HealthNuts is essentially a birth cohort that was recruited at 12-months of age. This age was selected for two reasons, firstly, SPT in very young infants may be difficult to interpret, and hence 12-months of age was selected as the age for recruitment. Secondly, at that time of recruitment, allergy prevention guidelines recommended that parents did not introduce peanuts until after 12-months and as such it was considered unlikely infants would have ingested peanut by this age. This was to minimise reporting bias of environmental exposures that may have occurred if parents were aware of the ir child's food allergy status .199 Chapter 3 - Methods 39 The Australian Vaccination schedule recommends a series of vaccinations at 12-months of age which are administered either at council-run immunisation centres or by a general practitioner in their clinic. In 2007, 92% of Victorian infants received standard vaccinations at 12-months of age and 46% of those received their vaccinations at council-run immunisation sessions.200 Initially, recruitment was conducted at 170 community immunisation centres across Greater Metropolitan Melbourne, although two-thirds of infant immunisations were conducted within 50 immunisations centres. Summary statistics of demographic characteristics were compared between the 50 most-visited centres and all 170 centres, and it was found that recruiting from the 50 centres maintained representativeness and diversity of sample so recruitment continued at the reduced sample of 50 immunisation centres. Figure 3.1. The Hea lthNuts study sample, representative of a Victorian birth cohort Sourced with permissio n from Osborne et al, Clinical and Exp Allergy, 2010199 HealthNuts study recruitment Age 1 year (Wave 1) All parents of infants aged 11-15 months, attending selected immunisation centres for their 12-month-old immunisations between August 2007 and September 2011, were asked a series of scripted questions, inviting them to participate in a food allergy study. Infants were excluded from the study if their parents could not read or understand English. During the compulsory 15-minute wait following immunisations, infants underwent skin prick testing to four common food allergens (peanut, egg, sesame/milk). Infants with any objective evidence of sensitisation, defined as SPT 1mm, were invited to participate in an OFC at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (83% of those eligible attended OFC). SPT was not conducted at recruitment if the infant had previously had an SPT performed by an allergist or if the infant had severe eczema on the back, which is a contraindication for SPT. These infants were still invited into the HealthNuts study clinic for food allergy assessment. Parents completed a detailed questionnaire while SPT was undertaken, but prior to knowledge of the results. This was to reduce the potential for bias that may occur if parents were aware of their infant's sensitisation status and changed their reporting of exposures. The questionnaire captured inform ation on infant's demographics, infant feeding, history of food reactions, common childhood illnesses, family history of allergy and environmental exposures (Appendix 1). These factors were identified on literature review and expert opinion as potential risk factors for food allergy. Details of tree nut ingestion and any adverse reactions were captured in this questionnaire. Age 4 years (Wave 2) At age 4 years, all participants were followed up via questionnaire (83% participation) and those who reported a new food allergy reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy, and those who had any food allergy at age 1 year, were invited for clinic assessment which included skin prick testing to a predetermined panel of 8 foods (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, sesame, and the tree nuts - cashew, almond, and hazelnut) and OFC (Appendix 2). Those reporting new reactions to tree nuts since age one were offered SPT and OFC at Wave 2. Chapter 3 - Methods 41 Age 6 years (Wave 3) At age 6 years the entire cohort (n=5276) were invited to participate in questionnaire and SPT assessment. Questionnaires were mailed to all participants capturing demographic details, history of food allergy and new food reactions, common allergen exposure information, history of asthma/wheeze and eczema (Appendix 3). All participants were invited for an allergy/health assessment which included SPT to the same predetermined panel of 8 foods as age 4 years (60.5% participation) and was conducted either in the child's home or at the Royal Children's Hospital. Tho se with positive SPT ( 1mm) were invited for a clinic appointment with a specialist allergy nurse and OFC were conducted when indicated by a standardised protocol (Table 7). SPT performed to almond, cashew and hazelnut No OFC offered for tree nut at age 1 SPT performed to almond, cashew and hazelnut and those sensitized offered OFC Those sensitised to almond, cashew or hazelnut had full tree nut SPT panel done at clinic a ssessment Parent reported tree nut ingestion and allergic reactions details captured in questionnaire Figure 3.2.

Cohort Profile: The HealthNuts Study: Population prevalence and environmental/ genetic predictors of food allergy. Int J Epidemiol, 2015 )1 HealthNuts study internal and external validity To assess the internal validity of the HealthNuts study, a brief non-responder questionnaire was developed and administered to parents who declined to participate in the study (Appendix 4). The purpose of the non-responder questionnaire was to determine whether those who declined to participate in the study differed from those who participated with regards to whether the infant was eating and tolerating allergenic foods, family history of allergic disease, eczema and other known risk factors for food allergy. The most common reasons for declining to participate in the HealthNuts study were that the infant was already eating and tolerating the foods being tested for (25%) or that they did not wish their child to undergo further testing following their immunisations (28%). Participants were similar to non-participants on most parameters measured in the non-responder questionnaire, with the exception that participants were more likely to have an immediate family member with a history of food allergy and less likely to have eaten peanut.199 To assess the external validity of the HealthNuts study relative to the target population of 12- month-old Victorian infants, characteristics of the HealthNuts cohort were compared to that of the whole population using data from the Perinatal Data Collection Unit, which publishes summary data from all Victorian births biennially.201 For most characteristics, the HealthNuts sample was comparable to the general population, with the exception that older mothers were over-represented in the HealthNuts sample.199 HealthNuts study skin prick testing Skin prick testing at age 1 recruitment (Wave 1) During the compulsory 15-minute wait following immunisations, a nurse administered SPT on the infants back, using a single-time lancet (Stallergenes, Antony, France). The panel of allergens included four of five common food allergens, egg white, peanut, sesame and either shellfish or cow's milk (ALK, Spain), a positive control (10mg/ml histamine ) and negative control (saline). Wheal size was measured after 15 minutes and calculated as the average of the longest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to it after subtracting the negative control. Chapter 3 - Methods 43 Shellfish was initially included in the SPT panel, because the study failed to get ethics approval to conduct cow's milk SPT for fear that sensitisation rates would be high among infants already tolerating cow's milk and lead to unnecessary parental anxiety. This ruling was reversed in 2009 after a pilot study revealed very low rates of cow's milk sensitisation. After a sufficient number of shellfish SPT were conducted to calculate accurate prevalence rates (n~2000), cow's milk replaced shellfish in the SPT panel. SPT to almond, cashew and hazelnut were performed only on those who attended RCH for a clinic assessment and OFC (n=1129). Skin prick testing at age 6 follow up (Wave 3) At age 6 years the entire cohort (n=5276) were invited to participate in questionnaire and SPT assessment (60.5% participation). SPT were performed on the child's back using the same methods as age one to a predetermined panel of 8 foods, including three tree nuts (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, sesame, and the tree nuts - cashew, almond, and hazelnut). SPT were conducted either in the child's home or at the Royal Children's Hospital. HealthNuts study oral food challenges Age 1 year oral food challenges (Wave 1) Any infant with detectable SPT response, wheal size 1mm, was invited into the HealthNuts study clinic at the Royal Children' s Hospital for an assessment and formal OFC to test for food allergy. This low SPT threshold was selected as a screening tool to ensure that no potential cases of food allergy were missed. A detailed clinical history was taken by an allergist to ensure that anaphylaxis to the index food had not occurred between recruitment and clinic attendance. SPT was repeated to a wider panel of allergens (peanut, egg white, sesame, shellfish, cow's milk, hazelnut, cashew, almond, soy, wheat and house dust mite.) A decision tree was used to determine whether an OFC should proceed on the basis of previous exposure and reaction to the index food (Figure 3.3). Food challenges proceeded in all circumstances, with the exception of infants who had a definite exposure to the food and an unequivocal reaction, consistent with the pre-determined OFC stopping criteria in the previous 1-month for egg or 2-months for peanut and sesame.Nurses performing OFC were blinded to both SPT results and clinical history. OFC were then performed irrespective of both the infants SPT wheal size and history of exposure to the food. OFC were conducted to peanut, raw egg white, baked egg and sesame, beginning with a smear or drop inside the lip. The dose increased at 15-20 minute intervals until either the equivalent of a single serve of the food was ingested, or a reaction occurred. After the initial dose, the challenge food is mixed with a previously tolerated food, usually apple sauce or yoghurt for the remainder of the challenge (Table 7) . Prior to the study commencing, investigators prospectively agreed on objective criteria that would constitute a positive OFC. These were: At least 3 concurrent, non-contact hives lasting at least 5 minute, Perioral or periorbital angioedema, Vomiting (excluding immediate gagging), or Evidence of anaphylaxis as defined by the Australian Society of Clinical Allergy and Immunology (evidence of circulatory or respiratory compromise) within 2 hours of the last challenge dose. Infants were observed for 2 hours following the final challenge dose, or following an objective reaction that caused the OFC to cease. If there was a suspicion of an acute allergic reaction (e.g., a transient area of erythema or hives), that did not meet the criteria for a positive challenge, the next dose of the challenge protocol was administered. The dosage protocol for the OFC are detailed in Table 7 . At discharge, participants with a positive food challenge were educated about food allergen avoidance, provided with an appropriate action plan and advised to make a follow- up appointment in 1 years' time with an allergist. To capture late reactions, participants with a negative food challenge were requested to continue administering the top dose of the challenge food at home for 7 days and return a symptoms diary. The food challenge result was deemed negative if the infant tolerated the top dose of the challenge and either did not report a late reaction after consumption of the top challenge dose at home for 1 week or if the infant's parent re ported that the infant was regularly consuming and tolerating the food. Food challenges were deemed inconclusive and a repeat challenge Chapter 3 - Methods 45 was offered if the infant refused to eat the challenge food at the clinic or if the parent reported a late reaction that did not meet the positive challenge criteria yet led the parent to remove the food from the infant's diet. Positive OFC in the absence of evidence of sensitisation were also considered inconclusive. No OFCs were performed to tree nuts at age 1 year. Participants were advised to avoid any tree nuts that they were sensitised to as per standard clinical practice at the time (2007-2011 ). At age 4 all those allergic at age 1 and those reporting new food reactions since age 1 were invited for allergy clinic assessment. Those reporting tree nut reactions consistent with IgE- mediated food allergy had SPT and OFC at age 4 years. At age 6 years all participants who were sensitised at follow up assessment were offered OFC including all tree nuts, refer to figure 3.3. Age 1 negative food challenge controls At 12 months a random sample of infants with negative SPT (0mm) to all foods at community recruitment in the HealthNuts study were also invited to undergo food challenge to egg or peanut. This was to test the assumption that infants with negative SPT are highly unlikely to have IgE-mediated food allergy to that food. All negative controls tested negative on food challenge.

Flow chart of Age 6 years HealthNuts challenge criteria protocol Chapter 3 - Methods 47 3.2 The SchoolNuts Study Overview The SchoolNuts Study is a large population-based study of students aged 10 to 14 years. The primary aims of the SchoolNuts study are to measure the population prevalence of food allergy during the critical 'early adolescent' period, defined as age 10 to 14 years,202 using the gold standard of OFC and to estimate the frequency and predictors of accidental adverse reactions to foods among those with food allergy. In brief, the SchoolNuts study is a school-based, cross-sectional stratified cluster sample of 9636 primary and secondary school students (10 to 14 years) recruited in greater metropolitan Melbourne. The study had two stages of assessment based on questionnaire and clinic assessment. Participants reporting a history of suggestive of food allergy were identified via self-report on student or parent questionnaires (Stage 1). Families were contacted via telephone to clarify the food allergy history and students invited to attend for a clinic appointment at the Royal Children's Hospital , Melbourne (Stage 2) where SPT was performed to the 16 most common food allergens (peanut, sesame, soy, almond, cashew, hazelnut, egg, shellfish, cow's milk, wheat, Brazil nut, walnut, pistachio, pine nut, macadamia, pecan). OFC was offered to all participants who self-report ed suspected IgE mediated food allergy and had evidence of IgE sensitisation via SPT on the day of clinic. Data for this thesis includes the self- reported tree nut allergy outcomes and adverse events reported from the stage 1 student questionnaire and the cashew challenge outcomes from the stage 2 clinic phase. SchoolNuts study sampling frame A school-based, cross-sectional stratified cluster sampling of primary and secondary school students in greater metropolitan Melbourne (population 3.6 million)203 was used to recruit a sample of 10 to 14 year old children. Seventy percent of the population of the state of Victoria reside in Melbourne.203 Schools were selected for recruitment for efficiency and cost effectiveness due to the ability to access large amounts of students in a single study introductory session. Also recruitment from schools provided a population-based sample rather than limited to those students managed as part of tertiary hospital allergy clinics allowing more accurate estimation of population prevalence of food allergy and frequency of adverse food reactions. Schools were randomly selected to reflect the variation in socio- economic status throughout school districts, and included each of the Government, Catholic and Independent school sectors. Schools were eligible for inclusion if they were less than 80km from the central business district and had more than 20 students per year level. A list of schools was obtained from the 2010 Melbourne Street Directory, stratified by primary versus secondary schools and subdivided into Government, Catholic and Independent schools. Each school within those groups was then assigned a number, and a random number generator was used by an independent statistician to select schools to approach.204 These 229 schools (representing 20,965 students) were approached to participate. SchoolNuts study recruitment A summary of the SchoolNuts study recruitment is outlined in figure 3.5. Each randomly selected school had an information letter sent to principals inviting their school to participate in the study. At each participating school, all students in Years 5, 6 (primary schools), 7 and 8 (secondary schools) were invited to take part. The choice to recruit at 10 to 14 years allowed for assessment of children across the transition from primary to secondary school and across the period of onset of puberty. This period also sees a significant shift from parent and teacher supervision towards greater student autonomy and independence. Researchers visited the schools to distribute a self-administered questionnaire to parent- consented students (Student Questionnaire-Appendix 5). Their parents were also asked to complete a questionnaire (Parent Questionnaire-Appendix 6). To improve the parent participation rate, modified versions of the Parent Questionnaires with survey questions shortened were subsequently sent by mail, email or SMS to those who had not completed the full Parent Questionnaire. SchoolNuts study internal and external validity To assess the internal validity of the SchoolNuts study, schools who did not want to participate were contacted via telephone to complete a short questionnaire to determine the number of children recorded as being at risk of anaphylaxis in the school and their age and gender. Chapter 3 - Methods 49 The proportion of participating schools in each of the government, Catholic, and independent school sectors reflected the overall distribution of school types in Victoria, with the exception of slightly fewer government primary schools.205There were no consistent patterns for differences in participation according to either size of the school or socio-educational advantage (Table 6). Socioeconomic status of participants was determined by using the Index of Community Socio-educational Advantage (ICSEA) score for each school, which is generated from student-level parent occupation and education, location, and percent indigenous student enrolment developed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. Participating government primary schools had a slightly lower median ICSEA score, which indicates less socio-educational advantage. In 2011, 3.9 million people resided in greater metropolitan Melbourne which represented 70% of residents in the state of Victoria. The distribution of SchoolNuts characteristics, including distribution of school sector attendance was comparable to general population data for the state of Victoria, collated by the department of education and available as an annual report.205 SchoolNuts Questionnaires The SchoolNuts study included both a student and parent questionnaire with variations in questions asked across the two questionnaires (Figure 3.5 and Appendices 5 and 6). The student questionnaire included questions regarding the child's history of food allergy and asthma and knowledge and attitudes toward food allergy. Students reporting current food allergy, current asthma or both were asked to complete additional more detailed sections of the questionnaire regarding their asthma, food allergy, or both. Those with current food allergy were asked to specify foods to which they were allergic: peanut, other nuts (nut type specified), hen's egg, cow's milk, sesame, fish, shellfish, soy, and other food (specified) and provide details of any allergic reactions that had occurred in the past 12 months (Appendix 5). The Parent Questionnaire collected additional information on the student's history of food allergy along with family demographics, and the allergy history of the other family members. The parent questionnaire did not contain details of any food reactions in the past 12 months (Appendix 6). Student eligibility for clinic evaluation was via a two-step process. Based on the assumption that parents have a better understanding about the history of the student's food allergy, students with possible current food allergy were identified through the response to Parent Questionnaire. Broad criteria were used to capture all cases of possible current food allergy, which was a positive response to any of the following questions; 1) \"Does your child currently have food allergy?\" 2) \"Has your child ever had food allergy, a food reaction or food related anaphylaxis?\" 3) \"Has your child ever eaten the following common allergens (Egg, Cow's milk, Sesame, Fish, Shellfish, Soy, Peanut, Tree nuts)?\" to capture students who may have unrecognised food allergy. Trained allergy research nurses then collected further information of the reaction/allergy by phone to evaluate whether current food allergy was likely, and if so, whether it was possibly IgE-mediated or not. Students were invited for clinic evaluation when the history suggested current IgE-mediated food allergy (i.e. evidence of an acute allergic reaction following ingestion of a food). Data regarding adverse food reactions included in this thesis was based on the student questionnaires as this information was not included in the parent questionnaire. Student- reported food allergy was validated through comparison to parent questionnaire responses. Chapter 3 - Methods 51 Table 7.

Outline of SchoolNuts Study Part 1: Parent and student questionnaire phase SchoolNuts skin prick testing Students identified with parent-reported possible food allergy from Stage 1 underwent a skin prick test (SPT) to a panel of 15 food allergens (egg white, cow's milk, soy, peanut, cashew, almond, hazelnut, walnut, pistachio, macadamia, pecan, brazil nut, pine nut, sesame, shellfish) along with a positive and a negative saline control (ALK-Abell\u00f3 SA, Madrid, Spain) as well as any other reported allergens using a single tine lancet (Stallergenes, Antony, France) on the student's volar forearm. Blood samples were also collected for serum IgE measurement.204 Schools consent to participate Information & consent form distrib uted to parents Parent -completed questionnaire: Parent-reported food allergy Food allergy diagnosis and management History of adverse reactions to foods in previous 5 years History of anaphylaxis ever History of asthma (ISAAC [52]) asthma severity (medication use, hospitalisation) Student -completed questionnaire (at school): Self-reported food allergy and asthma status Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) [53] Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) [54] Knowledge of and attitudes toward food allergy Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS) [55] Students with food allergy only: History of adverse reactions to foods in previous 12 mths , Epipen use, Food allergy specific quality of life [56, 57] Absent students complete questionnaire at home (children with allergies known to miss more school) Short non -participant questionnaire: Number of children recorded as at risk of anaphylaxis in school Short non -participant questionnaire: History of food allergy/asthma in child Family history of allergy Reasons for non-participation (optional)Chapter 3 - Methods 53 SchoolNuts oral food challenges Students were eligible for OFC if they had a positive SPT result to a food they had a history of reaction to and currently avoiding, or they had never eaten. OFC were not performed if the participants met the following criteria consistent with a high likelihood of clinical allergy. 1.SPT 3mm AND one of more of the following: a)A past history of severe reaction requiring multiple doses of adrenaline, b)An episode of anaphylaxis when older than 10 years; c)A convincing history of recent reaction (in the past 12 months) consistent with IgE- mediated food allergy; 2.A past history of reaction and highly sensitized (SPT wheal size 8mm). A small number of OFCs were conducted despite a negative SPT due to equivocal history. OFC dosage protocols were consistent with those of the HealthNuts study and included graded, incremental doses administered at 15 to 20 minute intervals (Table 7). Criteria to define a positive OFC result were based on the standardised criteria used in HealthNuts Study with one modification, namely, the inclusion of strictly defined subjective persistent symptoms in the upper airways or gastrointestinal which specifically included: itchy mouth or throat, abdominal pain or nausea, tightness in throat, difficulty talking or difficulty breathing, continuing up to the timing of the next dose, the previous dose was repeated. If the above symptoms persisted for a total of more than 40 minutes or reoccurred on 3 doses, it was recorded as a positive reaction.204 As per the HealthNuts study, OFCs were deemed negative when the student had a negative result on the day of the OFC and did not report any positive reactions during home-based food introduction in the week following the OFC.

Clinic Cohorts A retrospective analysis of all sequential open cashew OFCs conducted at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) allergy centre between 2011-2016 and a private allergy clinic based at RCH, the Melbourne Allergy and Children's Centre (MACCS) (2015 -2016, operational since 2015) was performed by myself. Patients undergoing cashew OFC were identified from the RCH electronic medical record and a database at MACCS. Cashew SPT wheal size, co-existing food allergy, current and resolved comorbid allergic disease and food and environmental allergen sensitisation were extracted via chart review. Those with a cashew SPT >3 months prior to OFC were excluded. Population Cohorts Cashew O FC from the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies were included. As previously outlined, both studies recruited participants from the community and utilised the same SPT and OFC protocols. Cashew OFCs were performed at age 4 and 6 years in the HealthNuts study and age 10 to 14 years in the SchoolNuts study . 3.4 Statistical methods Each manuscript in the subsequent results chapters includes a section describing the statistical methods specific to that analysis. As an overview, prevalence estimates are expressed as observed proportions with 95 % confidence intervals. Prevalence estimates were adjusted to reflect the distributions of risk factors among those approached at age 6 and agreed to follow up and therefore had a full allergy assessment versus those who declined follow up, via the inverse probability weighting method.206 Kappa analysis was performed to measure the agreement between dyads of student and parent responses for self-reported food allergy in the SchoolNuts study. All analyses used logistic regression (for binary outcomes) and linear regression (for continuously valued biomarkers to permit adjustment of the estimated difference in prevalence / mean for possible confounding of these associations by other measured factors). A separate regression model was conducted for each clinical factor with the demographic factors included as a priori confounders and other clinical factors only retained as confounding variables if they altered the odds ratio by more than 10%. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic value of SPT and sIgE to predict food allergy and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to quantify the accuracy of the test (Chapter 4 and Chapter 6). The odds of food allergy (a monotonic transformation of the prevalence of food allergy) was modelled for various SPT or sIgE thresholds using logistic regression and predicted prevalence from these models replaced the observed values (presence or absence of food allergy) in the standard formula for the positive predictive values (PPVs). Bootstrapping, a method of deriving standard errors and confidence intervals from repeated samples drawn with replacement from the original dataset, was used to quantify the precision (uncertainty) of the PPV estimates and to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the corresponding population parameter.207 For the thresholds with 95% PPV, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated using standard formulas the details of which are discussed in the literature review section 2.1.1. STATA software was used for all statistical analysis (release 14.0 and 15.0, StatCorp, College Station, Texas). 3.5 Ethical conduct in human research The subjects of these studies were infants and young children which raises several ethical considerations. The Declaration of Helsinki, a set of ethical principles for medical research, asserts that vulnerable populations such as infants and children, should not participate in medical research unless their involvement is essential to answer a specific research question that will promote the health of that vulnerable population. As food allergy generally presents in the first years of life and due to the paucity of methodologically robust food allergy studies, Chapter 3 - Methods 57 it is important to conduct research in this age group to identify risk factors and predictors of food allergy and its natural history. Participation in this study included SPT screening for food allergy. It poses minimal risk to an infant and the benefits include identifying infants at risk of food allergy before introduction of the allergen. Consent to participate in the HealthNuts study was provided by the infant's parents or guardians. Approval to conduct the HealthNuts study was obtained from the Victorian State Government Office for Children (reference no. CDF/07/492), the Victorian State Government Department of Human Services (reference no. 10/07), and the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number. 27047). Consent to participate in the SchoolNuts study was provided by the student's parents. Ethical approval was obtained from the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 31079), the Department of Education and Early Childhood and the Catholic Education Office. Ethical approval for the cashew OFC project was obtained from the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 37076A). Chapter 4 - The Worldwide Prevalence of Tree Nut Allergy 59 THE WORLDWIDE PREVALENCE OF TREE NUT ALLERGY 4.1 Introduction This chapter is presented in the form of a manuscript that was published in Current Allergy and Asthma Reports. 2015 Sep; 15(9):555 . This was the first study done as part of this thesis and addresses the following research questions via a systematic review of the literature: 1.What is the worldwide prevalence of tree nut allergy? 2.Does tree nut allergy prevalence vary by region? 3.What are the most common individual tree nut allergies around the world? This research was presented at the Food, Allergy and Nutrition Symposium hosted by the NHMRC funded Centre for Food & Allergy Research (CFAR) and the CRE in Foods for Future Australians in 2015. It was also presented as an abstract and poster at the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) an nual scientific meeting in 2015 both held in Adelaide, Australia FOOD ALLERGY (T GREEN, SECTION EDITOR) The Prevalence of Tree Nut Allergy: A #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 Abstract Tree nuts are one of the most common foods causing acute allergic reactions and nearly all tree nuts have been asso- ciated with fatal allergic reactions. Despite their clinical impor- tance, tree nut allergy epidemiology remains understudied and the prevalence of tree nut allergy in different regions of the world has not yet been well characterised. We aimed to system- atically review the population prevalence of tree nut allergy inchildren and adults. We searched three electronic databases (OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed) from January 1996 to December 2014. Eligible studies were categorised byage, region and method of assessment of tree nut allergy. Of the 36 studies identified most were in children ( n=24) and from Europe ( n=18), UK ( )o rU S A( n=5). Challenge- confirmed IgE-mediated tree nut allergy prevalence was lessthan 2 % (although only seven studies used this gold standard) while probable tree nut allergy prevalence ranged from 0.05 to4.9 %. Prevalence estimates that included oral allergy syn- drome (OAS) reactions to tree nut were significantly higher(8-11.4 %) and were predominantly from Europe. Prevalence of individual tree nut allergies varied significantly by region with hazelnut the most common tree nut allergy in Europe, walnut and cashew in the USA and Brazil nut, almond and walnut most commonly reported in the UK. Monitoring time trends of tree nut allergy prevalence (both overall and by indi- vidual nuts) as well as the prevalence of OAS should be con-sidered given the context of the overall recent rise in IgE- mediated food allergy prevalence in the developed world.

Contrary to popular belief, peanuts are not tree nuts and are in fact a groundnut and classified as a legume. Tree nuts most likely to result in an IgE-mediated food allergyreaction are almond, brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio and walnut. Although botanical- ly unrelated, tree nut and peanut allergies share many clinicalsimilarities. Peanut and tree nuts are two of the most common foods reported to cause IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. IgE-mediated food allergy reactions can occur after ingestionof very small amounts of peanut and tree nut, typically within minutes of ingestion with symptoms including hives, angio- edema or vomiting. Reactions can also be life threatening,with the most severe reactions termed anaphylaxis. Peanut and tree nuts together account for 70 -90 % of reported food- induced anaphylaxis fatalities, with tree nuts alone accounting for around 18 -40 % [ 1-4]. Allergies to peanut and tree nuts also commonly co-exist with around 20 -30 % of people with a peanut allergy also allergic to one or more tree nuts [ 5,6]. For individuals with one tree nut allergy, around 30 % will have at least one additional tree nut allergy [ 6]. Tree nut and peanut allergies are usually lifelong [ 7]. Peanut allergy has been well described and widely reported with population prevalence estimates between 1 and 6 % [ 8\u0081,9]. Despite the similarities to peanut allergy, the population prevalence of tree nut allergy has been less well characterised. Determining tree nut allergy prevalence at a population level can be complex. Firstly, the definition of a 'tree nut ' may vary. Some studies include peanut and tree nuts together as'nuts ', while other studies only include one or two tree nuts. Few studies investigate allergy to all eight common individual tree nuts. Secondly, allergic reactions to tree nuts can result from primary IgE-mediated mechanisms or, alternatively, viasecondary cross-reactivity mechanisms to birch pollen, in a form of food allergy known as oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen food syndrome (PFS). In individuals with birch pol-len sensitisation, birch pollen-specific IgE can cross-react with similar proteins found in a range of fresh fruits, vegetables and nuts (apple, apricot, carrot, celery, hazelnut, peach, peanut,pear, potato and plum) resulting in oral pharyngeal symptoms [10,11]. Finally, the method of tree nut allergy diagnosis may vary from self-reported methods such as surveys and question- naires (which have been found to overestimate the true prev- alence of food allergy) [ 8\u0081,9], IgE testing methods such as skin prick testing (SPT) or specific IgE (which are limited to IgE-mediated food allergy and are indicative of sensitisation not clinical allergy), to the most objective but time-consuming and cumbersome methods of oral food challenge (OFC) anddouble-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC). One previous systematic review by Zuidmeer et al., of studies published between 1990 and 2006, reported theprevalence of perceived reactions to tree nut as ranging be- tween 0 and 7.3 %; however, most studies included in this review ( n=27 of 36) were based in Europe where the preva- lence of oral allergy syndrome is high, and few studies used objective definitions of tree nut allergy such as challenge con- firmed outcomes [ 12\u0081]. A more recent systematic review by Nwaru et al. was confined to European studies only and did not distinguish between individual tree nuts [ 13\u0081]. A more up- to-date global prevalence estimate of tree nut allergy is needed since 20 new studies have been published since 2006, and understanding the regional variation in tree nut allergy is im- portant given the overall rising burden of food allergy [ 14,15] in developed countries and the importance of tree nuts as a cause of severe allergic reactions. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up to- date systematic review of the population prevalence of tree nut allergy in children and adults including details of all individual tree nuts in various regions of the world. Methods Search Strategy Following closely the methods and procedures of the Pre- ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [16], we systematically searched three electronic databases (OVID MEDLINE,EMBASE and PubMed) based on a search strategy formulat-ed with the assistance of a research librarian. The search strat- egy was created in OVID MEDLINE and modified for EMBASE and PubMed. Figure 1outlines the full OVID MEDLINE search strategy. Study Selection Tree nuts were defined as walnut, almond, pistachio, cashew, pecan, hazelnut, macadamia and Brazil nut. Studies reportingon all forms of allergic reactions (primary and secondary IgE- mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions) were included and there were no age restrictions applied. All tree nut allergyoutcomes were included for both individual and combined tree nut allergies. We included eligible studies that reported tree nut allergy based on self-report, sensitisation (sIgE or SPT), OFC/DBPCFC or convinc ing clinical history. The search was limited to English-language articles and, to capture more recent publications, limited to the period January 1996 to December 2014. To ensure unbiased estimates of tree nut allergy prevalence in the community, we excluded studies inselected patient groups or those performed in hospital or aller- gy clinic settings and included only population-based cross- sectional and cohort studies. Reviews and case reports were54Page 2 of 13 Curr Allergy Asthma Rep (2015) 15: 54excluded along with studies of which full-text articles were not available. Identified articles were screened via title and abstract by two independent reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolvedby consensus and if necessary a third reviewer consulted. Ref- erence lists of identified studies were reviewed for additionalarticles. A full-text review was then undertaken for all articles identified. Quality assessment of the studies was performed by two reviewers based on participation rate, ability of the study de-sign to address tree nut allergy outcomes objectively and in- clusion of individual tree nut information.Analysis Using a standardised method, relevant study details were summarised including reference details, age, sample size and response rate, prevalence estimates and 95 % confi- dence intervals (CI) for all reported food allergy out-comes (self-/parent report, specific IgE testing, skin prick testing, symptoms and food challenges) for overall food allergy and tree nut allergy. If not reported, prevalenceestimates were calculated as the observed proportion with 95 % CI calculated on the assumption of a binomial sampling distribution.*The primary search was conducted in OVID MEDLINE and modied for EMBASE and PubMed. The search involved a combina/g415on of three search groups as either MeSH terms or keywords, each of which had to be present in order for an ar/g415cle to be included: 1) \"nut s\", \"tree nuts\" individual \"hypersensi/g415vity\" or \"allergy\"; and 3) \"prevalence\" or \"epidemiology\". The search was limited to English language ar/g415cles. The exact search conducted in OVID MEDLINE is shown in the box below. 1.

For this review, the approaches used to determine tree nut allergy have been grouped as follows: 1.Confirmed tree nut allergy \u2014defined as food challenge confirmed tree nut allergy (OFC or DBPCFC) or recent history (<2 years) of IgE-mediated reaction with positive allergy testing (SPT or sIgE) undertaken as part of the study in the absence of a formal food challenge. 2.Probable tree nut allergy \u2014defined as reported history (>2 years) of IgE-mediated reaction with allergy or self- report of doctor diagnosis (presumed to include allergy- specific history and testing). 3.Self-reported tree nut allergy \u2014defined as parent or self- reported tree nut allergy in the absence of data on allergytesting. 4.Sensitisation only (allergy testing via SPT or sIgE, with- out confirmation of clinical allergy). We performed a random effects meta-analysis and in an attempt to address the significant heterogeneity observed across the studies stratified by age, region and method of tree nut allergy diagnosis. Statistical analyses were undertaken using STATA 13 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Results Study Selection and Characteristics Figure 1summarises the search methodology. The systematic search of the literature resulted in 333 articles after duplicates were removed. Title and abstract review identified 261 that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 72 articles and an additional ten records identified through manuallysearching reference lists underwent full-text review. Forty six full-text articles were excluded (26 were in selected popu- lations, seven did not report tree nut allergy prevalence, sevendid not include prevalence data and six were review articles). Included studies are described in Table 1(n=36).T wenty six studies were designed to measure overall food allergyprevalence and reported tree nut allergy as a study outcome, seven were studies specifically aimed at investigating tree nut allergy prevalence and three studies included tree nut allergy prevalence data as part of an investigation of peanut allergy prevalence or associated factors. Quality assessment of the studies based on participation rate, ability of the study design to addr ess tree nut allergy outcomes objectively and inclusion of individual tree nut information re-sulted in 28 studies graded as moderate and eight poor. Three of the studies were assessed as poor because they were not de- signed to measure tree nut allergy prevalence but reported sometree nut prevalence data, which w e have included in this review. The majority ( n=28) of the studies were population-based cross- sectional studies and the remaining eight were cohort studies.Six studies did not provide participation rate details, ten studies h a dap a r t i c i p a t i o nr a t ea b o v e8 0% ,1 3b e t w e e n5 0a n d8 0% and seven less than 50 %. One s tudy by Greenhawt et al. in American college students had a participation rate of only 3 % and reported a very high overall self-reported food allergy prev- alence of 54 % and a self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence of9.16 % (95% CI 6.8- 11.9) [ 24]. This study has been included in the summary table, but the prevalence estimates not discussed aspart of the review since the participation rate was extremely lowand the study therefore not necessarily representative of the population from which it was sampled. The random effects meta-analysis showed heterogeneity to be too great to report pooled results ( I 2>98 %, p=0.000forall analyses). Tree Nut Allergy Prevalence by Age and Allergy Diagnosis Method The majority ( n=24) of studies in this review were in children and adolescents, four studies included both adults and chil- dren, six studies adults only and two studies reported an over-all tree nut allergy prevalence without age breakdown; in one of these studies, participants were >15 years [ 23] and the second <61 years of age [ 25]. Prevalence estimate ranges for all allergy definitions, categorised by age, are outlined in Table 2. Seven studies used the most objective assessment of oral food challenge (or convinc- ing recent history of allergic reaction together with positive allergen-specific IgE) with an overall prevalence range of 0 - 1.6 %. Nine studies combined self-reported food allergy with additional objective assessment such as specific details regarding doctor diagnosis or sensitisation details (sIgE/SPT) and were classified as probable food allergy for this review. The overallprobable tree nut allergy prevalence range was 0.05- 4.9 %, with only one study reporting adult data. However, the majority ofprevalence estimates for tree nut allergy were based on self-reported reactions ( n=20 studies). The self-reported tree nut al- lergy prevalence range was wider for adults (0.18 -8.9 %) and those studies including both adults and children (0.4 -11.4 %) than those studies including only children (0 -3.8 %). Overall self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence ranged from 0 to 11.4 %. Three studies based tree nut allergy prevalence on sensiti- sation alone (sIgE or SPT) without any clarification of pres-ence of clinical allergy. One reported hazelnut sensitisation bySPT in Russian children of 0.8 % (95 % CI 0.4 -1.1) and Finnish children of 6.3 % (95% CI 3.6 -9.8) [ 52]. The second study reported sensitisation based on SPT of 1.0 % in 7-year-old children in the UK [ 40]. The third study in adults reported sensitisation prevalence to hazelnut of 9.26 % and walnut2.98 % (overall 12.2 % (95% CI 11.7 -12.7)) [ 20].

Tree Nut Allergy Prevalence by Region Prevalence estimate ranges for each method of allergy defini- tion are summarised by region in Table 3. Regional variation in self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence is illustrated inFig.2. Most studies were from Europe ( n=18), the UK ( n= 8), or the USA ( n=5). There were three studies from Asia and one each from Canada, Central America and Australia. Strat-ifying by region highlighted a markedly higher prevalence oftree nut allergy in some European countries with a range of 0.04 -11.4 %. OAS appeared to contribute to higher tree nut allergy prevalence in some European countries since all three of the studies reporting tree nut allergy prevalence over 8 % were self-reported, all in adolescents and adults, and all from Europe. Two of these studies directly reported that all tree nutallergy found in their study was due to OAS [ 35,42] and the third study did not specify the type of allergic reaction to treenuts, but overall 33 % of all allergy, to any food, was report-edly due to OAS [ 30]. All other regions, regardless of allergy definition, reported tree nut allergy prevalence less than 2 %. Individual Tree Nut Allergy Prevalence Table 4summarises the percentage of tree nut allergic partic- ipants allergic to each individual tree nut by region. Fourteen studies provided details of individual tree nut prevalence. The prevalence of individual tree nut allergies varied by region.Hazelnut was the most common tree nut allergy reported in six of the seven studies from Europe accounting for 17 -100 % of all tree nut allergies. The two studies from the USA reported walnut and cashew as the most common tree nut allergies ranging from 20 to 30 % and 15 -30 %, respectively. Brazil nut allergy was reported commonly in the UK ranging from24 to 33 %. The one study from Mexico reported low overall tree nut allergy of 0.18 % (2/1126) with both participantsallergic to walnut. None of the studies reported on the preva- lence of multiple tree nut allergies. Tree Nut Allergy Prevalence Over Time There is limited evidence to determine if the population prevalence of tree nut allergy is increasing. Three studies in the USA utilised random-digit telephone surveys in 1997, 2002 and 2008 [ 44\u0081,45\u0081,46\u0081]. Study design was consistent across each sampling period and included a large number of participants ( n=4374; 13,493 and 5300, respectively). No significant i ncrease in adult self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence was found over the three timepoints. However, the prevalence of self-reported tree nut allergy in children younger than 18 years had increasedTable 1 (continued) Reference Country Study design Allergy outcome Type of allergy N Participation rate (%)Age Individual tree nuts describedPrevalence measureOverall prevalence%( 9 50]UK Cohort 1.

Using the most robust measure of tree nut prevalence (challenge confirmed or history of reaction with IgE antibod- ies), we estimate the overall prevalence to be <2 % in coun-tries where OAS is not reported. Secondary tree nut allergy (OAS) estimates for older age groups including adolescents and adults is as high as 10 %, particularly in Europe. Fewstudies reported the population prevalence of individual tree nut allergies. However, how prevalent a particular tree nut allergy is differs significantly by region with hazelnut the mostcommon tree nut allergy in Europe, walnut and cashew in the USA and Brazil nut, almond and walnut most commonly re- ported in the UK. There is limited evidence to determine if thepopulation prevalence of tree nut allergy is increasing. This is the first systematic review of the literature exploring tree nut allergy prevalence exclusively across the age groupsand different regions of the world, utilising robust systematic review methodology, closely following PRISMA guidelines. A further strength of this review is we categorised prevalence by robustness of the study methodology employed to define tree nut allergy. We identified three studies with self-reportedtree nut allergy greater than 8 %, all from Europe demonstrat- ing that studies which do not differentiate primary and sec- ondary tree nut allergy prevalence rates are likely to inflateprevalence estimates. Precise estimates of true tree nut allergy were limited by the small number of studies reporting challenge confirmed treenut allergy prevalence \u2014the gold standard for diagnosis. As for other epidemiological studies of food allergy prevalence[8\u0081,9], we also found higher prevalence estimates for self- report and sensitisation. Self-report is known to overestimate the true prevalence of food allergy [ 54] and asymptomatic sensitisation to foods is relatively common [ 9]; therefore, ob- jective measures are critical. We were also unable to accurate-ly determine whether tree nut allergy is on the rise as only one series of estimates was available. Finally, estimates of theprevalence of individual tree nut allergies could not be reliably estimated due to the paucity of data reported for individual nuts, although it is clear that there is significant regional var-iation in prevalence estimates [ 55]. We found overall tree nut allergy prevalence mirrors the global pattern of overall food allergy with countries withlow prevalence of food allergy also reporting low levels of tree nut allergy. Large population-based epidemiological stud- ies such as the ISAAC and EuroPrevall studies have demon-strated considerable regional variability of common food al- lergens and sensitisation patterns, but the reasons for this re- main largely unexplored. It has been hypothesised thatvariation in dietary patterns at the population level might lead to variations in sensitisation status and hence risk of subse- quent food allergy. Du Toit et al. hypothesised that variationsin peanut allergy prevalence between genetically similar pop- ulations in the UK and Israel might be due to differences in infantile peanut consumption patterns [ 22], whilst others have argued that boiled versus roasted peanut dietary intakes may at least partly explain the difference in allergy patterns across different regions [ 56,57]. Our review found a higher self-reported tree nut allergy range (0 -11.4 %) than both previous published systematic reviews. Nwaru et al. performed a meta-analysis of sevenstudies and reported a pooled self-reported point prevalence of 1.8 % (95% CI 1.63 -1.99), although there was signifi- cant the studies ( I 2=99.4 %, p=0.00). Zuidmeer et al. included studies from a wider range ofcountries from 1990 to 2006 and reported a self-reported tree nut allergy prevalence range of 0 -7.3 % based on seven studies [ 12\u0081]. Prevalence varied based on type of tree nut allergy, method of tree nut allergy diagnosis, age andregion. Similarly to Zudimeer et al., considering the largeheterogeneity between the studies, we have not presented a pooled prevalence estimate since this would mask the dif- ferences between populations. Nwaru et al. reported confirmed tree nut allergy pooled point prevalence of 0.45 % ( I 2=0.00 %, p=0.88) while Zuidmeer et al. reported a range of 0.1 -4.3, based on only three studies. We found the prevalence of tree nut sensitisationto be the highest of the four methods of allergy definition used(1.0-12.2 %). Comparison to sensitisation prevalence esti- mates in previous reviews is difficult as we reported sensitisa-tion prevalence estimates based on population sensitisation.Previous reviews both reported studies where SPT or sIgE was performed only on participants that had previously self- reported tree nut allergy. Neither of these reviews differentiat-ed between primary and secondary tree nut allergy prevalence, or reported on individual tree nut allergy prevalence nor the nature or prevalence of multiple tree nut allergies. In conclusion, this systematic review has highlighted that there is considerable heterogeneity in tree nut allergyprevalence from studies to date and pooling individualstudy estimates risks masking the real differences between populations. Data is limited to largely European, US and UK studies using self-reported prevalence in children andadolescents. There is a need for further studies to deter- mine tree nut allergy by gold standard methodologies such as food challenge, and differentiate between primaryand secondary tree nut allergy. Further detailed informa- tion on individual tree nut prevalences will help inform our understanding of regional variation and repeated esti-mates over time will enable us to understand whether time trends in tree nut allergy mirror the general rise in IgE- mediated food allergy reported in developed countries.Curr Allergy Asthma Rep (2015) 15: 54 Page 11 of 13 54Acknowledgement This review forms work as part of VMc PhD, funded by the Centre for Food and Allergy Research (CFAR).

This is one of the first studies to investigate and characterise adverse food reactions including anaphylaxis and associated risk factors in the adolescent period, an age group identified at high risk for adverse food reactions and anaphylaxis but poorly studied in food allergy research. This manuscript addresses the following research questions: Do food allergic sufferers have more reactions or severe reactions when peanut or tree nut allergic versus other food allergies? a)What is the prevalence of self-reported adverse reactions for peanut, tree nut and other foods in 10 to 14 year old allergic children in the SchoolNuts study? b)What is the prevalence of self-reported anaphylaxis for peanut, tree nut and other foods in 10 to 14 year old allergic children in the SchoolNuts study? c)What factors are associated with adverse food allergy reactions and anaphylaxis in 10 to 14 year old allergic children in the SchoolNuts study ? This research was presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Congress in Vienna, Austria in June 2016 as an oral presentation. It was awarded best oral presentation in the anaphylaxis section of the meeting. EAACI is Eur ope's largest medical association in the fields of allergy and clinical immunology and the congress is their annual meeting with around 8000 delegates attending each year.

Peters, PhD,aand Katrina J. Allen, MD, PhD,a,b,c,ffor the SchoolNuts investigators Melbourne, Australia, and Manchester, United Kingdom Background: Adolescents are at the highest risk of death from anaphylaxis, yet few population-based studies have described the frequencies and risk factors for allergic reactions caused by accidental allergen ingestion in this group. Methods: We describe the prevalence, frequency, and associatedrisk factors for recent adverse food reactions in 10- to 14-year- olds in Melbourne, Australia, recruited from a stratied, random, population-based sample of schools (SchoolNuts,n59663; 48% response rate). Self-reported food allergy and adverse reaction details, including anaphylaxis, were identied by using a student questionnaire over the past year. Results: Of 547 students with possible IgE-mediated foodallergy, 243 (44.4%; 95% CI, 40.3% to food. Fifty-three (9.7%; 95% CI, 7.2% to 12.2%) students reported 93 anaphylaxis episodes. Peanut and tree nutswere the most common food triggers. Among students with current IgE-mediated food allergy, those with resolved or current asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3] and 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.6]) and those with more than 2 food allergies (aOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.1]) were at greatest risk of any adverse food reaction, and those with nut allergy were mostat risk of severe reactions (aOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4]). Resolvedor current asthma was not associated with increased risk of severe reactions (aOR, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.3-2.2] and 1.6 [95% CI, 0.7-3.7]).Conclusions: Adolescents with food allergy are frequently exposed to food allergens. Those with asthma and more than 2food allergies were at the greatest risk for adverse food reactions. Those with nut allergies were most at risk of severereactions. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;141:982-90.) Key words: Food allergy, anaphylaxis, adolescents, schools, peanut allergy, asthma Food allergy affects up to 10% of children and 2% to 3% of adults and appears to be increasing in prevalence.1-4This increase in food allergy prevalence has coincided with increased reports of food-induced anaphylaxis. The greatest increase in anaphylaxis has been reported in the 0- to 5-year age group5; however, more recent data suggest that the increase in food-induced anaphylaxis is now occurring more rapidly in the periadolescent age period (5- 14 years).6,7Adolescents also constitute the highest proportion of deaths from anaphylaxis.8-11 Studies to date reporting the frequency of adverse food reactions and anaphylaxis have been limited to selected food allergens only,12-19occurred in younger children,20or been based on allergy clinic or health care facility presentation.21Few population studies have described the frequency of adverse foodreactions, including anaphylaxis, among adolescents. Additionally, predicting those adolescents with food allergy who might be at greatest risk of food reactions is also difcult. 22 Reported risk factors for anaphylaxis-related fatalities haveincluded delayed administration or failure to administer FromaMurdoch Children's Research Institute,cthe Department of Allergy and Immunology, anddthe Centre for Adolescent Health, Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne;bthe Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Royal Children's Hospital;ethe Allergy and Lung Health Unit, Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Melbourne; andfthe Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University of Manchester.

Understanding the predictors for adverse food reactions, including anaphylaxis, for the population of adolescents with food allergy underpins thedevelopment of age-appropriate prevention and managementstrategies. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and associated risk factors for adverse food reactions reported in thepreceding 12 months among those with IgE-mediated food allergy in a large population-based cohort of 10- to 14-year-old students. METHODS The SchoolNuts study is a cross-sectional population-based study that aimed to determine the population prevalence of challenge-proved food allergy and to assess risk factors for adverse reactions to foods in earlyadolescence. The early adolescent period (10-14 years) was selected to allowassessment of children across the transition from primary (10-11 years) to secondary school (12-14 years), where greater autonomy and independence occurs, which is also consistent with the onset of puberty. The study had 2stages: stage 1, parent and student questionnaires; stage 2, clinic-basedassessments. Questionnaires were used to determine the likelihood of IgE-mediated food allergy, after which the students and their parents were invited to attend a hospital clinic visit for allergy testing and food challenge.This study reports the data from stage 1 student questionnaires. Participant selection and recruitment Stratied cluster sampling of primary and secondary school students in the greater metropolitan Melbourne area (population of 3.9 million in 2011)25was used to recruit a sample of 10- to 14-year-old adolescents between July 2011and December 2014. Seventy percent of the population of the state of Victoriareside in Melbourne. 25Schools were randomly selected to reflect the variation in socioeconomic status throughout the various school districts and includedeach of the government, Catholic, and independent school sectors in theAustralian education system. Schools were eligible for inclusion if they were less than 80 km from the central business district and had more than 20 students per year level. A list of schools was obtained from the 2010Melbourne Street Directory stratied by primary (grades 5 and 6) versussecondary (years 7 and 8) schools and subdivided into government, Catholic, and independent schools. Each school within those groups was then assigned a number, and a random number generator was used to select schools. These 229schools (representing 20,965 students) were approached to participate byletter of invitation, 117 (51.1%) of which participated in the study. At each participating school, all students in years 5, 6, 7, and 8 were then invited to take part. Parental consent was required for students to complete the student questionnaire. Consented students completed questionnaires as part of a school visit by the research team (n 59,663). Families were invited to complete a parent questionnaire sent through the school. Fifty-seven percent of student questionnaires had a corresponding parent questionnaire completed (n 55,507). Questionnaire details and denitions The student questionnaire included questions regarding the child's history of food allergy and asthma and knowledge and attitudes toward food allergy.Student-reported resolved asthma was dened as an afrmative response to the following question: ' 'Have you ever had asthma?' ' Current asthma was dened as an afrmative response to the following question: ' 'Do you still haveasthma?' ' Students reporting current food allergy, current asthma, or both were asked to complete additional more detailed sections of the questionnaire regardingtheir asthma, food allergy, or both. Those with current food allergy were askedto specify foods to which they were allergic: peanut, other nuts (nut type specied), hen's egg, cow's milk, sesame, sh, shellsh, soy, and other food (specied). Those students who did not complete further food allergyquestions and those who reported a food allergy that was unlikely to beIgE-mediated (celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or reactions to additives) were excluded from the current analyses. The remaining students were classied as ' 'possibly IgE-mediated food allergic.' ' Students were asked whether they had experienced an adverse food reaction in the past 12 months (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Reposi- tory at www.jacionline.org for details of the questionnaire). Details of each food reaction were sought, including the food trigger, self-report of anaphylaxis, use of adrenaline autoinj ector, locale of the reaction (home, school, restaurant, and friend's home), symptoms (skin rash, facialswelling, vomiting, diarrhea, and breathing difculties), and time frameof each reaction (<1 hour from food ingestion and reaction, 1-4 hours,>4 hours, and unknown). The denition of anaphylaxis was based on the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy denition of anaphylaxis, which categorizes any reaction involving acute onset ofrespiratory compromise as anaphylax is (Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy denition was any acute onset illness with typical skin features [urticarial rash or erythema/flushing, and/or angioedema] PLUS involvement of respiratory and/ or cardiovascular and/or persistent severe gastrointestinal symptoms OR any acute onset of hypotension orbronchospasm or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, even if typica l skin features are not present). 26Each reaction was categorized into one of 5 groups according to time of onset of reaction and symptoms (see Fig 1 for details): (1) conrmed anaphylaxis; (2) unrecognized anaphylaxis; (3) likely IgE mediated;(4) unlikely IgE mediated; and (5) unable to be classied. V.L.M. initiallyreviewed and classied all cases. Dr Allen reviewed all categorizations,and any discrepancies were resolved by Dr Tang. Students reporting multiple reactions were assigned based on the most severe reaction reported. Fig 1 shows categorization of students based on participation and classication of each reaction. The parent questionnaire replicated questions regarding asthma and food allergy status included in the student questionnaire; however, details of foodallergy reactions in the past 12 months were not included in the parentquestionnaires. Statistical methods Self-reported possible food allergy prevalence was expressed as the observed proportion with 95% CIs. Kappa analysis was performed to measure the agreement between dyads of student and parent responses for self-reported food allergy. The prevalence of adverse reactions was calculated as the numberof students reporting a reaction in the past 12 months divided by those withprobable IgE-mediated food allergy. We used logistic regression models to rst identify risk factors for having adverse food reactions among those with possible IgE-mediated food allergy.Second, among those with adverse food reactions, we assessed risk factors for severe compared with mild reactions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between demographic factors (sex, school type, school sector, and student's country of birth) and clinical factors of interest (resolved and current asthma, number of food allergies, and type of food allergies) and the risk of adverse food reactions expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. A separateregression model was conducted for each clinical factor, with the demographicfactors included as a priori confounders and other clinical factors retained only as confounding variables if they altered the OR by greater than 10%.STATA software was used for all statistical analyses (release 14.0; StataCorp,College Station, Tex).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 141, NUMBER 3MCWILLIAM ET AL 983Ethical approval was obtained from the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee, the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, and the Catholic Education Ofce. RESULTS Study population Table I outlines the demographic characteristics of the study population. The mean age was 12 61.2 years, with balanced participation in terms of sex (50.5% males) and school level (51.7% attended primary school).

Details of food allergy reactions in the past 12 months among those with possibleIgE-mediated food allergy Table IV details all episodes of food-induced allergic reactions reported in the 12 months before the study. Among those students with possible IgE-mediated food allergy (n 5547), a total of 372 allergic reactions were reported by 243 (44.4%; 95% CI, 40.3% to 48.7%) students. More than 1 reaction was reported by 34% of students (n 573). A total of 53 students reported 93 reactions that met the criteria for anaphylaxis (conrmed anaphylaxis[n544] and unrecognized anaphylaxis [n 549]) over in a prevalence of 9.7% (95% CI,7.2% to 12.2%). Peanut and tree nut were the reported trigger foods for 43.8% (106/242) of all IgE-mediated reactions and 57% (53/93) of allsevere reactions (conrmed and unrecognized anaphylaxis).Cashew and walnut were the most common tree nuts reported. Home was the location for 37 (39.8%) of the 93 episodes of all types of anaphylaxis (conrmed and unrecognized anaphylaxis),whereas restaurants were the location for 17% (n 516) and schools for 8.6% (n 58). Of the 44 episodes of conrmed anaphylaxis, adrenaline autoinjectors were used for 19 (43.2%)episodes. Risk factors for reporting an adverse food reaction in the past 12 months among those with a possibleIgE-mediated food allergy Table II presents the risk factor analysis for having an adverse reaction to a food in the last 12 months among those with possible IgE-mediated food allergy (n 5547). Adjusted multivariable analysis showed that female subjects (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5), those with either a history 1.1-3.2) or current asthma (aOR, 1.7; 95%CI, 1.1-2.6), and those with more than 2 food allergies (vs single food allergy: aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) were more likely to report an adverse food reaction in the past 12 months. Thosewith nut allergy were less likely to report a food reaction in the past 12 months than those without nut allergy (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8). Risk factors for a food allergy reaction in the past 12 months that met the criteria for anaphylaxisamong those with IgE-mediated food allergy reporting a reaction We compared those who reported a nonsevere IgE-mediated reaction in the past 12 months (n 595) with those who reported a reaction consistent with anaphylaxis (conrmed or unrecognized anaphylaxis, n 553). There was no association between risk of anaphylaxis and demographic factors, current or resolved asthma, and number of food allergies. However, those with nut allergy were almost 3 times more likely to report anaphylaxis in the past 12 months than those without nut allergy (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI,1.1-4.4; Table III ). No evidence of associations were found for modiable risk factors, including previous prescription of an adrenalinautoinjector, carriage patterns for autoinjectors, or higher riskof accidental allergen exposure through knowingly eating the food to which the student was allergic or eating foods labeled with precautionary allergen labeling, such as ''may contain traces of''(data not shown). DISCUSSION This is one of the rst studies to investigate the population prevalence and characterization of adverse food reactions,including anaphylaxis, and associated risk factors in adolescents.These results show that in a population-based sample of 10- to 14-year-old students with possible IgE-mediated food allergy, almost half (44.4%) reported food-induced allergic reactions inthe preceding 12 months, and almost 1 in 10 (9.7%) reported at least 1 reaction with symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. Reactions occurred most frequently in the home and weretriggered most commonly by peanut and tree nuts. Reporting any food allergy reaction in the past 12 months was associated with female sex, having more than 2 food allergies, and havingasthma (resolved or current). Nut allergy was the only risk factorfound to be associated with reporting anaphylaxis. We observed a trend of increased asthma among those with food allergies reporting anaphylaxis compared with milder reactions. However,our results did not show that those with asthma were at signicantly increased risk for severe reactions. A major strength of this study is that it is both population based and highly detailed in its investigation of food-induced allergicreactions in the adolescent age group. This allowed study of all adolescents with food allergies and those experiencing adversefood reactions and is not limited to clinical samples, such as those presenting to health care facilities for treatment after a reaction or managed by allergy clinics. Although clinical samples have thestrength of more robust diagnosis and denition of adversereactions and anaphylaxis, they risk overrepresenting those with more severe food allergy phenotypes, higher socioeconomic status, and greater access to specialized medical managementand education.TABLE I.

The denition of anaphylaxis relied on self-reported symptoms involving breath- ing difculties, which might have overestimated the true preva- lence of anaphylaxis. This denition might also have captured asthmatic episodes that were by chance associated with meals,along with true episodes of food-induced anaphylaxis. However, this is unlikely to have greatly inflated our estimates of anaphylaxis because almost all reactions involving breathing difculties alsohad 1 or more symptoms of skin rash, facial swelling, and/or vomiting. In addition, the study population was restricted to those living in urban/suburban areas of Victoria (within 80 km of thecentral business district), and therefore ndings might not begeneralizable to rural areas. The study was also underpowered to assess the important issue of fatalities in this age group. Although parents have a robust appreciation of their child's clinical history, an adolescents' increasing engagement outsidethe home might reduce the likelihood that parents fully share the adolescent's experience of food allergy. Hence a further strengthof SchoolNuts is the inclusion of both adolescent and parent reporting. This has also allowed validation of self-reported responses for food allergy, asthma, and allergic reaction detailsaddressing the limitation of self-reported data. Kappa analysis showed strong correlation between student and parent dyad responses for self-reported food allergy. However, validation ofstudent reports of food reaction details against parent responseswas not possible because of differences in questionnaires. Medication or health care contact questions relevant to asthma were not included in the student questionnaire.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of food-induced anaphylaxis in patients with food allergy reported a pooledincidence rate of self-reported anaphylaxis in 0- to 19-year-olds of 4.93/100 person years (95% CI, 2.78-8.74) with a range of 0.6 to 8.9/100 person years based on 10 studies. 28Comparison with our results is difcult because the included articles either involved younger children,19,20were based on selected food allergies only,13-19or involved high-risk allergy clinic populations.21Population-representative studies in adolescence are limited, and comparison is difcult because of differences in population food allergy prevalence and studymethodologies. A large study of 11- to 15-year-old Turkish students (n510,096) also recruited adolescents and parents through schools. Using self-reported questionnaires, they reported aslightly higher prevalence of parent-reported food allergy (11.3%) than in our study of adolescent-reported food allergy (9.7%) and a much lower rate of reactions in the past year (3.6%vs 44.5%) in our study. These authors did not report separately on the frequency of anaphylaxis. 29 Reported only by abstract at this stage, a large birth cohort study in Sweden with a follow-up at 16 years of age reportedmuch lower rates of adverse reactions, with 8.5% of 16-year-olds reporting reactions to food in the past 12 months and 0.8%experiencing anaphylaxis. Overall food allergy prevalence wasnot reported. 30 Finally, in a population-based study of 0- to 17-year-olds in Germany, 38% self-reported food-induced allergic reactions.TABLE II.

Self-reported food allergy prevalence of 6.6% in young adolescents within the SchoolNutsstudy supports the natural history of resolution of food allergy for many children with food allergy. However, the nding that almost half of 10- to 14-year-old adolescents with food allergiesexperienced reactions in the past 12 months highlights theongoing burden that food allergy has on subjects, with subsequent effects on their families and health care facilities. We found that female subjects were more likely to report experiencing any adverse food reaction in the past 12 months butfound no signicant sex difference associated with anaphylaxis. This is in contrast to observations of increased risk of fatality fromanaphylaxis in adolescent male subjects and might reflect the younger age group in our study. 9 Our data suggest a benet from the current compulsory training around food allergy that has been in place in the educationalsector in Australia (rst introduced from 2008 in some states) because fewer reactions occurred in schools compared withrestaurants and homes. However, this might simply reflect thatmore meals are eaten at home versus school or eating out. Moreover, the nding that just over half of reactions occurred in the home highlights the importance of allergen avoidance andeducation/management strategies targeted at preventingaccidental exposure in all environments and not just schools. We note that less than half (43.2%) of the cases of conrmed anaphylaxis reported adrenalin autoinjector administration, andthis worrying result requires further exploration. It is unclearwhether this is simply a result of underreporting as a result of retrospective recall or whether this represents true underadministration. However, it is important to note that thewell-known risk of anaphylaxis, including reported fatalities in the school environment, has resulted in legislated guidelines for anaphylaxis management for schools in Australia. All Victorianschools with an enrolled student at risk of anaphylaxis aremandated to have an annually updated action plan for each student at risk of anaphylaxis, staff must undertake regular training on anaphylaxis management and autoinjectoradministration, and generic autoinjectors must be available within the school. In SchoolNuts one third (32.4%) of adolescents with food allergy reported current asthma. This is much higher than in theTurkish school-based population-representative study, which reported a prevalence of asthma of 12.3% in those with foodallergy. 29We also found those with asthma (both resolved and current asthma) were almost twice as likely to report a foodreaction in the past 12 months compared with those with nohistory of asthma. Surprisingly, those reporting anaphylaxis hadmore asthma than those reporting milder reactions; however, asthma was not found to be signicantly associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis.

Asthma as a risk factor for food-induced anaphylaxis requires further investigation. Peanut and tree nuts were the most common food allergies reported in our study, including among students with a history ofanaphylaxis, which is consistent with other studies. 24,32-34 Among those reporting reactions, nut allergy increased the risk3-fold of having a reaction consistent with anaphylaxis whencompared with those without nut allergy. Yet among those with IgE-mediated food allergy, nut allergy was associated with decreased risk of having a reaction in the past 12 months. Thisapparently paradoxical result might be the result of widespread awareness of the potential severity of nut allergy and adoption of strategies to assist in nut avoidance, such as food policiesbanning nuts. It might also be easier to avoid nut ingestion than other more ubiquitous food allergens, such as egg or milk. However, the association of nut allergy with more severereactions might be that once accidental exposure to an allergen occurs, nuts elicit more severe reactions than exposure to other allergens, such as milk and egg, which are often tolerated in abaked or processed form. 35,36TABLE IV.

This might reflect that the chance of accidental exposure is higher if multiple food allergens need to be avoided. Additionally, this might beindicative of a higher-risk subset of adolescents with multiplefood allergies because of coexisting allergies to the more common later-onset allergies (sh/shellsh, nuts, or both) together with persistent milk allergy, egg allergy, or both. Milk and egg allergyhave previously been thought to resolve by early school age, but recent data suggest increasing persistence into adolescence, with persistent allergy associated with more severe reactions to milkand egg. 35,36Turner's report of anaphylaxis in adolescents from a tertiary clinical center in London37showed that the majority of those with recent severe anaphylactic reactions had been triggeredby exposure to cow's milk protein in the context of persistentcow's milk allergy from earlier childhood. Although the study by Turner 37did not report the presence of other coexisting food allergies, adolescents with multiple food allergies, including unresolved milk allergy, egg allergy, or both, might represent a higher-risk phenotype for anaphylaxis that has not been sufciently considered to date. In conclusion, within a population-based sample of 10- to 14-year-old adolescents with food allergy in Melbourne, Australia,there was an alarmingly high rate of food-induced allergicreactions, including anaphylaxis. Reactions occurred most frequently in the home and were most commonly triggered by peanut and tree nuts. Those with asthma and more than 2 foodallergies were at greatest risk for reactions, but those with nutallergies were most at risk of reactions consistent with anaphylaxis.

This study offers population-representative data on the frequency, characteris- tics, and associated risk factors for adverse food reactionsamong adolescents. It highlights also the alarming frequency of adverse food reactions among adolescents and the need for specic management and education strategies aimed at allergenavoidance in this high-risk age group.

This research was also presented as an oral poster at the European Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Paediatric Meeting (PAAM) in London October 2017. Studies in children of tree nut allergy prevalence based on OFC outcomes have been limited, with no Australian studies to date. Development of tree nut allergy in childhood is also understudied. T he first presentation for children with food allergy is often via reactions to milk, peanut and/or egg in infancy and early sensitisation to tree nuts is reported in 19% of those with food allergies by 2 years of age.169 How this early sensitisation relates to the subsequent development of tree nut allergy is uncertain and has not been studied at the population level nor systematically assessed using protocolised challenges. There is a current clinical dilemma as to what should be done regarding tree nut allergy testing and introduction advice for those with either peanut allergy or other forms of food allergy in infancy Therefore, this manuscript addresses the following research questions: 1.What is the prevalence of tree nut allergy in Australian children aged 1 and 6 years of age? d)What is the prevalence of parent-reported tree nut allergy in the HealthNuts study at age 1 year? e)What is the prevalence of challenge-confirmed tree nut allergy in the HealthNuts study at age 6 years?f)What are the most common individual tree nut allergies in children at age 6 years? 2.What proportion of those with challenge-confirmed food allergy at age one year are tree nut sensitised? 3.What is the relationship between tree nut sensitisation at age one year and tree nu t allergy at age 6 years? 4.What is the relationship between food allergy type at age one year and tree nut allergy at age 6 years? 5.What is the frequency of co-allergy to peanut and other nuts at age 6 years ?Patterns of tree nut sensitization and allergy in the rst 6 years of life in a population-based cohort Vicki McWilliam, MND,a,b,cRachel Peters, Allen, MD, PhD,a,b,c,g* for the HealthNuts investigators /C224 Melbourne, Australia, and Manchester, United Kingdom Background: Longitudinal population-based data regarding tree nut allergy are limited. Objectives: We sought to determine the population prevalence of tree nut allergy at age 6 years and explore the relationship between egg and peanut allergy at age 1 year and developmentof tree nut allergy at age 6 years. Methods: A population-based sample of 5276 children was recruited at age 1 year and followed up at age 6 years. At age1 year, allergies to egg and peanut were determined by means of oral food challenge, and parents reported their child's history of reaction to tree nuts. Challenge-conrmed tree nut allergy wasassessed at age 6 years.Results: At age 1 year, the prevalence of parent-reported tree nut allergy was 0.1% (95% CI, 0.04% to 0.2%). Only 18.5% of infants had consumed tree nuts in the rst year of life. At age6 years, challenge-conrmed tree nut allergy prevalence was3.3% (95% CI, 2.2% to 3.3%). Of children with peanut allergyonly at age 1 year, 27% (95% CI, 16.1% to 39.7%) had tree nut allergy at age 6 years compared with 14% (95% CI, 10.4% to 17.9%) of those with egg allergy only and 37% (95% CI, 27.2%to 47.4%) of those with both peanut and egg allergy. Conclusions: Tree nut allergy is uncommon in the rst year of life, likely because of limited tree nut consumption. At age6 years, tree nut allergy prevalence is similar to peanut allergy prevalence. More than a third of children with both peanut and egg allergy in infancy have tree nut allergy at age 6 years.Understanding how to prevent tree nut allergy should be anurgent priority for future research. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;nnn :nnn-nnn.) Key words: Food allergy, sensitization, tree nut allergy, prevalence, population Tree nut allergies are usually lifelong and together with peanut allergy are the most common cause of food-induced anaphylaxis and related fatalities.1,2Unlike peanut allergy, population-based data regarding tree nut allergy are limited. Recently, we reported that 2.3% of 10- to 14-year-old Australian children had clinic-conrmed tree nut allergy3;h o w - ever, prevalence estimates using challenge conrmation remain limited at less than 10 years of age. To date, studies in younger children of challenge-conrmed food allergy outcomes havebeen limited to regions reporting very low overall rates of food al- lergy (<1%) 4-6or where low numbers of tree nut food challenges were performed.7 Development of tree nut allergy in childhood is also understudied, with little understanding of the role of early tree nut sensitization and food allergy type. The rst presen-tation for children with food allergy is often through reactions to peanut or egg in infancy. Children with peanut allergy are thought to be at increased risk of tree nut allergies, witharound 30% of pediatric patients presenting with peanutallergy reported to have allergies to tree nuts. 8-12To date, no study has explored this clinical observation at the populationlevel nor systematically assessed the association using proto-colized challenges. The current clinical dilemma remains: What should be done regarding tree nut allergy testing and introduction advice for those with either peanut allergy orother forms of food allergy in infancy? The objectives of this study were to estimate the population prevalence of clinic-conrmed tree nut allergies during the rst6 years of life and describe the patterns of coexisting allergies toFromathe Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne;bthe Department of Pae- diatrics,dthe Allergy and Lung Health Unit Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, andethe Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne; the Departments ofcAllergy and Immunology andfGeneral Medicine, Royal Chil- dren's Hospital, Melbourne; andgthe University of Manchester. *These authors contributed equally to this work. /C224The HealthNuts investigators who are not individually named as authors are Terence Dwyer, Adrian Lowe, Melissa Wake, and Colin Robertson.

We also aimed to explore the relationship between food allergy at age 1 year and the subsequentdevelopment of tree nut allergy at age 6 years. METHODS The HealthNuts study is a population-representative longitudinal study of 5276 children recruited at age 1 year and followed up to age 6 years. The study methods have been described in detail previously.13-15To summarize, between 2007 and 2011, 5276 infants aged between 11 and 15 months were recruited from immunization clinics around Melbourne, Australia. At recruitment, all infants underwent skin prick tests (SPTs) to egg, peanut,and sesame, and parents completed a questionnaire. The rst half of the cohort also had SPTs to shrimp, whereas the second half of the cohort had SPTs to cow's milk. 13 SPTs were performed with single-tine lancets (Stallergenes, Antony, France) on the infant's back using allergens from ALK-Abell /C19o (Madrid, Spain), along with a positive control (10 mg/mL histamine) and a negative control (saline). Wheal size was measured after 15 minutes and calculated bysubtracting the negative control from the average of the longest diameter andthe diameter perpendicular to it. Parental report of the history of allergic reactions in the rst year of life was determined by means of questionnaire. All children who showed any reaction on SPTs (wheal size > _1 mm), as well as a random sample of those with negative SPT responses, were invited to attend a study clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital for repeat SPTs and oral food challenges (OFCs). At age 1 year, OFCs were performed only for egg, peanut, and sesame. Those attending the clinic had additional SPTs performed for tree nuts (almond, cashew, and hazelnut). No OFCs were performed for tree nuts at age1 year. For those with negative SPT responses to tree nuts, home introductionwas advised. For those with positive SPT responses, avoidance wasrecommended. Follow-up methods at 4 and 6 years of age have been described previously. 14To summarize, at age 4 years, all participants were followed up by means of questionnaire, and those who reported a new food-inducedallergic reaction and those who had any food allergy at age 1 year were invited for clinic assessment that included SPTs and OFCs. At age 6 years, the entire cohort (n 55276) was invited to participate in questionnaire and SPT assessment. Questionnaires were mailed to allparticipants, capturing demographi c details, history of food allergy and new food reactions, common allergen exposure information, and history of asthma/wheeze and eczema. All partic ipants were invited for an allergy/ health assessment that included SPTs to a predetermined panel of 8 foods (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, sesame, cashew, almond, and hazelnut) and was conducted either in the child's home or at the Royal Children's Hospital.Those with positive SPT responses (>1 mm) or parent-reported reactions tofoods consistent with an IgE-mediated allergy were invited for a clinic appointment with a specialist allergy nurse, and OFCs were conducted when indicated by using a standardized protocol (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). Those who were sensitized to almond, cashew, or hazelnut had additional tree nut SPTs performed to all nontoler- ated tree nuts at the second clinic visit, including Brazil nut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio, and walnut. OF Cs were conducted, as previously described, 16and results were deemed positive if they met at least 1 of the following predened criteria: (1) 3 or mo re concurrent noncontact urticarias lasting at least 5 minutes; (2) severe persistent vom iting; (3) perioral or peri- orbital angioedema; or (4) anaphylaxis (evidence of circulatory or respira-tory involvement) within 2 hours of the last challenge dose in the presence of IgE sensitization.Denitions Age 1 year. Sensitized tolerant to egg, peanut, or sesame was dened as an SPT response of 2 mm or greater and a negative OFC result to that food. Egg, peanut, or sesame allergy was dened as an SPT response of 2 mm or greater and a positive OFC result to that food. Milk allergy was dened as an SPT response of 2 mm or greater and a his- tory of reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy. Parent-reported tree nut allergy was dened as parental report of a reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy to 1 or more tree nuts (any acuteonset of skin rash, facial swelling, vomiting, or breathing difculties within 1 hour of food ingestion). Tree nut sensitization was dened as an SPT response of 3 mm or greater to almond, cashew, or hazelnut. Tree nut tolerance was dened as a history of tolerance on ingestion or a negative SPT response when undertaken. Age 6 years. Tree nut sensitization was dened as an SPT response of 3 mm or greater to almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan,pistachio, or walnut. Denite tree nut allergy was dened as any of the following: (1) positive OFC result and IgE sensitization at age 6 years; (2) history of objective reac-tion in the past 12 months consistent with HealthNuts OFC stopping criteriaafter denite exposure to the food of interest and evidence of IgE sensitizationat 6 years; or (3) a positive OFC result at age 4 years and SPT response of 8 mm or greater at 6 years of age. Probable tree nut allergy was dened as any of the following: (1) SPT response of 8 mm or greater but no age 4 years OFC or recent reaction historyand no known tolerance or (2) SPT response of 3 to 7 mm at age 6 years and one of (A) positive OFC result at age 4 years, (B) history of objective reactionmore than 12 months ago consistent with HealthNuts OFC stopping criteriaafter denite exposure to the food of interest, or (C) parental report of food avoidance because of allergy. Tree nut tolerant was dened as any of the following: (1) negative OFC result; (2) SPT response of 0 to 2 mm; (3) SPT response of 3 to 7 mm and parent-reported ingestion history (eaten >1 time since age 4 years); or (4) no reaction since age 4 years and no parental report of food avoidance. Statistical methods The prevalence of tree nut allergy was calculated among those who completed an allergy assessment at age 6 years (n 53232) and limited to the tree nuts included in the screen ing SPT panel (cashew, hazelnut, and almond). Those with negative SPT responses were deemed tree nuttolerant. To assess whether these estimates were influenced by characteristics that were associated with participation in allergy assessment at age 6 years, we adjusted for differences in risk factors between participants with and without missing data at age 6 years by using the inverse probability weighting method. 17This reweighting was used to reflect the distribution of risk fac- tors among those approached but did not participate versus those who under-went a full allergy assessment. Weights were the inverse of the predicted probability of participation obtained after tting a logistic regression model including covariate risk factors that were associated with completing anassessment rather than questionnaire only or nonparticipation (socioeco- nomic status, family history of allergy, parent country of birth, and whether the child had challenge-conrmed food allergy or eczema at age 1 year).This generated a propensity score for each participant. 17 As a sensitivity analysis, tree nut allergy prevalence was calculated as the number of children with tree nut allergy (denite or probable tree nut allergy)to 1 or more tree nuts expressed as a proportion of the entire HealthNuts cohort(n55276). It was assumed that those with no SPT data and no known food allergy were tree nut tolerant. This provides the most conservative prevalence estimate. All prevalence estimates are reported as the observed proportion with 95% CIs calculated by using the normal approximation to the binomialdistribution. The proportion of those with nut allergies (denite and probable allergy) with coallergy to other tree nuts was calculated. As a sensitivity analysis, thisproportion has also been calculated with all those sensitized at between 3 andJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL nnn20182MCWILLIAM ET AL Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of Melbourne from ClinicalKey.com.au by Elsevier on October 08, 2018.

Both calculations have been reported. Ethics Ethics approval was obtained for the HealthNuts study from the Victorian State Government Ofce for Children (reference no. CDF/07/492), theVictorian State Government Department of Human Services (reference no. 10/07), and the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no. 27047). RESULTS An overview of the HealthNuts study is provided in Fig 1 . A total of 5276 one-year-old infants participated in the Health- Nuts study at age 1 year (74% participation). Of these, 924 hadpositive SPT responses to egg, peanut, sesame, or shrimp/cow's milk; attended the OFC clinic; and had SPTs to tree nuts (cashew, almond, and hazelnut). An additional 193 control subjects withnegative results attended the clinic for SPTs. At age 1 year, 530participants were given a diagnosis of OFC-conrmed food al-lergy to egg, peanut, or sesame. At age 6 years, 84.4% of the cohort participated in follow-up, with 61.3% (n 53232) completing both a questionnaire and allergy assessment, including tree nut SPTs, and 23.1%(n51222) completing a questionnaire only. Participants with a family history of allergy and children with eczema or food allergyat age 1 year were more likely to participate in the follow-up atage 6 years ( Table I ). Parent-reported tree nut allergy at age 1 year At age 1 year, 6 parents reported a reaction to tree nut consistent with an IgE-mediated food reaction, representing an overallprevalence of 0.1% (95% CI, 0.04% to 0.2%) among the wholecohort of 5276 infants. The low prevalence of reactions might be due to the low consumption of tree nuts in the rst year of life, with only 18.5% of parents reporting that their infants hadconsumed any tree nut by age 1 year.Age 1 Age 6HealthNuts cohort Age 1yr (SPT to peanut) clinic clinic assessment n=4159 Food allergic n=530No food allergy n=587 Allergy assessment inc.

Tree nut sensitization was less common in infants who were sensitized to 1 or more foods but not allergic (sensitizedtolerant; 12% [95% CI, 9.4% to 16.6%]) and food sensitization (5.2% [95% CI, 2.7% to 9.3%; Table II ). Tree nut sensitization was more common in infants with both peanut and egg allergy (48.4% [95% CI, 38% to 58.9%])compared with that in infants with single egg or peanut allergies (23.6% [95% CI, respectively; Table II ). Tree nut allergy at age 6 years At age 6 years, 234 children were sensitized, and 154 children were allergic to 1 or more tree nuts. Of those with an SPT to treenuts at age 6 years (n 53232), the observed prevalence of tree nutsensitization was 7.3% (95% CI, 6.4% to 8.3%), 4.3% (95% CI, 3.8% to 5.2%; see E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). After re- weighting this estimate for differences in characteristics of sub-jects who did and did not participate in assessments at age 6 years, the weighted prevalence of tree nut allergy was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.8% to 4.0%). Cashew CI, 0.1% to 0.5%]; Fig 2 ). All other individual tree nut allergies were diagnosed in less than 1.0% of participants (pistachio, n 550; and Brazil nut, n 55;Table III ). Among the whole cohort of 5276 children, the prevalence of tree nut sensitization was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.9% to 5.0%) was 3.1% (95% CI, 2.6% to 3.6%). This estimate is likely to be conservative because it assumes that all children whowere lost to follow-up did not have tree nut allergy. Collectively,tree nut allergy prevalence (3.3%) was similar to peanut allergy prevalence (2.8% [95% CI, 2.4% to 3.3%). A summary of the SPT and OFC outcomes at age 6 years is included in Fig E2 in this ar- ticle's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org . Coallergy patterns among tree nuts Coallergy patterns among those with any nut allergy are outlined in Table III . Of the 154 children with any tree nut allergy at age 6 years, 42.9% (n 566) also had peanut allergy at age 6 years. Eighty-four (52.2%) were allergic to only 1 tree nut,26.7% to 2 tree nuts, 12.4% to 3 tree nuts, and 8.7% to morethan 3 tree nuts. Of those with cashew allergy, 36% had coexisting pistachio allergy, and if all those with pistachio sensitization re- sults of between 3 and 7 mm who did not have an OFC weredeemed allergic, this increased to 46%. Of the 147 children with peanut allergy at age 6 years, 45% also had 1 or more tree nut allergies. The most common tree nutcoallergy for those with peanut allergy at age 6 years was to cashew (36.7%; Table III ). Tree nut allergy at age 6 years among children with egg or peanut allergy in infancy Of those with peanut allergy only at age 1 year, 27% had tree nut allergy at age 6 years compared with 14% of those with egg allergy only. A greater proportion (37%) of those with both peanut and egg allergy at age 1 year had tree nut allergy at age 6 years ( Fig 3 ). Tree nut sensitization at age 1 year and development of tree nut allergy at age 6 years Of 168 children who were sensitized to cashew at age 1 year, 39% had cashew allergy, and 35% were cashew tolerant at age 6y e a r s( Table IV ). Of those sensitized to almond at age 1 year (n587), 11% had almond allergy, and 59% were almond tolerant, whereas of those sensitized to hazelnut (n 572), 19% had hazelnut allergy, and 53% were hazelnut tolerant at age 6 years.

It is also the rst population-based study to charac- terize the development of tree nut allergy among children with infantile egg and peanut allergy. We found the prevalence of treenut allergy at age 6 years (3.3%) to be as common as that of peanut allergy (2.8%), with cashew the most common individual tree nut allergy (2.7%). At age 1 year, 41% of those with challenge-conrmed allergy to egg or peanut were already sensitized to 1 or more tree nuts, and those with both allergies were at greatest risk for tree nut sensitization. Cashew was the most common tree nutsensitization at age 1 year, and around 40% of children sensitized to cashew at age 1 year were allergic to cashew at 6 years of age. Almost half (48%) of the children with both peanut and eggallergy at age 1 year had tree nut allergy at age 6 years. The strengths of the HealthNuts study are the large population- representative sample, high participation fraction, and goodinternal and external validity. 13The follow-up at age 6 years had high cohort retention (>80%). Most tree nut allergy outcomes were clinically conrmed based on objective criteria, with out- comes based on predetermined objective stopping criteria, andthe remainder were determined based on large SPT wheal sizes and a history of reported objective adverse reactions consistent with IgE-mediated food allergies. Limitations included use of open OFCs rather than double- blind, placebo-controlled OFCs, although only objective criteria were used to dene a positive challenge result, and nurses were blind to SPT wheal size and history of previous reaction. Not allstudy participants had SPT or nut consumption data available at age 6 years. Almond, cashew, and hazelnut had more complete screening, and there are limited SPT and OFC data for theadditional tree nuts. Most of those deemed allergic to Brazil nut,macadamia nut, pecan, pistachio, and walnut are based on high-level sensitization (SPT response, >8 mm) but not OFC results,and many of those with midrange sensitization (3-7 mm) did not have OFCs performed. This limits the coallergy patterns reported and is an important factor to consider for tree nut allergy studies inthe future. In addition, there is also likely to be an allergic bias inparticipation and follow-up at age 6 years. Therefore we have reported a range of more and less conservative observed prevalence estimates and a population prevalence estimate fortree nut allergy reweighted for factors that were associated with participation at age 6 years. There are few prevalence studies reporting challenge- conrmed outcomes for tree nut allergy. Recently, we undertooka systematic review of tree nut allergy prevalence internationally and found estimates ranged from 0.05% to 4.9%. However, therewas signicant study heterogeneity resulting from differences instudy design and diagnostic methods. We found 7 studies in children reporting challenge-conrmed tree nut outcomes ranging from 0% to 1.4%. 18Most of these estimates come from countries or regions with low overall food allergy prevalence.4-6 Our SchoolNuts study of 10,000 children aged 10 to 14 years re-ported clinic-dened tree nut allergy of 2.3% by using the sameOFC protocols as the current HealthNuts study. 3The slightly lower prevalence in the SchoolNuts study might reflect the olderage group studied. Estimates of allergy prevalence for individual tree nuts are also limited. Our systematic review found high regional variation,with European studies reporting hazelnut as the most commontree nut allergy, largely because of the high rate of birch pollenallergy and its cross-reactivity with hazelnut. In the United Kingdom Brazil nut was reported as the most common tree nut allergy, and walnut and cashew were reported as the mostcommon tree nut allergy in the United States. Here we found cashew to be the most common tree nut sensitization at age 1 year and allergy at age 6 years. Our Australian SchoolNuts study alsoreported cashew as the most common tree nut allergy in 10- to 14- year-olds and the most common tree nut trigger for food-induced anaphylaxis. 3The overall nut coallergy prevalence reported in our study (45%) was greater than that of the population-representativeSchoolNuts study reporting 30% of 10- to 14-year-olds with pea- nut allergy having 1 or more tree nut allergies and 30% of those with a tree nut allergy having 1 or more additional tree nut al-lergies. Several single-center allergy clinics have also reported similar rates of coallergy to 1 or more tree nuts among children with peanut allergy 10,11,19,20; however, Fleischer et al2reported a higher rate of coexisting peanut allergy (68%) among 190TABLE II.

Cashew-pistachio and walnut-pecan belong to the same botanical families (Anacardiaceae and Juglandaceae, respec-tively) and have a reported reactivity 8,21and coallergy. The NutCracker study, a single-center prospective cohort study of 83 children with tree nut allergy inIsrael, reported two thirds of those with walnut and cashew allergy were also allergic to pecan and pistachio, respectively, whereas all those with pecan and pistachio allergy were allergic to walnut andcashew, respectively. 22Andorf et al,23in a study of 60 selected pa- tients with multifood allergy, reported all those allergic to coexisting pecan allergy. They reported a unidirectionality ofthe coallergies, with only two thirds of those patients with walnut and cashew allergy allergic to pecan and pistachio, respectively, suggesting that some allergenic proteins are shared, whereasothers are unique to cashew and walnut, resulting in monoallergy. We found a lower proportion of those with cashew allergy having coexisting pistachio allergy. We did not nd pecan-walnutcoallergy to be as common as other studies. The differencesobserved might be due to the limitations of tree nut screening and OFCs in our study because although a smaller study (n 587), the NutCracker study, did complete OFCs for all sensitized tree nuts, which we were not able to achieve. The observed differences might also to be due to regional differences. Data on rates of early tree nut sensitization are limited. In 2005, Clark and Ewan 10reported that by 2 years of age, 19% of those with peanut allergy were sensitized to 1 or more nuts. This wasa single-center allergy cohort limited to 47 patients with peanut allergy only. We have reported a markedly higher rate of treenut sensitization among those with peanut allergy in our popula- tion cohort of 33.3%. We also report for the rst time a high rate of tree nut sensitization among all those with food allergy at age1 year and not just peanut allergy. Consideration should be given to identifying this high-risk group of infants in the general popu- lation to activate allergy prevention strategies. This study has found that at 6 years of age, collectively, rates of tree nut allergy are almost as high as those of peanut allergy, with cashew the most common tree nut allergy. Up to half of those withTABLE III.

Hazelnut, almond, and cashew SPTs were performed for all study participants. The full tree nut SPT panel was only performed for those sensitized to either almond, cashew, or hazelnut.

Evidence that tree nut allergy can be prevented might be required before making recommendations to identify and target children at high risk oftree nut allergy early in life. Clinical implications: Up to 48% of those with food allergy at age 1 year were found to be tree nut sensitized, and more than a third of those tree nut-sensitized patients had tree nut allergyat age 6 years.

As for other forms of food allergy, tree nut allergy diagnosis is primarily via SPT and sIgE together with OFC . The application of 95%PPVs can assist clinicians with the decision of when an OFC may be warranted, however published 95% PPV data for tree nuts remains limited. Previous studies as part of this PhD have found cashew to be the most common individual tree nut allergy and the most common trigger of adverse reactions in Australia highlighting a priority need for improved diagnostic tools for cashew allergy. This final manuscript as part of this PhD addresses the following research questions: 1.What are the SPT wheal sizes that correlate with a 95% PPV of a positive oral food challenge for cashew? 2.Do these thresholds differ when stratified by allergy clinic or general population cohorts? 3.Do these thresholds differ when stratified by known risk factors for food allergy?Chapter 7 - Improving the Diagnosis of Tree Nut Allergy 1037.2 The Manuscript SPT predictive values for the outcome of cashew challenges in children Authors: Vicki McWilliam, MND 1,2,3,8, Rachel L.

To date there have been few studies of diagnostic tests for cashew allergy, and positive predictive values (PPVs) for cashew as well as other tree nuts are largely extrapolated from studies of peanut allergy. How relevant these cut-offs are for cashew has not been formally explored. Objective : We aimed to establish skin prick test (SPT) wheal sizes that correlated to 95% PPV for a positive food challenge for cashew. Methods: We included all cashew oral food challenges (OFC) conducted as part of the HealthNuts (n=108, age 4-6 years) and SchoolNuts (n=37, age 10-14 years) studies, both recruited from the community (Population cohort). A second cohort of all cashew OFCs cond ucted at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) allergy centre (n=343) (2011-2016) and a private allergy clinic based at RCH (n=43) was included via electronic medical record review (Clinic cohort) . 95% PPV for cashew SPT was calculated for both cohorts. Results: Among the population cohort (n=145), 62% of cashew OFC were positive compared to 20% of the clinic cohort (n=386) . The SPT threshold for 95% PPV derived from the population cohort was 10mm (95%CI 7.5-12.0). For the clinic cohort the (95%CI 9.5- unknown). A SPT 8mm had a PPV of 89 (95%CI 79-95) in the population cohort and 62 (95%CI 45-78) in the clinic cohort. Conclusion: A higher SPT wheal size may be more appropriate than the commonly used 8mm cut-off to guide clinical decisions around when to perform OFC for cashew.

Cashew has been reported as the most common tree nut allerg en and the most common cause of adverse food reactions and anaphylaxis 2-4. It has also been reported that reactions to cashew can be more severe than those to peanut 5-8. Despite these reports, cashew allergy remains understudied. Diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy is reliant on a detailed medical history and physical examination, in conjunction with diagnostic testing of immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels either via serum specific IgE measurements (sIgE) or skin prick testing (SPT)9. Diagnosis of cashew allergy, like other tree nuts, can be problematic with allergy screening tests often performed for tree nuts for those with allergy to other foods and no history of prior ingestion or reaction to cashew. We have previously reported that up to half of those with egg and peanut allergy can be sensitised on SPT to tree nuts as early as one year of age1 . The diagnostic gold standard is to perform an oral food challenge (OFC), however this is time and labour intensive, limited in availability in many tertiary allergy services and exposes the child to the risk of severe reactions 10. This can result in patients being advised to avoid multiple tree nuts based on sensitisation alone, which, given recently published evidence of the protective effect of early allergen introduction, may increase their risk of developing tree nut allergy 11. SPT and sIgE thresholds above which the individual has a 95% probability of being clinically allergic (95% positive predictive value (PPV)) have been used as a tool for clinicians to determine when an OFC should be performed. In Australia, SPTs are performed in preference to sIgE in most paediatric allergy clinics. PPVs are dependent on the underlying prevalence of disease (in other words, the pre-test probability of food allergy), which is likely to depend on factors such as age, SPT method and the population in which the allergy testing is being performed 12, 13. Clinic- based PPV studies often do not report the reason for challenge, however in our experience most OFC in the clinical setting are undertaken to determine resolution of allergy (tolerance) rather than a diagnostic challenge. Those at higher risk of reaction, such as those with high SPT wheal sizes are not offered an OFC, which impacts the pre-test probability of food allergy. PPVs for SPT have now been widely published for peanut, egg, milk and sesame in both clinical and population cohorts 14-26. There is limited data on tree nut PPVs and no data derived from population cohorts16, 27. With the possibility of increasing prevalence and severity of cashew allergy there is an urgent need for more accurate, timely and cost effective diagnostic methods. We aimed to establish the SPT wheal size that correlated with 95% positive predictive value to a positive oral food challenge for cashew in a population-based cohort of children and a clinic- based cohort of children. We also aimed to explore if these thresholds differ when stratified by known risk factors for cashew allergy (co-existing peanut or other food allergy, co-existing atopy, previous reaction history, age and sex). Methods Study Populations: The population cohort of this study comprised of participants who underwent cashew OFC as part of the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies . The HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies are two large population-based allergy studies done at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute . Both studies recruited participants from the community. Cashew OFCs were performed at 4-year-old and 6-year-old follow-up in the HealthNuts study, whereas the SchoolNuts study assessed students aged 10-14 years. The study populations are outlined in further detail below. The HealthNuts study is a population-representative longitudinal study of 5276 children recruited at age 1 and followed up to age 6 years. The study methods have been described in detail previously 28-30. To summarise, between 2007 and 2011, 5276 infants aged between 11-15 months were recruited from immunisation clinics around Melbourne, Australia (74% participation). At recruitment all infants underwent skin prick testing (SPT) to four common allergens (peanut, egg, sesame and milk), those with detectable SPT responses were invited to the R oyal Children's Hospital Melbourne for a formal OFC (83% of those eligible attended). At age 4 years all participants were followed up via questionnaire (83% participation) and those who reported a new food allergy reaction, and those who had any food allergy at age 1 year, were invited for clinic assessment that included SPT to a predetermined panel of 8 foods (milk, egg, peanut, wheat, sesame, cashew, almond and hazelnut). All those with a SPT>=1mm were offered an OFC. Chapter 7 - Improving the Diagnosis of Tree Nut Allergy 107At age 6 years the entire cohort (n=5276) were invited to participate in questionnaire and SPT assessment. Questionaries were mailed to all participants capturing demographic details, history of food allergy and new food reactions, common allergen exposure information, history of asthma/wheeze and eczema. All participants were invited for an allergy/health assessment that included SPT to the same predetermined panel of 8 foods as age 4 years (60.5% participation). All those with a positive SPT (>=1mm) were offered a cashew OFC except those that had a cashew positive OFC at age 4 years and a cashew SPT >=8mm at 6 years or a recent history of IgE-mediated reaction. The SchoolNuts study is a cross-sectional population-based study that aimed to determine the population prevalence of challenge- proven food allergy in early adolescence. The study methods have been described in detail previously 2, 31. Briefly, recruitment was via stratified random population-based sampling of schools in Melbourne (n=9663) from 2011-2014. Questionnaires with phone follow up were used to identify students with potential IgE-mediated food allergy. Students with potential IgE mediated food allergy were invited to attend a clinic assessment for allergy testing (SPT) to a panel of 15 food allergens (egg white, cow's milk, soy, peanut, cashew, almond, hazelnut, walnut, pistachio, macadamia, pecan, brazil nut, pine nut, sesame, shellfish) and a panel of environmental allergens. Students were eligible for OFC if they had a positive SPT result ( 3mm) to a food that they had a history of reaction to and were currently avoiding, or that they had never eaten. OFC were not performed if participants met any one of the following criteria: 1. were sensitised ( 3mm) and had a past history of a severe reaction requiring multiple doses of adrenaline, 2. Reported an episode of anaphylaxis when older than 10 years of age, 3. reported a food reaction in the past 12 months consistent with an IgE-mediated food allergy reaction, or 4. were highly sensitised (8mm) and reported a past history of reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy. The clinic cohort of this study comprised of patients who had undergone a cashew OFC as part of the allergy clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) between 2011 and 2016 and a private allergy clinic- based at RCH, the Melbourne Allergy and Children's Centre (MACCS) , that opened in 2015 and had an OFC database established from 2016. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all sequential open cashew OFCs undertaken at both sites. Patients undergoing cashew OFC were identified from the electronic medical records databases at both the RCH and MACCS. Cashew SPT wheal size, co-existing food allergy, current and resolved comorbid allergic disease and food and environmental allergen sensitisation were extracted via chart review. Those with their most recent cashew SPT conducted more than 3 months prior to OFC were excluded. Skin prick testing: All SPT performed at RCH, MACCS and the HealthNuts study were performed on the chil d's back, while the SchoolNuts study utilised the volar aspect of the student's forearm. Wheal size was measured after 15 minutes and calculated by subtracting the negative control from the average of the longest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to it. SPTs for MACCS and RCH were performed with Quintip device (Stallergenes, Antony, France) and the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies were performed with single-tine lancets (Stallergenes, Antony, France) using cashew extract along with a positive and negative saline control. Extracts for the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies were ALK-Abello SA, Madrid, Spain and RCH and MACCS Hollister-Stier, Stallergenes, Antony, France. All SPT were performed within 3 months prior to cashew OFC. Oral food challenges: Criteria for undergoing cashew oral food challenges HealthNuts participants with a cashew SPT 1mm or a parent-reported reaction consistent with an IgE-mediated allergy were invited for a clinic appointment with a specialist allergy nurse and OFC. The low SPT cut-off for sensitisation was applied in the HealthNuts study to ensure that all potential cases of food allergy were detected. Cashew OFC were offered at both the 4-year-old and 6-year-old follow up. SchoolNuts participants with a parent-reported history of an adverse food reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy were invited to participate in an allergy assessment which included cashew SPT. Those with a cashew SPT 3mm were invited for cashew OFC. Cashew OFC protocols OFC dosage protocols for all sites were consistent with those of the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) using graded, incremental doses administered at 15- to 20- minute intervals with a top dose of 2 teaspoons of crushed cashew. OFC protocols for the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies have been previously described2, 32. An OFC was deemed positive if it met at least one of the following predefined criteria: (1) three or more concurrent non-contact urticaria lasting at least 5 minutes; (2) severe persistent vomiting; (3) peri-oral or peri-orbital angioedema; or (4) anaphylaxis (evidence of circulatory or respiratory involvement) within 2 hours of the last challenge dose in the presence of IgE sensitisation. For the SchoolNuts study, additional criteria based on persistent subjective symptoms in the upper airways or the Chapter 7 - Improving the Diagnosis of Tree Nut Allergy 109gastrointestinal tract were included due to the older age of participants. In the absence of objective signs, i f subjective symptoms (itchy mouth or throat, abdominal pain or nausea, tightness in throat, difficulty talking or difficulty breathing) continued up to the timing of the next dose, the previous dose was repeated. If the above symptoms persist ed for a total of more than 40 minutes or reoccurred on 2 doses, the challenge was considered positive. OFCs were deemed negative at all sites if a patient or participant tolerated a top dose of 2 teaspoons of crushed cashew nut on the day of the OFC and did not report any positive reactions during continued daily intake of 2 teaspoons at home in the week after the OFC. RCH and MACCS cashew OFCs were performed in a clinical allergy setting with the recommendation to undertake an OFC based on the clinical expertise of the attending allergist . In this setting OFCs are not routinely performed if there is a high likelihood of reaction such as those with high-level sensitisation or a recent history of reaction. Therefore, OFCs are largely performed to determine tolerance rather than diagnose food allergy. Occasionally, an OFC may be performed despite a high positive SPT if there is a recent history of tolerance to a partial ingestion of cashew. All RCH and MACCS OFCs had symptoms retrospectively reassessed and those not meeting OFC stopping criteria as outlined by PRACTALL guidelines were excluded (n=2) 33. Statistical Methods: Continuously-valued variables are summarised using means (and standard deviations) or medians (and range), with frequencies reported as percentages with 95% confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution. A two-sample comparison of the prevalence of positive OFC within the clinic cohorts showed little evidence these samples were drawn from populations with different prevalence of cashew allergy (p = 0.24) and similarly for the population-based cohorts (p = 0.24). There was no evidence against the null hypothesis of a linear relationship between the SPT wheal size and the log-odds of a positive OFC based on data from any of the cohorts, so we assumed linear association throughout our analyses. In light of these results, we combined data for the two clinic cohorts RCH and MACCS to form a clinic cohort and for the two population-based cohorts HealthNuts and SchoolNuts to form a population cohort for all analyses. All analyses were conducted for the population and clinic cohorts separately. The capacity of the cashew skin prick test to diagnose OFC-confirmed cashew allergy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to quantify the accuracy of the test. Logistic regression was used to model the association between the SPT wheal size in millimetres and the risk of cashew allergy. The assumption that the logarithm of the odds of food allergy was linearly related to the SPT wheal size was assessed using the likelihood ratio test to compare the linear model with a more general \"saturated\" model that made no assumption about the shape of the relationship between SPT wheal size and the risk of food allergy. A fitted probability of food allergy was produced for each study participant given their SPT wheal size and used to replace the observed binary outcome in the standard formula for the PPV that is, a modelled PPV for each level of SPT wheal size was produced by taking the average of the fitted probability of cashew allergy for all infants with an SPT wheal size of greater than the given level. This method produces a smooth non-decreasing curve for the PPV across the range of SPT wheal sizes therefore overcoming fluctuations (sampling variation) in the observed proportion of infants with cashew allergy for increasing SPT. To quantify the precision of estimation of the PPVs, we used bootstrapping, a method of deriving SEs and CIs from repeated samples drawn with replacement from the original dataset. One hundred bootstrap replications were used to determine the variability of parameter estimates and to calculate 95% CIs for the thresholds with 95% PPVs to food allergy. The analysis was stratified on known risk factors for food allergy/positive tree nut challenge: sex, co-existing peanut allergy, co-existing tree nut allergies, co-existing non-nut allergies, other allergic disease and previous reaction history. All analyses were done using Stata 15. 0 (release 15.0, StatCorp, College Station, Texas). Ethics: Approval to conduct the HealthNuts study was obtained from the Victorian State Government Office for Children (reference no. CDF/07/492), the Victorian State Government Department of Human Services (reference no. 10/07) and the RCH Human Research Ethics Committee (reference no. 27047). For the SchoolNuts study, ethics approval was obtained from the RCH Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 31079), the Department of Education and Early Childhood and the Catholic Education Office. All parents provided written informed consent. Ethics approval for the use of de-identified clinic data from RCH and MACCS was obtained from the RCH Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 37076A). Chapter 7 - Improving the Diagnosis of Tree Nut Allergy 111Results Study Populations: Demographic and clinical characteristics stratified by cashew OFC cohort are outlined in Table 1. A total of 386 cashew OFC were performed in a clinical setting (RCH n=343, MACCS n=43) and 145 cashew OFC were population-based studies (HealthNuts n=108, SchoolNuts n=37). Males represented 61% of the clinic cohort and 57.9% of the population cohort. The median age at challenge was 8 years for the clinic cohort and 6 years for the population cohort. Co-morbid rates of eczema were comparable between cohorts [54.7% (211/386) clinic cohort, 55.1% (80/145) population cohort], whilst rates of asthma and rhinitis were higher among the clinic cohort [clinic cohort asthma 58.8% (n=227), population cohort asthma 29.6% (n=184) and (n=23)]. Among the clinic cohort, 63.5% (n=245) had a co-existing food allergy (peanut n=194, other tree nut n=39, egg n=62, other= 62) compared to 51% (n=74) of those among the population cohor t (peanut n=33, other tree nut n=12, egg n=13, other n= 14). Age stratified demographic and clinical characteristics for the clinic cohort are outlined in Supplementary Table 1. Results of cashew OFC: Among the clinic cohort, 19.9% (n=77) of cashew OFC were positive compared to 62.1% (n=90) of the population cohort challenges. The most common reason for cashew OFC among both cohorts was cashew sensitisation without a history of cashew ingestion, 46.6% of those in the clinic cohort and 67.7% of those among the population cohort. Among the population cohort, 91% (n=61) of those with an SPT 8mm and no history of cashew exposure had a positive cashew OFC compared to 59% (n=22) of those among the clinic cohort. Characteristics of the positive cashew OFCs Characteristics of positive cashew challenges stratified by cohort are outlined in Table 2. Among those in the clinic cohort with a positive cashew challenge (n=77) the most common symptoms were skin (75%), gastrointestinal (48%) and oropharyngeal (38%). Among those in the population cohort with a positive cashew challenge (n=90) the most common symptoms were angioedema (61%), skin (60%) and oropharyngeal (50%). There were marked differences in reported treatments between the clinic and population cohorts. Among those with a positive cashew OFC in the population cohort (n=90), 77% required no treatment, 22% antihistamine and 5.6% salbutamol. Among those with a positive cashew OFC in the clinic cohort (n=77), 78% antihistamine, 3.4% salbutamol and 1.3% oral steroid. Among the 168 positive cashew challenges in the population and clinic cohorts, nine children required adrenalin (5.3%). Table 3 summarises the details of the nine patients requiring adrenalin. Five had no history of cashew ingestion and three had a previous history of cashew reaction (one anaphylaxis) and cashew SPT wheal sizes ranged from 1-18mm. Five had co- existing food allergy (milk 2, sesame 2 and another tree nut 1). The majority of reactions among the population cohort occurred with a crumb (52%, n=47) whereas reaction doses in the clinic population tended to be higher with 29/77 (38%) occurring at the top dose (2 teaspoons) (Table 2). Diagnostic capacity of cashew SPT for challenge confirmed cashew allergy: There were marked differences in the prevalence of cashew allergy between the population and clinic-based cohorts 62.1% and 19.5% respectively (see Table 1), which we believe is due to differences in the selection of participants for cashew challenge between the 2 cohorts. Patients in the allergy services from which the clinic cohort is drawn are less likely to have undergone an OFC if the attending clinician determines that they are more likely to have a positive result, such as patients with high level sensitisation (>8mm SPT). This is not the case for the population- based cohorts, where OFC were offered to all participants with a detectable SPT (wheal size 1mm except those with a recent history of a reaction consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy (Supplementary Table 2). This is further supported by the difference in median SPT between the 2 cohorts [clinic cohort=3mm (IQR 1-5), 95% PPV for cashew allergy also varied between the population and clinic-based cohorts, 10mm or greater (7.5-12.0) and AUC was 0.83-0.95) for the population cohort and 0.81 (0.76-0.87) for the clinic cohort. SPT thresholds with 95% PPV for cashew allergy, along with sensitivity, specificity, NPV, positive and negative LR at the reported thresholds are presented in Table 4. When stratified by risk factors for cashew allergy, 95% PPVs could not be generated for the clinic cohort. For the population cohort some differences were noted but with overlapping confidence intervals there is little evidence to support differences in 95% PPVs between the groups at the population level. (Supplementary Table 4). There was no evidence of differences in population- level 95% PPVs based on analyses after stratification on other known risk factors for food allergy or age (data not shown). Chapter 7 - Improving the Diagnosis of Tree Nut Allergy 113The commonly applied SPT thresholds of less than 3mm and 8mm and above are presented in Table 5. The 3mm threshold performed as expected with high sensitivity and low specificity for the population and clinic-based cohorts. Discussion: To our knowledge this is the largest series of oral food challenges for cashew allergy reported and the first study to report 95% PPVs for cashew SPT. We found the SPT threshold for 95% PPV among a clinic cohort of 14mm and a population cohort of 10mm with marked differences in cashew allergy prevalence between the clinic and population cohorts. The strengths of this study are the large number of cashew OFCs and the development of SPT thresholds with 95% PPVs for cashew allergy using data contributed from population and allergy clinic-based samples of children in the same city. The population-based cohorts provide cashew OFC outcomes based on pre-determined stopping criteria irrespective of SPT wheal size. There are also a number of limitations. Similar to other studies based on data from allergy clinics, the results of our analyses of data from the clinic-based cohorts are affected by two types of selection bias since patients are likely to have (1) more severe allergic disease when compared to individuals from population cohorts of children; and (2) been offered OFC only if the allergist deemed them to be at low risk of reacting. As a result, the clinical cohort has a limited number of OFCs represented with high-level sensitisation (>8mm), a lower median SPT and the majority of reactions were to the top OFC dose. The clinic cohort data are also likely to have suffered from a type of information bias, since details were obtained from a retrospective record review and OFC outcomes were not standardised. All challenge outcomes were, however, reviewed and those that did not meet the PRACTALL criteria33 for a positive oral food challenge were excluded from analysis. Both the population and clinic cohorts have a limited number of cashew OFC performed in children <2 years of age which is the age that children typically present with food allergy and when 95% PPV estimates for cashew SPT would be most useful to guide cashew introduction recommendations. Comparison of our thresholds for cashew SPT response to other studies is difficult due to the limited number of studies to date. One study reported that SPT wheal diameters 8mm predicted a positive food challenge with >95% accuracy individually for cashew, hazelnut, walnut, and sesame. This study was, however, from a highly selected clinic population and included lower numbers of cashew OFC (n=89) 16. A more recent study that retrospectively reported outcomes of tree nut challenges from the University of Michigan Allergy clinic included 28 cashew challenges and fitted a single predictive model that combined cashew and pistachio OFCs to generate a 50% NPV of 6.5mm. If the sensitivity and specificity of SPT thresholds for OFC allergy are assumed not to vary between populations, then PPVs and NPVs will be dependent on the underlying prevalence of food allergy. It has been previously argued that PPVs for sIgE derived from clinic populations cannot be meaningfully applied to general populations, although this question has not yet been addressed using relevant data on SPT wheal size 13. Our data demonstrates a similar variation of PPVs based on different populations and highlights that PPVs based on clinic cohorts are more likely to include those with lower prevalence of food allergy due, most likely, to selection bias related to physician decisions around who is offered an oral food challenge, and therefore generate artificially higher PPV thresholds. Based on our results we propose that a SPT wheal size of 10mm may be more appropriate than the commonly used 8mm cut-off to guide clinical decisions around when to perform OFC for cashew. It has been proposed that likelihood ratios, which compare the probability of a positive SPT result in patients with and without food allergy, should be the tool of choice to determine the probability of allergic disease as they have the potential to be independent of disease prevalence 34. The calculation and appropriate application of likelihood ratios does, however, require several steps, which may explain why this procedure has received limited use in clinical practice. In the present study, we have included both positive and negative likelihood ratios to assist clinicians with applying our data to their own settings. Conclusion Within a population-based cohort we have established a 95% PPV for cashew SPT of 10mm. It is known that 95% PPVs can vary depending on the population they are generated from a nd this study has demonstrated considerable variability between clinic- and population-based cohorts for the 95% PPV for cashew SPT. To improve tree nut allergy diagnosis and management, further work is required utilising data based on OFC confirmed outcomes with OFC offered to all sensitised individuals irrespective of wheal size to generate 95% PPVs for the additional tree nuts.

This thesis has explored several key areas regarding tree nut allergy in Australia including the prevalence, natural history, frequency of adverse food reactions related to tree nuts and the development of tree nut allergy in the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts population-based cohorts and the Royal Children's Hospita l and MACCS allergy clinic populations. A summary of the key findings are outlined below: 8.1 Key Findings Tree nut allergy prevalence Worldwide tree nut allergy prevalence A systematic review of the literature up until 2014 found tree nut allergy prevalence studies to be limited, with data mainly from Europe, the UK and the USA. Prevalence estimates based on challenge-confirmed outcomes for any tree nut were less than 2%. Probable tree nut allergy prevalence ranged from 0.05 to 4.9%. Prevalence of individual tree nut allergies varied significantly by region with hazelnut the most common tree nut allergy in Europe, walnut and cashew in the USA and Brazil nut, almond and walnut most commonly reported in the UK. Australian tree nut allergy prevalence data was limited to one study of self-reported tree nut in children. Australian tree nut allergy prevalence At HealthNuts study recruitment at 12 months of age, (2007 -2011) parent -reported tree nut ingestion rates were low (<18%) and parent -reported tree nut allergy rates were less than 1 % [0.1%, ( 95% CI 0.04 -0.2)]. At age 6 years follow up in the HealthNuts study , challenge confirmed tree nut allergy was 3.3% (95% CI 2.8 -4.0). Cashew was the most common tree nut allergy among those at 6 years of age .Tree nut aller gy adverse events Among 10 to 14 year olds with food allergy in the SchoolNuts study; 44.4% of students with likely IgE-mediated food allergy reported a reaction in the past year (95%CI 40 .3, 48.7) and 10% reported reactions consistent with anaphylaxis (95%CI 7.2, 12.2). Peanut and tree nut (cashew and walnut) were the most common trigger foods and reactions occurred most frequently at home. Those with asthma were two times more likely to report experiencing a food reaction in the past 12 months [aOR 1.9 (95%CI 1.1, 3.2)], however asthma was not associated with experiencing more severe reactions [aOR 1.6 (95% CI 0.7,2.6) ]. Those with multiple food allergies, compared to a single food allergy, were two times more likely to report an adverse food reaction in the past 12 months [aOR 1.9(95% CI 1.1,3.1)] and there was a trend towards reporting more severe reactions [aOR 2.1 (95% CI 0.9,3.8)]. Those with nut allergies, compared to those without nut allergies, were at decreased risk of reporting a reaction in the past 12 months [aOR 0.7 (95% CI 0.5, 0.1)], however were three times more likely to report a severe reaction [aOR 2.9 (95% CI 1.1,4.4)]. Development of tree nut allergy In the HealthNuts study; Among those with challenge confirmed food allergy at age 1 yea r, 41% were sensitised to one or more tree nuts. Tree nut sensitisation was more common in infants with both peanut and egg allergy (48%) compared to single peanut and (33%) and single egg (24%) allergy. Of those children who were sensitized to cashew at age 1 year, 39% had cashew allergy, and 35% were cashew tolerant at age 6years. Of children with peanut allergy only at age 1, 27% (95%CI 16.1-39.7) were tree nut allergic at age 6, compared with 14% (95%CI 10.4-17.9) of those with egg allergy only and 37% (95%CI 27.2-47.4) of those with both peanut and egg allergy.127Of the 147 children with peanut allergy at age 6 years, 45% also had one or more tree nut allergies. The most common tree nut co-allergy for those with peanut allergy at age 6 years was to cashew. Cashew nut oral food challenge outcomes Utilising two clinic cohorts and two population-based cohorts of children, the SPT wheal sizes that correlated with 95% predictability of a positive OFC for cashew were determined. A cashew SPT wheal size of 10mm or greater (95%CI 7.5-12.0) was found to have 95% PPV to cashew allergy among the population cohort with a positive likelihood ratio of 20.6 (95% CI 2.9 145.2). A cashew SPT wheal size of 14mm (95%CI 9.5-unknown) greater was found to have 95% PPV to cashew allergy among the clinic cohort with a positive likelihood ratio of 10.9 (95% CI 2.2-53.1). 8.2 Strengths and Limitations The strengths and limitations of the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies are discussed in detail in each results chapter. Overall, the strengths of both studies are the large sample sizes, the population sampling frames, high participation fraction and follow-up rates, good internal and external validity, and the utilization of the gold standard test to define food allergy. Population sampling has ensured that that the full spectrum of food allergy cases and adverse events related to food allergy that would be observed at the community level are captured. Most previous food allergy studies have recruit ed participants from tertiary allergy centres , which may over represent children with more severe allergic disease resulting in selection bias and generalisability of study findings. Internal validity of the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies was assessed via non-responder questionnaires. For the HealthNuts study, participants were similar to non-participants on most parameters with the exception that participants were more likely to have a family history of food allergy and less likely to have ingested peanut. External validity of the HealthNuts study was assessed by comparing characteristics of the HealthNuts cohort to that of the whole population using data from the Perinatal Data Collection Unit4. For most characteristics, the HealthNuts sample was comparable to the general population. Population sampling, high response rated and good internal and external validity reduce the likelihood of selection bias. A significant strength of the HealthNuts study is the use of the gold standard OFC to define food allergy outcomes which reduces information bias (misclassification) compared to less robust measures of food allergy, such as self-reporting or tests of IgE sensitisation, which are known to overestimate the prevalence of food allergy.139 Secondly, to ensure no potential cases of food allergy were missed all participants with a detectable SPT wheal were offered OFC. By challenging all infants with detectable SPT responses, irrespective of the magnitude of SPT response, the classification of food allergy is robust. Participants with negative SPT responses (0mm) were assumed to be food tolerant. To test this assumption, a random sample of 200 participants with negative SPT to all foods underwent OFC; all negative controls tested negative on challenge. A potential limitation of this research is that both the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies utilised open OFCs rather than double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. However, only objective symptoms were used to define a positive OFC result, and the validity and sufficiency of using open challenges in infants has been previously confirmed independently.208 As with other studies investigating tree nut allergy to date, there were also challenges with determining tree nut allergy outcomes in both the HealthNuts and SchoolNuts studies. At age one recruitment, tree nut SPT were only performed for those participants that attended clinic for an OFC to either milk, egg, sesame or peanut and no OFC were performed for tree nuts. Tree nut SPT was limited to almond, hazelnut and cashew. Therefore, tree nut allergy prevalence estimates at age one are limited to parent- reported reactions. Patterns of sensitisation are limited to the participants that attended clinic and the tree nuts: almond, cashew and hazelnut. At age 6 years tree nut allergy prevalence estimates were possible as tree nut SPT were performed on the entire cohort and as per age one protocol, all sensitised participants offered an OFC. However, not all study participants had SPT or nut consumption data available at age 6 years. Almond, cashew and hazelnut had more complete screening and there is limited SPT and OFC for the additional tree nuts. Most of those deemed allergic to Brazil nut, macadamia, 129pecan, pistachio and walnut are based on high-level sensitisation (SPT>8mm) not OFC and many of those with mid-range sensitisation (3-7mm) did not have OFC performed. This was largely due to the high number of participants with sensitisation to multiple tree nuts and the burden to families and study resources to perform multiple OFC for the one participant. This limits the quality of the data for exploring the co-allergy patterns reported and is an important factor to consider for tree nut allergy studies in the future. In addition, there is also likely to be an allergic bias in participation and follow up at age 6 as we observed participants with a family history of allergy and children with eczema or food allergy at age 1 year were more likely to participate in the follow-up at age 6 years. Therefore we have reported a range of more and less conservative observed prevalence estimates and a population prevalence estimate for tree nut allergy re-weighted for factors that were associated with participation at age 6 years. The SchoolNuts study was limited by the use of self-reported data regarding adverse food reactions however the use of both student and parent questionnaires allowed validation of self-reported responses for food allergy, asthma and allergic reaction details. Kappa analysis showed strong correlation between student and parent dyad responses for self-reported food allergy. Additionally, whilst clinical samples have the strength of more robust diagnosis and definition of adverse reactions and anaphylaxis compared to self-reported reactions they risk missing those experiencing milder reactions and over representing those with more severe food allergy phenotypes, higher socio-economic status and those with greater access to specialised medical management and education which are captured with a population-based study. Finally, PPVs are dependent on the underlying prevalence of disease, therefore thresholds developed in one setting may not be generalisable to another setting if the prevalence of food allergy is substantially different. This can be overcome by the use of likelihood ratios that are presented alongside all PPVs reported in this thesis. 8.3 Implications of this work Until recently tree nut s have been an under considered and understudied food allergen. This body of work has reported the first challenge confirmed tree nut allergy prevalence rates in Australia, determining one of the highest reported tree nut allergy rates in the world to date, with cashew the most common individual tree nut allergy. This work has highlighted the regional variability of overall and individual tree nut allergy prevalence rates and the need for region specific studies that include all the common culinary nuts. Confirming other reports of adverse food reactions,147,151-153 the work conducted as part of this PhD has found peanut and tree nut the most common triggers of adverse food reactions for children aged 10 to 14 years, with cashew the most common tree nut trigger reported. Certainly based on this work cashew appears to be equal to peanut in prevalence and severity of reactions in Melbourne, Australia. This work has also highlighted some important considerations around tree nut allergy prevention. Recent systematic review and meta-analysis evidence has shown that early peanut or egg introduction reduces the risk of a child developing peanut or egg allergy9. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in clinical practice, from advice to delay the introduction of peanut and egg to actively encouraging introduction before 12 months of age. Accordingly, infant feeding guidelines (in Australia and internationally)30,209-211 have been revised to recommend the introduction of peanut and other allergenic solids in the first year of life. Whether timely introduction of tree nuts in infancy promotes immune tolerance and provides protection from developing tree nut allergy is not known. Work as part of this thesis has shown that among those with co-existing food allergy at 12 months of age, sensitisation rates to tree nut were as high as 48% and in the context of allergen avoidance for the sensitised tree nuts, 30% of those tree nut sensitised at 12 months were tree nut allergic at 6 years of age. With such high levels of tree nut sensitisation among infants with food allergy, tree nut SPT screening has the potential to impose a significant burden on allergy clinics to confirm allergy status for each individual tree nut. Evidence that tree nut allergy can be prevented is needed before making recommendations to identify and target children at high risk of tree nut allergy early in life. Further research is required to guide tree nut introduction advice for those at high risk of tree nut allergy. 131There remains significant limitations to food allergy diagnosis with a high dependency on time consuming, costly and potentially risky OFCs to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Current waiting lists at the Royal Children's' Hospital allergy clinic for food challenges are lengthy and OFC are prioritised for core foods such as milk, egg and wheat. Many children sensitised to tree nut s are not able to have an OFC performed and are often avoiding multiple tree nuts based on IgE sensitisation status alone. The future of food allergy diagnosis lies in the use of multiple diagnostic parameters offering greater precision than IgE testing alone which may eradicate the need for OFC. There are very promising technical advances on the horizon such as basophil activation testing and improvement in cellular assays and component-resolved diagnostics but until they are ready for clinical application the use of 95% PPVs for SPT and sIgE remain a useful adjunct to clinical decision making regarding a patient's need for an OFC. To date, SPT thresholds for tree nut have not been reported and clinicians often apply a generic 8mm threshold which is not specific to any of the individual tree nuts nor the Australian population. The cashew SPT threshold generated from this PhD will improve the management of cashew allergy (the most common tree nut allergy in Australia) by providing a reliable SPT threshold based on an Australian population-based cohort. It is hoped this can assist with identifying those children needing an OFC and reduce food challenge waiting lists and consequently improve access to tertiary care for children with complex allergies. 8.4 Future directions The work as part of this PhD has outlined the burden of tree nut allergy in Australian children and provides an important foundation for further work regarding tree nut allergy prevention, diagnosis and management. It is postulated that food allergy, including tree nut allergies are increasing but there are limited data on food allergy time trends, particularly for tree nut allergy. The EarlyNuts study aims to recruit 2,000 infants aged 12 months from immunisation sessions across Melbourne. With the same study methods as the HealthNuts study, Wave 1 which was completed 10 years ago, the EarlyNuts study aims to establish if there has been a change in food allergy prevalence among Australian infants. It will also provide information regarding the timing of introduction of allergenic foods, including tree nuts. Preliminary results suggest common allergens such as peanut, egg and cashew are being introduced earlier for a larger proportion of infants in the first 12 months of life than in the HealthNuts study 10 years ago. Unlike HealthNuts, EarlyNuts There is currently no data on the primary or secondary prevention of tree nut allergy, therefore further research is planned to explore the impact of early introduction of tree nuts in high risk children through a randomised controlled trial in the RCH Allergy clinic population of which I am an associate investigator, called the TreEAT study. We hypothesize that optimal introduction of tree nuts in the first year of life will reduce childhood tree nut allergy. We also hypothesize that a supervised multi-nut OFC in high risk infants will improve the rates of tree nut introduction and ongoing ingestion at home, ultimately lowering the rate of tree nut co- sensitisation and challenge-proven allergy. We have designed a randomised, open-label controlled trial for infants (aged 6 to 12 months) at high risk of tree nut allergy. We specifically aim to determine the efficacy of a multi-tree nut OFC compared to recommending home introduction (without prior supervised OFC) to (1) reduce challenge-proven tree nut co-allergy at 18 months (primary objective), (2) reduce tree nut sensitisation at 18 months of age, and (3) improve rates of home tree nut ingestion at 18 months. This study will be the first in the world to provide evidence for a management guideline for the prevention of tree nut allergy in high- risk infants (peanut and/or egg allergic). Within the next 4 years, clinical outcomes from this randomized controlled trial will provide evidence to inform clinical practice in primary and secondary prevention of tree nut allergy from infancy. As part of this thesis a 95% PPV threshold for cashew SPT was determined and work is underway to establish 95% PPV thresholds for SPT for additional tree nuts. Other work that is planned for improving the diagnosis of tree nut allergy is a trial of basophil activation testing in the TreEat RCT which has shown promise for improved diagnosis for other allergens but studies for tree nut allergens and clinical application has to date been limited. Our understanding of tree nut allergy time trends and natural history is limited due to the paucity of longitudinal tree nut allergy studies and current data is based on tertiary level allergy clinic populations. Ongoing research within the HealthNuts study includes all 5276 participants being contacted at 10 years of age and invited to undergo a detailed health assessment including SPT to food and inhalant allergen, OFCs if food sensitised, lung function testing, retinol photography, physical assessments and collection of biological specimens (blood and cheek swabs) for immunological, genetic and epigenetic studies. This will allow further investigation of the natural history of tree nut allergy and identification of modifiable risk factors which may influence the development of tree nut allergy and prevent progression 133to multiple food allergies, within a population-based cohort with challenge confirmed allergy outcomes. The pinnacle of food allergy research is a treatment with most of the work focusing on systemic epicutaneous, sublingual and oral immunotherapy.64 To date this research has been limited for tree nut allergy but work as part of this thesis has highlighted cashew as a priority tree nut for expansion of the work already underway for peanut allergy oral immunotherapy.75,76,212-219 8.5 Conclusion Within this thesis, I have examined several key areas regarding tree nut allergy in Australia including the prevalence, frequency of adverse food reactions related to tree nuts and elements of the natural history and development of tree nut allergy in population-based HealthNuts and SchoolNuts cohorts and the Royal Children's Hospital and MACCS allergy clinic populations. These findings have made a significant contribution to the literature and shaped the future direction of many of the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory based research projects within our own research group and those of our collaborators and has immediate implications for the clinical management of tree nut allergy.
