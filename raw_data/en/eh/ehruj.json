We in cohorts from Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania. We studied antibody dynamics and force of infection across pathogens and cohorts. Enteropathogens shared common seroepidemiologic features that enabled between-pathogen comparisons of transmission. Overall, exposure was intense: for most pathogens the window of primary infection was <3 years old; for highest transmission pathogens primary infection occurred within the first year. Longitudinal profiles demonstrated significant IgG boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs, underscoring the value of longitudinal designs to estimate force of infection. Seroprevalence and force of infection were rank-preserving across pathogens, illustrating the measures provide similar information about transmission heterogeneity. Our findings suggest antibody response can be used to measure population-level transmission of diverse enteropathogens in serologic surveillance.

The pathogens that cause diarrhea spread when stool from infected people comes into contact with new hosts, for example, through inadequate sanitation or by drinking contaminated water. Currently, the best way to track these infections is to collect stool samples from people and test them for the presence of the pathogens. Unfortunately, this is costly and difficult to do on a large scale outside of clinical settings, making it hard to track the spread of diarrhea-causing pathogens. The body produces antibodies - small proteins that can detect specific pathogens - in response to an infection. These antibodies help ward off future infections by the same pathogen, so if they are present in the blood, this indicates a current or previous infection. Scientists already collect blood samples to track malaria, HIV and vaccine-preventable diseases in low-resource settings. These samples could be tested more broadly to measure the levels of antibodies against diarrhea-causing pathogens. Now, Arnold et al. have used blood samples collected from children in Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania to measure antibody responses to 8 diarrhea-causing pathogens. The results showed that many children in these settings had been infected with all 8 pathogens before age three, and that all of the pathogens shared similar age-dependent patterns of antibody response. This finding enabled Arnold et al. to combine antibody measurements with statistical models to estimate each pathogen's force of infection, that is, the rate at which susceptible individuals in the population become infected. This is a key step for epidemiologists to understand which pathogens cause the most infections in a population. The experiments show that testing blood samples for antibodies could provide scientists with a new tool to track the transmission of diarrhea-causing pathogens in low-resource settings. This information could help public health officials design and test efforts to prevent diarrhea, for example, by improving water treatment or developing vaccines. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45594.002](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45594.002) Introduction A broad set of viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens are leading causes of the global infectious disease burden, with the highest burden among young children living in lower income countries ( [GBD 2016 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016](#bib22)). Infections that result in acute diarrhea and related child deaths drive disease burden estimates attributed to enteropathogens, but asymptomatic infections are extremely common and the full scope of sequelae is only partially understood ( [Liu et al., 2016](#bib37); [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51)). Much of what we know about enteropathogen transmission is based on passive clinical surveillance, which reflects a small fraction of all infections. For example, antibody-based incidence of infection to Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni were 2-6 orders of magnitude higher than case-based surveillance in European populations ( [Simonsen et al., et al., 2012](#bib71); [Teunis 2013](#bib72)), and a study of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in Fiji found similarly high discordance between incidence and case-based surveillance ( [Watson et al., 2017](#bib78)). A more complete picture of enteropathogen infection in populations would help understand drivers of transmission, disease burden, naturally acquired immunoprotection, as well as to design public health prevention measures, and measure intervention effects. Stool-based, high-throughput PCR assays have helped solve the logistical difficulties of single-pathogen testing for enterics and have provided new insights into pathogen-specific infections and disease burden ( [Liu et al., 2016](#bib37); [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51)). Yet, stool is not routinely collected in population-based surveys, and infection with many globally important enteric pathogens can be sufficiently rare and relatively short-lived to require designs with almost continuous surveillance ( [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51); [Lin et al., 2018](#bib36)). At the same time, large-scale serological surveillance platforms create new opportunities for expanded enteropathogen surveillance alongside other infectious diseases ( [Metcalf et al., 2016](#bib39); [Arnold et al., 2018](#bib2)). These challenges and opportunities have generated interest in antibody-based measurement as a complement to PCR for population-based enteropathogen 2014](#bib45); [Arnold al., 2017](#bib1)), endpoints in randomized studies et 2018](#bib76); [Egorov al., 2018](#bib16)). After infection, many enteropathogens elicit a transiently elevated antibody response that wanes over time. In lower transmission settings where antibody responses could be monitored longitudinally after distinct infections, Salmonella enterica, (IgG) levels in blood have been shown to wane over a period of months since infection; IgM and IgA levels decline even more quickly ( [Teunis et al., 2012](#bib71); [Strid et al., 2013](#bib19); [Hj\u00f8llo et al., 2018](#bib28)). Compared with permanently immunizing infections such as measles, transient immunity adds a layer of complexity to seroepidemiologic inference and methods. To our knowledge, there has been no detailed study of enteropathogen seroepidemiology among children in low-resource settings where transmission is intense beginning early in life ( [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51)). Such studies are needed to determine if serology is a viable approach to measure enteropathogen transmission in low-resource settings. We conducted a series of analyses in cohorts from Haiti, Tanzania, and Kenya that measured serological antibody responses to eight enteropathogens using multiplex bead assays. Our objectives were to identify common patterns in antibody dynamics shared across enteropathogens and populations, and to evaluate serological methods to compare between-pathogen heterogeneity in infection, including estimates of force of infection. Our results provide new insights into the seroepidemiology of enteropathogens among children living in low-resource settings, and contribute advances to inform the design and analysis of surveillance efforts whose goal is to quantify heterogeneity in enteropathogen transmission through antibody response. Results Study populations The analysis included measurements from cohorts in Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania. Blood specimens were tested for IgG levels to eight enteropathogens using a multiplex bead assay on the Luminex platform ( [Table 1](#table1)). The Haitian cohort included repeated measurements among children enrolled in a study of lymphatic filariasis transmission in Leogane from 1990 to 1999 et al., 1998](#bib34); [Hamlin et al., 2012](#bib25)). Leogane is a coastal agricultural community west of Port au Prince. At the time of the study its population was approximately 15,000, most homes had no electricity and none had running water. In total, the Haiti study tested 771 finger prick blood specimens collected from 142 children ages birth to 11 years old, with each measurement typically separated by one year (median measurements per child: 5; range: 2 to 9). In Kenya, a 2013 prospective trial of locally-produced, in-home ceramic water filters enrolled 240 children in a serological substudy ( [Morris et al., 2018](#bib40)). Study participants were identified through the Asembo Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which is located in a rural part of Siaya County, western Kenya along the shore of Lake Victoria. Only 29% of the population had piped drinking water (public taps), water source contamination with E. coli prevailed (93% of samples tested), and the average age children began consuming water was 4 months ( [Morris et al., 2018](#bib40)). Children aged 4 to 10 months provided dried blood spot specimens at enrollment (February 2013), and again 6 to 7 months later (August to September, 2013; n = 205 children measured longitudinally). The Kenya study period encompassed seasonally heavy rains from March through June. In Tanzania, 96 independent clusters across eight trachoma-endemic villages in the Kongwa region were enrolled in a randomized trial to study the effects of annual azithromycin distribution on Chlamydia trachomatis infection ( [Wilson et al., 2019](#bib80)). The population is very rural, and water is scarce in the region: at enrollment, 69% of participants reported their primary drinking water source, typically an unprotected spring, was >30 min' walk one-way. From 2012 to 2015, the Tanzania study collected dried blood spots from between 902 and 1577 children ages 1-9 years old in annual cross-sectional surveys that took place from October through December at the conclusion of the dry season before heavy seasonal rains (total measurements: 4,989). Although children could have been measured repeatedly over the four-year study in Tanzania, they were not tracked longitudinally. There was no evidence that the Kenya and Tanzania interventions reduced enteropathogen antibody response ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/45594/figures#supp1)), so this analysis pooled measurements from the study arms in each population. Age-dependent shifts in population antibody distributions We estimated seropositivity cutoffs using three approaches: receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica including a panel of external, known positive and negative specimens, as previously reported ( [Moss et al., 2014](#bib45); [Morris et models ( [Benaglia et al., 2009](#bib6)) fit to measurements among children ages 0-1 year old to ensure a sufficient number of unexposed children; and, presumed seronegative distributions among children who experienced large increases in antibody levels ( [Table 1](#table1)). Classification agreement was high between the different approaches (agreement >95% for most comparisons; [Supplementary file 2](/articles/45594/figures#supp2)). Among children < 2 years old, antibody levels clearly distinguished seronegative and seropositive subpopulations, but there were not distinct seronegative and seropositive subpopulations by age 3 years for most pathogens measured Haiti ( [Figure 1](#fig1)) and Tanzania ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig1s1)). By age 3 years, the majority of children were seropositive to Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat subunit), and norovirus GI.4 and GII.4; in all cases antibody distributions were shifted above seropositivity thresholds. In contrast, there was a qualitative change in the antibody response distributions to Giardia, E. histolytica, Salmonella and Campylobacter with increasing age, shifting from a bimodal distribution of seronegative and seropositive groups among children 1 year old to a unimodal distribution by age 3 years and older ( [Figure 1](#fig1), [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig1s1)). A direct age-dependent shifts in antibody distributions to Giardia VSP-3 antigen and Chlamydia trachomatis pgp3 antigen in Tanzania illustrates stark differences in enteropathogen- generated immune responses versus pathogens like Chlamydia that elicit a response that consistently differentiates exposed and unexposed subpopulations as children age ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/45594/figures#fig1s2)). Distributions of IgG levels in the younger Kenyan cohort (ages 4-17 months) showed distinct groups of seropositive and seronegative most subunit and cholera toxin B subunit were near the maximum of the dynamic range of the assay for nearly all children measured in the three these IgG levels waned as children aged, presumably from acquired [Figure 1](#fig1), [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig1s1)). [see in antibody response We hypothesized that IgG responses to closely related antigens would co-vary but that IgG responses to unrelated antigens would be uncorrelated. Joint variation in individual-level IgG responses aligned with hypothesized relationships based on antigenic overlap and shared epitopes. Responses to Giardia Kenya (=0.84) and Tanzania high within-individual variability suggests that measuring responses to multiple unique recombinant protein antigens yields more information about infection than measuring responses to one alone ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). High correlation between Salmonella LPS Groups B and D, between norovirus GI.4 and GII.4, and between ETEC and V. cholerae likely reflected antibody cross-reactivity. Correlation could also result from multiple previous infections with different Salmonella serogroups or different norovirus genogroups. A comparison across all antigens revealed no other combinations with high correlation ( [Supplementary file 3](/articles/45594/figures#supp3)). We excluded cholera toxin B subunit antibody responses from remaining analyses because of the difficulty of interpreting its epidemiologic measures in light of high levels of cross-reactivity with ETEC LT B subunit. Heat labile toxin-producing ETEC very common among children in low-resource settings ( [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51)), and there was no documented transmission of cholera in the study populations during measurement periods. Birth to three years of age: a key window of antibody acquisition and primary seroconversion For most pathogens, mean IgG levels and seroprevalence rose quickly and plateaued by ages 1 to 3 years in Haiti ( [Figure 3](#fig3)), enormous individual-level variation, age-dependent mean IgG curves exhibited characteristic shapes seen across diverse pathogens, and reflected high levels of early-life exposure ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1)). In (E. histolytica) to 100% (ETEC subunit) by age 3 years ( [Figure 3B](#fig3)), and in Tanzania, the majority of 1 year olds were already seropositive for some evidence of maternally-derived IgG among children under 6 months old with a drop in mean IgG levels by age, but this pattern was only evident for norovirus GI.4 in Haiti ( mean IgG responses to many pathogens declined from a young age, presumably from exposure early in life and acquired immunity. Mean IgG levels declined after age 1 year for Giardia in Haiti ( [see all](/articles/45594/figures#fig3) Longitudinal antibody dynamics show significant boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs Based on age-dependent shifts in IgG distributions ( [Figure 1](#fig1)), we hypothesized that conversion of IgG levels to seropositive and seronegative status could mask important dynamics of enteropathogen immune response above seropositivity cutoffs, particularly among ages beyond the window of primary infection. In Haiti and Kenya we examined longitudinal IgG profiles among children. In the Haitian cohort, which was followed beyond the window of primary infection, children commonly had >4 fold increases and decreases in IgG while remaining above seropositivity cutoffs\u2014a pattern observed across pathogens but particularly clear for ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). In Kenya, 4-fold increases in IgG largely coincided with a change in status from seronegative to seropositive, presumably because increases in IgG followed primary infection in the young cohort ages 4-17 months ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig4s1)). Many Kenyan children exhibited >4 fold increases and decreases in IgG response to Campylobacter p18 and p39 antigens above the seropositivity cutoff, a result of earlier primary infection and/or additional infection and boosting during the study period ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig4s1)). [see all](/articles/45594/figures#fig4) Comparison of serology with stool-based measures of infection The Kenya study monitored diarrhea symptoms in weekly visits between enrollment and follow-up. The study collected stool from children whose caregivers reported diarrhea symptoms in the past 7 days, and tested stool for Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections using an immunoassay with additional PCR testing for Cryptosporidium as previously described ( [Morris et al., 2018](#bib40)). Among 132 children with paired serology measurements, those infected with Cryptosporidium (n = 17) and Giardia (n = 25) enabled us to compare stool-based measures of infection with IgG responses. Children with confirmed infections in diarrheal stools had higher IgG levels and seroprevalence at both time points compared with those who did not have confirmed infections, but many children without stool-confirmed infections seroconverted during the study. Among children without confirmed Giardia infection in diarrheal stools, seroprevalence to Cp23 (37%, 57%) at follow-up. These findings suggest that many children were not shedding genetic material at the time of diarrheal stool collection, or many infections with these two pathogens were asymptomatic. [Supplementary file 4](/articles/45594/figures#supp4) includes additional details. Serological estimates of force of infection The seroconversion rate, an instantaneous rate of seroconversion among those who are susceptible, is one estimate of a pathogen's force of infection and a fundamental epidemiologic measure of transmission ( [Hens et al., 2012](#bib27)). Serologically derived force of infection is useful for pathogens that commonly present asymptomatically, such as many enteric infections. Across diverse pathogens, steeper age-seroprevalence curves typically reflect higher transmission intensity ( [Corran et al., 2007](#bib14); [Pinsent et al., 2018](#bib48)), and age-adjusted seroprevalence equals the area under the age-seroprevalence curve (a summary measure) ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1)). We therefore hypothesized that seroprevalence and prospectively estimated force of infection should embed similar information about infection heterogeneity across pathogens. We also hypothesized that standard methods to estimate force of infection from age-structured seroprevalence would underestimate force of infection derived from longitudinal data because of significant antibody boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs. Longitudinal designs in Haiti and Kenya enabled us to use individual child antibody profiles to estimate average rates of prospective seroconversion and seroreversion during the studies. We defined incident seroconversions and seroreversions as a change in IgG across a pathogen's seropositivity cutoff and estimated force of infection as incident changes in serostatus divided by person-time at risk. In a secondary analysis, we defined incident boosting as a 4 fold increase in IgG to a final level above a seropositivity cutoff and incident waning as 4 fold decrease in IgG from an initial level above a seropositivity cutoff. The secondary definition captured large changes in IgG above seropositivity cutoffs, which aligned with repeated boosting and waning observed in the Haitian cohort ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). We found a rank-preserving relationship between pathogen seroprevalence and average force of infection in Kenya and Haiti ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). Overall levels and steepness of the relationship differed between cohorts, presumably because Kenya measurements were within a window of primary infection for most children (4-17 months) whereas Haiti measurements extended from birth to 11 years and captured lower incidence periods with overall higher seroprevalence as children aged. Consistent with this interpretation, when we progressively narrowed the age range of the Haitian cohort and repeated the analysis, the relationship was steeper when estimated among children ages 0-2 years and flattened as measurements among older children were added ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig5s1)). [see all](/articles/45594/figures#fig5) Force of infection varied widely across pathogens in Kenya, ranging from 0.1 seroconversions per year for E. histolytica to >5 for Campylobacter ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). In Haiti, force of infection ranged from 0.3 E. histolytica seroconversions per year to 1.1 ETEC seroconversions per year ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). Force of infection estimated from 4-fold changes in IgG led to more events and slightly higher rates compared with those estimated from seroconversion alone ( [Table 2](#table2)). For example, Cryptosporidium incident cases increased from 70 to 204 (a 2.9 fold increase) and the average rate increased from 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5, 0.8) to 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.0) per child-year when using a 4-fold IgG change criteria because of substantial IgG boosting and waning above the seropositivity cutoff ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). Sensitivity analyses that defined incident boosting over a range of 2-fold to 10-fold increases in IgG showed force of infection estimates were relatively stable across a wide range of definitions. In Haiti, the only pathogen for which force of infection estimated using a 4-fold increase in IgG was significantly higher than the seroconversion rate was Cryptosporidium ( [Supplementary file 5](/articles/45594/figures#supp5)). We evaluated whether model-based force of infection estimates from age-structured seroprevalence could accurately recover estimates from the longitudinal analyses. We focused on the Kenya cohort since children were measured repeatedly during the ages of primary infection and because longitudinal force of infection and seroreversion rate estimates varied considerably across pathogens ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). We estimated force of infection from seroprevalence curves using methods developed for cross-sectional, 'current status' data, a common approach in serosurveillance of vaccine diseases ( [Hens et 1999](#bib20); [Katzelnick 2018](#bib33)). Force of infection estimates from semiparametric spline models were similar to estimates from the longitudinal analysis for all pathogens, but had substantially wider confidence intervals owing to the loss of information from ignoring the longitudinal data structure ( [Figure 6](#fig6)). Parametric approaches including an exponential survival model ( [Jewell and Laan, 1995](#bib30)) and a reversible catalytic model ( [Corran et al., 2007](#bib14)) yielded narrower confidence intervals than the semiparametric model but tended to underestimate force of infection compared with longitudinal estimates ( [Figure 6](#fig6)). Across pathogens, model-based force of infection estimates derived from seroprevalence were rank-preserving compared with nonparametric longitudinal analyses. We conducted a simulation study to investigate whether longer sampling intervals in the cohorts (6 months in Kenya, 12 months in Haiti) could lead us to miss more frequent exposures and thus under-estimate force of infection. For each cohort, we created 100 imputed datasets that reconstructed a child's daily IgG levels, assuming that each infection boosted IgG and that it would wane exponentially. The simulation drew IgG boosts from empirical distributions in each cohort and used antibody-specific decay rates. We allowed for the maximum number of intermediate exposures between measurements as long as IgG levels could wane sufficiently to follow a child's empirical measurements, thus providing an approximate upper bound of the seroconversion rates (force of infection) that could plausibly be detected for each antibody. We down-sampled the daily datasets at intervals of 30, 90, 180, and 360 days to reflect realistic measurement intervals and estimated seroconversion rates. We found that for most pathogens studied, higher resolution sampling would not substantially increase seroconversion rates in absolute terms. Rates estimated through simulation increased from between 0.1 to 0.9 episodes per child-year at risk if measured with a sampling interval of 30 days instead of annually (Haiti) or every six months (Kenya). However, for pathogens with highest seroconversion rates, ETEC and Campylobacter, increases in rates estimated with 30 day sampling intervals detected a median of 4 to 8 additional seroconversions per child-year at risk compared with empirical rates ( [Figure 7](#fig7)). In relative terms, seroconversion rates in Haiti had a larger discrepancy; rates more than doubled when using a 30 day sampling interval, compared with the annual interval used in the study. Discussion In cohorts from Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania we identified consistent patterns in IgG responses that provide new insights into enteropathogen seroepidemiology among children in low-resource settings. Most population-level heterogeneity in IgG levels and seroconversion was between birth and 3 years, reflecting high transmission and early life primary infection. For particularly high transmission pathogens (e.g., ETEC, Campylobacter), most variation in IgG levels was observed among children < 1 year old. In these study populations, endemic force of infection for enteropathogens was as high, and in many cases several fold higher, than force of infection estimated during epidemics of new dengue serotype introductions in Nicaragua and Peru (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 seroconversions per year) ( [Katzelnick et al., 2018](#bib33); [Reiner et al., 2014](#bib57)). Significant boosting and waning of antibody levels above seropositivity cutoffs identified through longitudinal profiles in Haiti and Kenya reinforce the value of longitudinal designs to derive antibody distributions among unexposed and to estimate force of infection. The shift of IgG distributions from bimodal to unimodal for many pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, and Campylobacter), resulting from a combination of antibody boosting, waning and acquired immunity, complicates the interpretation of seroprevalence at older ages: among older children a seronegative response could either mean the children were never exposed or they were previously exposed but antibody levels waned below seropositivity cutoffs. The age-dependent shift contrasts with more stable differentiation of seronegative and seropositive groups observed for some other antibody responses (e.g., C. trachomatis pgp3 in [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/45594/figures#fig1s2)) and likely results from less robust and sustained IgG response following infection. Estimates of IgG half-life in the Haiti cohort were on the order of 10 weeks for most pathogens ( [Supplementary file 8](/articles/45594/figures#supp8)), implying that time to seroreversion would be approximately 1 year without additional exposure (assuming exponential decay = 0.01 corresponding to a 10 week half-life, a starting level of 10,000 MFI, and seropositivity cutoff of 300 MFI; = 350 days). Seroreversion is therefore possible at young ages, but population-level mean IgG levels and seroprevalence declined for only three pathogens, Giardia, ETEC, and Campylobacter, 3](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/45594/figures#fig3s2)). Increases levels and seroprevalence with age imply IgG boosting from new infections or repeated infections outpaced IgG decay for all enteropathogens studied until at least age 3 years, and for many pathogens through age 10 years; seroprevalence thus reflects a conservative lower bound of a population's cumulative exposure over this age range. The age range over which seroprevalence provided useful epidemiologic information varied by pathogen and cohort. In Haiti, 100% of children were seropositive to ETEC LT B toxin before age 12 months, though seroprevalence did not exceed 90% for most other pathogens until age 5 years in Haiti ( [Figure 3](#fig3)). In Kenya, the age range of 4-18 months captured wide variation in seroprevalence for most pathogens. The Tanzania study enrolled children ages one and older due to a primary focus on trachoma monitoring, but missed the key window of variation in antibody response for all enteropathogens except E. histolytica and Salmonella ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1](/articles/45594/figures#fig3s1) and [2](/articles/45594/figures#fig3s2)). Studies that extend beyond 10 years into adolescence and adulthood would help determine whether enteropathogen seroprevalence remains sufficiently high that it no longer provides useful epidemiologic information. The shift in IgG distributions for some enteropathogens raises the question of whether population mean IgG levels stabilize at a new 'set point' with repeated infections as has been observed for dengue serotypes ( [Salje et al., 2018](#bib61)); if so, then the use of fold-changes in IgG would be preferred to seropositivity cutoffs to identify incident infections among older ages. In low-resource settings, measuring a sufficient number of young children before primary infection, preferably with longitudinal measurements, will help ensure that within-sample seropositivity cutoff estimation is possible. Two-component mixture models fit the data and provided reasonable cutoff estimates only when restricted to an age range that included clearly delineated subpopulations of seronegative and seropositive responses. For most pathogens studied, this required measurements among children < 1 year old, an age range during which IgG responses still followed a bimodal distribution. The only reliable approach to estimate seropositivity cutoffs for the highest transmission pathogens like ETEC and Campylobacter was to estimate a distribution among presumed unexposed by identifying measurements among children who subsequently experienced a large increase in IgG, a strategy only possible in a longitudinal design. Although not attempted here, studies that wish to compare antibody response and seroprevalence between different sites should use a common assay platform and materials (e.g., shared bead coupling) with jointly estimated seropositivity cutoffs to help ensure comparability across sites, since there are currently no global reference standards to translate arbitrary units into antibody titers for enteropathogens. Seroepidemiologic measures that can be estimated from cross-sectional surveys are of particular interest for infectious diseases because most large-scale, population-based serosurveillance platforms use cross-sectional designs ( [Arnold et al., 2018](#bib2)). Our results show that seroprevalence and force of infection estimated from seroprevalence models adequately summarize between-pathogen heterogeneity in transmission when compared with longitudinal estimates of force of infection. Pathogens with fastest rising mean IgG and highest force of infection measured prospectively over the study period, and seroprevalence was rank-preserving with prospective force of infection in both Haiti and Kenya ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). Seroprevalence alone thus appears to be sufficient to assess relative pathogen transmission if measured in an age range that captures ample heterogeneity in response (in these cohorts < 3 years old). Our findings align with modeling studies of other infectious diseases such as malaria ( [Corran et al., 2018](#bib33)), and suggest that enteropathogens share similar seroepidemiologic features conducive to population-based surveillance in cross-sectional surveys despite different underlying immunology. Two caveats are that cross-sectional methods considered in this study will generally underestimate force of infection because they fail to rigorously account for seroreversion and incident boosting above seropositivity cutoffs ( [Figure 6](#fig6)), and seroprevalence is not a clear marker of cumulative exposure as children age beyond the window of primary infection because of waning IgG responses. The relative intensity of pathogen transmission based on serological measures in this analysis aligns with relative differences in infection from large-scale molecular testing in stool. For example, rapid rises in IgG levels, seroprevalence, and force of infection for ETEC and Campylobacter beginning very early in life is consistent with their prominence in molecular testing of stool specimens in the MAL-ED studies ( [Platts-Mills et al., 2018](#bib51); [Platts-Mills et al., 2015](#bib50)). Higher of infection for norovirus GII.4 compared with norovirus GI.4 in Haiti is consistent with the relative prominence of circulating genogroups ( [B\u00e1nyai et al., 2018](#bib5); [Rouhani et al., 2016](#bib59)). The results lend additional support to the idea that broader serological testing in existing serosurveillance platforms represents a useful opportunity to measure enteropathogen transmission in populations without routine stool-based testing ( [Metcalf et al., 2016](#bib39); [Arnold et al., 2018](#bib2)). These analyses had limitations. High correlation between Salmonella LPS Groups B and D, between ETEC LT B subunit and cholera toxin B subunit, and between norovirus GI norovirus GII at the individual level ( [Figure 2](#fig2)) shows that for these pathogens seroepidemiologic analyses will be less specific than analyses based on molecular detection. Salmonella LPS Groups B and D have antigenic overlap in their lipopolysaccharides ( [Grimont and subunit and cholera are to be immunologically cross-reactive ( [Smith and Sack, 1973](#bib66)). There was no known cholera transmission in the study populations, so we assumed the elevated responses to the cholera toxin B subunit reflected exposure to LT-producing ETEC; this assumption could only be confirmed with specific measures of cholera infection. Norovirus GI and GII virus-like particles are is possible ( [Tamminen et al., 2012](#bib69)). In addition, a recent study from Uganda found high seroprevalence for both GI and GII norovirus suggesting repeated infections by viruses of the same or different genogroup could potentially boost cross-reactive antibody production ( [Thorne et al., 2018](#bib73)). Despite lower specificity between genogroups or serogroups in these cases, the consistency of antibody relationships with predictions based on antigenic overlap, and absence of correlation between unrelated antibodies ( [Supplementary file 3](/articles/45594/figures#supp3)), lends support to the internal validity of the assays. Our reliance on IgG as a sole measure of immune response did not enable finer distinction between pathogens in age-dependent acquired immunity that might be possible with additional measures of immune function. For example, ETEC LT and Campylobacter IgG levels and seroprevalence consistently rose quickly by age 1 year across all of the cohorts ( [Figure 3](#fig3) and its supplements). We interpret the steep rise in IgG early in life to reflect higher transmission and exposure to ETEC and Campylobacter compared with other pathogens studied, but the steeper rise in IgG levels could also reflect a difference in immune mechanism. For example, it could reflect a more robust response to T-cell dependent antigens compared with T-cell independent antigens (e.g., Salmonella LPS), which might require a more mature immune system to mount a robust B-cell response ( [Siegrist and Aspinall, 2009](#bib63)). Yet, the steep rise in Salmonella LPS IgG among Haitian children ( [Figure 3](#fig3)), and the faster age-dependent rise in IgG response to Salmonella LPS compared with ETEC LT B subunit among children in the United States ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1)) suggest that differences in IgG acquisition by age likely reflect differences in early life pathogen exposure. Children were measured relatively infrequently in the Kenya and Haiti cohorts, which could have led to missed seroconversions if IgG levels waned below the seropositivity cutoff before a child's next measurement. Our simulations that studied the effect of more frequent sampling showed that monthly measurement could lead to higher force of infection estimates in settings with frequent exposure, and that more frequent measurements would be most valuable for highest transmission pathogens, such as ETEC and Campylobacter in this study ( [Figure 7](#fig7)). Higher resolution longitudinal measurements would also enable study of seasonal differences in enteropathogen transmission. Measurement timing in analysis populations precluded extensive evaluation of seasonal differences in IgG response, but age-adjusted seroprevalence was 1-5% higher across pathogens during the wet season in the Haiti cohort ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/45594/figures#supp1)). This exploratory result suggests a potential avenue of future research that could join high resolution temperature, precipitation, and antibody measurements to study seasonal drivers of enteropathogen transmission dynamics. Another limitation is that without measures of patent infection in stool we were unable to compare multiple independent measures of transmission. Paired stool and blood specimens could help resolve some of the questions raised above related to serological assay specificity and differential immune development across pathogens. The Haiti and Tanzania cohorts were not originally designed to assess enteropathogens, and antibody measurements were not paired with measures of clinical symptoms of diarrhea or with measures of patent infection in stool. In Haiti, [Moss et al. (2014)](#bib45) previously reported limited microscopy testing for protozoan cysts alongside IgG markers, but infrequent stool measurements prevented extensive comparisons. In Kenya, diarrheal stool testing during weekly follow-up visits for Cryptosporidium and Giardia showed that serology identified nearly all infections detected in stool, plus a substantial number of presumed infections not detected through diarrheal surveillance ( [Supplementary file 4](/articles/45594/figures#supp4)); however, for other pathogens studied we did not have stool-based measures of infection. All included antigens have been characterized extensively with respect to patent infections among adults and children in other settings (details in Materials and methods). Furthermore, we observed high levels of consistency across cohorts in seroepidemiologic patterns, and consistency with general age-dependent patterns documented across diverse pathogens for which transmission begins early in life ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1); [Hens et al., 2007](#bib14); [Katzelnick et al., 2018](#bib33)). Together, these observations suggest that the antibody dynamics and force of infection estimates from IgG responses reflect actual pathogen transmission in these cohorts, but paired stool and blood testing would provide a more definitive test. High-resolution, longitudinal assessment of paired enteropathogen infection and antibody measurements among children could provide valuable, additional insights into the pathogen-specific antibody dynamics following primary- and secondary infections. Analyses of Plasmodium falciparum ( [White et al., 2014](#bib79); virus ( [Salje et al., 2018](#bib61)) illustrate how paired, longitudinal measurements of patent infection and antibody response enable richer characterizations of antibody dynamics and pathogen transmission. Paired longitudinal stool and antibody testing among children and adults would enable studies of age-dependent enteropathogen antibody kinetics, and if present, disentangle them from age-varying incidence rates when using serology to estimate force of infection. Studies that pair stool-based molecular testing with antibody response could also assess whether approaches to estimate enteropathogen incidence from cross-sectional samples that rely on estimates of antibody decay with time since infection ( [Teunis et al., 2012](#bib71); [Simonsen et al., 2009](#bib65)) could be used among children in low-resource settings. A similar approach was recently described to estimate cholera incidence among all ages ( [Azman et al., 2019](#bib4)), but broader development across enteropathogens and among young children remains an open area of research. Conclusions Among children in Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania, antibody-based measures of enteropathogen infection reflected high transmission with primary exposure to most pathogens occurring by age 1-2 years. In low-resource populations, seroincidence rates and force of infection estimated beyond the age range of primary infection ideally should account for IgG boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs. Antibodies are a promising approach to measure population-level enteropathogen infection, and seroepidemiologic measures of heterogeneity and transmission are central considerations for their use in trials or in serologic surveillance. Our findings show that for most enteropathogens studied, the ideal window to measure heterogeneity in antibody response closes by ages 2 to 5 years in low-resource settings, and studies that plan to estimate force of infection should favor longitudinal designs with multiple measurements in this early age window. Materials and methods Ethics statement [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-1) In Haiti, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of St. Croix Hospital (Leogane, Haiti) and the institutional review board at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). After listening to an overview of the study, individuals were asked for verbal consent to participate. Verbal consent was deemed appropriate by both review boards because of low literacy rates in the study population. With each longitudinal visit, the study team re-consented participants before specimen collection. Mothers provided consent for children under 7, and children 7 years and older provided additional verbal assent. In Kenya, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and at the US CDC. Primary caretakers provided written informed consent for their infant child's participation in the trial and blood specimen collection and testing ( [Morris et al., 2018](#bib40)). The original trial was registered at [clinicaltrials.org](http://www.clinicaltrials.org) (NCT01695304). In Tanzania, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institute for Medical Research Ethical Review Committee in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and the institutional review board at the US CDC.

Multiplex bead assays Antigens [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-2-1) All antigens used have been well-characterized in previous studies. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Group D Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis ( [Strid et serotype Typhimurium ( [Strid et al., subunit protein et Escherichia coli (ETEC LT B subunit) were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant Giardia VSP-3 and VSP-5 ( [Priest et al., 2000](#bib54)) were expressed and purified as previously described ( [Priest et al., 2010](#bib56); [Schmidt-Ott et al., 2005](#bib62)) were expressed and purified as previously described ( [Zambrano et al., 2017](#bib83)). 1991](#bib70); [Houpt et al., 2004](#bib29)) was kindly provided by William Petri (University of Virginia) and Joel Herbein (TechLab). Virus-like particles from norovirus GI.4 and GII.4 New Orleans were purified from a recombinant baculovirus expression system ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1); [Jiang et al., 1992](#bib31); [Pisanic et al., 2019](#bib49)). All antibody responses were measured in multiplex bead assays on the Luminex platform at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Haiti study (PJL's laboratory), Kenya study (JWP's laboratory), and Tanzania study (DLM's laboratory). Haiti [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-2-2) Sera from the Haiti cohort study were diluted 1:400 and analyzed by multiplex bead assay as described in detail elsewhere ( [Moss et al., 2014](#bib45); [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1); [Hamlin 2012](#bib25)). Salmonella LPS and ETEC LT B subunit antigens were coupled to SeroMap Austin, TX) in buffer containing 0.85% NaCl and 10 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 7.2 (PBS) using 120 micrograms for 1.25 \u00d7 107 beads using the methods described by Moss and colleagues ( [Moss et al., 2011](#bib44)). Coupling conditions and externally defined cutoff values for the Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and E. histolytica antigens as well as for the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione-S-transferase (GST) negative control protein have been previously reported ( [Moss et al., 2014](#bib45)). Each multiplex bead assay plate (N = 25) included four control sera: one negative sample and three positive samples that spanned the response range from low to high for a selection of the antigen markers. For the positive control sample responses to the 10 enteric antigens used in this study, the average coefficient of variation (CV%) was 8.3 with a standard deviation of 4.3. The median CV% was 7.9 with a range of 2.3% to 19.9%. Kenya [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-2-3) For the Kenya study, an optimized bead coupling technique using less total protein was performed in buffer containing 0.85% NaCl and 25 mM 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.0. The B subunit protein from cholera toxin was purchased from Sigma Chemical. The GST negative control protein (15 g), Cryptosporidium Cp17 (6.8 g) and Cp23 (12.5 g) proteins and the Campylobacter p39 protein (25 g) were coupled to 1.25 \u00d7 107 beads using the indicated protein amounts ( and Campylobacter p18 proteins were coupled using 30 g of protein per 1.25 \u00d7 107 beads. Salmonella LPS B and LPS D were coupled to the same number of beads using 60 g and 120 g, respectively. Blood spot elutions from the Kenya study were diluted to a final serum concentration of 1:400 (assuming 50% hematocrit) and analyzed by multiplex bead assay as described by Morris and colleagues ( [Morris et al., 2018](#bib40)). Each multiplex bead assay plate (N = 11) included five control sera: one negative sample and four positive control samples offering a range of responses to various antigen markers. For the positive control sample responses to the 11 enteric antigens used in this study, the average CV% was 6.3 with a standard deviation of 3.7. The median CV% was 5.3 with a range of 1.1% to 14.9%. Tanzania [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-2-4) For the Tanzania study, the same conditions described in the Kenya study were used to couple antigens from Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, ETEC B toxin subunit, cholera B toxin subunit, GST, and Salmonella LPS group B and LPS group D. Campylobacter p39 and p18 were both coupled at 25 g per 1.25 \u00d7 107 beads in buffer containing 0.85% NaCl and 25 mM 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.0. Dried blood spots were eluted in the casein-based buffer described previously ( [Priest et al., 2010](#bib56)) and samples were diluted to either 1:400 serum dilution with 50 \u00b5l run per well for year 1, or 1:320 serum dilution with 40 \u00b5l run per well for years 2-4. The incubation steps, washes, and data collection methods used in the multiplex bead assay were performed as described previously ( [Priest et al., 2010](#bib56)). All samples were run in duplicate, and the average median fluorescence intensity minus background (MFI-bg) value was recorded. Each multiplex bead assay plate (N = 37) included four control sera: one negative sample and three positive control samples offering a range of responses to various antigen markers. For the positive control sample responses to the nine enteric antigens used in this study, the average CV% was 8.4 with a standard deviation of 5.3. The median CV% was 5.3 with a range of 2.6 to 15.1. The Tanzania study used different bead lots in year 1 and years 2-4; we confirmed that the use of different bead lots had no influence on the results ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/45594/figures#supp1)). Antibody distributions and determination of seropositivity [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-3) We transformed IgG levels to the log10 scale because the distributions were highly skewed. Means of the log-transformed data represent geometric means. We summarized the distribution of log10 IgG response using kernel density smoothers. In the Tanzania and Haiti cohorts, where children were measured across a broad age range, we stratified IgG distributions by each year of age <3 years to examine age-dependent changes in the population distributions. To assess potential cross-reactivity between antigens, we estimated pairwise correlations between individual-level measurements in each cohort using a Spearman rank correlation ( [Zar, 2005](#bib84)) and visualized the relationship for each pairwise combination with locally weighted regression fits ( [Cleveland and Devlin, 1988](#bib12)). We compared three approaches to estimate seropositivity cutoffs. Approach 1: External known positive and negative specimens were used to determine seropositivity cutoffs antigen. Cutoffs were determined using ROC analysis as previously described ( [Moss et al., 2014](#bib45); [Morris et al., except for LecA, VSP-3, and VSP-5 in Haiti; in these cases, the mean plus three standard deviations of 65 specimens from citizens of the USA with no history of foreign travel were used to estimate cutoffs ( [Moss et al., 2014](#bib45)). Approach 2: finite Gaussian mixture model ( [Benaglia et al., 2009](#bib6)) to the antibody distributions among children 0-1 years old, and estimated seropositivity cutoffs using the lower component's mean plus three standard deviations. The rationale for restricting the mixture model estimation in Haiti and Tanzania to children 0-1 years old was based on initial inspection of the age-stratified IgG distributions that revealed a shift from bimodal to unimodal distributions by age 3 ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). This approach ensured that there was a sufficiently large fraction of unexposed children in the sample to more clearly estimate a distribution among seronegative children. Approach 3: In the longitudinal Haiti and Kenya cohorts we identified children < 1 year old who presumably seroconverted, defined as an increase in MFI-bg values of +two or more on the log10 scale. A sensitivity analysis showed that an increase of 2 on the log10 scale was a conservative approach to identify seroconversion for most antibodies considered in this study; an increase of between 0.3 to 2.16 MFI-bg lead to optimal agreement with ROC-based and mixture model-based classifications in Kenya, and an increase of 0.92 to 2.41 led to optimal agreement across antigens and references in Haiti ( [Supplementary file 5](/articles/45594/figures#supp5)). We then used the distribution of measurements before seroconversion to define the distribution of IgG values among the presumed unexposed. We used the mean log10 MFI-bg plus three standard deviations of the presumed unexposed distribution as a seropositivity cutoff. We summarized the proportion of observations that were in agreement between the three classification approaches, and estimated Cohen's Kappa ( [Cohen, 1960](#bib13)). Additional details and estimates of seropositivity cutoff agreement are reported in [Supplementary file 2](/articles/45594/figures#supp2). Mixture models failed to estimate realistic cutoff values if there was an insufficient number of unexposed children, which was the case for ETEC LT B subunit and cholera toxin B subunit in all cohorts, and for nearly all antigens in Tanzania where the study did not enroll children < 1 year old ( [Table 1](#table1)). In analyses of seroprevalence and seroconversion, we classified measurements as seropositive using ROC-based cutoffs if available, and mixture model-based cutoffs otherwise. There were three exceptions. By age 1 year, a majority of children across the cohorts had IgG levels near the maximum of the assay's dynamic range for ETEC LT B toxin and cholera toxin B subunit. The absence of a sufficient number of unexposed children to ETEC LT B toxin, cholera B toxin, and in some cases Campylobacter p18 or p39 led mixture models either to not converge or to estimate unrealistically high seropositivity cutoffs beyond the range of quantifiable levels. For these pathogens, we used seropositivity cutoffs estimated from presumed unexposed measurements in the longitudinal Haiti and Kenya cohorts (approach 3, above). High levels of agreement between classifications ( [Supplementary file 2](/articles/45594/figures#supp2)) meant results were insensitive to choice of approach in these cohorts. We classified children as seropositive to Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, or Salmonella if antibody levels against either of the antigens from each pathogen were above estimated seropositivity cutoffs. Age-dependent antibody levels and seroprevalence curves [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-4) We estimated mean IgG levels and seroprevalence by age using semiparametric cubic splines in a generalized additive model, specifying binomial errors for seroprevalence, and random effects for children or clusters in the case of repeated observations ( [Wood, 2017](#bib82); [Wood, 2012](#bib81)). We also estimated the relationships by age using a stacked ensemble approach called 'super learner' that included a broader and more flexible library of machine learning algorithms ( [Arnold et al., 2017](#bib1); [van der Laan et al., 2007](#bib74); [Polley et al., 2018](#bib52)), and found similar fits to cubic splines. We estimated approximate, simultaneous 95% confidence intervals around the curves using a parametric bootstrap from posterior estimates of the model parameter [Ruppert et al., 2003](#bib60)). [Supplementary file 6](/articles/45594/figures#supp6) includes additional details. Force of infection from longitudinal data [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-5) In the Kenya and Haiti longitudinal cohorts, we estimated prospective seroconversion rates as a measure of force of infection by dividing the number of children who seroconverted by the person-time at risk between measurements. We defined incident seroconversions and seroreversions as a change in IgG across a pathogen's seropositivity cutoff. Vaccine immunogenicity and pathogen challenge studies among healthy adults often use a 4-fold increase in antibody levels (difference of +0.6 on the log10 scale) as a criterion for seroconversion [Bernstein et 2015](#bib7); [Jin et al., 2017](#bib32); [Chakraborty et al., 2018](#bib10)). In a secondary analysis aimed to capture significant changes above a pathogen's seropositivity cutoff, we defined incident boosting episodes as a 4 fold increase in IgG to a final level above a seropositivity cutoff, and incident waning episodes as 4 fold decrease in IgG from an initial level above a seropositivity cutoff. In the secondary definition, individuals were considered at risk for incident boosting episode if they were seronegative, if they experienced a 4 fold increase in IgG in their first measurement period, or if they experienced a 4 fold decrease in IgG in a preceding period (Haiti). To estimate person-time at risk used for rates and force of infection, we assumed incident changes were interval-censored and occurred at the midpoint between measurements. We estimated 95% confidence intervals for rates with 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles a nonparametric bootstrap distribution ( [Wasserman, 2004](#bib77)) that resampled children with replacement to account for repeated observations. Force of infection from age-structured seroprevalence in Kenya In the Kenya cohort, we estimated force of infection through age-structured seroprevalence using multiple approaches. There is a long history methods development to estimate force of infection from age-dependent seroprevalence ( [Hens et al., 2012](#bib27)), which is of particular interest to large-scale, cross-sectional surveillance platforms ( [Arnold et al., 2018](#bib2)). Our rationale was to determine if force of infection estimates from age-structured seroprevalence were comparable to estimates from the longitudinal analysis based on incident changes in serostatus. As we show in [Supplementary file 7](/articles/45594/figures#supp7), the age dependent seroprevalence curve is the difference between the cumulative distribution functions of seroconversion times and seroreversion times. In a special case of no seroreversion, age-specific seroprevalence is thus the cumulative hazard function. The age-specific force of infection can then be estimated as the hazard of seroconverting at age A = a: (a) = F(a) / [1 - F(a)], where F(a)=P(Y | A = a) is the proportion of the population who are seropositive at age a and F(a) is the derivative of F(a) with respect to a. Key assumptions include stationarity/homogeneity (i.e., no intervention or cohort effects) and that there is no seroreversion ( [Hens et al., 2012](#bib27)). There was no evidence for large changes in transmission during the studies, even due to intervention ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/45594/figures#supp1)). We know for many enteric pathogens children in the Kenya cohort did serorevert (e.g., [Figure 6](#fig6)); when assumption is violated, estimates provide a lower-bound of a pathogen's force of infection. We considered three different estimation approaches for force of infection from age-structured seroprevalence. Exponential model (SIR model) [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-6-1) The simplest catalytic model, a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, assumed a constant force of infection over different ages, (a) = and no seroreversion ( [Hens et al., 2012](#bib27)). In the survival analysis context, this is equivalent to assuming a constant hazard, which can be estimated with an exponential survival model. We modeled the probability of being seropositive conditional on age with a generalized linear model fit with maximum likelihood that assumed a binomial error structure and complementary log-log link ( [Jewell and Laan, 1995](#bib30)). We estimated average force of infection from the model's intercept term: Reversible catalytic model (SIS model) [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-6-2) For some infectious diseases, like malaria, reversible catalytic models have been proposed to estimate force of infection from an age-seroprevalence curve while accounting for antibody waning with time since infection ( [Corran et al., 2007](#bib14)). The model assumes a constant rate of seroconversion, , but extends the SIR model by also assuming a constant seroreversion rate, , equivalent to a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We modeled the probability of a child being seropositive conditional on age as a function of these two additional parameters: We fit the model with maximum likelihood assuming a binomial error structure and a fixed seroreversion rate. To incorporate information about the seroreversion rate in the model, we bootstrapped the dataset 1000 times, resampling children with replacement. In each bootstrap replicate, we estimated each pathogen's seroreversion rate using information from longitudinal data, and then fit the reversible catalytic model assuming a cross-sectional sample. The results are thus optimistic because they incorporate some information from the longitudinal design. Attempts to fit an SIS model assuming only a cross-sectional design with the seroreversion rate as a second free parameter led to highly unstable estimates, consistent with results presented in [Supplementary file 7](/articles/45594/figures#supp7) that show age-dependent seroprevalence alone does not technically contain information about seroreversion (). As an internal validity check, we confirmed that force of infection estimates from the SIS model matched those from the SIR model for ETEC and Campylobacter, pathogens which had seroreversion rates that approached 0. Semiparametric spline model [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-6-3) We fit a model that allowed force of infection to vary flexibly by age using cubic splines in a generalized additive model ( [Wood, 2017](#bib82)). Let for an arbitrary function , which we fit with cubic splines that had smoothing parameters chosen through cross-validation. The age-specific prevalence predicted from the model is: and the age-specific force of infection is: where is the first derivative of the linear predictor from the logit model ( [Hens et al., 2012](#bib27)). We estimated and its standard error using finite differences from spline model predictions ( [Wood, 2017](#bib82); [Wood, 2012](#bib81)). To estimate average force of infection from the model, comparable to other methods used, for each pathogen we estimated the marginal average force of infection over the empirical age distribution in the cohort: We estimated approximate 95% confidence intervals for the average force of infection by simulation with a parametric bootstrap that was based on the posterior distribution of model parameters ( [Ruppert et al., 2003](#bib60); [Marra and Wood, 2012](#bib38)). [Supplementary file 7](/articles/45594/figures#supp7) provides additional details, including age-specific estimates of force of infection for each pathogen. Effects of sampling interval on serological force of infection estimates [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap45594?item=s4-7) We conducted a simulation study to investigate whether longer sampling intervals used in the Kenya and Haiti cohorts could lead to under-estimates of seroconversion rates. We modeled a single antigen per pathogen (e.g., Cp17 for Cryptosporidium). For each cohort, we created 100 simulated datasets that imputed each child's daily IgG levels. The simulation was designed provide an approximate upper bound on force of infection measured with serology. IgG levels were allowed to continuously boost and wane as long as each child's IgG trajectory remained consistent with their empirical measurements. We drew IgG boosts for each antibody from the empirical distribution of >4 fold increases in each cohort. We assumed IgG levels decayed exponentially. We estimated exponential decay parameters for each antibody using a subsample of adjacent measurements separated by <1 year with the largest decline in IgG (bottom quintile of declines), selected to reduce the possibility of intermediate exposures. IgG half-life estimates ranged from 51 to 169 days across antibodies in Haiti. In Kenya, too few children experienced reductions in IgG between measures for us to reliably estimate antibody decay rates, so the simulation assumed a fixed IgG decay rate across antibodies that corresponded to a half-life of 69 days, which was broadly consistent with the majority of IgG half-life estimates in Haiti and with 12 week half-life estimates for Cryptosporidium IgG levels among Canadian adults ( [Priest et al., 2001](#bib55)). After simulating daily IgG trajectories for all children, we down-sampled the imputed data at intervals of 30, 90, 180, and 360 days and estimated seroconversion rates and seroreversion per the main analysis. We found that sampling intervals of 30 days adequately summarized even the most dynamic IgG trajectories. As an internal validity check, we compared seroconversion and seroreversion rates estimated from the simulations with empirical rates at comparable sampling intervals (180 days in Kenya, 360 days in Haiti) and found excellent agreement. Across the 100 simulated datasets, we quantified the potential influence of measurement frequency on force of infection estimates by estimating median rates for each pathogen and sampling interval, as well as the median difference in rates between sampling intervals.

Summary: This manuscript reports on the dynamics of enteropathogen-specific antibody responses in three cohorts of children in LMICs. While largely descriptive in nature, this manuscript provides an important foundational look at enteropathogen antibody kinetics and points towards important methodological issues that must be solved in the future if we are to improve the use of serology for inference about enteric infection incidence. Hence this is an important and innovative piece of work that pushes the boundaries in integrated serological surveillance, beyond the past work in the field by yourselves and other groups. It opens up the potential for use of serosurveillance for enteric infections, to measure impact of public health interventions, and to better understand disease transmission. Despite some concerns, this report has the potential to be highly influential in the field of enteric disease epidemiology. Essential revisions: 1) The conclusions of the paper are based only on analysis of serologic data, without demonstrated exposure confirmed by molecular or microbial detection, and longitudinal measures are 6-12 months apart. Thus, the poor granularity of data points may result in misclassifications of \"primary\" infection, and \"boosting\" due to repeated exposures. For example, in longitudinal studies of cholera patients, approximately 30% have a 4-fold \"boosting\" of antibody responses in the 6-12 months following an initial infection. More frequent exposures may not be well-captured by the yearly sampling that was done in Haiti, or even the 6 months apart samples from Kenya. We would like to see more exploration of this, and if possible, some method for correcting/adjusting this. For instance, the discussion notes that for two of the three studies, there were no paired stool samples. However, for the Kenyan study by Morris et al., this data was available. Although the number of PCR positive stool samples was small, it would still be incredibly valuable to look at antibody responses in PCR +ve versus PCR -ve samples. This could be done, for example, in Supplementary file 1. 2) With such dynamic post-infection kinetics the idea of seroprevalence more complicated than traditional settings where it is more or less a saturating state. In these cases, as the authors note in the discussion, the measured antibody response reflects both the effect of cumulative exposures and the time since one's last infection. It would be helpful for the authors to expand more on what seroprevalence actually means in this context and whether cut-offs should be age dependent or whether we should abandon this concept in adults? 3) It would be helpful if the authors could briefly discuss how they may disentangle age-specific serologic kinetics from age-specific incidence rates (perhaps due to different exposures/mixing patterns with age). This will certainly complicate interpretation of some epidemiologic inference. 4) It would be helpful for the authors to expand on the suggested age range where seroprevalence data (age-specific or aggregate) may be the most informative. I wonder if some measure of entropy could help. 5) The biggest serologic rises in early childhood is seen in T-cell-dependent antigens LTB, campylobacter p18/39), and less so on T-independent antigens (Salmonella LPS). This could be because the low \"seroconversions\" in Salmonella LPS IgG in early childhood are a reflection of an immature immune system (we know that polysaccharide-specific IgG2 also increases with age), rather than a relative lack of exposures. A discussion of this is warranted at least, and if data sets are available, examination of longitudinal and cross-sectional enteric pathogen IgG responses from cohorts in higher-income countries (where primary enteropathogen exposures occur later in childhood due to improved WASH or rota vaccination) would help to tease out the specificity of such findings to this age group in LMICs. 6) There is no mention of seasonality in either the description of sampling methodology or in the analysis. We know that several enteropathogens (ETEC and norovirus in particular have been well-studied) occur with seasonal variation - this needs to be accounted for in the analysis. 7) Seroconversion is defined as 4-fold; however, in methods for seropositivity cutoffs, seroconversion was defined as increase in MFI-bg values of +2 or more on log10 scale (subsection \"Antibody distributions and determination of seropositivity\"). Though the 4-fold definition has been used by other groups, it is quite arbitrary and sensitivity analyses should be performed with other definitions of seroconversion. 8) The authors note that the slope of the relationship between seroprevalence and foi differs between Kenya and Haiti and suggest it may be due to the older ages included in the Kenya cohort. The authors could explore whether this is likely the case by looking at how the slope changes when analysis is restricted to lower age groups. Sample size may be a challenge but it seems like this may strengthen their explanation. 9) The authors note that the confidence intervals using the RCM model are small. These confidence intervals do not take into account the seroreversion parameter and it seems like this could be jointly estimated from longitudinal data and the age-specific seroprevalence curves.

Thus, the poor granularity of data points may result in misclassifications of \"primary\" infection, and \"boosting\" due to repeated exposures.

We would like to see more exploration of this, and if possible, some method for correcting/adjusting this. For instance, the discussion notes that for two of the three studies, there were no paired stool samples. However, for the Kenyan study by Morris et al., this data was available. Although the number of PCR positive stool samples was small, it would still be incredibly valuable to look at antibody responses in PCR +ve versus PCR -ve samples. This could be done, for example, in Supplementary file 1. We agree that measurement frequency in the longitudinal cohorts (6 months in Kenya, 12 months in Haiti) combined with absence of paired stool-based testing could result in misclassification of \"primary infection\" and \"boosting\" of antibody responses following an initial infection. We would expect misclassification arising from the coarsened serological measurements to lead to the estimates presented to represent lower bounds on the force of infection because we might under-estimate the incidence of actual infection. We have explored this issue in more detail through two additions to the paper. First, we conducted a simulation study in the Haiti and Kenya cohorts that imputed each child's IgG levels with daily resolution, with IgG kinetics modeled from empirical measures of boosting levels and waning rates in the cohorts. Simulation results suggest that, as predicted, less frequent monitoring could under-estimate seroconversion rates in settings where children have very frequent repeated infections. The influence of measurement frequency on estimates was relatively small in magnitude for most pathogens (+0.1 to +0.9 additional seroconversions per child-year detected with monthly monitoring compared with measurements every 6- or 12-months), but was more significant for highest transmission pathogens in this study, ETEC and Campylobacter. The new text added to the results, included below, summarizes the main findings. Supplementary file 8 describes the simulation in detail, with a summary of the approach in the Materials and methods. A new Figure 7 summarizes the main results. New text added to Results: \"We conducted a simulation study to investigate whether longer sampling intervals in the cohorts (6 months in Kenya, 12 months in Haiti) could lead us to miss more frequent exposures and thus under-estimate force of infection. [...]However, for pathogens with highest seroconversion rates, ETEC and Campylobacter, increases in rates estimated with 30-day sampling intervals detected a median of 4 to 8 additional seroconversions per child-year at risk compared with empirical rates (Figure 7).\" Second, we completed an analysis in the Kenya cohort that compared IgG responses among children who had confirmed Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in diarrheal stools during weekly longitudinal monitoring, versus those who did not. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were the only two pathogens studied with serology that were also tested in stool. A new Supplementary file 4 includes the full analysis. We added the following text to the Results: \"Comparison of serology with stool-based measures of infection The Kenya study monitored diarrhea symptoms in weekly visits between enrollment and follow-up. [...] This suggests that many children were not shedding oocysts at the time of diarrheal stool collection, or many infections with these two pathogens were asymptomatic. Supplementary file 4 includes additional details.\" And to the Limitations section of the Discussion: \"In Kenya, diarrheal stool testing during weekly follow-up visits for Cryptosporidium and Giardia showed that serology identified nearly all infections detected in stool, plus a substantial number of presumed infections not detected through diarrheal surveillance (Supplementary file 4); however, for other pathogens studied we did not have stool-based measures of infection.\" 2) With such dynamic post-infection kinetics the idea of seroprevalence more complicated than traditional settings where it is more or less a saturating state. In these cases, as the authors note in the discussion, the measured antibody response reflects both the effect of cumulative exposures and the time since one's last infection. It would be helpful for the authors to expand more on what seroprevalence actually means in this context and whether cut-offs should be age dependent or whether we should abandon this concept in adults? We expanded on interpretation of seroprevalence in the Discussion to provide additional thoughts related to cutoff interpretation and use (text below). We hesitate to extrapolate our findings from this study to comment on the appropriateness of age-dependent cutoff values or the concept of seropositivity among adults because little is known about how durable the IgG response is for most of these pathogens outside of studies among adults in the United States and Europe, where transmission is much less intense. Among children we demonstrated a consistent shift at the population level from bi-modal distributions to unimodal distributions for antibody responses to pathogens such as Giardia, but it is unclear whether the population distribution stabilizes or whether it continues to shift lower as individuals age, gradually moving back to more closely approximating the \"unexposed\" distribution. As two of the reviewers recently demonstrated for cholera IgG among people of all-ages in Bangladesh (Azman et al., 2019), for cholera in that setting seropositivity cutoffs appear to remain useful even among adults because CTB IgG responses decay sufficiently over approximately 1-2 years to enable detection of boosting due to new infections. Revised Discussion section: \"The shift of IgG distributions from pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, and Campylobacter), resulting from a combination of antibody boosting, waning and adaptive acquired immunity, complicates the interpretation of seropositivity at older ages: among older children a seronegative response could either mean the children were never exposed or they were previously exposed but antibody levels waned below seropositivity cutoffs. [...] Increases in mean IgG levels and seroprevalence with age imply IgG boosting from new infections or repeated infections outpaced IgG decay for all enteropathogens studied until at least age 3 years, and for many pathogens through age 10 years; seroprevalence thus reflects a conservative lower bound of a population's cumulative exposure over this age range. The age range over which seroprevalence provided useful epidemiologic information varied by pathogen and cohort. In Haiti, 100% of children were seropositive to ETEC LT B toxin before age 12 months, though seroprevalence did not exceed 90% for most other pathogens until age 5 years in Haiti (Figure 3). In Kenya, the age range of 4-18 months captured wide variation in seroprevalence for most pathogens, and in Tanzania inclusion of children ages 1 and older missed the key window of variation in antibody response for all pathogens except E. histolytica and Salmonella (Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2). Studies that extend beyond 10 years into adolescence and adulthood would help determine whether enteropathogen seroprevalence remains sufficiently high that it no longer provides useful epidemiologic information. The shift in IgG distributions for some pathogens results raises the question of whether population mean IgG levels stabilize at a new \"set point\" with repeated infections as has been observed for dengue serotypes (40); if so, then the use of fold-changes in IgG would be preferred to seropositivity cutoffs to identify incident infections among older ages. In low-resource settings, measuring a sufficient number of young children before primary infection, preferably with longitudinal measurements, will help ensure that within-sample seropositivity cutoff estimation is possible. Two-component mixture models fit the data and provided reasonable cutoff estimates only when restricted to an age range that included clearly delineated subpopulations of seronegative and seropositive responses. For most pathogens studied, this required measurements among children <1 year old, an age range during which IgG responses still followed a bimodal distribution. The only reliable approach to estimate seropositivity cutoffs for the highest transmission pathogens like ETEC and Campylobacter was to estimate a distribution among presumed unexposed by identifying measurements among children who subsequently experienced a large increase in IgG, a strategy only possible in a longitudinal design. Although not attempted here, studies that wish to compare antibody response and seroprevalence between different sites should use a common assay platform and materials (e.g., shared bead coupling) with jointly estimated seropositivity cutoffs to help ensure comparability across sites, since there are currently no global reference standards to translate arbitrary units into antibody titers for enteropathogens.\" 3) It would be helpful if the authors could briefly discuss how they may disentangle age-specific serologic kinetics from age-specific incidence rates (perhaps due to different exposures/mixing patterns with age). This will certainly complicate interpretation of some epidemiologic inference. We agree that if age-specific differences in antibody kinetics exist, that it could complicate epidemiologic inference in a setting with age-varying incidence. Our view is that longitudinal designs that pair high resolution measures of infection in stool with antibody measurements would be essential to disentangle the two processes. We added the following sentence to the Discussion: \"Paired longitudinal stool and antibody testing among children and adults would enable studies of age-dependent enteropathogen antibody kinetics, and if present, disentangle them from age-varying incidence rates when using serology to estimate force of infection.\" 4) It would be helpful for the authors to expand on the suggested age range where seroprevalence data (age-specific or aggregate) may be the most informative. I wonder if some measure of entropy could help. Please see our additions in response to comment 2. 5) The biggest serologic rises in early childhood is seen in T-cell-dependent antigens LTB, campylobacter p18/39), and less so on T-independent antigens (Salmonella LPS). This could be because the low \"seroconversions\" in Salmonella LPS IgG in early childhood are a reflection of an immature immune system (we know that polysaccharide-specific IgG2 also increases with age), rather than a relative lack of exposures. A discussion of this is warranted at least, and if data sets are available, examination of longitudinal and cross-sectional enteric pathogen IgG responses from cohorts in higher-income countries (where primary enteropathogen exposures occur later in childhood due to improved WASH or rota vaccination) would help to tease out the specificity of such findings to this age group in LMICs. Thank you very much for providing this insightful hypothesis. Based on this, we added text to the Discussion to mention this possibility and discuss the idea with respect to age-dependent IgG responses measured among children in the United States, which we published previously. \"Our reliance on IgG as a sole measure of immune response did not enable finer distinction between pathogens in age-dependent acquired immunity that might be possible with additional measures of immune function. [...] Yet, the steep rise in Salmonella LPS IgG among Haitian children (Figure 3), and the faster age-dependent rise in IgG response to Salmonella LPS compared with ETEC LT B subunit among children in the United States (15) suggest that differences in IgG acquisition by age likely reflect differences in early life pathogen exposure.\" 6) There is no mention of seasonality in either the description of sampling methodology or in the analysis. We know that several enteropathogens (ETEC and norovirus in particular have been well-studied) occur with seasonal variation - this needs to be accounted for in the analysis. We have added more specific details about sample timing with respect to seasonality (additions summarized below). In the Kenya and Tanzania studies, specimen collection took place during narrow windows that did not capture seasonal variation. In Kenya, all specimens were collected in two, three-week windows: between Jan 30 - Feb 22, 2013 at enrollment, and Aug 12 - Sep 4, 2013 at follow-up. In western Kenya, the there are two periods of seasonally heavy rain: March - May and November - December. Thus, specimen collection took place during dry periods and the follow-up period captured the March - May wet season. The Tanzania study collected specimens between October and December of each year (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), just before the beginning of the rainy season. In Haiti, there are two annual rainy seasons: April-June and August-October. The study collected measurements in both dry and wet seasons. A previous study of the protozoan IgG responses measured in this cohort found slightly higher mean levels of Giardia VSP and E. histolytica LecA antigens (Moss et al., 2014). We extended the previous analysis to include all antigens in the present study and to examine both geometric mean IgG levels and seroprevalence by season. We examined antibody response by season and found some evidence for higher mean antibody levels and seroprevalence across all pathogens during the wet season. However, the differences were small in magnitude (e.g., increases in seroprevalence of 1 to 4 percentage points during the wet season, depending on the pathogen; prevalence ratios ranged from 1.01 to 1.07). We examined age-dependent patterns in IgG levels and found slightly higher levels during the wet season but no substantive difference in the shape of the curves. We summarized the results in Supplementary file 1. Based on the results, we concluded that season was not a major determinant of the main results described in the Haitian cohort. We have mentioned this dimension to the study and future work in the Discussion. \"Higher resolution longitudinal measurements would also enable study of seasonal differences in enteropathogen transmission. Measurement timing in the analysis populations precluded extensive evaluation of seasonal differences in IgG response, but age-adjusted seroprevalence was 1-5% higher across pathogens during the wet season in the Haiti cohort (Supplementary file 1). This exploratory result suggests a potential avenue of future research that could join high resolution temperature, precipitation, and antibody measurements to study seasonal drivers of enteropathogen transmission dynamics.\" 7) Seroconversion is defined as 4-fold; however, in methods for seropositivity cutoffs, seroconversion was defined as increase in MFI-bg values of +2 or more on log10 scale (subsection \"Antibody distributions and determination of seropositivity\"). Though the 4-fold definition has been used by other groups, it is quite arbitrary and sensitivity analyses should be performed with other definitions of seroconversion. Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that the use of a 4-fold increase is somewhat arbitrary in this context, though there is some justification of that magnitude of IgG increase to define seroconversion based on enteric pathogen challenge studies (e.g., Moe et al., 2004 for norovirus https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15539501). Our use of +2 on the log10 scale (100-fold increase) to identify \"presumed unexposed\" children was intentionally conservative to identify measurements that were highly likely to have been among unexposed. In response to this suggestion, we conducted sensitivity analyses in Haitian and Kenyan cohorts to examine the sensitivity of the results to the choice of IgG fold-change used to define boosting and waning. We varied the fold-change in IgG from 2 to 10 and repeated boosting and waning incidence rate analyses. In Haiti, larger values resulted in lower rates, but the rates typically declined non-linearly and, interestingly, converged with rates based on seropositivity around a 4-fold increase. Incident boosting rates using a 4-fold increase were very similar to use of seroconversion rates based on crossing seropositivity cutoffs, and were statistically indistinguishable for all pathogens except for Cryptosporidium, where rates did not converge until using a 5-6 fold increase in IgG. In Kenya, estimates were insensitive to the choice of fold-change in IgG used to define incident boosting, and estimates were near identical to seroconversion rates across all fold-changes in IgG. This was presumably because most increases in IgG were large in the Kenyan cohort, reflecting a primary infection for most children in this early age range. Supplementary file 5 includes this new sensitivity analysis. We added the following text to the manuscript: \"Sensitivity analyses that defined incident boosting over a range of 2-fold to 10-fold increases in IgG showed force of infection estimates were relatively stable across a wide range of definitions. In Haiti, the only pathogen for which force of infection estimated using a 4-fold increase in IgG was significantly higher than the seroconversion rate was Cryptosporidium (Supplementary file 5).\" 8) The authors note that the slope of the relationship between seroprevalence and foi differs between Kenya and Haiti and suggest it may be due to the older ages included in the Kenya cohort. The authors could explore whether this is likely the case by looking at how the slope changes when analysis is restricted to lower age groups. Sample size may be a challenge but it seems like this may strengthen their explanation. Thank you for this suggestion. On your recommendation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby we progressively restricted the age range of the Haiti cohort with progressively narrow bands from 0-5 years to 0-2 years. We stopped at 0-2 years because there were fewer than 100 measurements among ages 0-1 years. The result was consistent with our earlier conjecture: the relationship was steepest amongst the youngest age band and gradually flattened as measurements among older children were included in the analysis. We added this analysis as a new supplement to Figure 5. We added the following text to the manuscript: \"Consistent with this interpretation, when we progressively narrowed the age range of the Haitian cohort and repeated the analysis, the relationship was steeper when estimated among children ages 0-2 years and flattened as measurements among older children were added (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1).\" 9) The authors note that the confidence intervals using the RCM model are small. These confidence intervals do not take into account the seroreversion parameter and it seems like this could be jointly estimated from longitudinal data and the age-specific seroprevalence curves. Thank you for this suggestion. We modified the modeling approach slightly to include uncertainty in the seroreversion parameter in the reversible catalytic model. We elected to estimate the confidence intervals using a non-parametric bootstrap, and within each bootstrap replicate we re-estimated the seroreversion rate using the longitudinal information in the replicate sample. This led to slightly, but not substantially, wider confidence intervals on the seroconversion rate compared with the asymptotic intervals that we originally presented. Figure 6 now includes the revised confidence intervals, and the direct comparison of confidence interval width is presented in Supplementary file 7 that generates the figure. Revised text in Materials and methods: \"We fit the model with maximum likelihood assuming a binomial error structure and a fixed seroreversion rate. [...] Attempts to fit an SIR model assuming only a cross-sectional design with the seroreversion rate as a second free parameter led to highly unstable estimates, consistent with results presented in Supplementary file 7 that show age-dependent seroprevalence alone does not technically contain information about seroreversion ().\" [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45594.034](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45594.034) Article and author information Author details Funding National Institutes of Health (K01-AI119180) - Benjamin F Arnold Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1022543) - Patrick J Lammie The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Ethics Human subjects: In Haiti, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of St Croix Hospital (Leogane, Haiti) and the institutional review board at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). After listening to an overview of the study, individuals were asked for verbal consent to participate. Verbal consent was deemed appropriate by both review boards because of low literacy rates in the study population. With each longitudinal visit, the study team re-consented participants before specimen collection. Mothers provided consent for children under 7, and children 7 years and older provided additional verbal assent. In Kenya, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and at the US CDC. Primary caretakers provided written informed consent for their infant child's participation in the trial and blood specimen collection and testing. The original trial was registered at clinicaltrials.org (NCT01695304). In Tanzania, the human subjects protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institute for Medical Research Ethical Review Committee in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the institutional review board at the US CDC. Parents of enrolled children provided consent, and children 7 years and older also provided verbal assent before specimen collection.

There is an urgent need for easily implementable and clinically effective Early Warning Scores (EWSs) that can predict the risk of complications within the next 24-48 hr. Although EWSs have been used in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients, there are several clinical limitations to their use. Moreover, no models have been tested on geographically distinct populations or population groups with varying levels of immune protection. Methods: We developed and validated COVID-19 Early Warning Score (COEWS), an EWS that is automatically calculated solely from laboratory parameters that are widely available and affordable. We benchmarked COEWS against the widely used NEWS2. We also evaluated the predictive performance of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Results: The variables of the COEWS predictive model were selected based on their predictive coefficients and on the wide availability of these laboratory variables. The final model included complete blood count, blood glucose, and oxygen saturation features. To make COEWS more actionable in real clinical situations, we transformed the predictive coefficients of the COEWS model into individual scores for each selected feature. The global score serves as an easy-to-calculate measure indicating the risk of a patient developing the combined outcome of mechanical ventilation or death within the next 48 hr. The discrimination in the external validation cohort was 0.743 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.703-0.784) (95% CI: 0.654-0.745) for the COEWS performed with scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Additionally, we observed that the AUROC of the NEWS2 was 0.677 in unvaccinated patients. Conclusions: The COEWS score predicts death or MV within the next 48 hr based on routine and widely available laboratory measurements. The extensive external validation, its high performance, its ease of use, and its positive benchmark in comparison with the widely used NEWS2 position COEWS as a new reference tool for assisting clinical decisions and improving patient care in the upcoming pandemic waves.

Therefore, in this mixed methods study we explored perceived pandemic-related practice changes to cervical cancer screenings in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods: Between October 2021 and June 2022, we conducted a national web survey of clinicians (physicians and advanced practice providers) who performed cervical cancer screening in FQHCs in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a sub-set of qualitative interviews via video conference, to examine perceived changes in cervical cancer screening practices during the pandemic. Results: A total of 148 clinicians completed surveys; a subset (n=13) completed qualitative interviews. Most (86%) reported reduced cervical cancer screening early in the pandemic, and 28% reported continued reduction in services at the time of survey completion (October 2021- July 2022). Nearly half (45%) reported staff shortages impacting their ability to screen or track patients. Compared to clinicians in Obstetrics/Gynecology/Women's health, those in family medicine and other specialties more often reported reduced screening compared to pre-pandemic. Most (92%) felt that screening using HPV self-sampling would be very or somewhat helpful to address screening backlogs. Qualitative interviews highlighted the impacts of staff shortages and strategies for improvement. Conclusions: Findings highlight that in late 2021 and early 2022, many clinicians in FQHCs reported reduced cervical cancer screening and of pandemic-related staffing shortages impacting screening and follow-up. If not addressed, reduced screenings among underserved populations could worsen cervical cancer disparities in the future.
