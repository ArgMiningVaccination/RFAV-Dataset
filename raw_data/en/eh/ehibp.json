And so far, I have omitted one that seems certainly quite wide-spread: CRYSTAL HEALING. What the Dickens is crystal healing, you ask? It is the attempt to bring about healing with the power of crystals, of course. And how is it supposed to work? This is where things get quite nebulous; this [website](http://www.holisticshop.co.uk/articles/introduction-guide-crystals), for instance tells us that the repeating chemical structure of crystals is said to invest them with a kind of memory. This means that crystals have the power to hold energies. You may hold a quartz crystal with the intention of filling it with your love. This is what is meant by programming a crystal. You do not need any wires or a special connection with God - all you need is intention and focus. The crystal will remember your love, which will then permeate any environment in which the crystal is placed. Crystals can remember negative as well as positive energies and so will sometimes need to be cleansed. For instance, an amethyst will actually help to cleanse a room of negative energies (eg. anger) but this means that the amethyst, which will retain an element of that negative energy, will itself occasionally require cleansing. Most crystal healers make fairly specific claims about the healing power of specific crystals. This [website](http://www.beliefnet.com/wellness/9-powerful-healing-stones-and-what-they-can-do-for-you.aspx?p=3) explains it in some detail. The following text is an extract of several key (only marginally altered) passages from much longer instructions about the use of different crystals for healing purposes: Crystal healing specialists generally agree that garnet promotes rapid general healing and regeneration in users. Garnet also has a positive effect on disorders such as acid reflux, blood-related illnesses, and physical strength. Rose quartz is considered, by practitioners of alternative medicine, to be the stone of love\u2014in this case, love of the self, in the form of self-esteem and self-worth. Rose quartz is simply brimming with happiness, and is a very positive stone that can help bring out forgiveness, compassion, and tolerance in users. Fluorite is of mental order and clarity, and can be used to help alleviate instability, paving the way for a more balanced view of life. Feeling tossed about on a sea of restless emotions? Try carrying fluorite with you throughout the day\u2014it helps cleanse and detoxify the centers of emotion. Fluorite is also the stone of learning, and can improve concentration and focus, while simultaneously reducing the anxiety that can sometimes make retaining information difficult. If you're a student, learning a new instrument, or facing a complex new job, fluorite may be the stone you'll want to keep on your person. Lapis lazuli is beneficial to the throat, vocal cords, and larynx, and can help to regulate endocrine and thyroid issues. This is one of the most effective stones to meditate with, as lapis lazuli is the stone of higher awareness, able to bring information to the mind in images rather than words. This is an especially great boon to those who have creative jobs, as their next big inspiration can come from this. If you suffer from anxiety, hematite is for you. A heavy, calming stone, hematite is very grounding\u2014it leaves the user feeling comfortable and \"in the moment,\" rather than being lost in memory or worry. This disconnection from the present\u2014which many of us suffer from\u2014is the cause of much discomfort. But by practicing mindfulness through meditation with hematite, you can reconnect with what's currently going on in your life. Alternative medicine practitioners consider jade to be the stone of the heart, and as such, affects this organ in a positive way, promoting heart health. Not only does jade promote physical heart health, but heals emotionally, as well. Focusing energies on the emotional heart, jade helps regulate what we embrace and what we resist, giving us better self-control, as well as a better picture of our own wants and needs. Turquoise is powerful, giving peace to the spirit and well-being to the body. This stone induces a sense of serenity, keeping physically harmful stress and inflammation at bay. Holding turquoise can bring back focus and restore vitality. Turquoise is also a stabilizer, and can calm the nerves when working on a difficult problem, or when performing or speaking in public. It is known for its effectiveness in alleviating the fear of flying. Obsidian is a protective stone, able to remove and guard against negativity. If you are trying to release issues from your past, including emotions such as anger, resentment, and fear, handling obsidian can help by allowing you to see them for what they are so that they can be dealt with. Physically, obsidian is said to benefit good health in muscle tissue and the digestive system, and can help rid the body of infection. It helps to reduce the pain of arthritis, joint problems, and cramps. Citrine holds the power of granting energy and stamina and supporting proper metabolism. Especially beneficial for those suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, this stone can bring back some much-needed vitality, and can even alleviate nausea and vomiting for those suffering from morning sickness. This gem also aids in keeping the nails, skin, and hair healthy, and is effective in relieving skin irritation of any kind. Emotionally, citrine is the gem of joy, helping the subconscious mind to accept happiness in life, releasing anger and negativity. This is the most effective gem for those suffering from depression\u2014combined with the skills of a trained counselor, meditation with citrine can help channel happiness through you, imbuing you with real joy. Whether you believe in the healing power of crystals or not, they are worth trying alongside your normal health regimen. At best, you'll find a spiritual support for your physical and mental health goals. And at worst? You'll be in possession of a few beautiful stones that make great meditative focal points. So do a little research and go try out a few of your favorite stones! END OF QUOTES Recently, [I promised to be more respectful](http://edzardernst.com/2017/01/my-new-years-resolution-for-2017-more-respect-please/) in my criticism of quackery, but when it comes to things like crystal healing this is a difficult task indeed. It goes almost without saying that there is not a jot of evidence for any of the therapeutic claims made in the above quotes or other promotional texts on crystal healing. Who publishes this sort of nonsense? The above excerpts come from ' [BELIEFNET](http://www.beliefnet.com/)', the \"leading lifestyle site dedicated to faith and inspiration.
