The American Chiropractic Association encourages the use of chiropractic specific guidelines in conjunction with the [Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain: A Clinical Practice Guideline](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-2367) from the American College of Physicians and therefore also adopts, but is not limited to, the [clinical practice guideline from the Clinical Compass](https://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(23)00016-7/fulltext) (formerly known as the Council on Chiropractic Guidelines and Practice Parameters), to provide specific guidance in the management or co-management of a patient within a chiropractic office. Ratified by the ACA House of Delegates: 2017 The American Chiropractic Association urges organizations that have developed practice parameters to recognize that practice parameters are educational tools, not mechanisms to determine reimbursement or credentialing, to assist physicians in clinical decision making and are not replacements for clinical decision making. Physicians must retain autonomy to vary from practice parameters without retribution in order to provide the quality of care that meets the individual needs of their patients; and encourages doctors of chiropractic to be cost conscious and to exercise discretion, consistent with good chiropractic care, when implementing practice parameters. Chiropractic Scope of Practice Doctors of Chiropractic are educated by accredited institutions to serve as primary care physicians. As such, ACA asserts the ability of all duly licensed doctors of chiropractic to practice to the full extent of their education. Chiropractic scope of practice should comprehensively reflect contemporary chiropractic education, and be further informed by an evolving evidence base, commonly accepted professional standards of practice, and societal needs. ACA also asserts that doctors of chiropractic should be fully integrated within healthcare systems, and compensated on par with other physicians performing the same or similar services.
