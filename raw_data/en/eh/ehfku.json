No. If the patient has an Ontario health card number, then the pharmacist needs the patient's Ontario health card number in order to submit the claim for payment through the HNS. 12.What forms of identification and other information are required for patients who do not have an Ontario health card number? If a pharmacy has been granted access to the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON, then the COVID-19 Vaccine Agreement requires documentation of alternate forms of identification to confirm date of birth if the patient does not have an Ontario health card number. Pharmacy staff must document the alternate form of ID on the vaccine record. Other forms of patient identification noted in that system may include: Birth Certificate Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 6 Employee ID First Nations ID Passport MRN (Medical Record Number) Out of Province ID Driver's Licence 13. What if a patient received their first dose (or more than one dose) of a vaccine outside of Ontario or Canada? Are they considered fully vaccinated and up to date? Fully vaccinated: The ' fully vaccinated' definition may continue to be used in some settings. In Ontario, an individual is considered fully vaccinated if they have received: The full series of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized by Health Canada, or any combination of such vaccines, One or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine not authorized by Health Canada, followed by one dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine authorized by Health Canada, or Three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine not authorized by Health Canada; and They received their final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days ago. Staying Up to Date: Staying 'up to date' means a person has completed their primary series and has received a COVID-19 vaccine within the last six months. Doses outside of Canada: Individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine outside of Ontario or Canada are required to provide proof, such as a vaccination receipt or certificate, to their public health unit in order to be registered in the system. Once that process is complete, if an additional dose is required, these individuals will be able to book their subsequent dose appointment through the provincial booking system, public health units that use their own booking system or participating pharmacies and primary care settings at an interval that aligns with Ontario's vaccine strategy. Individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine outside of Ontario or Canada who contact their local Public Health Unit will have their COVID-19 vaccine history verified and uploaded into the COVAX system. Depending on how many doses and which vaccines were Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 7 previously administered (please refer to the COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance located on the ministry's website), pharmacies may administer an additional dose of an mRNA monovalent vaccine or a bivalent mRNA vaccine if applicable, if required to complete the vaccine series or as a booster. Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". Ministry Payment 14.How much does the ministry pay pharmacy immunizers to administer the COVID-19 vaccine?

In addition to injection training for pharmacy vaccinators as outlined by the Ontario College of Pharmacists, pharmacy staff must also go through general training to use the Provincial COVID- 19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON database that holds all the COVID -19 vaccination information. Resource information regarding the Provincial COVID- 19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON including support, training, forms and reference materials for pharmacies are available. Pharmacies should contact their head office or the Ontario Pharmacists Association for t hese resources . Do not contact the COVAX ON support channel directly. 20.Are there on-boarding resources available for pharmacies? Yes. Pharmacies will be provided with an on- boarding resource package that outlines the ov erall process and descriptions of user profiles for the Provincial COVID -19 Vaccine Solution -COVAX ON. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 10 Pharmacy Participation 21.Will all Ontario pharmacies provide the publicly funded COVID -19 vaccine? No. Only participating pharmacies that have been selected by the ministry and who meet t he criteria in the most recent version of the EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID -19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility \", are eligible to provide the publicly funded COVID -19 vaccine. Pharmacy criteria include but are not limited to: Have a valid HNS Subscription Agreement with the ministry Have a valid COVID -19 Vaccine Agreement Currently enrolled and in good standing in the current Universal Influenza Immu nization Program (UIIP)* *Due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and to increase access to vaccination services to as many eligible individuals as possible, as of January 13, 2022, the ministry opened enrollment in the COVID -19 vaccination program to pharmacies that are not enrolled in the current UIIP on an exceptional and temporary basis . Pharmacies that are interested in administering publicly funded COVID -19 vaccines but not currently enrolled in the current UIIP should email the ministry at: OPDPInfoBox@ontario.ca with their store nam e, address and ON Provider #. In addition to having a valid HNS Subscription Agreement and a valid COVID- 19 Vaccine Agreement, such pharmacies will be required to pass an inspection by their local public health unit (PHU), including a cold chain inspection, and comply with all storage and handling guidelines for vaccines. Please note that Note: A valid COVID- 19 Vaccine agreement is in respect of a particular pharmacy operator oper ating at a specific pharmacy location. Where a pharmacy is sold, or where a pharmacy operator relocates, a new COVID -19 Vaccine Agreement is required to reflect the new pharmacy operator or location. Similarly, enrollment in the UIIP is in respect of a particular pharmacy operator operating at a specific pharmacy location. Where a pharmacy is sold, or where a pharmacy operator relocates, new enrollment in the UIIP is required to reflect the new pharmacy operator or location. Other considerations inc lude: pharmacy should have the capacity and ability to accept and administer v accine supply quickly and effectively other factors such as high risk areas, regional population distribution, pharmacy pat ient base and performance in the UIIP. Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice.

What is the Provincial COVID -19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON? The Provincial COVID -19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON is the database that holds all COVID - 19 vaccine administration for the province. It is separate from the HNS and all pharmacies are required to enter patient vaccine administration information as well as inventory supply in this system. The fee paid to pharmacies for administering the COVID -19 vaccine includes pharmacy services relating to accessing and using the Provincial COVID- 19 Vaccine Solution -COVAX ON. The requirements for accessing and using the Provincial COVID- 19 Vaccine Solution- CO VAX ON can be found in the COVID -19 Vaccine Agreement. Access to and use of the Solution is conditional on the pharmacy being granted access to the Provincial COVID- 19 Vaccine Solution -COVAX ON by the ministry. It is important that pharmacies correctly document vaccine administration and i nventory management in the Provincial COVID -19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON. While vaccine administration to the patient should occur PRIOR to completing the entry in COVAX ON, pharmacy staff must be diligent in accessing COVAX ON to confirm when the patient received their first dose (if applicable) including verifying which vaccine and the appropriate time interval between doses before administering the vaccine. Incorrect entries in COVAX ON must be corrected immediately. Please refer to the Job Aids in the resource information provided. regarding the Provincial CO VID-19 Vaccine Solution- COVAX ON including support , training, forms and reference materials for pharmacies are available. Pharmacies should contact their head office or th e Ontario Pharmacists Association for these resources . Note: When entering information in the Provincial COVID -19 Vaccine Solution -COVAX ON, immunizers must identify their individual health professional status (i.e., they must use their own User ID). Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 12 23.What happens if there is a system failure and the pharmacy is not able to enter vaccine or inventory information in the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON? In the event of system failure, pharmacies must ensure a manual contingency plan is in place for keeping track of COVID-19 vaccine administration and future logging in the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON. For example, at a minimum, pharmacies should ensure there is supply of consent forms, vaccine information forms and daily patient rosters printed in the event the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON system is not available. 24.What type of personal protective equipment (PPE) do pharmacists need in order to administer the COVID-19 vaccine? Resources and guidance for PPE can be found on the Ontario College of Pharmacists website. 25.Is PPE available for pharmacies that administer the COVID-19 vaccines? Yes. The ministry has a dedicated supply of PPE that is available through the provincial stockpile for participating pharmacies that administer the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine. Note that there is an allocation framework in place depending on the current supply and not all orders for PPE may be filled. The ministry's supply of PPE must ONLY be used to support the activity of pharmacies administering the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine. 26.How do I access the ministry supply of PPE to support the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine? Pharmacies may order PPE by accessing the Remedy online intake2 form at this link: https://ehealthontario.on.ca/en/health-care-professionals/ppe-intake?a=ppe-intake 2 Note, the access for PPE is the same as for accessing for the UIIP program. Pharmacies may use the same form / process. Pharmacies that belong to a banner or chain corporation should work through their corporate head office, who may centrally coordinate order and facilitate distribution. Independent pharmacies may order directly from the website. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 13 27.What other procedures must be followed during the COVID -19 pandemic? Pharmacy professionals should continue to follow the guidelines set out by public health of ficials. Pharmacies have a shared responsibility for informing and educating the public on COVID- 19, including promoting infection prevention and control measures. Resources can be found on the Ontario College of Pharmacists website as well as Ministry Guidance at this website. Please also refer to Vaccine and Storage Handling section at the end of the Qs & As. 28.Is it mandatory to schedule the patient's appointment for the second or subsequ ent dose? NACI continues to preferentially recommend that a complete primary series of a mRNA CO VID-19 vaccine (Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna) should be offered to individuals in the authorized age groups without contraindications to the vaccine. Pharmacy staff should schedule the appointment dates and times for the second or s ubsequent doses as applicable. The appointment date and time can be hand -written on the printed receipt -of-vaccine that is provided to the patient as per documentation requirements (Note: a written receipt can be printed from COVAX ON). Patients are strongly urged to return to the same pharmacy for the second or subsequent dos es. Pharmacy staff must provide patients with information on the arrangements for the second or other subsequent dose scheduling (if applicable) including how the patient may reach the pharmacy should there be a need for rescheduling as well as potential situations that may requi re the pharmacy to re- schedule for reasons such as issues with vaccine supply. In the event that a patient requests a dose at your pharmacy - without having had their first or primary series dose s at your pharmacy - pharmacies are permitted to administer the vaccine dose. Patients should be reminded to cancel any appointments they may have booked at other pharmacy or mass clinic locations. 29.What is the procedure if the patient does not show up for the scheduled dose or there are doses left at the end of the day? Pharmacists may use their professional judgement in the event that a patient does not s how up for their vaccine appointment. For example: They may contact the patient to make inquiries on their timing, situation; They may re- schedule the patient or move them in the queue as appropriate; Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 14 They may reallocate the dose to another eligible or soon-to-be eligible patient with a future scheduled appointment or a patient on their waiting list if no other patient is available and document the rationale. Pharmacists should ensure to the best of their ability that no vaccine is wasted. All sites administering the COVID-19 vaccine, including pharmacies, are expected to follow the eligibility criteria determined by the province in alignment with the framework.

As for any HNS claim, pharmacies must keep a record of the required documentation. All pharmacy documentation records relating to the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine claim (and epinephrine auto-injector, if applicable) are part of the patient's medication record and must be maintained in a readily retrievable format for the appropriate record retention period of at least 10 years from the last recorded professional pharmacy service provided to the patient, or until 10 years after the day on which the patient reached, or would have reached, the age of 18 years, whichever is longer. Such records must also be maintained for the same period of time for the purposes of post-payment verification. In addition, pharmacists are expected to review and adhere to the Ontario College of Pharmacists Record Retention, Disclosure and Disposal Guidelines. 32.What will happen if I forget to document or misplace the documentation? If there is no documentation, incorrect or incomplete documentation, the administration fee that is claimed may be subject to recovery by the ministry. Documentation is also important in the event of an adverse reaction following an immunization or if a patient follows up with the pharmacy for their COVID-19 vaccine record. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 16 33.What documentation must pharmacists provide to the patient after administration of the COVID-19 vaccine? To help patients keep track of their COVID-19 vaccine, pharmacists must provide a written record (i.e., paper based) of the COVID-19 immunization product administered, including the date and name of the pharmacy. A pharmacy may wish to also provide an electronic record containing this information. Pharmacy staff should also schedule with the patient the day and time for the subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses as applicable at the same pharmacy. They must also give the patient instructions on how they can reach the pharmacy in the event they need to reschedule as well as let the patient know how they will reach them should there be a need to reschedule due to issues such as vaccine supply. Patients should keep the vaccine record in a safe place, and it must also be readily available on file at the pharmacy. Pharmacies must inform and provide written documentation to patients of after-care instructions, any potential adverse effects they may experience following the vaccination and when to contact their health care provider. For more information on forms and resource materials pharmacies should contact their head office or the Ontario Pharmacists Association. Resources can also be found on the Ontario College of Pharmacists website as well as Ministry Guidance at this website. 34.What documentation does the ministry require for an epinephrine auto-injector claims submission?

In addition, it is mandatory for pharmacies to document the adverse event due to the vaccine administration in the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON. 5 For complete reporting requirements, please refer to the pharmacy's COVID -19 Vaccine Agreement for adverse events. For additional information, please contact your local public health unit. Refer to the ministry website for a list of Ontario pub lic health units . For additional information, please contact your local public health unit. Refer to the ministry website for a list of Ontario public health units . 39.If a patient has an adverse reaction to the COVID -19 vaccine, who is r esponsible for administering the epinephrine auto- injector? Should the adverse reaction occur after the administration of the COVID -19 vaccine, the p harmacist (or the other health care provider ) who administered the COVID -19 vaccine must administer the epinephrine auto- injector. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 20 Under the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, the administration of a substance by injection is a controlled act which unauthorized persons are prohibited from performing. Where the administration of a substance by injection is done for the purposes of rendering first aid or temporary assistance in an emergency, individuals are exempted from the prohibition of performing this activity. However, it is advisable to speak with the Ontario College of Pharmacists if you have any additional questions about your responsibilities and/or accountabilities in this regard. For claims submission purposes, the ministry requires the patient's Ontario health number (or proxy patient ID) and pharmacist identification for the use of an epinephrine auto-injector after an adverse reaction to the administered COVID-19 vaccine. 40.Can an individual get Nuvaxovid or a viral vector vaccine (Janssen) vaccine if they are allergic to the mRNA vaccines? At this time the Province has a limited supply of Nuvaxovid and viral vector vaccines (for example, the Janssen vaccine). Pharmacies should work with their public health unit to determine how eligible individuals can receive one of these vaccines, if required. Note: The Medicago (Cofivenz\u00ae) vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccines are currently not available in Ontario. Pharmacists should direct individuals with known or suspected allergies to components of the mRNA vaccines or AEFI with a COVID-19 vaccine to their primary care provider or local public health unit (PHU) for a referral to an appropriate physician / nurse practitioner (or a relevant specialist related to the AEFI that occurred). The appropriate physician / nurse practitioner will complete an assessment and Allergy Form to develop a vaccination care plan with the individual which will determine the method for possible (re)administration of a COVID-19 vaccine, such as Nuvaxovid. A viral vector vaccine (Janssen vaccine) should only be offered when all other authorized COVID-19 vaccines are contraindicated and with informed consent. The assessment will also determine whether vaccine administration can be safely provided in a general PHU vaccine clinic, pharmacy, or primary care office. People who experienced a severe immediate allergic reaction after a first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may safely receive future doses of the same or another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after consulting with an appropriate physician / nurse practitioner. See NACI's recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines for more information. The Allergy Form and patient vaccine administration care plan completed by an appropriate physician / nurse practitioner must be provided to the identified vaccine clinic for inclusion in the individual's medical record. The vaccination care plan must also include the parameters a clinic should meet to provide the safe administration of vaccine, including: availability of advanced medical care; details/severity of the previous allergic episode(s); confirmation Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 21 that appropriate counselling on the safe administration of vaccine was provided; date, clinician's name, signature and contact information; and the individual's name and date of birth. A copy of the Allergy Form and patient vaccine care plan must be maintained by the administering clinic. PHUs may coordinate with participating pharmacies and/or primary care offices to assist in vaccine administration, including transferring Nuvaxovid (or a viral vector vaccine if applicable) to the site, as required. Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\" for further information, including dosing intervals for second doses as well as third / booster doses. Restrictions 41.Can pharmacy immunizers submit claims for providing the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine to residents of long-term care homes or hospital in-patients? With respect to hospitals, the answer is no. Pharmacy staff administration of the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine to hospital in-patients is not eligible for payment under this initiative. With respect to long-term care home residents, pharmacies can submit claims for providing the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine to residents of long-term care homes at the location of the long-term care home or other congregate setting in collaboration with the public health unit, if certain conditions are met. See Questions #64-70 for more information. In addition, staff, support workers, essential caregivers, volunteers and contractors who are working within congregate settings are eligible for COVID-19 vaccine doses when pharmacy staff visit the home / congregate setting to administer the vaccine to residents, provided that they meet all eligibility requirements noted in the most recent Executive Officer Notice - Administration of COVID-19 vaccine in Ontario Pharmacies. 42.Can pharmacists submit claims for COVID-19 vaccine administration manually to the ministry, using a paper claim? No. The ministry does not accept paper claims for the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine unless 3 intervention codes are required in order to process the claim. All claims must be submitted electronically using the HNS. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 22 43.Can pharmacists submit a claim for the epinephrine auto-injector when it is provided to the patient to take home after the COVID-19 vaccine was administered? No. Claims submitted for epinephrine auto-injector that are associated with the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine emergency use are only reimbursed when the injection is given by the pharmacist (or other regulated health care provider) as emergency first aid or temporary assistance as needed right after administering the COVID-19 vaccine to a patient. 44.Can pharmacists submit a claim for epinephrine auto-injector for a patient without a valid Ontario health card number? Yes. Pharmacists may submit claims for payment using the ministry's HNS for epinephrine auto-injectors administered to individuals without a valid Ontario health card number for emergency use after administering the COVID-19 vaccine by using the proxy patient ID. 45.If the pharmacist recommends to a physician that a patient should get their COVID-19 vaccine, is the recommendation billable under the Pharmaceutical Opinion Program? No. All eligible individuals are encouraged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, because its administration is within the pharmacist's scope of practice (when administered in accordance with this initiative) and requires no permission from a primary care provider, such a recommendation does not meet the criteria of the Pharmaceutical Opinion Program. 46.Do I have to administer the COVID-19 vaccine within the walls of the pharmacy? Participating pharmacies must administer publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine within the pharmacy premises, unless otherwise permitted as follows: in a nearby location (e.g., pharmacy parking lot) as long as they adhere to public safety and relevant Ministry policy / direction (including infection prevention and control measures), the COVID-19 Vaccine Agreement, and any Ontario College of Pharmacist (OCP) standards, polices or guidelines. for home-bound patients in their private home. Refer to Question #47 as a mobile clinic in other locations (e.g., community centres, apartment complexes, etc.). Refer to Question #48. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 23 in retirement homes, congregate settings and long-term care homes under the direction of Public Health Units. Refer to questions # 64-70. Reference information: Ontario College of Pharmacists guidelines including appropriate infection control measures to ensure patients remain safe. Ontario Pharmacists' Association Playbook and FAQs as a reference for much of the overall operational aspects of providing COVID-19 vaccines to your patients. Ministry Guidance documents provided to clinicians available here. 47. Am I allowed to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to a patient in their private home for example if they are not physically mobile? There is an expectation that pharmacies are administering the COVID-19 vaccine within the pharmacy premise where vaccine storage requirements can be maintained. However, an exception may be allowed for the pharmacist to visit the patient's private home (i.e., one-on-one; not a congregate setting) to administer the COVID-19 vaccine provided the patient has requested a home visit by the pharmacist and provides a reason such as due to the patient being immobile, and this request and rationale is documented by the pharmacy in writing. In exceptional circumstances, a single dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines may be transported in a syringe whilst adhering to the storage and handling guidelines regarding transport of vaccines. In addition, trained community pharmacy staff may administer COVID-19 vaccine doses in long-term care homes, retirement homes and other congregate settings under the direction of Public Health Units. See Questions #64-70 below for more information. As per Question #48, pharmacies are also allowed to administer as mobile clinics. The pharmacy must also ensure public safety, vaccine handling and storage requirements (e.g. specific references to transferring vaccines and vaccine specific references at this link) as well as adhere to relevant Ministry policy / direction, the COVID-19 Vaccine Agreement, and any Ontario College of Pharmacist (OCP) standards, polices or guidelines. In addition, the pharmacist documentation must include the geographical location of the vaccine administration if not conducted within the pharmacy. This documentation must be retained in a readily retrievable location for a period of at least 10 years from the last recorded pharmacy service provided to the patient, or 10 years after the day on which the patient reached or would have reached the age of 18 years, whichever is longer. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 24 48. How can my pharmacy participate in delivery of COVID-19 vaccines via mobile clinics? What are the requirements / parameters? As a response to the Omicron variant, as of December 20, 2021, pharmacies may conduct off-site mobile clinics in collaboration with their local Public Health Unit. All patient eligibility requirements in the most recent version of the Executive Officer Notice - Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine in ON Pharmacies apply to the mobile clinic. Participating pharmacies must notify the ministry in advance if they plan to operate a mobile clinic. Emails are sent to OPDPInfoBox@ontario.ca. Pharmacy emails must include the pharmacy ON#, pharmacy name and address of the pharmacy responsible for the mobile clinic. In addition, pharmacies must provide the proposed date and location of the mobile clinic. In addition, the following conditions apply: Participating pharmacies must contact their local PHU to notify them of future mobile clinics that they intend to operate. It is recommended that mobile clinics be within the geographic region of the local PHU. The mobile clinic must be aligned with Ontario's vaccine distribution plan in cooperation with local PHU planning and may be informed by outreach and engagement possibly coordinated with community partners. Trained pharmacy staff from the participating pharmacy must administer COVID-19 vaccine from their own supply and transport doses to the mobile clinic as per storage and handling guidelines Pharmacy staff from the participating pharmacy would need to ensure infection prevention and control measures are followed and other guidelines/policies if applicable. Pharmacy staff from the participating pharmacy must access COVAX ON on site at the mobile clinic location for required documentation of vaccine administration and issuing of patient receipts Upon return to the location of the participating pharmacy, the pharmacist from the participating pharmacy must submit claims through the HNS for reimbursement as soon as possible and within 7 calendar days 6. Participating pharmacies are responsible for all aspects of running the mobile clinic including staffing, supplies, communication, signage and other logistics. 6 Note that the HNS can process online transactions for publicly funded services on any of the most recent seven calendar days, including the current date. This means that a claim for the COVID-19 vaccine could be submitted today for a service date in the past (as long as it is within the past 7 days). Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 25 Participating pharmacies must comply with applicable law, including with respect to waste management with consideration for any added insurance requirements respecting operations off-site. Following the pharmacy mobile clinic, pharmacies must complete within 7 calendar days, the Pharmacy Mobile Clinic Form at this link: https://forms.office.com/r/iNc4bXFcL8 The participating pharmacy must also ensure public safety, vaccine handling and storage requirements (e.g. specific references to transferring vaccines and vaccine specific references at this link) as well as adhere to relevant Ministry policy / direction, the COVID- 19 Vaccine Agreement (including insurance and indemnity requirements), and any Ontario College of Pharmacist (OCP) standards, polices or guidelines. In addition, the pharmacist documentation must include the geographical location of the vaccine administration at the mobile clinic. This documentation must be retained in a readily retrievable location for a period of at least 10 years from the last recorded pharmacy service provided to the patient, or 10 years after the day on which the patient reached or would have reached the age of 18 years, whichever is longer. Individual pharmacists, interns, pharmacy students and pharmacy technicians with injection training may also participate in administering COVID-19 vaccine in an alternate clinic setting organized and hosted by another authorized organization (e.g., PHU or hospital-led mass immunization clinic). In these instances, as it falls outside the parameters of the Executive Officer Notices and Qs and As, they should refer to the applicable legislation, other agreements, or OCP policy as appropriate. 49.Can the COVID-19 vaccines be mixed / switched - one vaccine used for the first dose and the other for the second dose? For primary COVID-19 vaccine series: The National Advisory Committee on Immunization ( NACI) guidelines has recommended interchangeability of vaccines (or vaccine mixing) which means a patient could receive one vaccine product for the first dose and a different vaccine product for the second dose to complete the two-dose vaccine series. Persons who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine should receive an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech (12+ formulation) or Moderna) for their second dose, unless contraindicated. According to NACI, an mRNA vaccine is now preferred as the Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 26 second dose for individuals who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine, based on emerging evidence of a potentially better immune response from this mixed vaccine schedule and to mitigate the potential risk of VITT associated with viral vector vaccines. In addition, the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine is currently not available in Ontario. The Nuvaxovid COVID- 19 vaccine may be offered to individuals in the authorized age group without contraindications to the vaccine who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine to complete the primary series. Persons who received a first dose of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer -B ioNTech or Moderna) should be offered the same mRNA vaccine for their second dose. If the same mRNA vaccine is not readily available* or unknown, another mRNA vaccine can be considered interchangeable and should be offered to complete the vaccine series. This is consistent with recommendations provided by the NACI and the practices of many jurisdictions. Pr ovision of a second dose of vaccine should not be significantly delayed in order to complete a vaccine series using the same mRNA product, unless clinically indicated. *Note , readily available means easily available at the time of vaccination without delay or vaccin e wastage7 7 Q&A for Health Care Providers on Mixed COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Schedules Based on advice from the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee (OIAC), and in alignment with NACI , the Ministry of Health has issued a preferential recommendation for the use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine for individuals 5- 29 years of age if receiving a primary series dose, or 5 - 17 years of age if receiving a booster dose. This recommendation stems from an observed increase in the number of reports in Ontario of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Moderna relative to Pfizer -BioNTech in children, adolescents and young adults, particularly among males. Although risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with the Moderna (50 mcg) vaccine in children 6 to 11 years of age is unknown, with a primary series in adolescents and young adults the rare risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with Moderna (100 mcg) was higher than with Pfizer -BioNTech (30 mcg). See COVID- 19 Vaccine Guidance for more details on administering to special populat ions. Note: Informed consent is required for those age 5 to 29 who wish to receive the Moderna vacci ne, as it is whenever administering a vaccine. Infants and children are recommended to be administered the same vaccine product for all doses in a primary series, using the dose that is correct for their age at the time of Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 27 appointment. This is particularly important for children aged 6 months to under 5 years of age who are eligible to receive the Moderna 25 mcg or Pfizer 3 mcg vaccine, due to the difference in the number of doses in the primary series between the two products. There is no preferred product for individuals 6 months to 4 years of age. Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\" for further information about eligibility criteria for second doses, including vaccine mixing. 50.Question intentionally deleted as of November 3rd, 2021 update. 51.Question intentionally deleted as of September 12, 2022 update. 52.Question intentionally deleted as of November 3rd, 2021 update. 53. Why has the province paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for first dose administration? As of May 11, 2021, following the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams, the province has paused the rollout and administration of first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. This decision was made out of an abundance of caution due an observed increase of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. As of May 12, 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has estimated the rate of VITT in Canada to be 1 in 83,000 doses administered (of the first dose of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine). However, as investigations continue, the rate could be as high as 1 in 55,000. The rate of VITT in the UK, after the second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, is estimated to be approximately 1 in 600,000 (17 cases out of 10.7 million second doses administered). It should be noted that with increased observation times, VITT rates have generally increased .8 8 NACI rapid response: Interchangeability of authorized COVID-19 vaccines The AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine is currently not available in Ontario. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 28 54. Are pharmacies able to order and administer Nuvaxovid (Novavax Inc.) or viral vector vaccines (Janssen)? Pharmacies will not be ordering Nuvaxovid or the viral vector, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine from their distribution centres at this time due to the limited quantities available in the province. Should patients approach pharmacies for Nuvaxovid or a viral vector vaccine, pharmacies should work in collaboration with their local Public Health Unit (PHU) on a case-by-case basis to determine eligibility when an mRNA vaccine is declined or for allergy situations (refer to Q#40). Nuvaxovid and viral vector vaccines will primarily be available through PHUs. In very limited situations, a PHU may engage a pharmacy to assist with administration. See also Q# 61 for other vaccine available only through PHUs at this time. 55.What is the recommended scheduling for second doses of mRNA vaccines in Ontario for individuals who received an mRNA vaccine for their first dose? The recommended dosing interval is 8 weeks for mRNA vaccines. For more information please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". 56.What is the recommended scheduling for second doses of the Nuvaxovid vaccine in Ontario for individuals who received Nuvaxovid vaccine for their first dose? The recommended dosing interval is 8 weeks for the Nuvaxovid vaccine. For more information please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". 57. Question intentionally deleted as of October 17th, 2022 update. 58. Question intentionally deleted as of October 17th, 2022 update. 59.What is the dose regimen of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine? The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine generally requires a single dose. However, individuals who received the single dose Janssen vaccine are eligible for a supplementary or booster dose in accordance with the EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 29 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility. For more information, please refer to the ministry website for the most recent of that EO Notice. 60.Which of the Pfizer vaccines (adult strength or pediatric strength) is recommended for children who are 11 years of age and turning 12 by the time they are eligible for their second dose or booster dose? Children should receive the formulation that is recommended for their age at the time of administration. For example, children who receive the Pediatric Pfizer vaccine for their first dose and who have turned 12 by the time the second dose is due may receive for their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine (12+ formulation) that is authorized for individuals aged 12 years and over to complete their primary series. Note: At this time, only the Pediatric Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, orange cap (10mcg) is authorized as a booster dose for children aged 5 - 11 years. 61.How do pharmacies obtain the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (0.10mg/mL) and Infant Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (3mcg) for infants/children? Pharmacies are able to access the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (0.10mg/mL) and the Infant Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (3mcg) from their Distribution Centre. 62.Can the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (0.10mg/mL) be used for older children (i.e., 6 to 11 years) or as a booster for those 18+? Although the lower concentration (0.10mg/mL) format of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can be used to administer a 50mcg dose for children aged 6 to 11 years or to those 18+ as a booster, due to limited vaccine supply, this format is reserved for completing a primary series for infants/children aged 6 months to 5 years at this time. 63.What is the recommendation for children who are 5 years old? Which COVID- 19 vaccine should they receive? Based on NACI recommendations, use of pediatric Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (10 mcg) is preferred to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg). The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg) may be given to children 5 years of age as an alternative with informed consent and discussion of risks and benefits with the health care provider. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 30 Children who have received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg) for a previous dose and turn 6 prior to completing their primary series are recommended to receive Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (50 mcg) to complete their primary series. If the primary series was completed with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg) or with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (10 mcg), the dose should be considered valid and the series complete. Note: At this time, only the Pediatric Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, orange cap (10mcg) is authorized as a booster dose for children aged 5 - 11 years. 64.When is a third or booster dose recommended after being infected with COVID-19? Individuals 5 years of age and older who are eligible to receive a booster dose and who are infected with COVID-19 after their primary series (but before their booster dose), are recommended to receive their booster dose 3 months after symptom onset or positive test (if asymptomatic) but 6 months may provide better immune response, provided that they meet the applicable dosing interval after completing their primary vaccine series. As per NACI, emerging evidence indicates that a longer interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is associated with improved antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines. With informed consent, individuals may receive a booster dose once they are no longer infectious (asymptomatic and have completed their isolation) and are otherwise eligible for the booster dose. Pharmacies should be informed and stay current with the vaccine's official indications in accordance with Health Canada's approved product monograph, including information regarding the recommended dosing. Ontario is funding third doses or booster doses, based on recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, OIAC and NACI. Note: the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine series involves a single dose. However, individuals who received the single dose Janssen vaccine are eligible for a supplementary or booster dose in accordance with the EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility. References in the remainder of this document to individuals who have already received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine shall be interpreted to include individuals who received the single dose Janssen vaccine. In addition, for immunocompromised individuals who received the single dose Janssen vaccine, references in the remainder of this document to a third dose shall be interpreted to mean a second dose. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 31 65.What is the difference between a third dose and a booster dose? Historically in other vaccine programs, it takes years of post-marketing surveillance to determine the optimal interval between doses and dose number to complete a primary series to sustain long-term protection. Per NACI's interim guidance on booster COVID-19 vaccine doses in Canada, the intent of a booster dose is to restore protection that may have decreased over time to a level that is no longer deemed sufficient in individuals who initially responded adequately to a complete primary vaccine series. This is distinguished from the intent of a third dose which might be added to the standard primary vaccine series with the aim of enhancing the immune response and establishing an adequate level of protection for individuals who developed no or sub-optimal immune response to a single or 2-dose primary series. While the term \"booster dose\" is used in this guidance, NACI continues to monitor the emerging scientific data on whether this dose is indeed a booster dose (to stimulate the memory response once protection has truly waned), or should be considered part of the primary series (to establish strong immune response and memory). NACI will adjust the terminology as required. See NACI interim guidance for more information. With respect to third doses, certain populations may demonstrate a suboptimal immune response to a single or two-dose COVID-19 vaccine series due to underlying health conditions. In these populations, a third dose of the current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is recommended for certain populations as described in the ministry guidance document, COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Recommendations. The use of third or booster doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is based on evidence and recommendations from the NACI located at this website, and OIAC. 66.Are pharmacies permitted to administer third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine? Pharmacies may administer third doses as part of a 3-dose primary series for immunocompromised groups with the vaccine product authorized for the eligible individuals age group (these recommendations also apply to children aged 6 months - 11 years of age) and may only submit claims for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine using a mRNA vaccine (i.e., Moderna in the case of Nuvaxovid, the person (age 18+) receiving the third dose in a primary series is unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine.

Active treatment is defined as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and excludes individuals receiving therapy that does not suppress the immune system (e.g., solely hormonal therapy or radiation therapy). See Ontario Health/Cancer Care Ontario's Frequently Asked Questions for more information. 10 Active treatment for patients receiving B-cell depleting therapy includes patients who have completed treatment within 12 months A copy of the referral letter from the health care provider is required as part of the documentation for administration of the third vaccine dose in the pharmacy to the immunocompromised groups above, except where a pharmacist assessed an individual's eligibility in accordance with the following note: Note: Pharmacists may verify whether a patient is eligible for a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine based on the patient's use of an immunosuppressant medication listed here by referring to a patient's recent prescription label or prescription receipt or their medication Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 33 profile. If an individual presents a prescription of a medication that is not listed here, they should be directed to their health care provider to receive a referral form/letter for a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 67.Are pharmacies permitted to administer booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. A booster dose with an mRNA vaccine is recommended for eligible individuals, to obtain stronger and longer-lasting protection regardless of which vaccine was used in the primary series. See question 74 for information on primary series. Eligibility Criteria for Monovalent (i.e. non-Bivalent) Booster Dose Administration after a primary series Individuals aged 5 to 11 years, are eligible for a booster dose, if at least 6 months (168 days) have passed since completing a primary COVID-19 vaccine series, including those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised who have completed a 3-dose primary vaccine series 11), 11 Individuals (12 years of age and older) who were receiving active treatment necessitating a three dose primary series, are eligible for a booster dose, even if not receiving active treatment currently. Note: With informed consent, individuals aged 5 to 11 years may receive their booster dose in less than 6 months (168 days) as long as 3 months have passed since completing their primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Only the Pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (orange cap) is authorized as a booster dose for individuals aged 5 to 11 years. Eligibility Criteria for Bivalent Booster Dose Administration after a primary series Individuals aged 18 years and older may receive a COVID-19 bivalent (either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) booster dose, if at least six months (168 days) *, have passed since the individual's last dose, regardless of the number of booster doses received previously. Individuals who are 12 - 17 years of age may receive a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent vaccine booster dose, if at least six months (168 days) *, have passed since the individual's last dose, regardless of the number of booster doses received previously. The bivalent Moderna (50 mcg) may be offered as a booster for individuals 12 to 17 years with moderately to severely immunocompromising conditions with informed Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 34 consent. The use of bivalent Moderna in this population is off-label and based on clinical judgement. *Note: With informed consent, individuals listed above may receive the COVID-19 bivalent (Moderna) booster dose in less than 6 months as long as 3 months have passed since they received their last dose. For more information please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". 68.Question deleted as of December 17, 2021 update. 69.Should individuals receiving a booster dose with an mRNA vaccine receive the full dose? For individuals age 12 and over who are recommended to receive a fall (2022) booster dose, NACI and the Ministry recommends that the authorized dose of a bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be offered subject to eligibility rules in the most recent Executive Officer Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". If the bivalent Omicron- containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is not readily available, an original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to ensure timely protection. The Moderna Bivalent COVID-19 vaccine 0.10mg/mL is a 50mcg dose for individuals age 18 and over. The Pfizer-BioNTech Bivalent COVID-19 vaccine is a 30 mcg dose for individuals age 12 and over. 70.What is the process for pharmacies when administering doses for residents of retirement homes, elderly living in other congregate settings or residents of LTC homes within these settings? Pharmacies are required to work with their local Public Health Unit and the retirement home, LTC home or congregate setting for administering COVID-19 vaccines to residents of these places. Pharmacies will be contacted by their local PHU or the retirement home, LTC home or congregate setting if their services are required. The list of retirement homes is available for pharmacies through their ONEMail account for verification purposes only. Note: Effective November 25, 2021 trained community pharmacy staff may administer and submit claims for COVID-19 vaccine doses to residents in LTC homes, retirement homes and other congregate settings under the direction of Public Health Units. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 35 As of December 17, 2021, trained community pharmacy staff may administer and submit claims for COVID-19 vaccine doses for staff, support workers, essential caregivers, volunteers and contractors who are working within congregate settings when the pharmacy staff visits the home / congregate setting to administer vaccines to residents. All individuals receiving the vaccine must be eligible for their dose as per the requirements noted in the most recent Executive Officer Notice - Administration of COVID -19 vaccine in Ontario P harmacies. The roles of each entity are outlined below: Public Health Unit Retirement Home, C ongregate Setting or LTC Home Pharmacy Identifies retirement hom es, congregate settings or LTC home that have residents who are eligible for a COVID- 19 vaccine dose that will be administered by a pharmacy If available, provides p harmacy with 'Clinic in a Box' (IPAD12 for accessing COVAX ON on site at the retirement home, congregate setting or LTC home) if required Works with the public heal th unit to determine best method of vaccine administration Establishes a par tnership with a local pharmacy if needed Works with the phar macy to provide guidance on the number of doses needed and support for scheduling dose administration / clinic days including which mRNA vaccine to be administered For congregate settings, determine number of elderly residents or staff (and others noted above) that require a vaccine dose Administers mRNA CO VID-19 as per arrangements between PHU and retirement home, congregate setting or LTC home Pharmacy administers CO VID-19 vaccine from own supply and transports doses to the retirement home, congregate setting or LTC home as per storage and handling guidelines Pharmacy accesses CO VAX ON on site using 'Clinic in a Box' for required documentation and issuing of patient receipts if needed Upon return to phar macy, submits claim through the HNS 12 Participating pharmacies providing COVID -19 vaccines outside the pharmacy in congregate settings or mobile clinics should be prepared to use their own IPADs or tablets to access the COVAX ON system. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 36 as soon as possible within one business day Comply with applicable law, including with respect to waste 71. Can pharmacies administer the COVID-19 vaccine at or around the same time as the flu vaccine? The COVID-19 vaccines may be given with, or at any time before or after, other vaccines, including the influenza vaccine with the exception of children aged 6 months to under 5 years of age. For children who are 6 months to under 5 years of age, it is recommended to wait for a period of at least 14 days BEFORE or AFTER the administration of another vaccine before administering a COVID-19 vaccine to prevent erroneous attribution of an AEFI to one particular vaccine or the other. However, this suggested minimum waiting period between vaccines is precautionary and therefore concomitant administration or a shortened interval between COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines may be warranted on an individual basis in some circumstances. These include: when there is a risk of the individual being unable to complete an immunization series due to the limited access to health services or being unlikely to return at a later date; when an individual may not return to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine; when another vaccine is required for post-exposure prophylaxis; when individuals require accelerated vaccination schedules prior to immunosuppressive therapy or transplant; and at the clinical discretion of the healthcare provider For those individuals age 5 years and older who are eligible for co-administration, if given by injection at the same time, separate limbs should be used if possible. Alternatively, the injections may be administered into the same muscle separated by at least 2.5 cm (1\"). Different immunization equipment (needle and syringe) must be used for each vaccine. Please see COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for more information. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 37 72.When is it recommended that an entire vaccine series be re-initiated? It is recommended that a re-vaccination with a repeat COVID-19 vaccine primary series (plus booster dose, if applicable) be initiated post-transplantation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) (autologous or allogeneic), and recipients of CAR-T-cell therapy given the loss of immunity following therapy or transplant. 13 Optimal timing for re-immunization should be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the clinical team. 13 As per the Canadian Immunization Guideline, HSCT recipients should be viewed as vaccine na\u00efve (i.e. never immunized) and require re-immunization after transplant. A re-vaccination series includes first, second, third and (if applicable) booster dose intervals based on a referral letter from a health care provider. 73.What course of action should be followed if the pharmacy has administered an incorrect dose to a patient or used the wrong vaccine according to the patient's age or experienced other errors or lapse of judgement when administering COVID-19 vaccines? Pharmacists should refer to Ministry Guidance COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance (Errors and Deviations section) on the management of inadvertent vaccine administration errors. This guidance document is intended to assist healthcare providers by providing them with suggested actions to take after an inadvertent immunization error has occurred to support consistent and optimal management of vaccine administration incidents. A vaccine administration error is a preventable event that may cause or lead to incorrect use of a vaccine and/or patient harm. Pharmacists should also be following their usual Standards of Practice when an error occurs including notifying the patient and any follow-up that is required. This response provides basic information only. This response is not intended to take the place of medical advice, diagnosis or treatment, or legal advice. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 38 74.What is the recommendation of a primary series of COVID-19 vaccine administration? For a primary series 1. NACI continues to preferentially recommend that a complete primary series of a monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) should be offered to individuals in the authorized age group without contraindications to the vaccine. 2. Novavax may be offered to individuals in the authorized age group without contraindications to the vaccine who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 3. Janssen may be offered to individuals who are 18 years and older without contraindications to the vaccine only when all other authorized COVID-19 vaccines are contraindicated. For more information, refer to the COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance. Vaccine Storage and Handling 75.What are the some of the requirements for pharmacies around vaccine storage and handling? Pharmacies must continue to follow the requirements outlined in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines (with the exception of the process for 'returning vaccine' noted on page 21 - refer to Q #76) regarding temperature log monitoring and managing cold-chain incidents. For example, pharmacies must: reach out to their public health unit about temperature logging and reporting. The frequency of temperature log monitoring / submissions will vary across public health units. notify their public health unit immediately should they experience any cold chain incidents in which the publicly funded vaccine is exposed to temperatures outside the +2 degrees C and +8 degrees C. contact their public health unit when adding new equipment (refrigerator) so that it can be inspected. This includes any wasted product as a result of an investigated temperature excursion, if applicable. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division o Pharmacist Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 39 Pharmacies should also be aware of the different storage guidelines (before/after dilution, before/after vial puncture, etc.) of each vaccine and be mindful when booking appointments to ensure there is minimal wastage. 76.How do I dispose of expired or wasted COVID-19 vaccines? For wastage and disposal of COVID-19 vaccine, pharmacies must document wastage, extra doses from vaccine vials and temperature excursions in the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON. Once wastage is documented in the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON., pharmacies must follow disposal practice protocols including: referral to the COVID-19: Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidance document on the ministry's website for information on how to dispose of expired or wasted vaccine (specifically Appendix B). Note that pharmacies are NOT to return expired or unused COVID-19 vaccines to their local public health unit as they currently do with the influenza vaccine; and adherence to Ontario College of Pharmacist (OCP) Policy and Guidance for example, the OCP Policy on Medication Procurement and Inventory Management to ensure there is a \"method for identifying products that are outdated, deteriorated, recalled, obsolete, or hazardous, and that such products are disposed of in a safe, legal, and environmentally sound manner\". This would include how to properly dispose of expired or wasted vaccine. Pharmacies may wish to contact the OCP for further advice as destruction of vaccine and drug wastage is included as part of the pharmacy's usual disposal practice protocols. 77.Which of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines require reconstitution? Currently, the Infant Pfizer-BioNTech, maroon cap, (DIN 02530325), Pediatric Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, orange cap (DIN 02522454) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (12+ formulation) vaccine, purple cap (DIN: 02509210) require reconstitution using a diluent that is supplied with the vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (12+ formulation) vaccine, grey cap (DIN: 02527863) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Bivalent vaccine, grey cap (DIN: 02531461) do NOT require reconstitution. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 40 For more information on the vaccines please refer to the product monograph and the resource information on the ministry website: COVID- 19 Vaccine Information and General COVID- 19: Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidance. Pharmacies should ensure that they have adequate space for preparing the injection for admi nistration while adhering to proper infection prevention and control measures. 78.What is the process if my pharmacy needs to transfer COVID -19 vaccine supply to another participating pharmacy? As noted in the COV AXON Agreement, pharmacies that need to transfer COVID -19 vaccine stock to another participating pharmacy require an authorization from the ministry. Stores are not allowed to transfer their vaccine supply to another store (even if the stores have the same owners) without authorization from the ministry and will only be allowed in exceptional circumstances (i.e., where there is risk of unused vaccine wastage). NOTE: The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine (all formulations) and the Moderna COVID - 19 v accine can only be transferred in exceptional circumstances and MUST be ministry approved prior to any transfer . Pharmacies that need to transfer vaccine to another participating pharmacy must adhere to the CO VID-19: Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidance that includes specific information on individual COVID- 19 vaccine requirements. Only unused vials (i.e., not punctured) can be transferred. Doses can only be transferred within their local public health region and the transferring pharmacy must notify the ministry by sending an email that includes: the pharmacy contact information (including ON Provider #) of the site tr ansferring the doses, pharmacy contact information of the site (including ON Provider #) receiving the tran sfer number of doses to be transferred, vaccine name, lot # and expiry date, and reason for the transfer Emails are sent to OPDPInfoBox@ontario.ca. Doses that are transferred must also be logged into the COVAX ON system for proper system-wide inventory management. Pharmacies transferring vaccine must ensure that they include needles and syringes with the shipments. Typically, pharmacy transfers are between pharmacies; however, if a public health unit (PHU) has confirmed that they will accept or supply vaccines, this information can apply to transferring vaccine to or from a PHU as well. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacist Administration of COVID -19 Vaccines Questions and Answers, Ministry of Health 41 Pharmacies arranging to transfer / or accept transfers of vaccine from primary care providers should contact their local public health unit for assistance in logging the transfer in COVAX ON. if the primary care provider does not have their own AO (Authorized Organization). Pharmacies arranging to transfer or accept transfers of vaccine must also follow this pr ocess and await ministry approval. 79.Question intentionally deleted as of November 3rd, 2021 update.
