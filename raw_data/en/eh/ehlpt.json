The Difference and Between Homeopathy and Naturopathy Many people mix-up the terms \"naturopathy\" and \"homeopathy\" (pronounced: ho\"me-op'ah-the). Rachelle S. Bradley, ND is trained as a naturopathic physician and has a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.), and she was board certified in homeopathy by the Council for Homeopathic Certification (CCH) and the Homeopathic Academic of Naturopathic Physicians (HANP). This means she is a naturopath who specializes in homeopathy. She may also use naturopathic therapies such as use herbs, nutrition, and supplements with you, but this is separate from the homeopathic process and remedy selection. Dr. Bradley is trained in the full spectrum of conventional basic and clinical medical sciences, as well as many natural therapies. One of these natural therapies is homeopathy. Therefore, homeopathy is one type of natural therapy a naturopath may use to help someone recover their health. In addition to the basic training in homeopathy that all naturopathic medical students receive, Dr. Bradley specialized in homeopathy and did her residency in homeopathy. Any type of health care practitioner that specialized in homeopathy would also be called a homeopath. However, they could not also be a naturopath unless they had also graduated from a naturopathic medical college. Traditional Homeopathy In this practice Dr. Bradley frequently uses traditional homeopathy as a primary treatment modality to help people recover from chronic disease (often along with some naturopathic therapies). Contrary to some people's impressions, homeopathy is not a generic term for holistic, alternative, or natural medicine; and homeopathic remedies have no similarity to herbal or nutritional supplements. Instead, homeopathy is a distinctly different system of healing with its own rules of application and its own specially prepared natural medicines. When homeopathy is practiced according the principles established with its discovery over 200 years ago, it is called \"traditional\" or \"classical\" homeopathy. Essential to traditional homeopathic care is the interview and health history. Selection of the correct homeopathic remedy depends entirely on the very thorough understanding of the whole person gained through this interview process. The lengthy detailed case-taking process assesses the \"totality of symptoms\" as experienced by the patient. This includes both all physical and mental/emotional symptoms, as well as basic personality traits. Then a single homeopathic medicine is selected that fits the whole person. The focus is always on stimulating self-healing, not on treating a specific disease or symptom.
