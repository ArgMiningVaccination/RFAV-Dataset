What was once a bustling, tropical theme park has now been reduced to mostly ruins and wilderness. There's a way to revamp the island though... by restoring all the Power Crystals to the island's various attractions! Power Crystals are a quest item in Hello Kitty Island Adventure that you can find hidden throughout the island. Power Crystals are used in various quests to restore certain attractions in the island's regions, such as the Plaza Gate or the Dance Hall. Those pesky Power Crystals can be a bit tricky to track down, however. Well, luckily on this page of [IGN's Hello Kitty Island Adventure guide](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure), you can find all the locations of Power Crystals in Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Where to Find All Yellow Power Crystals There are a total of three Yellow Power Crystals in Hello Kitty Island Adventure. To kick off the quest to find these Yellow Power Crystals and open the Plaza Gate, talk to Chococat at his tent in Seaside Resort. Chococat will enlist your help in opening up the Plaza Gate with the \"Power Up the Gate\" quest. - Requirements: - Must be friends with Chococat - Unlock Story Quest \"Power Up the Gate\" Once you have gotten the Magnets from Badtz-maru and Tuxedosam and built your Power Crystal Sensor, you can begin using the Sensor to seek out the three Yellow Power Crystals hidden in Seaside Resort. Where to Find Yellow Power Crystal #1 The first Yellow Power Crystal can be found in a Puzzle Room not far from the Plaza Gate where you meet with Chococat. Follow the path back towards the plaza to the west but take the branching path north instead. Here you will find a temple door with two purple switches to the left and right. Stand on either purple switch, and Chococat will stand on the opposite switch to open the temple door. Inside, you will find the Beginners Bridge Puzzle Room. Solve the puzzle within to find the first Yellow Power Crystal. [Beginners Bridge Puzzle Solution](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure/Beginners_Bridge_Puzzle_Solution)guide. Where to Find Yellow Power Crystal #2 After finding the first Yellow Power Crystal in the Beginners Bridge Puzzle Room, the Sensor will lead you to the far west side of Seaside Resort. Follow the path through the plaza, and then continue going west. When the path starts forks just before the docks where Badtz-maru resides, turn northwest and follow the sandy path the rest of the way to the Crystal Conundrum Puzzle Room. [Crystal Conundrum Puzzle Solution](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure/Crystal_Conundrum_Puzzle_Solution)guide for a puzzle walkthrough! Where to Find Yellow Crystal #3 With the first and second Yellow Power Crystals secured from both puzzle rooms in Seaside Resort, there's is just one last Yellow Power Crystal to find. From the Crystal Conundrum Puzzle Room, head east back towards the plaza. Head north up the center path from the plaza. Eventually you will come to an end of the wooden path, with a \"Top Hat\" sign sitting to the right of a broken bridge. Arriving here will trigger a cutscene between you and Chococat. Your friend suggests going to My Melody for help repairing the bridge so that you can reach the third Yellow Power Crystal, which must be on the other side. Find My Melody in her shop at the plaza. She thinks she can repair the bridge, but she needs you to bring her two Strawberry Crates to have enough materials for the job. You can find Strawberry Crates all around the island! Trying searching the north and south beach on Seaside Resort, or the cliffs above the plaza. Once you have two or more Strawberry Crates, talk to My Melody at her shop to give them to her. Return back to the broken bridge on the path north of the plaza. With the bridge repaired, you can now cross to the other side! You will find the third Yellow Power Crystal on the beach to the right of the now repaired bridge. Collect the Yellow Power Crystal before heading back to the Plaza Gate on the far east side of Seaside Resort. Interact with the Plaza Gate to insert all three Yellow Power Crystal and open up the gate to Spooky Swamp and beyond. Where to Find All Green Power Crystals It's time to restore the Spooky Swamp to its true haunted self. There are a total of three Green Power Crystals you can find to restore the Spooky Swamp. Before you can find the Green Power Crystals, you must reach Friendship Level 4 with Kuromi, unlocking the \"Re-Haunt the Spooky Swamp\" Story Quest. - Requirements: - Kuromi Friendship Level 4 - Unlock Story Quest: \"Re-Haunt the Spooky Swamp\" Where to Find Green Power Crystal #1 Once you have reached Level 4 Friendship with Kuromi, speak with her in the Spooky Swamp to jump start the unlocked \"Re-Haunt the Spooky Swamp\" quest. Kuromi will lead you to the Haunted Mansion, northeast of the plaza where Kuromi normally hangs out. She'll give you the first Green Power Crystal needed to power up the Haunted Mansion. Where to Find Green Power Crystal #2 With the first Green Power Crystal, head east of the Haunted Mansion. To the right of the hedge, you will find a hollow tree stump with an empty generator inside. Interact with this generator to place the Green Power Crystal and turn on the Haunted Mansion. Now that the Haunted Mansion is unlocked, a challenge awaits ahead. \"Survive\" all the floors of the Haunted Mansion - or more accurately solve each floor's puzzle - to get to the attic. In the attic of the Haunted Mansion, you will find the second Green Power Crystal. Where to Find Green Power Crystal #3 After exiting the Haunted Mansion, follow the path across the bridge to the north until you come across the train tracks, with a mine cart operated by a Null. Cross the train tracks to find the hollow tree stump on the other side, with an empty generator inside. Place the second Green Power Crystal inside this generator to power up the \"Ghost Tour\" cart ride. Hop into the cart behind the Null after talking with Kuromi. The cart will make stops all around the northern section of Spooky Swamp whenever it encounters a fall of fog. When the fog stops the cart, hop out and search for the nearest light switch to clear the fog off the tracks. Complete the Ghost Tour cart ride and turn on all three lights switches to clear the tracks of fog. Once you complete the loop, the temple door north of the Ghost Tour ride will open up. Inside this door you can find a room with a treasure chest and the third Green Power Crystal! All that's left to do is wear the Spooky Witch outfit set, collected from the treasure chests in the Haunted Mansion and Treasure Trove room, and sneak past the Null guarding the last generator just southeast of the Ghost Tour. Place the last Green Power Crystal here to restore the Spooky Swamp. Where to Find All Purple Power Crystals Pekkle loves nothing more than to dance. But what's a dance party without any music? Gemstone Mountain once used to be a bustling wild west attraction, with the star of the show being the Dance Hall. Help Pekkle revive the Dance Hall by starting the \"Bring Back the Swing\" story quest and collecting all three Purple Power Crystals. - \"Bring Back the Swing\" Quest Requirements: - Must be Friendship Level 5 with Pekkle - Chococat must not be involved with any other quests Once you have reached Friendship Level 5 with Pekkle, you will unlock the story quest, \"Bring Back the Swing\". Talk with Pekkle in his usual spot in Gemstone Mountain, near the Fast Travel Mailbox in Gemstone Town. He'll lead you into the Dance Hall just to the north. What's a dance hall without a band to play music? In order to get the animatronic band in the Dance Hall playing again, you will need to find all three Purple Power Crystals in Gemstone Mountain to power up the stage. Don't forget to equip your Power Crystal Sensor while you search for Purple Power Crystals! You can access the Sensor from your Tool Wheel. Where to Find Purple Power Crystal #1 You can find the first Purple Power Crystal not far from the Dance Hall in Gemstone Town. From the Dance Hall, head just a bit south down the path until you are in the town square, where the Gemstone Town Fast Travel Mailbox resides. From the town square, head up the northeast path towards the pond. Swim across the pond to the small island in the center of the pond. Atop this island you find the first Purple Power Crystal! Where to Find Purple Power Crystal #2 The second Purple Power Crystal can be found southwest of the Dance Hall. However, to reach it you will need to go around the long way. That is, unless you have the stamina to climb this tall stone pillar on your own. From the town square south of the Dance Hall, head along the west path past the workbench and up the rope ladder. At the top of the cliff, pivot a bit south, following the edge of the cliff. You'll find another wood slat path that connects to a bridge that leads over the gorge below. Walk to the end of the bridge, and atop the stone pillar that overlooks Gemstone Mountain, you can see the second Purple Power Crystal. Where to Find Purple Power Crystal #3 The last Purple Power Crystal can be found a bit to the northwest of the Dance Hall. This crystal will also require a bit of an excursion to reach, unless you have the stamina to parkour your way to this lofty spot. From the town square in front of the Dance Hall, head along the west path yet again, until you reach the rope ladder. At the top of this cliff, keep following the path as it takes you north. At the fork in the path where you find the Oasis Fast Travel Mailbox, pivot east along the dirt path. Keep heading east, climbing up the next rope ladder you encounter and follow the train tracks. Around the spot where you see the giant mine cart buried in the sand outside the Crystal Caves entrance, head south until you hit the edge of the cliff. Follow the edge of this cliff west. You'll encounter two wooden bridges. Walk onto the westmost bridge. At the end of this west bridge, you will find the Purple Power Crystal on the edge of the stone arch! Now that you have all three Purple Power Crystals, all that's left is to return to the Dance Hall and place them in the stage. With the stage up and running and the animatronic band operational, the last step is to help Pekkle invite the rest of the Sanrio characters to a hoedown. You will only need to gift five Characters a Dance Hall Invitation to invite all the Sanrio characters to the Dance Hall. Where to Find All the Red Power Crystals Poor Retsuko came on this vacation to finally get a break from work. Well, thanks to the unceremonious crash-landing on the island, she's lost all her luggage. It's somewhere inside the Red Hot Ruins within Mount Hothead. But to get inside the ruins, you need to open the door with three Red Power Crystals. - \"Enraging Ruins\" Quest Requirements: - Friendship Level 7 with Retsuko Where to Find Red Power Crystal #1 The first Red Power Crystal can be found on the shores beneath Mount Hothead.

Just a bit left past the first Visitor Cabin you encounter, there is a small pool of water. The Red Power Crystal sits on the rock outcrop overlooking the pool. Where to Find Red Power Crystal #2 The second Red Power Crystal sits on the stone path along the east side of Mount Hothead. From the Red Hot Ruins door, head east along the path. Keep following the cobbled stone path as it turns north and the ground turns ashen black. At one curve of this path, near the cliffside overlooking the path towards the Hot Springs, you can find another Red Power Crystal. Where to Find Red Power Crystal #3 The last Red Power Crystal can be found in the Hot Springs, east of Mount Hothead. If you have not already traveled to the Hot Springs and unlocked the Fast Travel Mailbox there, from the Red Hot Ruins door head east down the path. Keep following the path as it curves northeast, until you come to the cliff edge at the north. From here, you can easily climb down or jump off the cliff, using your Balloons to make a graceful descent. In the Hot Springs there are several pools of spring water. Look for the pool with the two waterfalls, left of one of the Visitor Cabins. A Red Power Crystal sits on a rock outcrop there. Where to Find All Blue Power Crystals A comedian isn't much without an audience. Hangyodon has set himself up in the Comedy Club located underwater in Rainbow Reef. But seeing as he's the only fish among your Sanrio friends, how is anyone else supposed to make it to a show? After all, you only found Hangyodon thanks to the [Snorkel you crafted](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure/How_to_Find_Hangyodon) with Kuromi's help.

Once you have started the Comic Relief story quest with Hangyodon, found the Mermaid Outfit, and met with Chococat about restoring the Mermaidifier outside the Plaza Gate, it's time to track down the Blue Power Crystals. Where to Find Blue Power Crystal #1 Look for the first Blue Power Crystal by the dock along the shore south of Gemstone Mountain. You can reach this dock from the Pirate Ship sunken underwater to the southwest, or from following the boardwalk south of Gemstone Mountain until you find this dock. Jump off the dock and use your [Snorkel to dive underwater](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure/How_to_Find_Hangyodon). You can dive much further and longer with the Mermaid Outfit equipped. At the bottom of this trench in Rainbow Reef, floating atop some of the coral on the ocean floor, you can find the first Blue Power Crystal. Where to Find Blue Power Crystal #2 The second Power Crystal can be found inside the Pirate Ship, found underwater north of the first Visitor Cabin you repair. Once you find the Pirate Ship, [use your Snorkel](/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure/How_to_Find_Hangyodon) to dive underwater. Keep diving and swimming until you find the south side of the ship, with the giant hole in its hull. Swim into the hole to enter a secret room. Inside the Pirate Ship, you will find a secret puzzle room called \"Sunken Solutions\". The objective is to use the tools at your disposal in this room to climb to the top of the \"mast\" of the ship where the Blue Power Crystal precariously sits.

Place the Blue Power Crystals to turn on the Mermaidifier, allowing your friends to transform into Mermaids and swim underwater just like you and Hangyodon! All that's left is to wrap up the \"Comic Relief\" quest by delivering the Comedy Club Flyers to My Melody, and stopping by the Comedy Club at night to take part in the opening night show. "}
