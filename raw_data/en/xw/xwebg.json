Friedman1,*1Infectious Disease Division, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine,University of Pennsylvania, depends on the total mRNA-LNPdose. We established that the maximum tolerated dose of our trivalent mRNA-LNP genital herpesvaccine was 10\u00b5g/immunization in mice. We then evaluated one of the mRNAs, gD2 mRNA-LNP, todetermine how much of the 10\u00b5g total dose to assign to this immunogen. We immunized mice with0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or measured antibodies to six crucial gD2 epitopes involved in virus entry and spread. Antibodies to crucialgD2 epitopes peaked at 1\u00b5g, while ELISA and neutralizing titers continued to increase at higherdoses. The epitope whileELISA and neutralizing titers indicated higher doses may be useful. We challenged the gD2 mRNA-immunized mice intravaginally with HSV-2. The 1-\u00b5g dose provided total protection, conrming theepitope studies, and supported assigning less than one-third of the trivalent vaccine maximum doseof 10\u00b5g to gD2 mRNA-LNP. Epitope mapping as performed in mice can also be accomplished inphase 1 human trials to help select the optimum dose of each immunogen in a multivalent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 [1]. mRNA vaccines forrabies, influenza, and cytomegalovirus are in human trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05085366, accessed on 30 January 2022) [2,3]. Other viral vaccines are likelyto follow, possibly including our candidate HSV-2 trivalent vaccine to prevent genitalherpes [4-7].The mRNA-LNP vaccines for COVID-19 demonstrated dose-dependent toxicity inphase 1 human studies [8,9]. An mRNA dose of 30\u00b5g of the Pzer/BioNTech COVID-19vaccine was well tolerated, however higher doses had more adverse reactions [9]. The cutoffdose for the Moderna vaccine was 100\u00b5g[9]. These vaccines use different proprietary LNPformulations. The LNP component tends to be the reactogenic constituent in the vaccine,and the LNP content increases proportional to the mRNA dose [10]. The COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccine contains a single mRNA encoding the Spike protein [1]. Our genital herpesvaccine contains three mRNAs while the CMV vaccine in phase 3 human trials containsViruses2022,14, 540.https://doi.org/10.3390/v14030540https://www.mdpi.com/journal/virusesViruses2022,14, 5402 of 126 mRNAs [4,5]. Multivalent vaccines need to use lower doses of individual immunogens tokeep the total mRNA-LNP content below toxic levels.Antigen doses for vaccines are often determined in dose escalation phase 1 humantrials based on balancing toxicity and immunogenicity. The selected dose is then evaluatedfor efcacy in much larger and more costly phase 2 and 3 human trials. Here, we evaluatedwhether measuring antibody responses to crucial epitopes on immunogens in dose esca-lation (phase 1-like) studies adds value to more established methods, such as serum IgGELISA and neutralizing antibody assays, in selecting the optimum dose of immunogensto include in larger efcacy studies. We used the mouse model of genital herpes and gD2mRNA-LNP as the test immunogen to evaluate our hypothesis that epitope mapping willhelp select the optimal dose of an immunogen to include in a multivalent vaccine.We previously performed epitope mapping studies using high throughput biosensortechnology to measure antibody responses to crucial epitopes on HSV-2 glycoprotein D(gD2) in immunized mice, guinea pigs, and humans [5,11-13]. In the guinea pig HSV-2genital infection model, antibody responses to crucial gD2 epitopes correlated with vaccineefcacy [11]. The greater crucial gD2 epitopes recognized by the immuneserum and the higher the antibody titer, the greater the protection was against the genitaldisease [11]. Here, we compare the utility of epitope mapping with serum IgG ELISA andneutralizing antibody titers for selecting the lowest effective dose of an mRNA immunogento include in a multivalent vaccine.2. Materials and Trivalent mRNA-LNP Vaccine ToxicityFor toxicity studies, female BALB/c mice (Charles River) age 7-9 weeks were immu-nized twice 28 days apart intramuscularly (IM) in the hind limb hip muscle with a total doseof 1, 3, or 10\u00b5g in 30\u00b5L containing equal concentrations of gC2, gD2, and gE2 mRNA-LNP,or with sterile saline as a control [5]. The DNA constructs designed to prepare the mRNAand procedures used to generate the mRNA have been described previously [5]. ThemRNA was encapsulated in LNP prepared by Acuitas [5]. Mice were evaluated for weightloss and hind limb mobility daily for 6-7 days after the rst and second immunizations.Mice received a daily score of 2 for a moderate reduction in hind limb mobility, 1 for aminor reduction, and 0 for no reduction.2.2. Immunizing with gD2 mRNA-LNPTo determine the lowest effective dose of gD2 mRNA to include in the vaccine, femaleBALB/c mice were immunized twice at 28-day intervals with gD2 mRNA-LNP at dosesof 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10\u00b5g (10 mice/group) diluted in 30\u00b5L of sterile saline. An additionalgroup of 10 mice received two immunizations with 10\u00b5g of Poly(C) RNA-LNP as a control.Serum was obtained just prior to the rst immunization and four weeks after the rst andsecond immunizations and stored at 96-well High Binding Costar microtiterplates at 100 ng/well in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 8.5 binding buffer, incubated for 1 hat room temperature then overnight at 4\u0000C, and blocked for 2 h with 5% (wt/vol) nonfatmilk in PBS 0.05% Tween 1:1000 wereadded to gD2-coated wells. Bound IgG was detected at optical density of 405 nm usinghorseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse analysis reading two-fold titers dilutions of mouse serawith 5% human serum as the source of complement obtained from an HSV-1- and HSV-2seronegative donor and 100 PFU of HSV-2 at 37\u0000C for 1 h. The remaining virus wasdetermined by plaque assay on Vero cells. The neutralizing titer [14].2.4. Biosensor-Based Antibody Microfluidics GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany). Anti-body competition assays then performed in the surface plasmon resonance imager(IBIS MX96, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) in a pre-mix assay format by saturating solublegD2(285t) a dilution) mouse sera. EachgD2(285t)/mouse serum mix was flowed across the sensor chip spotted with the gD MAbs.gD2 alone was flowed across the chip for the rst 2-3 cycles and every 10th cycle to establishthe background binding of gD2 compared to gD2 plus mouse serum. Data were recordedas response units (RU). The blocking activity of mouse sera was calculated for each Mab asa percentage using the formula: [1\u0000(RU gD2(285t) + mouse gD(285t) alone)]100. Occasionally, the (RU gD2(285t) + mouse serum) yielded a negative RU value thatwas lower than the baseline value of buffer alone, resulting in percent blocking values thatexceeded 100%.2.5. HSV-2 Vaginal Infection and Vaccine EfcacyMice were injected subcutaneously with 2 mg of medroxyprogesterone ve days priorto infection [16]. The vagina was cleared using a sterile swab moistened with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and mice were infected intravaginally ve weeks after the secondimmunization with 5103PFU (275 LD50) HSV-2 strain MS. Mice were monitored forsurvival, weight loss, genital disease, and vaginal virus titers on days two and four post-infection, and HSV-2 DNA in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at the time of humane euthanasiaor at the end of the experiment on days 28-32 post-infection. Mice received a daily score ofone each for redness/erythema, hair loss, vaginal exudate, and necrosis for a maximumdaily score of four for genital disease.2.6. Vaginal Virus TitersVaginal swabs were obtained on days two and four post-infection and placed in 1 mLof complete Serial by plaqueassay on Vero cells [5].2.7. qPCR for HSV-2 DNA Present in the DRGDRG samples were analyzed in duplicate for HSV-2 genomic DNA [5]. Separatereactions were used to amplify HSV-2 DNA and the adipsin gene. Five microlitersof puried qPCR(Roche LightCycler 96, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The primers and probe used to amplify theHSV-2 Us9 gene were: GGCAGAAGCCTACTACTCGGAAAA; Reverse, CCAT-GCGCACGAGGAAA; and Probe, The primers andprobe used to amplify the mouse adipsin gene were: Forward, GCAGTCGAAGGTGTGGT-TACG; Reverse, GGTATAGACGCCCGGCTTTT; and Probe, FAM-CTGTGGCAATGGC-MGBNFQ. The DRG HSV-2 DNA copy number was expressed as log10DNA copies per105adipsin genes. Samples with less than one copy by 40 cycles in duplicate wells wereconsidered negative. If only one of the duplicate wells was positive, the sample was testedin triplicate. The DRG sample was considered positive for HSV-2 DNA if two or more ofthe triplicates were positive [4].Viruses2022,14, 5404 of 122.8. Statistical AnalysisArea under the curve (AUC)pvalues for weight loss and leg toxicity were calculatedby the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test with Holm adjustment for multiple comparisonsusing R Studio Version 1.3.1056 with R software version 4.0.2 (R Core Team, 2020, DE,USA) and the trapezoid rule with function \"AUC\" from \"DescTools\" version0.99.44.pvalues comparing endpoint serum IgG ELISA titers after the rst and secondimmunization were calculated by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. The two-tailedMann-Whitney test was used to compare gD2 IgG ELISA, neutralizing antibody titers,epitope antibody titers, day two and day four vaginal virus titers, and the HSV-2 DNAcopy number in DRG. When multiple comparisons were performed, we used ordinaryone-way ANOVA with Sidak's correction. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used tocalculatepvalues for survival. With the exception of AUC,pvalues were calculated usingGraphPad Prism version 9.2.0. Results were considered signicant atp< 0.05.2.9. Study ApprovalThe mouse studies were approved by the University of Pennsylvania InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee under protocol 805187.3. Results3.1. Experimental Design and RationaleThe study design can be divided into three parts. In experiment 1, we immunizedmice with our gC2, gD2, and gE2 trivalent mRNA-LNP vaccine to determine the totalmRNA-LNP dose per administration that is safe. These results established the upperlimits for the total dose of mRNA-LNPs, however did not dene the optimum dose of theindividual mRNA-LNP immunogens within that total. In experiment 2, we performedimmunology assays as a guide for determining the optimum dose of an individual mRNA-LNP immunogen to include in a multivalent vaccine. We used only one of the immunogens,gD2 mRNA-LNP, to test our hypothesis that measuring antibody responses to crucial,functional epitopes on an antigen adds value to more standard assays, such as serum IgGELISA and neutralizing antibodies, to dene the optimum immunogen dose. Experiment 3involved infecting the animals to assess vaccine efcacy. The goal was to determine whichof the immunology assays best predicted the immunogen dose that protected the animals.Lessons learned about the predictive value of immune responses in preclinical studies willhelp select immunogen doses of multivalent vaccines in human trials.3.2. Experiment 1: Toxicity Is Dose Dependent for the Trivalent mRNA-LNP VaccineWe evaluated vaccine toxicity in mice vaccine LNPs at equivalentconcentrations. The goal of experiment 1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dosewhen all three immunogens were included in the vaccine. BALB/c mice were immunizedIM two times 28 days apart with 1, 3, or 10\u00b5g of the trivalent HSV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine orwith sterile PBS as a control. Mice were evaluated after the rst and second immunizationsfor weight loss and reduction in hind limb mobility. By comparing 10\u00b5g of the trivalentmRNA-LNP vaccine with either PBS or the 1-\u00b5g dose, it was found that mice receiving the10-\u00b5g dose lost more weight and developed greater loss in mobility of the immunized hindlimb after both immunizations (Figure1). Mice receiving the 3-\u00b5g dose had weight lossand decreased hind limb mobility in-between the 1-\u00b5g and 10-\u00b5g groups. We detected nodifferences for weight loss or hind limb mobility when comparing the 1-\u00b5g group with thePBS group or comparing the rst with second immunization. Our mouse studies establishthat lower doses of the trivalent mRNA vaccine are better tolerated than higher doses andsupport choosing the lowest vaccine dose possible that is effective. For the purposes ofthe current study, we established that the total dose of RNA-LNP immunogens within thevaccine should not exceed 10\u00b5g.Viruses2022,14, 5405 of 12Viruses 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12 groups. We detected no differences for weight loss or hind limb mobility when comparing the 1-g group with the PBS group or comparing the first with second immunization. Our mouse studies establish that lower doses of the trivalent mRNA vaccine are better toler-ated than higher doses and support choosing the lowest vaccine dose possible that is ef-fective. For the purposes of the current study, we established that the total dose of RNA-LNP immunogens within the vaccine should not exceed 10 g. Figure 1. Trivalent mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine toxicity is dose dependent. Weight loss and hind limb mobility were assessed after (a) the first and (b) second immunization. The trivalent mRNA-LNP and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vaccination groups were weighed on days 1-6 post-infection and evaluated for mobility in the inoculated hind limb on days 1-7 post-immuniza-tion (weight: n = 15 animals in the 1-g and 3-g groups, 9 animals in the 10-g group, and 5 animals in the PBS group; hind limb mobility: n = 15 mice in the 1-g and 3-g group, 13 mice in the 10-g group, and 5 mice in the PBS group). P values were not calculated comparing 3 g with PBS, 1 g, or 10 g. p values were determined by comparing area under the curve (AUC) using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test with Holm adjustment for multiple comparisons. 3.3. Experiment 2: Dose Escalation Study of gD2 mRNA to Evaluate IgG ELISA Titers, Neutralizing Antibodies, and Antibodies to Crucial gD2 Epitopes Choosing the lowest effective vaccine dose for each immunogen in a multivalent vac-cine is challenging. We established in experiment 1 that the total dose of all three mRNA immunogens should not exceed 10 g. The issue is whether to include equal concentra-tions of each mRNA immunogen or increase the concentration of one or more immuno-gens while decreasing another will improve the outcome without changing the total mRNA-LNP content. We evaluated gD2 mRNA as one of the three immunogens in the trivalent genital herpes vaccine to determine whether measuring antibody responses to crucial gD2 epitopes in a dose escalation study provides useful information beyond that gained from serum gD2 IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers to establish the dose of an immunogen to include toxicity is dose dependent. Weightloss and hind limb mobility were assessed after (a) the rst and (b) second immunization. Thetrivalent mRNA-LNP and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vaccination groups were weighed ondays 1-6 post-infection and evaluated for mobility in the inoculated hind limb on days 1-7 post-immunization (weight:n= 15 animals in the 1-\u00b5g and 3-\u00b5g groups, 9 animals in the 10-\u00b5g group,and 5 animals in the PBS group; hind limb mobility:n= 15 mice in the 1-\u00b5g and 3-\u00b5g group, 13 micein the10-\u00b5ggroup, and 5 mice in the PBS group).Pvalues were not calculated comparing 3\u00b5g withPBS, 1\u00b5g, or 10\u00b5g.pvalues were determined by comparing area under the curve (AUC) using theMann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test with Holm adjustment for multiple comparisons.3.3. Experiment 2: Dose Escalation Study of gD2 mRNA to Evaluate IgG ELISA Titers,Neutralizing Antibodies, and Antibodies to Crucial gD2 EpitopesChoosing the lowest effective vaccine dose for each immunogen in a multivalentvaccine is challenging. We established in experiment 1 that the total dose of all three mRNAimmunogens should not exceed 10\u00b5g. The issue is whether to include equal concentrationsof each mRNA immunogen or increase the concentration of one or more immunogenswhile decreasing another will improve the outcome without changing the total mRNA-LNPcontent. We evaluated gD2 mRNA as one of the three immunogens in the trivalent genitalherpes vaccine to determine whether measuring antibody responses to crucial gD2 epitopesin a dose escalation study provides useful information beyond that gained from serumgD2 IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers to establish the dose of an immunogen toinclude in a vaccine [11,15,17].3.3.1. Serum IgG ELISA TitersWe rst evaluated whether gD2 IgG ELISA is helpful when assessing the number ofvaccine doses to administer. Mice were immunized twice at one-month intervals with gD2mRNA-LNP at doses ranging from 0.3\u00b5g to 10.0\u00b5g (33-fold range). Sera were obtainedprior to immunization and four weeks after the rst and second immunizations. Serum gD2IgG ELISA titers increased signicantly after at each gD2 mRNAdose (Figure2a). Two immunizations at signicantly exceededthe IgG titers (Figure2a). These resultsViruses2022,14, 5406 of boost in gD2 IgG ELISA titers occurs after the second immunizationand demonstrate the value of serum IgG ELISA when selecting dosing frequency.Viruses 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 12 3.3.1. Serum IgG ELISA Titers We first evaluated whether gD2 IgG ELISA is helpful when assessing the number of vaccine doses to administer. Mice were immunized twice at one-month intervals with gD2 mRNA-LNP at doses ranging from 0.3 g to 10.0 g (33-fold range). Sera were obtained prior to immunization and four weeks after the first and second immunizations. Serum gD2 IgG ELISA titers increased significantly after the second immunization at each gD2 mRNA dose (Figure 2a). Two immunizations at the lowest dose of 0.3 g significantly exceeded the IgG ELISA titers after a single immunization with 10-g gD2 (Figure 2a). These results indicate that a major boost in gD2 IgG ELISA titers occurs after the second immunization and demonstrate the value of serum IgG ELISA when selecting dosing fre-quency. We next evaluated gD2 IgG ELISA titers after the second immunization to determine whether IgG ELISA is useful for selecting the optimal gD2 dose per administration of the vaccine. The serum IgG ELISA titers increased 2.4-fold when comparing 0.3 g and 10.0 g doses (Figure 2a). A dose-response pattern is apparent because higher gD2 doses pro-duced higher ELISA titers, although titers changed relatively little over the 33-fold range. Based on the ELISA results, we would likely include gD2 mRNA-LNP at a dose of 3.33 g in the trivalent vaccine, representing one-third of the maximum tolerated dose of 10 g for all three immunogens. Our reasoning is that ELISA titers continued to rise with each higher dose, providing no clear guidance whether a dose lower than 3.33 g would be equally efficacious. 3.3.2. Serum Neutralizing Antibody Titers We next evaluated neutralizing antibody responses after the second immunization using five sera per group that were selected based on the volume of serum available. We previously reported that neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs immunized with the tri-valent mRNA vaccine correlated with protection against genital infection [4]. Therefore, selecting the gD2 mRNA dose that produces the highest neutralizing titers without tox-icity is important for the success of the trivalent mRNA vaccine. Neutralizing antibody titers at the three highest doses followed a dose-response pattern and were highest in the 10-g group (Figure 2b). Therefore, we would likely choose a dose of 3.33 g for gD2 mRNA in the trivalent vaccine for similar reasons as stated for ELISA titers. Figure 2.gD2 mRNA-LNP generates serum IgG ELISA and dose-dependent pattern. (a) Serum gD2 IgG ELISA titers were evaluated prior to the rst immunizationand four weeks after the rst and second immunization (n= 10 sera/dose) (pre and prior to therst immunization; I and II, sera obtained after the rst and second immunizations, respectively).(b) Neutralizing antibody titers were determined in the presence of complement (n= 5 sera/dose).pvalues comparing ELISA IgG titers after the rst and second bleeds were calculated by the Wilcoxonmatched pairs signed rank test.pvalues comparing different doses in (a,b) were calculated bythe two-tailed howeverpvalues comparing 10.0\u00b5g evaluated gD2 IgG ELISA titers after the second immunization to determinewhether IgG ELISA is useful for selecting the optimal gD2 dose per administration ofthe vaccine. The 0.3\u00b5g and10.0\u00b5g A dose-response pattern is apparent because higher gD2 dosesproduced higher ELISA titers, although titers changed relatively little over the 33-foldrange. Based on the ELISA results, we would likely include gD2 mRNA-LNP at a dose of3.33\u00b5g in the trivalent vaccine, representing one-third of the maximum tolerated dose of10\u00b5g for all three immunogens. Our reasoning is that ELISA titers continued to rise witheach higher dose, providing no clear guidance whether a dose lower than 3.33\u00b5g would beequally efcacious.3.3.2. Serum Neutralizing Antibody TitersWe next antibody responses after the second immunizationusing ve sera per group that were selected based on the volume of serum available.We previously reported that neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs immunized with thetrivalent mRNA vaccine correlated with protection against genital infection [4]. Therefore,selecting the gD2 mRNA dose that produces the highest neutralizing titers without toxicityis important for the success of the trivalent mRNA vaccine. Neutralizing antibody titers atthe three highest doses followed a dose-response pattern and were highest in the 10-\u00b5ggroup (Figure2b). Therefore, we would likely choose a dose of 3.33\u00b5g for gD2 mRNA inthe trivalent vaccine for similar reasons as stated for ELISA titers.Viruses2022,14, 5407 of 123.3.3. Antibodies to Crucial gD2 throughput biosensor to six crucial gD2 epitopes [5,11-13,15]. Antibodies that bind to these six gD2epitopes perform one or more of the following functions: block gD2 binding to the her-pesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) nectin-1 receptor, or gD2 conformational changes [5,11,17].We evaluated epitope-specic antibody responses to the six gD2 epitopes after thesecond immunization using ve sera per gD2 dose that were selected based on the volumeavailable. Our goal was to determine whether epitope mapping adds useful information toELISA and neutralizing antibody titers during a phase 1-like dose escalation study to helpselect the optimum gD2 mRNA-LNP dose for phase 3 efcacy Serum was puried gD2(285t) and withmultiple MAb [11,15]. Binding of gD2 to the MAb on the chip was measured for eachgD2-immune serum mixture and compared to binding when gD2 was mixed with thebuffer. A reduction in gD2 binding to a particular MAb when mixed with serum comparedto buffer indicates competition and signies that an antibody is present in the immuneserum to an epitope recognized by the MAb on the chip.MAbs that recognize identical or overlapping epitopes are referred to as a communityof MAbs [13]. We spotted multiple MAbs from each community on the chip, and report theresults of prototype MAbs for each community [11]. (1) Prototype MAb MC23 blocks to the [11,15,17]. Titers of blocking antibodiesto MC23 were highest in the 10-\u00b5g group and were signicantly higher than in the 0.3-\u00b5ggroup that had the lowest titers (Figure3a). (2) We next evaluated prototype MAb 77S,which recognizes an epitope that is involved with binding to HVEM and nectin-1 [11,15].Similar to MC23, the antibody titers were highest and signicantly greater than at0.3\u00b5g (Figure3b). (3) We then assessed prototype 1D3, which blocks gD2 bindingto the HVEM receptor [11,15]. In contrast to the prior MAbs, the 10-\u00b5g group had lowerantibody titers than at 1.0\u00b5g, although differences did not achieve statistical signicance(Figure3c). This result suggests that at high doses, other (polyclonal) gD2 antibodies in theimmune sera may alter ID3 or interfere with antibodies that bindto this epitope. We again detected the lowest antibody titers in the 0.3-\u00b5g group. (4) Wenext evaluated prototype MAbs MC2, which blocks gD2 activation thereby preventingits interaction The antibody to the MC2 epitope followeda similar pattern as ID3 in that the 10-\u00b5g group had lower titers than the 1-\u00b5g group,suggesting possible changes to epitope conformation or interference by other antibodiesin the sera (Figure3d). (5) We then assessed prototype MAb which to with is recognized by [17,19]. As noted for several other epitopes,the 0.3-\u00b5g group had the lowest antibody titers (Figure3f). We conclude that antibodieswere produced to most epitopes at all immunization doses; that for some epitopes a highgD2 dose improved the antibody response, while for others, a high gD2 dose resulted insomewhat reduced antibody titers; and the 0.3-\u00b5g group generally produced the lowestantibody titers. No clear pattern emerged for choosing the optimal gD2 mRNA dose whenanalyzing antibody responses to individual epitopes.Viruses2022,14, 5408 of 12Viruses 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12 dose resulted in somewhat reduced antibody titers; and the 0.3-g group generally pro-duced the lowest antibody titers. No clear pattern emerged for choosing the optimal gD2 mRNA dose when analyzing antibody responses to individual epitopes. Figure 3. gD2 mRNA-LNP produces antibodies to important functional epitopes. Antibody re-sponses were measured to six functional gD2 epitopes identified by MAb (a) MC23, (b) MC2, (e) MC5, and (f) MC14. Sera from five mice were evaluated per vaccine dose. The shape of the symbol identifies individual mice in the gD2 mRNA groups; for example, the animal indicated by a rectangle in (a) is also denoted by a rectangle in (b-f). We calculated p values comparing the highest dose (10 g) with the lowest dose (0.3 g), and the dose producing the highest antibody titer with the lowest antibody titer. p values were performed using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test or ordinary one-way ANOVA with Sidak's correction when multiple comparisons were performed. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ns, not significant. Our prior studies indicated that high titer antibody responses to multiple epitopes are required for protection against genital HSV-2 infection with no individual epitope emerging as dominant [11]. Therefore, we combined the epitope-specific antibody re-sponses into a single graph to demonstrate the polyclonal antibody response to all six epitopes at each gD2 dose (Figure 4). Importantly, we did not observe a dose-response pattern for antibody titers to gD2 epitopes. Instead, we identified a plateau in antibody titers at gD2 doses 1 g with no further increase at higher doses. The plateau at 1 g distinguishes the epitope antibody titers from IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody re-sponses that failed to plateau even at 10 g. The epitope antibody titers suggest that the 1-g dose is as effective as the higher doses in producing high titers of antibodies to the six crucial epitopes, leaving up to 9 g available to accommodate the remaining two mRNA immunogens, if needed. In contrast, the IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody ti-ters supported using 3.33 g without signaling that lower the gD2 mRNA dose may be equally effective. Figure 3.gD2 mRNA-LNP produces antibodies to important functional epitopes. Antibody responseswere measured to six functional gD2 MC5, and (f) MC14. Sera from ve mice were evaluated per vaccine dose. The shape of the symbolidenties individual mice in the gD2 mRNA groups; for example, the animal indicated by a rectanglein (a) is also denoted by a rectangle in (b-f).

Therefore, we combined the epitope-specic antibody responses into asingle graph to demonstrate the polyclonal antibody response to all six epitopes at eachgD2 dose (Figure4). Importantly, we did not observe a dose-response pattern for antibodytiters to gD2 epitopes. Instead, we identied a plateau in antibody titers at gD2 doses\u00001\u00b5gwith no further increase at higher doses. The plateau at 1\u00b5g distinguishes the epitopeantibody titers from IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody responses that failed to plateaueven at 10\u00b5g. The epitope antibody titers suggest that the 1-\u00b5g dose is as effective as thehigher doses in producing high titers of antibodies to the six crucial epitopes, leaving upto 9\u00b5g available to accommodate the remaining two mRNA immunogens, if needed.

Experiment 3: Vaccine Efficacy in gD2 mRNA Immunized Mice To evaluate vaccine efficacy, the same mice used for immunology studies in Figure 2-4 were challenged with HSV-2 at 5 \u00d7 103 PFU (275 LD50) 35 days after the second im-munization (10 mice/group).

No animal immunized with gD2 mRNA lost weight (Figure 5b), developed genital disease (Figure 5c), or had any other sign of illness, including ruffled fur, hunched posture, abnormal gait, or lethargy. We next evaluated mice for evidence of subclinical infection by measuring virus titers in vaginal swabs obtained on days two and four post-infection and by assaying for HSV-2 DNA copy number in DRG (site of latency) at the time of humane euthanasia or at the end of the experiment on days 28-32. All animals in the Poly(C) group had HSV-2 isolated from vaginal swabs on days two and four post-infection (Figure 5d,e). Only two of forty (5%) animals immunized with gD2 mRNA had positive vaginal virus cultures on day two and one of the same animals (2.5%) had a positive vaginal culture on day four (Figure 5d,e). Both animals with positive vaginal virus cultures were in the 0.3-g group (Figure 5d,e). Six of seven animals in the Poly(C) group had HSV-2 DNA detected in DRG at the time of humane euthanasia 8-14 days post-infection (Figure 5f). Only one of forty (2.5%) animals immunized with gD2 mRNA was positive for HSV-2 DNA in DRG obtained at the end of the experiment (Figure 5f). This animal was different from the two that had positive vaginal virus cultures on days two or four and was also in the 0.3-g group. Overall, three of ten (30%) mice in the 0.3-g group had evidence of subclinical infection compared to 0/30 (0%) at higher doses (p = 0.0121 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test). We conclude that the gD2 mRNA-LNP vaccine provided outstanding protection against clin-ical disease at 1 g; however, breakthrough subclinical infections occurred when the vac-cine dose was 0.3 g. Only the epitope-specific antibody responses offered a preview that 1 g was likely sufficient, enabling the inclusion of higher doses of the other immunogens in the vaccine, if needed.

Discussion We included equal concentrations of each mRNA in the gC2, gD2, and gE2 trivalent vaccine in our prior mRNA vaccine publications and the current study to define the max-imum tolerated dose [4-7]. The vaccine efficacy could possibly be improved by using lower doses of one antigen and higher doses of another rather than equal doses of each antigen. The Merck nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil 9) is an exam-ple of a multivalent vaccine that incorporates different doses of protein antigens in the vaccine ranging from 20 g to 60 g [20]. We used the murine mouse model of genital herpes to determine if epitope mapping provides useful information beyond IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers during the dose escalation phase of a trial to select immunogen doses for a multivalent vaccine. We evaluated serum IgG binding assays over a 33-fold range of gD2 mRNA-LNP doses. Two immunizations were more immunogenic than one, supporting the value of IgG ELISA in selecting the dosing frequency. However, IgG ELISA was less valuable for de-ciding the dose per administration to include in the trivalent vaccine. A plateau in ELISA titers did not occur to guide the decision. Instead, antibody titers increased at higher doses with a significantly higher gD2 IgG ELISA titers at 10 g than at 0.3 g. We detected a similar dose-response pattern for neutralizing antibody titers. Toxicity studies suggested a maximum tolerated dose of 10 g for all three mRNA-LNP immunogens. The ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers provided no clues that less than one-third of that total dose was needed for gD2 mRNA-LNP. We used high throughput biosensor technology to evaluate antibody responses to crucial gD2 epitopes. We made four important observations. First, antibody responses to Figure 5.Vaccine efcacy in mice immunized with gD2 mRNA-LNP. (a) Survival curves:p< 0.0001comparing the Poly(C) RNA group with all other groups.

All animals in the Poly(C) group had HSV-2 isolated fromvaginal swabs on days two and four post-infection (Figure5d,e). Only two of forty (5%)animals immunized with gD2 mRNA had positive vaginal virus cultures on day two andone of the same animals (2.5%) had a positive vaginal culture on day four (Figure5d,e).Both animals with positive vaginal virus cultures were in the 0.3-\u00b5g group (Figure5d,e).Six of seven animals in the Poly(C) group had HSV-2 DNA detected in DRG at the time ofhumane euthanasia 8-14 days post-infection (Figure5f). Only one of animalsimmunized with gD2 mRNA was positive for HSV-2 DNA in DRG obtained at the endof the experiment (Figure5f). This animal was different from the two that had positivevaginal virus cultures on days two or four and was also in the 0.3-\u00b5g group. Overall, threeof ten (30%) mice in the 0.3-\u00b5g group had evidence of subclinical infection compared to0/30 (0%) at higher doses (p= test). We conclude thatthe gD2 mRNA-LNP vaccine provided outstanding protection against clinical disease at1\u00b5g; however, breakthrough subclinical infections occurred when the vaccine dose was0.3\u00b5g. Only the epitope-specic antibody responses offered a preview that 1\u00b5g was likelysufcient, enabling the inclusion of higher doses of the other immunogens in the vaccine,if needed.4. DiscussionWe included equal concentrations mRNA in gC2, gD2, and gE2 trivalentvaccine in our prior mRNA vaccine publications and the current study to dene themaximum tolerated dose [4-7]. The vaccine efcacy could possibly be improved by usinglower doses of one antigen and higher doses of another rather than equal doses of eachantigen. The Merck nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil\u00ae9) is an exampleof a multivalent vaccine that incorporates different doses of protein antigens in the vaccineranging from 20\u00b5g to 60\u00b5g[20].We used the murine mouse model of genital herpes to determine if epitope mappingprovides useful information beyond IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers duringthe dose escalation phase of a trial to select immunogen doses for a multivalent vaccine.We evaluated serum doses.Two immunizations were more immunogenic than one, supporting the value of IgG ELISAin selecting the dosing frequency. However, IgG ELISA was less valuable for decidingthe dose per administration to include in the trivalent vaccine. A plateau in ELISA titersdid not occur to guide the decision. Instead, antibody titers increased at higher doseswith a signicantly higher gD2 IgG asimilar dose-response pattern for neutralizing antibody titers. Toxicity studies suggested amaximum tolerated dose of 10\u00b5g for all three mRNA-LNP immunogens. The ELISA andneutralizing antibody titers provided no clues that less than one-third of that total dosewas needed for gD2 mRNA-LNP.We used high throughput biosensor technology to evaluate antibody responses tocrucial gD2 epitopes. We made four important observations. First, antibody tocrucial gD2 epitopes plateaued at doses\u00001\u00b5g, suggesting little benet of higherdoses, distinguishing the epitope responses from ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers.Second, antibody responses to some gD2 epitopes were lower at 10\u00b5g than 1\u00b5g, indicatingthat using too high a dose may be detrimental from both an immunology and toxicityperspective. Third, combining antibody responses to all six crucial epitopes provided aclearer cutoff for the effective gD2 mRNA dose than analyzing individual epitopes. Fourth,the antibody responses to all six epitopes matched the results of the HSV-2 challenge studiesin that antibody titers were lowest in the 0.3-\u00b5g group and this was the only group withbreakthrough infections, while the 1-\u00b5g dose was as protective as the 3- or 10-\u00b5g doses.The study has certain limitations. First, the number of breakthrough infections wassmall, with only 3 animals developing infection. Immunizing mice with gD2 mRNAat doses lower than 0.3\u00b5g may yield more breakthrough infections and improve ourcondence in the value of epitope mapping to predict vaccine efcacy. Nevertheless,Viruses2022,14, 54011 of 12differences in breakthrough infections were statistically signicant when comparing 0.3\u00b5gwith higher doses. Second, we evaluated sera for antibodies to gD2 epitopes at a singledilution of 1:50. Results may vary if sera were tested at multiple dilutions. We think thisoutcome is unlikely because almost all animals produced antibodies within the dynamicrange of the assay, with few animals having no antibody response or producing antibodytiters at the upper limit of detection.Subsequent studies will evaluate the optimal dose of gC2 and gE2 mRNA-LNP toinclude in the trivalent vaccine based on the same principles explored here for gD2 mRNA-LNP. We conclude that epitope mapping adds a valuable new tool to more traditionalimmunology assays for deciding the dose of each mRNA immunogen to include in amultivalent vaccine during a phase 1 dose escalation study.Author Contributions:Conceptualization, and H.M.F.; funding acquisition, D.W.,G.H.C., and H.M.F.
