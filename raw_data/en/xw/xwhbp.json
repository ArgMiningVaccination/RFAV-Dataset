I found the flotation tanks to be incredibly meditative, and the effect it has on your body lasts throughout the day. The place is very clean and they have a very regimented cleaning process. The salt cave is also very relaxing and it has a positive effect on the breathing. This place is an oasis in the middle of Bay Ridge.\" \"Come to a pristine spa for some much-needed self-care! J9 has designed a one of a kind experience that refreshes and renews me every time I go! Each service I've tried so far has been uniquely wonderful. From the sauna to salt cave and float tank, I've been impressed with how deeply relaxing it is to step away from the world, turn inward, and recharge. Highly recommend!\" \"Beautiful space, so peaceful. My first float and it won't be my last. What an incredible experience! Clean and serene and calming. We also tried the salt cave and it immediately helped my sinuses. Definitely going back!\" \"Every time I go for a healing session here, I feel like I am a completely new person. The place is very clean and has a welcoming atmosphere.\" \"Body Mind Salt was definitely something Bay Ridge desperately needed in the neighborhood. Let me just say once I heard there was a salt cave in the neighborhood I was extremely excited to try it and I did and was one of the best things I've done for myself. I've been trying to kick the nasty habit of cigarettes for years now after many failed attempts. Now after going to the salt cave once a week I haven't had a cigarette nor do I have the urge to after 12 days now which I've never done I'm trying to quit. My runs are a lot better, breathing, and sleep. If you're looking to change your health for the better, I highly recommend coming to Body Mind Salt to assist you in living a healthy life, you won't regret it.\" \"This wellness center is like a dream! Like other reviewers mentioned, it is VERY clean and you can feel the positive energy the second you walk in the door. Perhaps it has something to do with the crystals :) I was booked for a session in the salt cave and the float tank. I could have fallen asleep in either of them because they were both very comforting and QUIET (hard to believe I was in Bay Ridge)... apparently the walls were insulated for sound when being built, which is very thoughtful. It was my first time in a float tank and the owner, J9, was kind enough to explain everything about it to me and made me feel very comfortable. When I was finished, there was a hot cup of organic tea waiting for me. I mean, talk about being taken care of. By the time I left, I was GLOWING - literally. It is a beautiful space built from beautiful intentions. What an amazing addition to the area. I highly, highly recommend it and cannot wait to go back!\" \"Kismet is the first word that comes to mind when I remember seeing Divine J9 outside her place... I asked her \"what is this going to be?\" To which she responded with a slew of health and wellness services coming to our Bay Ridge! So far I have done the float tank and the Shamanic Energy Healing. From the moment you step into this sanctuary, you feel engulfed in love, light, and tranquility. I bought my boyfriend and I float sessions because I felt it would be a nice way to begin his new trip around the sun. The tank room was very serene, the water was the perfect temperature. Perfect thing to do if you are in need of solace. The Shamanic energy healing session was a graduation gift from my BF. For the last few months, I had been feeling a blockage in my energy field that was preventing me from reaching my highest potential. J9 helped me to clear the blocks in a way I didn't know was possible. The session was very personal and so I won't dive into the specifics, but I do have to say that if you are looking to balance your energy field, and are in need of some zen in your life, a shamanic healing is for you. I am so thankful for this establishment and for J9 as I have woken up with a smile every day since my healing. I definitely recommend this spa to anyone who is looking for peace within themselves. Scheduling is super simple, prices are adequately appointed, the staff are wonderful and the spa is pristine. I can't wait for my next visit!\" \"Super relaxing! Clean, state-of-the-art spa. I especially loved the float and salt cave. It's a brilliant escape from reality! Absolutely recommend!\" \"Great local business, infrared sauna & float tanks are great here! Price is about right. Relaxing authentic spa experience. Extremely clean!\" Salt cave halotherapy, or dry salt therapy, is a holistic, drug-free, natural treatment using microparticles of salt to promote better breathing, sounder sleep, improved physical fitness and endurance, and overall wellness. Dry salt therapy can also help alleviate symptoms of many respiratory and skin conditions, including allergies, colds, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), smoker's cough, acne, and psoriasis. Experience the therapeutic effects of dry salt halotherapy in a relaxing zero gravity chair with the added bonus of sound therapy to soothe your soul! \"The sensory deprivation chamber has been the most important tool that I've ever used for developing my mind, for thinking, for evolving.\" \"With the Epsom salts and magnesium that are in [float] tanks, they're helpful with recovery and relaxing your muscles... also, it's one of the only places where you can really get unplugged from all the noise and distractions that go on with daily life.\" \"We had a Zen master who visited my lab once, and he asked to go in the tank for an hour. Most of his life he had meditated every day for four or five hours or more. And he thought the depth of meditation he reached in the tank was on par with a level he reached maybe once a year in his normal meditation environment\u2014which was not exactly the middle of Times Square. He was amazed.\" \"If I could give 6 stars I would! The staff is super friendly and provides nothing but the best for customers. Definitely will be coming here again for the float tanks!\" Ready for the ultimate staycation? Drift off to a galaxy far, far away floating in more than 1,000 lbs. of silky smooth medical-grade Epsom salts under a starry night with soothing meditation music. Or, feel free to turn off the lights and music to experience true sensory deprivation. What a treat in today's overstimulating world! Either way, this relaxing, zero-gravity environment helps relieve stress on the body, mind, and soul. Aids muscle recovery. Benefits also include deeper meditation, improved focus, and creativity. Pregnant moms-to-be, especially those in their last trimester, love the relief that floating provides. \"Body Mind Salt is a hidden gem and Divine J9 is amazing. From the moment I spoke with her on the phone, I knew I had to book my first chakra cleansing appointment with Divine J9. She is very professional, nurturing and friendly. I am glad that I booked a session today, her cleansing technique had an immediate effect. I will definitely be a returning customer.\" \"If you want to try Reiki for migraines or trauma healing, I cannot recommend this place enough. I went for a 90 minute Reiki session and sound bath. There are no words for what I experienced. I did my first session after a friend said it was the only thing that worked for curing her migraines. That sounded dramatic to me. I was not only getting migraines, but I was diagnosed with a neurological condition last year that affects my vision because of the migraines and it's been a challenging year. I've also been unable to take a full breath for over a year. I felt a tight knot in my diaphragm FOR. OVER. A. YEAR. I've tried a lot of medication, physical therapy for tissue massages, a chiropractor to align my brain stem, and I spent a lot of money. I took my friend's advice and figured I had nothing to lose by finding a Reiki healer. I figured, the worse that could happen is I spend a lot of money to feel relaxed. But after my reiki session, I CAN BREATH. FULL, DEEP AMAZING BREATHS. I couldn't even yawn before. I don't mean I got relaxed enough to take a deep breath, something actually happened to me that changed me physically. I can't explain it. The night after my session, I wrote some letters the way she instructed me to and while I was writing the negative stuff, I felt pressure increasing in my head. As I got to the positive, I could feel the pressure lifting. I cannot explain how bizarre this is, as someone whose migraines debilitate me. I do a lot of journaling, so it wasn't just my writing. It was the entire process clearing my body in this really odd way that I can't explain. I haven't had a migraine since. Afterwards I meditated and had a literal yawning attack. I would also get head pressure anytime I worked out and it is gone. My workout feels incredible because I can breath deeply and my sleep has been deep, restful sleep. It's been a week and I'll see how this evolves, but this week I have been SO hopeful and so grateful for the relief. I feel like I understand my part in my illness differently. I wanted to believe Reiki could work, but I didn't believe it would be as impactful as it's been. I don't know how it works, or what exactly happened and I don't even care. She never claimed she could cure anything, she just did her work and I could not be more grateful. I wish insurance recognized alternative therapies because I've spent a lot of their (and my own) money trying to get this under control. So incredibly thankful.\" \"Thank you for saving my life, you are the best healer. And you helped me remove the negative entity away from my life... thank you I appreciate it.\" Get to the root cause of an issue.

After reading about the benefits of infrared saunas online, I was pleasantly surprised to see there was a place in Bay Ridge offering such services. The space is so clean (pristine even) and inviting. I was provided with clean towels and offered water before and after the sauna. Not only was the experience great, but I actually got the time of my appointment slightly wrong and the owner was able to accommodate me anyway. Looking forward to being a monthly member!\" \"Great local business, infrared sauna & float tanks are great here! Price is about right. Relaxing authentic spa experience. Extremely clean!\" \"I'm a long-time believer of infrared sauna therapy for natural healing and prevention. I own a Sunlighten sauna and use it regularly to maximize health benefits. I highly recommend Sunlighten infrared saunas because of the research on their proprietary infrared heaters.\" \"Sweating is one of the best ways to detox your body. Every time we sweat, we're flushing out the toxic substances and heavy metals that we encounter in everyday life. Infrared sauna therapy promotes this process... by heating your body from the inside to expel them from deep down.\" \"There is a mountain of evidence on infrared sauna use showing that it is as foundational as diet and exercise. Sauna use is a miracle practice. I love it. I use it. I benefit from it.\" \"This is actually the first year I didn't miss any games... and my recovery program [including IR sauna] is a huge part of that.\" \"If you analyze the peer-reviewed data, full-spectrum infrared sauna therapy would be a multibillion drug if it came in a pill. The ability to heal endothelium and improve symptoms and prognosis for congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease is remarkable. Sunlighten saunas are the only infrared saunas clinically shown to temporarily lower blood pressure and reduce belly fat, both contributing factors to a healthy heart.\" \"I love the Sunlighten 3 in 1 technology. It helps me with relaxation, helps me with inflammation, it's great for building collagen. I walk out of the sauna, and I feel rejuvenated. If you want to look good, it's all about feeling good.\" \"Infrared sauna therapy promotes relaxation by helping to balance your body's level of cortisol, your body's primary stress hormone.

I know it sounds a bit dramatic but when my life starts going haywire, this place gets me back on track.
