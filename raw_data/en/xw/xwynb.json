However, physical examination and ultrasound can rapidly identify patients requiring emergent laparotomy. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the mainstay of evaluation in the remaining patients to more precisely identify the site and magnitude of injury. - Manifestation of the \"bloody vicious cycle\" (the lethal combination of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis) is the most common indication for damage control surgery. The primary objectives of damage control laparotomy are to control bleeding and limit GI spillage. - Blunt injuries to the carotid and vertebral arteries are usually managed with systemic antithrombotic therapy. - The abdominal compartment syndrome may be primary (i.e., due to the injury of abdominal organs, bleeding, and packing) or secondary (i.e., due to reperfusion visceral edema, retroperitoneal edema, and ascites). [+] [+] Trauma, or injury, is defined as cellular disruption caused by an exchange with environmental energy that is beyond the body's resilience which is compounded by cell death due to ischemia/reperfusion. Trauma remains the most common cause of death for all individuals between the ages of 1 and 44 years and is the third most common cause of death regardless of age. [1](#bru_ch7rf1) It is also the leading cause of years of productive life lost. Unintentional injuries account for over 110,000 deaths per year, with motor vehicle collisions accounting for over 40%. Homicides, suicides, and other causes are responsible for another 50,000 deaths each year. However, death rate underestimates the magnitude of the societal toll. For example, in 2004 there were approximately 167,000 injury-related deaths, but 29.6 million injured patients treated in emergency departments (EDs). Injury-related medical expenditures are estimated to be $117 billion each year in the United States. [2](#bru_ch7rf2) "}
