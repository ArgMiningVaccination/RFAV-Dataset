{"title": "March 2009 - DC's Improbable Science", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": "DC's Improbable Science", "date": "2009-03-30", "cleaned_text": "Monthly Archives: March 2009 In March 2007 I wrote a piece in Nature on [Science degrees without the science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19). At that time there were five \"BSc\" degrees in homeopathy. A couple of weeks ago I checked the UCAS site for start in 2009, and found there was only one full \"BSc (hons)\" left and that was at Westminster University. Today I checked again and NOW THERE ARE NONE. A phone call to the University of Westminster tonight confirmed that they have suspended entry to their BSc (Hons) homeopathy degree. They say that they have done so because of \"poor recruitment\". It was a purely financial decision. Nothing to do with embarrasment. Gratifying though it is that recruits for the course are vanishing, that statement is actually pretty appalling It says that the University of Westminster doesn't care whether it's nonsense, but only about whether it makes money. Nevertheless the first part of this post is not entirely outdated before it even appeared, because homeopathy will still be taught as part of [Complementary Therapies. And Naturopathy and \"Nutritional Therapy\" are still there.](http://www.wmin.ac.uk/Default.aspx?page=3135). According to their ' [School of Integrated Health](http://dcscience.net/cam-courses.pdf)', \"The University of Westminster has a vision of health care for the 21st Century\". Yes, but it is what most people would call a vision of health care in the 18th century. The revelation that the University of Westminster teaches that [Amethysts emit high Yin energy](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) caused something of a scandal. Since then I have acquired from several sources quite a lot more of their teaching material, despite the fact that the university has refused to comply with the Freedom of Information Act. In view of the [ rather silly internal review ](http://dcscience.net/?p=984#wmin)conducted by Westminster's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, this seems like a good moment to make a bit more of it public, I think that revelation of the material is justified because it is in the public interest to know how the University if Westminster is spending taxpayers' money. Another motive is to defend the reputation of the post-1992 universities. I have every sympathy with the ex-polytechnics in their efforts to convert themselves into universities. In many ways they have succeeded. That effort is impeded by teaching mystical versions of medicine. If the University of Westminster is being brought into disrepute, blame its vice-chancellor, not me. Homeopathic spiders Here are a few slides from a lecture on how good spider venom is for you. It is from Course 3CTH502 Homeopathic Materia Medica II. No need to worry though, because they are talking about homeopathic spider venom, so there is nothing but sugar in the pills. The involvement of spiders is pure imagination. No more than mystical gobbledygook. You are in hurry, or play with your fingers? You need spider venom pills (that contain no spider venom). You break furniture? Time goes too fast for you? Try the tarantula-free tarantula pills. You are preoccupied with sex? You play with ropes? What you need is Mygale (which contains no Mygale) Much more seriously, the same sugar pills are recommended for serious conditions, chorea, 'dim sight', gonorrhoea, syphilis and burning hot urine. This isn't just preposterous made-up stuff. It is dangerous. There is a whole lot more fantasy stuff in the handouts for Homeopathy Materia Medica II (3CTH502). Here are a couple of examples. Aurum metallicum (metallic gold) [ [Download the whole handout]] Affinities MIND, VASCULAR SYSTEM, Nerves, Heart, Bones, Glands, Liver, Kidneys, RIGHT SIDE, Left side. Causations Emotions. Ailments from disappointed love and grief, offence or unusual responsibility, abuse of mercury or allopathic drugs. Aurum belongs to the syphilitic miasm but has elements of sycosis (Aur-Mur). Potassium salts are the subject of some fine fantasy, in \"The Kali's\" [sic]. (there is much more serious stuff to worry about here than a few misplaced apostrophes.). [ [Download the whole handout](http://dcscience.net/Kali's.pdf)] \"The radioactive element of potassium emits negative electrons from the atom nucleus and is thought to be significant in the sphere of cell processes especially in relation to functions relating to automatism and rhythmicity.\" \"Kali people are very conscientious with strong principles. They have their rules and they stick to them, 'a man of his word'.\" \"Potassium acts in a parasympathetic tending towards [\"Kali people=] are not melancholic like the Natrum's but rather optimistic.\" Radioactive potassium is involved in automaticity? Total nonsense. Where is the science? Yes, it is true that the students get a bit of real science. There isn't the slightest trace that I can find of any attempt to resolve the obvious fact that what they are taught in the science bits contradict directly what they are told in the other bits. Sounds like a recipe for stress to me. They even get a bit of incredibly elementary statistics. But they can't even get that right. This slide is from PPP - Res Quant data analysis. \"Involves parameters and/or distributions\". This has no useful meaning whatsoever, that I can detect. \"Tests hypotheses when population distributions are skewed\". Well yes, though nothing there about forms of non-Gaussian properties other than skew, nothing about normalising transformations, and nothing about the Central Limit theorem. \"Ranks data rather than the actual data itself\". This is plain wrong. Randomisation tests on the original data are generally the best (uniformly most powerful) sort of non-parametric test. It seems to have escaped the attention of the tutor that ranking is a short-cut approximation that allowed tables to be constructed, before we had computers. The students are told about randomised controlled trials. But amazingly in the lecture PPP-RCTs, the little matter of blinding is barely mantioned. And the teacher's ideas about randomisation are a bit odd too. Sorry, but if you fiddle the randomisation, no amount of \"careful scrutiny\" will rescue you from bias. An Introduction to Naturopathic Philosophy Naturopathy is just about as barmy as homeopathy. You can see something about it at the [University of Wales](http://dcscience.net/?p=259). How about this slide from Westminster's An Introduction to Naturopathic Philosophy. So if you get tuberculosis, it isn't caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis? And the symptoms are \"constructive\"? So you don;t need to do anything. It's all for the best really. This isn't just nonsense. It's dangerous nonsense. Traditional Chinese Medicine Ever wondered what the mysterious \"Qi\" is? Worry no more. All is explained on this slide. It means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism. Or perhaps prana? Is that quite clear now? What can we make of this one? Anyone can see that the description is barely written in English and that vital information is missing (such as the age of the woman). And it's nonsense to suggest that \"invasion of cold\" (during keyhole surgery!) would cause prolonged constriction of blood vessels (never mind that it would \"consume yang qi\"). Not being a clinician, I showed it to an oncologist friend. He said that it was impossible to tell from the description whether the problem was serious or not, but that any abdominal pain should be investigated properly. There isn't anything here about referral for proper investigation. Just a lot of stuff about ginger and cinnamon. Anyone who was taught in this way could be a real danger to the public. It isn't harmless nonsense It's potentially harmful nonsense. And finally, it's DETOX Surely everyone knows by now that 'detox' is no more than a marketing word? Well not at the University of Westminster. They have a long handout that tells you all the usual myths and a few new ones. It is written by Jennifer Harper-Deacon, who describes herself modestly, thus. Jennifer Harper-Deacon is a qualified and registered Naturopath and acupuncturist who holds a PhD in Natural Health and MSc in Complementary Therapies. She is a gifted healer and Reiki Master who runs her own clinic in Surrey where she believes in treating the 'whole' person by using a combination of Chinese medicine and naturopathic techniques that she has qualified in, including nutritional medicine, Chinese and Western herbalism, homoeopathy, applied kinesiology, reflexology, therapeutic massage, aromatherapy and flower remedies. It seems that there is no limit on the number of (mutually incompatible) forms of nuttiness that she believes. Here are a few quotations from her handout for Westminster students. \"Detoxification is the single most powerful tool used by natural health professionals to prevent and reverse disease\" go on to a raw food only diet, especially fruit, the stored toxins are brought up from the deep organs such as the liver and kidneys, to the superficial systems of elimination.\"; Very odd. I always though that kidneys were a system of elimination. \"The over-use and mis-use of antibiotics has weakened the body's ability to attack and destroy new strains of resistant bacteria, virulent viruses, which have led to our immune system becoming compromised.\" Certainly over-use and mis-use are problems. But I always thought it was the bacteria that became resistant. \"The beauty about detoxification therapy is that it addresses the very causative issues of health problems\" That is another dangerous and silly myth. Tuberculosis is not caused by mythical and un-named \"toxins\". It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \"Naturopathy follows the logic of cause and effect therefore believes that we simply need pure food and water, sunshine, air, adequate rest and sleep coupled with the right amount of exercise for health.\" Try telling that to someone with AIDS. \"Colon cleansing is one of the most important parts of any detoxification programme.\" The strange obsession with enemas in the alternative world is always baffling. \"Frankincense: holds the capacity to physically strengthen our defence system and can rebuild energy levels when our immune system is weak. Revered as a herb of protection, frankincense can also strengthen our spiritual defences when our Wei qi is low, making us more susceptible to negative energies. This calming oil has the ability to deepen the breath, helping us to let go of stale air and emotions, making it ideal oil to use inhale prior to meditating.\" This is so much hot air. There is a bit of evidence that frankincense [might have some anti-inflammatory action](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/dec17_2/a2813) and that's it. But this has to be my favourite. \"Remember when shopping to favour fruits and vegetables which are in season and locally grown (and ideally organic) as they are more vibrationally compatible with the body.\" Locally grown vegetables are \"more vibrationally compatible with the body\"? Pure mystical gobbledygook. Words fail me. OK there's a whole lot more, but that will do for now. It's good that Westminster is shutting down its Homeopathy BSc, but it seems they have a bit further to go. The [Health Professions Council](http://www.hpc-uk.org/) (HPC) is yet another regulatory quango. strapline is | At present [the HPC regulates](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/); Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists, radiographers and speech & language therapists. These are thirteen very respectable jobs. With the possible exception of art therapists, nobody would doubt for a moment that they are scientific jobs, based on evidence. Dietitians, for example, are the real experts on nutrition (in contrast to \"nutritional therapists\" and the like, who are part of the alternative industry). That is just as well because the ten criteria for registration with the HPC say that aspirant groups must have \"Practise based on evidence of efficacy\" But then came the Pittilo report, about which I wrote a [commentary in the Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece), and here, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://dcscience.net/?p=235), and [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=251). Both the Pittilo report, the HPC, and indeed the Department of Health itself (watch this space), seem quite unable to grasp the obvious fact that you cannot come up with any sensible form of regulation until after you have decided whether the 'therapy' works or whether it is so much nonsense. In no sense can \"the public be protected\" by setting educational standards for nonsense. But this obvioua fact seems to be beyond the intellectual grasp of the quangoid box-ticking mentality. That report recommended that the HPC should regulate also Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners. Even more absurdly, it recommended degrees in these subjects, just at the moment that those universities who run them are beginning to realise that they are anti-scientific subjects and closing down degrees in them. How could these three branches of the alternative medicine industry possibly be eligible to register with the HPC when one of the criteria for registration is that there must be \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\"? Impossible, I hear you say. But if you said that, I fear you may have underestimated the capacity of the official mind for pure double-speak. The HPC published a report on 11 September 2008, [Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf). The report says 1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons. 2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions. 3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest. But the last conclusion contradicts directly the requirement for \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\". I was curious about how this contradiction could be resolved so I sent a list of questions. The [full letter is here](/dc-to-hpc 5 Dec 2008.pdf). The letter was addressed to the president of the HPC, Anna van der Gaag, but with the customary discourtesy of such organisations, it was not answered by her but by Michael Guthrie, Head of Policy and Standards He said \"Our Council considered the report at its meeting in July 2008 and decided that the regulation of these groups was necessary on the grounds of public protection. The Council decided to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Health that these groups be regulated. [\".] http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf This, of course, doesn't answer any of my questions. It does not explain how the public is protected by insisting on formal qualifications, if the qualifications happen to teach mythical nonsense. Later the reply got into deeper water. \"I would additionally add that the new professions criteria are more focused on the process and structures of regulation, rather than the underlying rationale for regulation - the protection of members of the public. The Council considered the group's report in light of a scoring against the criteria. The criteria on efficacy was one that was scored part met. As you have outlined in your email (and as discussed in the report itself) the evidence of efficacy (at least to western standards) is limited overall, particularly in the areas of herbal medicines and traditional Chinese medicine. However, the evidence base is growing and there was a recognition in the report that the individualised approach to practice in these areas did not lend themselves to traditional RCT research designs.\" Yes, based on process and structures (without engaging the brain it seems). Rather reminiscent of the great scandal in UK Social Services. It is right in one respect though. The evidence base is indeed growing, But it is almost all negative evidence. Does the HPC not realise that? And what about \"at least by Western standards\"? Surely the HPC is not suggesting that UK health policy should be determined by the standards of evidence of Chinese herbalists? Actually it is doing exactly that since its assessment of evidence was based on the [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/?p=235) in which the evidence was assessed (very badly) by herbalists. One despairs too about the statement that \"there was a recognition in the report that the individualised approach to practice in these areas did not lend themselves to traditional RCT research designs\" Yes of course the [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/?p=235) said that, because it was written by herbalists! Had the HPC bothered to read Ben Goldacre's column in the Guardian they would have realised that there is no barrier at all to doing proper tests. It isn't rocket science, though it seems that it is beyond the comprehension of the HPC. So I [followed the link](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf) to try again to find out why the HPC had reached the decision to breach its own rules. Page 10 of the HPC Council report says 3. The occupation must practise based on evidence of efficacy This criterion covers how a profession practises. The Council recognizes the centrality of evidence-based practice to modern health care and will assess applicant occupations for evidence that demonstrates that: - Their practice is subject to research into its effectiveness. Suitable evidence would include publication in journals that are accepted as learned by the health sciences and/or social care communities - There is an established scientific and measurable basis for measuring outcomes of their practice. This is a minimum\u2014the Council welcomes evidence of there being a scientific basis for other aspects of practice and the body of knowledge of an applicant occupation - It subscribes to the ethos of evidence-based practice, including being open to changing treatment strategies when the evidence is in favour of doing so. So that sounds fine. Except that research is rarely published in \"journals that are accepted as learned by the health sciences\". And of course most of the good evidence is negative anyway. Nobody with the slightest knowledge of the literature could possibly think that these criteria are satisfied by Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners. So what does the HPC make of the evidence? Appendix 2 tells us. It goes through the criteria for HPS registration. \"Defined body of knowledge: There is a defined body of knowledge, although approaches to practice can vary within each area.\" There is no mention that the \"body of knowledge\" is, in many cases, nonsensical gobbledygook and, astonishingly this criterion was deemed to be \"met\"!. This shows once again the sheer silliness of trying to apply a list of criteria without first judging whether the subject is based in reality, Evidence of efficacy. There is limited widely accepted evidence of efficacy, although this could be partly explained by the nature of the professions in offering bespoke treatments to individual patients. This criterion is scored part met overall. Sadly we are not told who deemed this criterion to be \"part met\". But it does say that \"This scoring has been undertaken based on the information outlined in the [Pittilo] report\". Since the assessment of evidence in that report was execrably bad (having been made by people who would lose their jobs if they said anything negative). it is no wonder that the judgement is overoptimistic! Did the HPC not notice the quality of the evidence presented in the Pittilo report? Apparently not. That is sheer incompetence. Nevertheless the criterion was not \"met\", so they can't join HPC, right? Not at all. The Council simply decided to ignore its own rules. On page 5 of the Council's report we see this. The Steering Group [Pittilo] argues that a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base (p.11, p. 32, p.34). This question can be a controversial area and the evidence base of these professions was the focus of some press attention following the report's publication. An often raised argument against regulation in such circumstances is that it would give credibility in the public's eyes to treatments that are not proven to be safe or efficacious. This second point is dead right, but it is ignored. The Council then goes on to say In terms of the HPC's existing processes, a lack of 'accepted' evidence of efficacy is not a barrier to producing standards of proficiency or making decisions about fitness to practise cases. This strikes me as ludicrous, incompetent, and at heart, dishonest. There will be no sense in policy in this area until the question of efficacy is referred to NICE. Why didn't the HPC recommend that? Why has it not been done? One possible reason is that I discovered recently that, although there are two scientific advisers in the Department of Health,. both of them claim that it is \"not their role\" to give scientific advice in this area. So the questions get referred instead to the Prince of Wales Foundation. That is no way to run a ship. The fact of the matter is that the HPC, like so many other regulatory agencies, fails utterly to protect the public from fraudulent and incompetent practitioners. In fact it actually protects them, in the same way that the [financial 'regulators' protected fraudulent bankers](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/opinion/19krugman.html?_r=1&em). They all seem to think that ticking boxes and passing exams is an effective process. Even if the exams require you to memorise that [amethysts \"emit high Yin energy](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbance as all levels "}
