[What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. This supplement has been used in connection with the following health conditions: |Used for||Why| | | 2 Stars Anxiety Refer to label instructions | | In a double-blind trial, a proprietary lavender oil preparation (silexan) provided significant symptom relief to people with generalized anxiety disorder. In a double-blind trial, individuals with anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder) received 80 mg per day of a proprietary lavender oil preparation (silexan, 80 mg once a day) or a low dose of an anti-anxiety drug (lorazepam, 0.5 mg once a day) for 6 weeks. Significant improvement was seen in both groups, and the degree of improvement was similar in both treatment groups. In another double-blind trial, Silexan also improved anxiety in people who were suffering from a combination of anxiety and depression. | | 2 Stars Insomnia Refer to label instructions | | Lavender oil's aroma is known to be calming and may be helpful in some cases of insomnia. The volatile oil of contains many medicinal components, including perillyl alcohol, linalool, and geraniol. The oil's aroma is known to be calming and thus may be helpful in some cases of insomnia. One study of elderly people with sleeping troubles found that inhaling lavender oil was as effective as some commonly prescribed sleep medications. Similar results were seen in another trial that included young and middle aged people with insomnia. Teas made from lavender flowers or from the oil (1 to 4 drops) are approved for internal use by the German Commission E for people with insomnia. Internal use of essential oils can be dangerous and should be done only with the supervision of a trained herbalist or healthcare professional. | | 2 Stars Perineal Pain after Childbirth Add several drops to a bath | | In one study, adding lavender oil to a bath helped relieve perineal pain after childbirth. In one study, the addition of oil to a bath was more effective than a placebo in relieving perineal pain after childbirth (the perineum is the area between the vulva and the anus.) The improvement was not statistically significant, however, so more research is needed to determine whether lavender oil is truly effective. | | 1 Star Indigestion, Heartburn, and Low Stomach Acidity Refer to label instructions | | Lavender is a gas-relieving herb that may be helpful in calming an upset stomach. Carminatives (also called aromatic digestive tonics or aromatic bitters) may be used to relieve symptoms of indigestion, particularly when there is excessive gas. It is believed that carminative agents work, at least in part, by relieving spasms in the intestinal tract. There are numerous carminative herbs, including European angelica root (Angelica archangelica), Traditional Use (May Not Be Supported by Scientific Studies) Traditionally, herbalists used lavender for a variety of conditions of the nervous system, including [depression](/medical-topics/id/hn-1200006#hn-1200006-need-to-know) and fatigue.1 It has also been used for headache and rheumatism. Due to its delightful odor, lavender has found wide application in perfumes and cosmetics throughout history. [] How It Works How It Works The volatile oil (also called essential oil) of lavender contains many constituents, including perillyl alcohol and linalool. The oil is thought to be calming2 and thus can be helpful in some cases of [insomnia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1222004#hn-1222004-need-to-know). One study of elderly people with sleeping troubles found that inhaling lavender oil was as effective as some commonly prescribed sleep medications.3 Similar results were seen in another trial that included young and middle-aged people with insomnia.4 A large clinical trial found that lavender oil added to a bath was no more effective than a placebo for relieving perineal discomfort immediately after childbirth.5 However, perineal pain was reduced three to five days afterward. Lavender is recommended by the German Commission E monograph for indigestion and nervous intestinal discomfort.6 How to Use It The German Commission E monograph suggests 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 grams) of the herb be taken as a tea.7 The tea can be made by steeping 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of leaves in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiling water for fifteen minutes. Three cups (750 ml) can be consumed each day. For internal applications, 1/2-3/4 teaspoon (2-4 ml) of tincture can be taken two or three times per day. Several drops of the oil can be added to a bath or diluted in vegetable oil for topical applications. The concentrated oil is not for internal use, except under medical supervision. [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Interactions with Medicines [] Side Effects Side Effects Internal use of the volatile oil can cause severe nausea. Very small amounts should be used only under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Excessive intake (several times more than the recommended amount) may cause drowsiness.8 External use in reasonable amounts is safe during [pregnancy](/medical-topics/id/hn-1251000#hn-1251000-need-to-know) and breast-feeding. In case reports, three young boys developed breast enlargement (gynecomastia) after repeated topical application of products that contained lavender oil and tea tree oil. The problem resolved after they stopped using the oils. While a cause-effect relationship was not conclusively proven, it was suggested by the fact that these oils have been found to have estrogen-like effects in test tube studies.9 [] Related Information [] References 1.
