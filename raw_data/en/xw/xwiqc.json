A study published last year in the International Journal of Cancer compared the diet of 362 women diagnosed with breast cancer with the diet of an equal number of cancer-free women. Among postmenopausal subjects, the researchers found that those women who regularly consumed mushrooms were 84% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than those who did not eat mushrooms regularly. (No difference was observed in premenopausal women.) While the exact mechanism responsible for the difference observed in the study has not been identified, ongoing research by Dr. Shiuan Chen out of the City of Hope in Duarte, California, suggests that mushrooms, specifically the button family, may be effective aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for converting a chemical produced by the adrenal glands in postmenopausal women to estrogen. Since three quarters of breast cancers are estrogen sensitive, blocking its production is believed to hinder the proliferation of these tumor cells. As impressive as the results of these studies are, the health benefits of mushrooms won't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with these unique edibles. While mushrooms have been slow to gain popularity in the U.S., they enjoy a long history as both food and medicine in many other parts of the world. Various species have been listed in Traditional Chinese Medicine texts for thousands of years, and mummified remains from the Tyrolean Alps indicate that Paleolithic Europeans used mushrooms as medicine as well. So what makes mushrooms so special? Well, first off, a mushroom is technically the fruit of a fungus, like an apple on an apple tree. Fungi are susceptible to many of the same diseases humans are susceptible to, and because of the many different substrates they grow in, they are constantly exposed to different bacteria and diseases. This constant exposure forces fungi to create defense systems in order to survive. It is precisely these defense systems that make mushrooms so beneficial to humans. Whereas mushrooms have been traditionally used to enhance the immune system, research is starting to back this practice up. Studies have focused on a group of polysaccharides known as beta-glucans, which appear to stimulate human immune cells (the cells responsible for identifying and destroying tumor cells) and are plentiful in most mushrooms. One beta-glucan in particular, lentinan, has received a lot of scientific attention lately. In addition to promoting the production and activity of immune cells, lentinan appears to stimulate the body's production of nitric oxide, which is used by the body not only to kill microbes and tumor cells but also encourages vasodilation, or relaxation, of the smooth muscles in blood vessel walls, which improves blood flow and delivery of oxygen to cells. Abundant in shiitake mushrooms, lentinan has also been credited with antitumor and antimicrobial activity and is currently approved in Japan for the treatment of cancer. It is worth noting that in most of the studies lentinan has been administered by injection, and this is the way it is currently being used in Japan as a cancer treatment. There is some question as to whether the body can absorb beta-glucans through the gastrointestinal tract, but considering the positive effects of oral administration of mushrooms reported throughout history, more research is needed to settle this debate. The benefits of mushrooms don't end with immune support and cancer protection. Many are used as adaptogens, compounds that exert a balancing effect on the adrenal glands. In Chinese medicine, mushrooms are often used as an overall tonic to balance and strengthen the body. Reishi, for example, is considered by many to be a supreme longevity tonic. And while nearly all mushrooms have a calming effect on the brain, reishi and oyster are often used specifically to soothe the nerves. Both reishi and shiitake mushrooms have a protective effect on the liver and are may aid in the removal of toxins from the body. Shiitake may also enhance libido, while maitake and reishi balance blood sugar. Maitake and shiitake have even been shown to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans\u2014which calls into question the recommendation that people on an anti-candida diet avoid all mushrooms. Perhaps the best part about mushrooms is that you need look no further than your own kitchen to harness their incredible power. In fact, incorporating mushrooms into your diet has never been easier. Many once-rare varieties are now commonly available in grocery stores and farmer markets, including shiitake, maitake, wood ear, and enoki. And of course there's the familiar button mushroom family, which includes white mushrooms, portabellas, and cremini. All are great choices for health, so find the ones that taste best to you, and get cooking! You can buy mushrooms fresh or dried and add them to soups, stir-fries, sauces, salads...just about anything. Because many of the beneficial compounds released from mushrooms end up in the liquid they are cooked in, a tea or broth is one of the best ways to enjoy the medicinal effects of mushrooms (particularly mushrooms that aren't appropriate for eating, such as reishi). To make a tea or broth from any mushroom, herbalist Christopher Hobbs recommends gently simmering the mushrooms in water for about an hour for maximum health benefit.
