The first dose is administered at 12 to 15 months of age. A second dose is administered at 4 to 6 years of age. The second dose may be administered prior to 4 years of age, provided that there is a minimum interval of one month betwe en the doses of measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccine, live {1-2}. Children who received an initial dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prior to their first birthday should receive additional doses of vaccine at 12 - 15 months of age and at 4 - 6 years of age to complete the vaccination series [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. For post - exposure prophylaxis for measles, admini ster a dose of M -M-R II vaccine within 72 hours after exposure . 2.2 Administration The sterile diluent for M-M-R II is provided in either a vial or prefilled syringe. Sterile Diluent Vial Use a sterile syring e free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection and/or reconstitution of the vaccine because these substan ces may inactivate the vaccine virus es. To reconstitute, use the sterile diluent vial supplied with M-M-R II. The sterile d iluent does not contain preservatives or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine viruses. To reconstitute the vaccine, w ithdraw the entire volume of the supplied sterile diluent from the vial and slowly i nject into the lyophilized vaccine vial. Gently a gitate to dissolve completely . Discard i f the lyophilized vaccine cannot be dissolved . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Visually inspect the vaccine before and after reconstitution prior to administration. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline plug . M-M-R II , when reconstituted, is a clear yellow liquid. Do not use the reconstituted va ccine if particulate s are present or if it appears discolored. Withdraw and administer the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine . Administer M-M-R II immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, the reconstituted vaccine may be stored between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), protected from light, for up to 8 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours . Sterile Diluent Prefilled S yringe To reconstitute, use the sterile diluent prefilled syringe supplied with the vaccine since it does not contain preservatives or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine viruses. Attach a needle to the prefilled syringe. Reconstitute the vaccine by slowly inject ing the entire volume of sterile diluent contained in the prefilled syringe into the lyophilized vaccine vial. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Discard if the lyophilized vaccine can not be dissolved. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Visually inspect the vaccine before and after reconstitution prior to adminis tration. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline plug . M-M-R II, when reconstituted, is a clear yellow liquid. Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if particulates are present or if it appears discolored . Withdr aw and administer the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine .3Administer M -M-R II immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, the reconstituted vaccine may be stored between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), protected from light, for up to 8 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS M-M-R II vaccine is a suspension for injection supplied as a single dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted using the accompanying sterile diluent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)] . A single dose after reconstitution is approximately 0.5 mL. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 4.1 Hypersensitivity Do not administer M-M-R II vaccine to individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (including gelatin ) {3} or who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction following administration of a previous dose of M-M-R II vaccine or any other measles, mumps and rubella -containing vaccine. Do not administer M-M-R II vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to neomycin [see Description (11)] . 4.2 Immunosuppression Do not administer M-M-R II vaccine to individuals who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or medical therapy. Measles inclusion body encephalitis {4} (MIBE), pneumonitis {5} and death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported in immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles -containing vaccine. In this population, disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection have also been reported. 4.3 Moderate or Severe Febrile Illness Do not administer M-M-R II vaccine to individuals with an active febrile illness with fever >101.3 \u00b0F (>38.5 \u00b0C). 4.4 Active Untreated Tuberculosis Do not administer M -M-R II vaccine to individuals with active untreated tuberculosis (TB) . 4.5 Pregnancy Do not administer M-M-R II to individuals who are pregnant or who are planning on becoming pregnant within the next month [s ee Use in Specific Populat ions (8.1) a nd Patient Counseling Infor mation (17)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Febrile Seizure There is a risk of fever and associated febrile seizure in the first 2 weeks following immunization with M-M-R II vaccine. For children who have experienced a previous febrile seizure (from any cause) and those with a family history of febrile seizures there is a small increase in risk of febrile seizure following receipt of M-M-R II vaccine [see Adverse Reactions (6 )]. 5.2 Hypersensitivity to Eggs Individuals with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at a n enhanced risk of immediate - type hypersensitivi ty reactions after receiving M-M-R II vaccine. The potential risks and known benefit s should be evaluated before considering vaccination in these individuals . 5.3 Thrombocytopenia Transient thrombocytopenia has been reported within 4-6 weeks following vaccination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Carefully evaluate the potential risk and benefit of vaccination in children with thrombocytopenia or in those who experienced thrombocytopen ia after vaccination with a previous dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine {6-8} [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 5.4 Family History of Immunodeficiency Vaccination should be deferred in individuals with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the individual's immune status has been evaluated and the individual has been found to be immunocompetent.45.5 Immune Globulins and Transfusions Immune Globulin s (IG) and other blood products should not be given concurrently with M-M-R II [see Drug Interaction s (7.2)] . These products may contain antibodies that interfere with vaccine virus replication and decrease the expected immune response. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) h as specific recommendations for intervals between administration of antibody containing products and live virus vaccines. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions include those identified during clinical trials or reported during post- approval use of M-M-R II vaccine or its individual components. Body as Panniculitis; vesiculation ). Special Senses \u2014 Ear Nerve deafness; otitis media. Senses \u2014 clinical trial (NCT 00432523 ), conducted in France and Germany, 752 children 12 months through 18 months of age received M -M-R II concomitantly administered with VARIVAX at a separate site, by either the intramuscular (n=374) or subcutaneous (n=378) route. In the overall population, 55.3% were male and the median age was 13.2 months. Local and systemic solici ted adverse reactions were recorded by parents or guardians using standardized diary cards. Local solicited reactions were recorded for 4 days after vaccination, and systemic solicited adverse reactions were recorded for 42 days after vaccination. In the event that a participant experienced a rash or a mumps -like illness, parents and/or guardians were instructed to contact the investigator for an examination as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours following onset of symptoms. The nature of any rash was characterized by principal investigator either as measles -like, rubella -like, varicella -like or \"other \". Study investigators reviewed the diary card with the participant or participant's legal guardian 42 days after vaccination to ensure consistency wit h protocol definitions. Table 1 below presents the frequency of solicited adverse reactions based on the final assessment by the study investigators. Table 1: Proportion of Participants Reporting Solicited Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination with M -M-R II, Concomitantly Administered with VARIVAX, by the Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Route5 N=total number of participants in the group * During the post vaccination monitoring period (0 - 42 days), 3 participants experienced a varicella - like injection - site rash at the M-M-R II injection site. All were reported in the subcutaneous group. Intensity of injection site reaction: mild or 2.5 cm; moderate or >2.5 to 5.0 cm; s evere or >5 .0 cm. Intensity of pain: mild: awareness of symptom but easily tolerated; moderate: definitely acting like something is wrong; severe: extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities.

Reports of meas les-, rubella -, and varicella - like rash included 3 reports of measles, 1 report of rubella, and 1 report of varicella, all with onset within 15 days post- vaccination. \u00b6 The percentage of fever is defined within the population who had valid temperature meas urements. One participant in IM group and two participants in SC group did not have temperature measurements and were excluded from the denominator; resulting in N=373 and N=374, respectively. # In the IM Group 92.3% of fevers were documented using the rectal route of measurement and 7.7% of fevers were documented only by the axillary route of measurement. In the SC Group 89.6% of fevers were documented using the rectal route of measurement and 10.4% of fevers were documented only by the axillary route o f measurement. Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 42 days following vaccination were recorded using diary cards supplemented by medical review. Data on unsolicited adverse events were transcribed into the study database during an on-site visit at day 42. The rates and types of reported adverse events (AEs) across groups were similar and included common clinical events that are often reported in the evaluated populations. Serious adverse events occurred at rates of 0.3% and 1% in the intramuscular and subcutaneous groups, respectively. One moderate intensity case of otitis media occurred in a participant in the subcutaneous group was considered related to the study vaccination. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Corticosteroids and Immunosuppre ssive Drugs M-M-R II vaccine should not be administered to individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy , including high dose corticosteroids . Vaccination with M-M-R II vaccine can result in disseminated disease due to measles vaccine in individuals on i mmunosuppressive drugs [s ee Contraindications (4 .2)]. 7.2 Immune Globulins and Transfusions Administration of immune globulin s and other blood products concurrently with M-M-R II vaccine may interfere with the expected immune response {9-11} [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)]. The ACIP has specific recommendations for intervals between administration of antibody containing products and live virus vaccines. 7.3 Tuberculin Skin Testing It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and r ubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin skin test with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) is to be done, it should be administered before , simultaneo usly with , or at least 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-R II vaccine . 7.4 Use with Other Live Viral Vaccines M-M-R II vaccine can be administered concurrent ly with other live viral vaccines. If not given concurrently, M-M-R II vaccine should be given one month before or one month after administration of other live viral vaccines to avoid potential for immune interference . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary M-M-R II vaccine is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because infection during pregnancy with the wild - type viruses has been associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes . Increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery and congenital defects have been observed following infection with wild-type measles during pregnancy. {12,13 } Wild-type mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion. Infection with wild- type rubella during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth. If rubella infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, it can result in severe congenital defects , Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the infant includes but is not limited to eye manifestations (cataracts, glaucoma, retinitis), congenital heart defects, hearing loss, microcephaly, and intellectual disabilities. M-M-R II vaccine contains live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella viruses. It is not known whether M-M-R II vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of M-M-R II vaccine administration to pregnant women. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.7 Available data suggest the rates of major birth defects and miscarriage in women who received M-M-R II vaccine within 30 days prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy are consistent with estimated background rates (see Data) . Data Human Data A cumulative assessment of post -marketing reports for M-M-R II vaccine from licensure 01 April 1978 through 31 December 2018 , identified 796 reports of inadvertent administration of M-M-R II vaccine occurring 30 days before or at any time during pregnancy with known pregnancy outcomes . Of the prospectively followed pregnancies for whom the timing of M-M-R II vaccination was known, 425 women received M-M-R II vaccine during the 30 days prior to conception through the second trimester. The outcomes for these 425 prospectively followed pregnancies included 1 6 infants with major birth defects, 4 cases of fetal death and 50 cases of miscarriage. No abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome have been identified in patients who received M -M-R II vaccine. Rubella vaccine virus can cross the placenta, leading to asymptomatic infection of the fetus. Mump s vaccine virus has also been shown to infect the placenta { 14} , but there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations or disease in the fetus or infant . The CDC established the Vaccine in Pregnancy registry (1971 -1989) of women who had received rubella vaccines within 3 months before or after conception. Data on 1221 inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women demonstrated no evidence of an increase in fetal abnormalities or cases of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) in the enrolled women {15}. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk. S tudies have shown that lactating postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast -fed infants . {16,17 } In the breast -fed infants with serological evidence of rubella virus vaccine strain antibodies , none exhibited severe disease; however , one exhibited mild clinical illness typical of acquired rubella . {18,19 } The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for M-M-R II, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from M-M-R II or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use M-M-R II vaccine is not approved for individuals less than 12 m onths of age. Safety and effectiveness of measles vaccine in infants below the age of 6 months have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Safety and effectiveness of mumps and rubella vaccine in infants less than 12 months of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of M-M-R II did not include sufficient numbers of seronegative subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 11 DESCRIPTION M-M-R II vaccine is a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1) Measles Virus Vaccine Live, an attenuated line of measles virus, deriv ed from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain and propagated in chick embryo cell culture; (2) Mumps Virus Vaccine Live, the Jeryl Lynn (B level) strain of mumps virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture; and (3) Rubella Virus Vaccine Live, the Wistar R A 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in WI - 38 human diploid lung fibroblasts . {20,21 } The cells, virus pools, recombinant human serum albumin and fetal bovine serum used in manufacturing are tested and dete rmined to be free of adventitious agents. After reconstitution, each approximately 0.5 mL dose contains not less than 3.0 log10 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious doses) of measles virus; 4.1 log 10 TCID50 of mumps virus; and 3.0 log 10 TCID50 of rubella virus. Each dose is calculated to contain sorbitol (14.5 mg), sucrose (1.9 mg), hydrolyzed gelatin (14.5 mg), recombinant human albumin (0.3 mg), fetal bovine serum (<1 ppm), approximately 25 mcg of neomycin and other buffer and media ingredients . The product contains no preservative.812 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action M-M-R II vaccination induces antibodies to measles , mumps, and rubella associated with protection which by neut ralization assays, immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Results from efficacy studies or effectiveness studies that were previously conducted for the component vaccines of M-M-R II were used to define levels of serum antibodies that correlated with protection against measles, mumps, and rubella [see Clinical Studies (14)] . 12.6 Persistence of Antibody Responses After Vaccination Neutralizing and ELISA antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in 95- 100%, 74-91%, and 90 -100% of individuals respectively, 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. {22-28} 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Muta genesis, Impairment of Fertility M-M-R II vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility . 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Efficacy Efficacy of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines was established in a series of double - blind controlled trials. {29-34} These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vacci nation against measles, mumps and rubella paralleled protection. {35-38} 14.2 Immunogenicity Clinical studies enrolling 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that subcutaneously administered M-M-R II vaccine is immunogenic. In these studies, a single subcutaneous injection of the vaccine induced measles HI antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralizing antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible individuals . A study of 6 -month -old and 15 -month - old infants born to mothers vaccinated with a measles vac cine in childhood, demonstrated that, following infant and toddler vaccination subcutaneously with Measles Virus Vaccine, Live (previously US- licensed, manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA ), 74% of the 6-month -old infants developed detectable neutralizing antibody titers while 100% of the 15-month -old infants vaccinated with Measles Virus Vaccine, Live or M-M-R II vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies { 39}. When the 6 -month - old infants of immunized mothers were revaccinated at 15 months with M-M-R II vaccine , they developed antibody titers similar to those of toddlers who were vaccinated previously at 15-month s of age . In an open label clinical trial (NCT00432523) 752 children 12 through 18 months of age received M-M-R II either intramuscularly (n=374) or subcutaneously (n=378), Antibody responses measles, mumps, and rubella viruses were measured by ELISAs using sera obtained 6 weeks postvaccination. For anti -measles virus, anti -mumps virus a nd anti - rubella virus, seroresponse rates were defined as the percentage of children seronegative at baseline who achieved antibody titers above the respective seroresponse threshold for each assay 6 weeks post vaccination. Seroresponse thresholds were def ined as 255 mIU/mL, 10 EU/mL, and 10 IU/mL for ant i- measles virus, anti - mumps virus, and anti -rubella virus antibodies, respectively . For each vaccine antigen at least 89% of enrolled children were seronegative at baseline. In a post hoc analysis, seroresp onse rates to mumps and rubella viruses were noninferior for the intramuscular group compared to the subcutaneous group (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in seroresponse rates [intramuscular group minus subcutaneous group] -5%). While the seroresponse rate to measles virus narrowly missed meeting the post hoc criterion of -5% for noninferiority (lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate -5.28%) , it met the pre- specified criterion a riority margin . For measles, lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rates was 90% after intramuscular administration. The point estimates of the proportions of children achieving antibody titers above the seroresponse thresholds for measles, mumps, and 94.3%, 97.7%, and 98.1% , respectively, 98.1% , respectively, in the subcutaneous group . 15 REFERENCES 1.

To maintain potency, M-M-R II must be stored between -58\u00b0F and +46\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C ). Use of dry ice may subject M-M-R II to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C). 8\u00b0C). Sterile Diluent The sterile diluent should stored in the refrigerato r (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F, 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) or to 77\u00b0F, 20\u00b0 C to 25\u00b0C) . Do not freeze the sterile diluent . Administer M-M-R II vaccine immediately after reconstitution. If not administered immediately, reconstituted vaccine may be stored between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), protected from light, for up to 8 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours.
