Characterizing such choices with structural models of discounting has been a core challenge for economists for much of the last century, with important contributions by Samuelson (1937); Koopmans (1960); Laibson (1997) and O'Donoghue and Rabin (2001). The preference parameters governing such models are of unique value for understanding a broad range of behaviors, and so have received a great deal of attention in the empirical literature on intertemporal choice.1 This paper seeks to understand whether the out-of-sample predictions given by structural estimates of discounting are empirically valid. We conduct a eld experiment on workers' allocation of e ort through time, a decision where evidence suggests that present-biased models of decision-making may be particularly relevant.2We rst estimate the individual discounting parameters of our workers, and then use these estimates to customize each worker's contract to their identi ed preferences with the intent of reaching a speci c intertemporal pattern of work. That is, we tailor incentives within-subject with the objective of reaching a predicted out-of-sample target. Our core test of predictive validity compares tailored workers to a control group which receives untailored, random contract terms. Interestingly, very little research makes use of the predictive value gained from the articula- tion and estimation of structural models of discounting.3When structural estimates or related 1Examples Wang (2015); Harrison, Lau and Williams (2002); Andersen, Harrison, Lau and Rutstrom (2008); Andreoni and Sprenger 2For Augenblick, Niederle Carvalho, Meier and Wang (2014) and Augenblick and Rabin (2015). 3What structural models have been used for is for comparison to market interest rates (Hausman, 1979), for comparison across samples, time, or elicitation and estimation strategies (Coller and Williams, 1999; Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue, 2002; Meier and Sprenger, 2015; Andersen et al., 2008), to assess di erences in patience across subpopulations (Kirby, Petry and Bickel, 1999; Camerer and Nguyen, 2010; Harrison et al., Falk, man and Sunde, 2010; Lawrance, 1991; Warner and Pleeter, 2001), to conduct welfare analyses (Laibson, 1997), and to conduct standard counterfactual exercises without out-of-sample testing (e.g., for how price changes should alter demand (Mahajan and Tarozzi, 2011)). 23 measures are used in out-of-sample prediction exercises, the analysis has often been indirect, linking di erences in measured patience to di erences in other behaviors without an articu- lated model for the precise relationship between the two (Chabris, Laibson, Morris, Schuldt and Taubinsky, 2008b; Meier 2010; Ashraf, Karlan Yin, 2006; Dohmen, Falk, Hu man and Sunde, 2006; Castillo, Ferraro, Jordan and Petrie, 2011).4Though such correlational exercises yield valuable insights, they could potentially be made more power- ful by directly employing the theoretical parameters in developing the out-of-sample prediction.5 Our project engages government health workers|termed Lady Health Workers (LHWs)| associated with polio eradication e orts for the Department of Health in Lahore, Pakistan. Polio is endemic in Pakistan. Of 350 new worldwide cases in 2014, 297 occurred in Pakistan, constituting a `global public health emergency' according to the World Health Organization.6 The disease largely a ects children under ve. The function of LHW vaccinators is to provide oral polio vaccine to children during government organized vaccination drives, which usually last two or more days and are conducted approximately every month. Vaccinators are given a supply of oral vaccine and a neighborhood map, and are asked to travel door-to-door vaccinating children with a suggested target for vaccinations. Prior to our project there was no technology for monitoring vaccinators, and vaccinators self reported their achievements. As one might imagine, vaccinators often fell short of their suggested targets, but rarely reported doing so. This behavior is consistent with the large literature on public sector absenteeism (Banerjee and Du o, 2006; Banerjee, Du o 4One exception is Mahajan and Tarozzi (2011) who use monetary measures for time inconsistency and purchase and treatment decisions for insecticide treated bednets together to estimate the extent of present bias and `sophistication' thereof. This exercise can be thought of as articulating the relationship between the experimental measures of time inconsistency and contract choice to deliver estimates of present bias. One point noted by Mahajan and Tarozzi (2011) is that the experimental measures wind up having limited predictive power for estimates of present bias that result from their structural exercise. 5Indeed, such exercises could by-and-large be conducted without appeal to structural estimation. Linking either non-parametric measures of discounting or structural parameters thereof to other behavior yields largely the same correlational insights if one does not articulate precisely how how the structural parameters should predict behavior. 6Between 95 percent and 99 percent of individuals carrying polio are asymptomatic. One infection is therefore enough to indicate a substantial degree of ambient wild polio virus.4 Since our study requires implementing performance-based incentives, it hinges fundamen- tally on an accurate measure of productivity.7To this end, each vaccinator in our sample is provided a smartphone, equipped with a precise real-time reporting application developed expressly for this project. Our tool for both measuring intertemporal preferences and tailoring intertemporal incentives is a special bonus contract. In this contract, vaccinators set daily work targets, and, conditional on reaching these targets, receive a sizable bonus. In particular, vaccinators set daily targets ofv1andv2vaccination attempts on day 1 and day 2 of the drive, respectively. Vaccinators face an interest rate, R, such that a single vaccination that is allocated to day 2 reduces by R the number of vaccinations required on day 1. That is, v1andv2satisfy the constraint v1+R\u0001v2=V; whereV= 300. The bonus contract o ers a xed bonus of 1000 rupees (around $10) for meeting both of theirv1andv2vaccination target attempts over a two-day drive.8If either daily target, v1orv2, is not met, the bonus is not received. Chosen allocations, ( v1;v2), can be used to structurally estimate discounting parameters for vaccinators. Experimental variation permits identi cation of an important behavioral aspect of intertemporal choice: the existence of present-biased preferences (Laibson, 1997; O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). Vaccinators are randomly assigned to make their allocation decision either in advance of the rst day of the drive or immediately on day 1 itself. Additionally, vaccinators are randomly assigned an interest rate, R. Under speci c structural assumptions, the experi- 7This links our work to a substantial body of recent research in development economics examining the role of incentives and monitoring in improving public sector performance (Bertrand, Burgess, Chawla and Xu, 2016; Basinga, Gertler, Binagwaho, Soucat, Sturdy and 2011; Miller, Foo, Zhao, Martorell, Medina and Rozelle, 2012; Sundararaman, 2011). 8Our bonus program paid vaccinators for attempted rather than successful vaccinations to avoid concerns that vaccinators, motivated by the incentives, would coerce individuals to receive vaccination. Details on the incentive program are provided in Section 2.2. Slightly more than half of vaccination attempts are successful, with slightly less than half of vaccination attempts reporting no child present. Appendix Figure A.6 reports vaccination behavior for each half-hour of the study, demonstrating limited variation in the proportion of successful and failed vaccination attempts throughout the work day.5 ment identi es a set of aggregate discounting parameters (for similar estimation strategies see Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012a; Augenblick et al., 2015). And, under additional assumptions, each vaccinator's allocation identi es her individual discount factor. We use the individual discounting parameters from an initial drive to tailor incentive con- tracts in a follow-up drive. The tailoring policy we adopt is one which uses the interest rate, R, to induce smooth provision of vaccinations through time, v1=v2, for every vaccinator. The optimal choice of interest rate is simple: to ensure smooth provision of service, the policy must give each vaccinator an interest rate equal to their (appropriately de ned) discount factor. The policy objective we adopt is admittedly arbitrary. As the importance of the exercise is speci cally in choosing a target and measuring predictive success relative to it, many policy objectives could provide a reasonable test.9Hence, we view our exercise as a proof of concept for the potential of such tailored contracting.10 In a sample of 337 vaccinators, we document three principal ndings. First, on aggregate, a present bias exists in vaccination behavior. Vaccinators allocating in advance of day 1 of the drive allocate signi cantly fewer vaccinations to v1than those allocating on the morning the drive actually commences. Corresponding estimates of present bias accord with those of prior laboratory exercises. Second, substantial heterogeneity in discounting is observed. This heterogeneity is important as it points to possible gains from individually-tailored contracts. Third, tailored contracts work. Relative to random contracts, vaccinators with tailored con- tracts provide signi cantly smoother service. This paper makes three contributions. First, our exercise uses eld behavior about e ort 9However, there may be speci c reason to be interested in smooth provision induced via tailoring of interest rates. First, there are likely many settings where smooth provision is desirable if, for example, work deteriorates if done all at once or planning of other tasks and work ow is facilitated by smooth provision. Second, giving the workers a choice from the menu of options induced by the tailored interest rate retains exibility on the part of the worker, which may be desirable if workers are likely to renege from precise prescriptions on work at every point in time, or there is uncertainty in either the environment or the preference measurement technology. Third, given our interest in present-biased preferences, one may think that a person choosing in the moment may generate less smooth intertemporal allocations, delaying costly work, relative to this same person choosing in advance. Hence, a policy objective of smooth provision may e ectively `de-bias' the worker's choices, making their allocations look more like their advance choices even if these choices are taken immediately. 10Our experiment also allows us to explore the viability of alternative policy preferences and tailored contracts such as a policy maker who wishes to maximize the total number of vaccinations. See section 4.2.5 for detail.6 to examine non-standard time preferences, joining a growing literature which identi es present bias from non-monetary choices in eld settings (Read and van Leeuwen, 1998; 2010, 2015; Carvalho et al., 2014).11Most closely related is the work of Kaur et al. (2010) and Kaur et al. (2015), who investigate the decisions of Indian data entry workers, also nding evidence of dynamic inconsistency and self-control problems at work.12 Second, we nd that the predictions given by structural preference estimates are, to a large degree, accurate. While a substantial literature provides evidence that preference measures correlate with economic behavior, this investigation is the rst, to our knowledge, to test whether the speci c point predictions for behavior given by an experimental preference measure are accurate. Further, we nd evidence in Section 4.2.4 that the predictions given by our structural model may o er advantages beyond atheoretic prediction models optimized using machine learning techniques. The third contribution of our paper is to show that preference measures can be used by principals to improve agents' incentives.13Much of the contract theory literature points to the central role of preferences in determining the optimal design of incentives.14The unobservabil- ity of preferences poses a key obstacle to testing the optimality of implemented contracts.15 11These studies include examination of present bias or dynamic inconsistency for food choices (Read and van Leeuwen, 1998; Sado et al., 2015); for highbrow and lowbrow movie choices (Read et al., 1999); for cafe reward choices (Sayman and Onculer, 2009); for completing survey items (Carvalho et al., 2014); and for fertilizer purchase decisions (Du o, Kremer and Robinson, 2011). For discussion of this literature, see Sprenger (2015). 12Documenting dynamic inconsistency outside of the laboratory and outside of the standard experimental domain of time dated monetary payments is particularly valuable given recent discussions on the elicitation of present-biased preferences using potentially fungible monetary et al., 2015; Carvalho et al., 2014). As in prior research, our results show that when investigating non-monetary choices, dynamic inconsistency may well have empirical support (see, e.g., Augenblick et al., 2015; Carvalho et al., 2014; Augenblick and Rabin, 2015). 13A classic literature in personnel economics documents the potential bene ts of implementing piece rates relative to lump sum payments (Lazear, 2000; Paarsch and Shearer, 1999; Shearer, 2004) and the elasticity of e ort with respect to the piece rate (Paarsch and Shearer, 2009). Our focus is not on the incentive e ects of piece rates, but rather the bene ts of using preference estimates to customize incentives. 14The relevant empirical literature points to a role for risk preference in contractual settings (Jensen and Murphy, 1990; Haubrich, 1994; Ackerberg 2013) Chiappori and Salani\u0013 e (2003) provide a review of empirical tests of predictions from contract theory about the design of incentives. 15In a review of the literature, Prendergast (1999) summarizes this point: \\While the conclusions taken from7 We measure a normally unobservable preference parameter and then use such measures in subsequent contract design. Rather than examining whether existing contracts are optimal, we derive the optimal compensation scheme given a policy instrument (the interest rate), a policy objective (smooth provision of service), and the measures of preferences, and then ex- perimentally test whether the optimized scheme improves performance. Our tailored contracts demonstrate that structural preference estimates based on experimental procedures can assist the design of incentives. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents our experimental design and corresponding theoretical considerations for structurally estimating time preferences and tailoring contracts, Section 3 present results, Section 4 provides robustness tests, and Section 5 concludes. 2 Experimental Design and Structural Estimation Our experiment has three components: eliciting the time preferences of vaccinators; identify- ing individual discounting parameters, and, after assigning individually tailored contracts to workers, testing whether these tailored contracts deliver on their speci c objective. In the rst subsection below, we describe the smart-phone monitoring application we devel- oped to track the productivity of our workers. We then describe how we identify discounting parameters, and how we use these to design our tailored contracts. A fourth subsection provides details of our experimental design. 2.1 Vaccinations and Smartphone Monitoring The Department of Health in Lahore, Pakistan, employs Lady Health Worker vaccinators throughout the city to conduct polio vaccination drives. Every month there is a vaccination drive that is at least two days long. Vaccinators are organized into teams of one senior worker this literature could be correct, this seems a poor method of testing agency theory...because many of the factors relevant for choosing the level of compensation are unobserved; the optimal piece rate depends on risk aversion and the returns to e ort, both of which are unknown to the econometrician...it is a little like claiming that prices are too high without knowing costs.\" (p. 19)8 and one junior assistant. These teams work together throughout the drive. Our experiment focuses on the incentives of the senior vaccinator. Prior to our study, the standard protocol for vaccination drives was to provide each vaccina- tor a xed target for total vaccinations over the drive and a map of potential households (called a \\micro-plan\"). No explicit incentives for completing vaccinations were provided and vacci- nators received a xed daily wage of 100 rupees (around $1). Vaccinators were asked to walk their map, knocking on each compound door, and vaccinating each child for whom parental permission was granted.16At the end of each day, vaccinators in each neighborhood convened with their supervisor and self-reported their vaccination activity for the day.17In principle, a monitor could verify the claims.18In practice, however, there was virtually no monitoring, and strong reasons to suspect over-reporting.19 In collaboration with the Department of Health, we designed a smartphone-based monitor- ing system. Each vaccinator in our study was given a smartphone equipped with a vaccination monitoring application. The vaccinator was asked to record information related to each vac- cination. Then, she was asked to take a picture of the home visited and her current vial of vaccine. An image of the main page of the application is provided as Figure 1, Panel A. Data from the smartphone system were aggregated in real-time on a dashboard available to senior 16Vaccinating a child consists of administering a few drops of oral vaccine. As there is no medical risk of over-vaccination, vaccinators are encouraged to vaccinate every child for whom permission is granted. For each attempted vaccination, vaccinators were asked to mark information related to the attempt (number of children vaccinated, whether or not all children were available for vaccination, etc.) in chalk on the compound wall. Appendix Figure A.1 provides an example of neighborhood micro-plan, Appendix Figure A.2 provides an example of a vaccination attempt, and Appendix Figure A.3 provides a picture of a chalk marking on a compound wall. 17Appendix Figure A.4 provides a picture of the form capturing the self-reports. The second column records the number of vaccinations for the day. The seventh column reports the number of vials of vaccine used in the process. 18This could potentially be done by walking the micro-plan and examining the chalk markings on each compound wall. 19We attempted to independently audit vaccinators by following the trail of chalk markings, but our enumer- ators found the process too di\u000ecult to produce a reliable audit of houses visited. We do, however, know the targets associated with each micro-plan prior to our monitoring intervention and that vaccinators almost never reported failing to meet a target. Even with a bonus incentive and smartphone monitoring in place, we nd that vaccinators on average achieve only 62 percent (s.d. = 58 percent) of the target given by their micro-plans. There is reason to expect that vaccinators would achieve a smaller share of their target with no incentive.9 Panel A: Splash Page Panel B: Slider Bar Figure 1: Vaccination Monitoring Smartphone App Notes : The picture is of two screenshots from the smartphone app used by vaccinators.

We next provide an outline of the bonus contracts. 2.2 Intertemporal Bonus Contracts We worked with the Department of Health to implement intertemporal bonus contracts in two-day drives in September, November and December of 2014. The intertemporal bonus contracts required workers to complete a present value total of V= 300 vaccination attempts in exchange for a xed bonus of 1000 rupees. Vaccinators 20This dashboard system is based on the technology described in Callen et al. (2015) and is depicted in Appendix Figure A.5.10 set daily targets, v1andv2, corresponding to vaccinations on day 1 and day 2 of the drive, respectively. If either of the vaccination targets, v1orv2, were not met, the 1000 rupees would not be received, and the vaccinator would receive only her standard wage. Each vaccinator was randomly assigned an interest rate translating vaccinations on day 1 to vaccinations on day 2. For each vaccination allocated to day 2, the number of vaccinations allocated to day 1 would be reduced by R. Hence, the targets v1andv2satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint v1+R\u0001v2=V: This intertemporal bonus contract is identical to an experimental device termed a Convex Time Budget used to investigate time preferences (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012a,b).21The intertemporal allocation ( v1;v2) potentially carries information on the time preferences of each vaccinator. We next describe the relevant experimental variation and structural assumptions that permit us to identify discounting parameters at the aggregate and individual level. 2.2.1 Experimental Variation and Structural Identi cation Our design generates two sources of experimental variation. First, each vaccinator is randomly assigned an interest rate, R, from the set R2f0:9;1;1:1;1:25g. These values were chosen following Augenblick et al. (2015). Operationally, experimental variation in Rwas implemented by providing each vaccinator with a slider bar on the introduction screen of the smartphone application. Figure 1, Panel B depicts the slider bar with an assigned interest rate, R, equal to 1.25. The vaccinator was asked to pull the slider bar to their desired allocation ( v1;v2) and then submit. The allocation was required to be submitted before commencing vaccination. Second, each vaccinator was randomly assigned to either submit their allocation in advance 21For applications to eld studies and e ort allocations, see Augenblick et al. (2015); Carvalho et al. (2014); Gine, Goldberg, Silverman and Yang (2010). We also borrow an additional design element from such studies| minimum allocation requirements|from such studies. In order to avoid vaccinators allocating all their vac- cinations to a single day of the drive, we placed minimum work requirements of v1\u001512 andv2\u001512. The objective of minimum allocation requirements is to avoid confounds related to xed costs. That is, by requiring vaccinators to work on both days of the drive, we avoid confounding extreme patience or extreme impatience with vaccinators simply not wishing to come to work on one of the two days.11 of day 1 of the drive or on the morning of day 1. We refer to the rst of these as `Advance' decisions and the second as `Immediate' decisions. The assignment to either the Advance or Immediate group was independent of the interest rate assignment. Section 2.4 describes the e orts taken to make everything else besides allocation timing equal between these conditions. Random assignment to Advance or Immediate choice and random assignment of Rare both critical design elements for identifying the discounting parameters of interest. We assume that individuals minimize the discounted costs of e ort subject to the intertemporal budget constraint provided by their bonus contract. We make two further structural assumptions. First, we assume a stationary, power cost of e ort function c(v) =v , wherevrepresents vaccinations performed on a given day and >1 captures the convex costs of e ort. Second, we assume that individuals discount the future quasi-hyperbolically (Laibson, 1997; O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). Hence, the worker's disutility of e ort can be written as v 1+ 1d=1\u000e\u0001v 2: The indicator 1d=1captures whether the decision is made in advance or immediately on day 1. The parameters and\u000esummarize individual discounting with capturing the degree of present bias, active for vaccinators who make Immediate decisions, that is, 1d=1= 1. If = 1, the model nests exponential discounting with discount factor \u000e, while if <1 the decisionmaker exhibits a present bias, being less patient in Immediate relative to Advance decisions. Minimizing discounted costs subject to the intertemporal budget constraint of the experi- \u00001+log \u000011d=1\u00001 \u00001logR:12 If we assume that allocations satisfy the above equation subject to an additive error term, \u000f, we arrive at the log\u0012v1 v2\u0013 =log\u000e \u00001+log \u000011d=1\u00001 \u00001logR +\u000f; (2) which can be estimated with standard techniques. This formulation provides intuition for the identi cation of structural parameters from vaccinator allocations, and make clear the purpose of our experimental variation in Rand1d=1. Variation in the interest rate, R, identi es the shape of the cost function, , while variation in 1d=1identi es . Note that \u000eis identi ed from the average level of v1relative tov2when decisions are made in advance (i.e., identi ed from the constant). An identical strategy for structurally estimating time preferences was introduced in controlled experiments by Andreoni and Sprenger (2012a), and has precedents in a body of macroeconomic research identifying aggregate preferences from consumption data.22 The above development delivers aggregate estimates of discounting parameters with each vaccinator's allocation contributing a single observation to the aggregate. Exercises exploring heterogeneity in time preferences document substantial di erences across people, even from relatively homogeneous populations (see e.g., Harrison et al., 2002; Ashraf et al., 2006; Meier and Sprenger, 2015). Given only a single observation per vaccinator, estimation of all parameters at the individual level is infeasible. However, we can calculate each vaccinator's discount factor, which is either \u000eifor those who make Advance decisions or ( \u000e)ifor those who make Immediate decisions. To make such a calculation, two further structural assumptions are required. First, we assume every vaccinator shares a common cost function, = 2, corresponding to quadratic cost. Second, we assume the intertemporal Euler equation (1) is satis ed with equality. Let Ri be the value of Rassigned to individual i, let1d=1;ibe their assignment to Advance or Immediate choice, and let ( v1;i;v2;i) be their allocation of vaccinations. Under the above this equation holds: Ri\u0001v1;i rate-adjusted ratio of allocated vaccinations identi es a discount factor for each individual, i. The structural assumptions required for identi cation of aggregate and individual discount factors are potentially quite restrictive. Our research design, which involves tailoring contracts to individual discount factors, requires an ex-ante commitment to the speci c functional forms of equations (1) and (3). Hence, for the purposes of estimation and tailoring, we analyze only these previously determined functional forms. In sub-section 4.1.2, we assess the validity of a set of required assumptions and present exploratory analysis related to alternative functional forms. 2.3 Tailored Contracts Under the set of structural assumptions above, each vaccinator's allocation in an intertemporal bonus contract identi es her discount factor for vaccinations, either \u000eifor those who make Advance decisions or ( \u000e)ifor those who make Immediate decisions. We consider a policymaker who knows such preferences and wishes to achieve a speci c policy objective. The policymaker has only one policy lever: manipulation of the interest rate, Ri, at the individual level. We formalize the problem as maximizing policy preferences, P(v1;i(Ri);v2;i(Ri)), subject to the vaccinator's o er curve. The problem is stated as maxR;iP(v\u0003 1;i(Ri);v\u0003 2;i(Ri)); where (v\u0003 1;i(Ri);v\u0003 2;i(Ri)) are de ned as the solution to vaccinator's minimization problem, minv1;i;v2;i(v1;i) + ( 1d=1;i\u000e)i\u0001(v2;i) s:t: v1;i+Ri\u0001v2;i=V: The solution maps the policy preferences into an interest rate for each vaccinator. One can consider many potential forms of policy preference, with policymakers desiring a variety of14 intertemporal patterns of e ort. As proof-of-concept, we consider rst a policy maker with one extreme form of preference, P(v1;i(Ri);v2;i(Ri)) =min[v1;i(Ri);v2;i(Ri)].23Such Leontief preferences correspond to a policymaker who desires perfectly smooth provision of service. This problem has an intuitive solution. The worker's intertemporal Euler equation (3) yields smooth provision,v1;i=v2;i, whenRi= ( 1d=1;i\u000e)i. Hence, the tailored contracts give each vaccinator a value ofRequal to their (appropriately de ned) discount factor. Note that the structural discounting parameters are critical in this development. With information on discount factors, contracts can be tailored for each worker to achieve speci c policy objectives. In a second two-day drive, we investigate the promise of tailored contracts. All vaccinators from the rst drive were invited to participate in a second intertemporal bonus contract. Vac- cinators were unaware that their previously measured behavior would be used to potentially inform their subsequent contracts. This sidesteps an important possibility that vaccinators might alter their rst drive behavior in order to receive a more desirable interest rate in the second drive. Half of vaccinators were given an individually tailored intertemporal made Immediate or Advance decisions.24Some vaccinators' allocation behavior in the rst drive implied extreme discount factors and hence extreme values of R\u0003 i. Our tailoring exercise focused only on a Tailoring Sample of vaccinators with discount factors between 0.75 and 1.5.25Vaccinators outside of these bounds were given either the upper or lower bound accordingly. 23The ability of our data to speak to alternative policy preferences is discussed in section 4.2.5. Leontief preferences in this environment are extreme, but there is general interest in understanding mechanisms to drive smooth behavior, particularly for saving and for avoiding procrastination. 24Note that this tailoring exercise requires that vaccinators remain in either the Immediate or Advance assignment across drives. 25Of our sample of 338 vaccinators, 57 exhibit discount factors outside of this range. The Tailoring Sample consists of the remaining 281 vaccinators.15 The other half of vaccinators were given a random intertemporal bonus contract, v1;i+~Ri\u0001v2;i=V; where ~Riwas drawn from a random uniform distribution U[0:75;1:5]. The bounds on the distribution of ~Riwere determined to match the bounds on R\u0003 i, while the choice of a random uniform control|rather than a single value of ~Rior some alternative distribution|was chosen to provide exible scope for constructing a range of comparison groups for tailored interest rates by drawing subsets of vaccinators assigned to the ~Ricondition (see section 4.2.3 for details). We nd our results are robust to a range of comparison groups. Random assignment to tailoring in Drive 2 is strati ed on the measure of absolute distance to equal provision jv1 v2\u00001j, based on allocations from Drive 1.26This measure of distance to equal provision also serves as our eventual measure of distance from equal provision when analyzing the e ect of assignment to tailoring in Drive 2. Stratifying assignment on key outcomes of interest is standard practice in the eld experimental literature (Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009), as it generally increases precision in estimating treatment e ects. 2.4 Design Details Our experiment is divided into two drives. The rst drive took place November 10-11, 2014 with training on November 7. The second drive took place December 8-9, 2014 with training on December 5. 2.4.1 Training and Allocation Decisions On November 7, all vaccinators participating in the November 10-11 drive received two hours of training at one of three locations in central Lahore on using the monitoring features of the smartphone application. Both Advance and Immediate vaccinators were given identical 26Speci cally, subjects are divided into terciles by this measure, with a roughly even number in each bin being assigned to the tailoring and to the control condition.16 training on the intertemporal bonus contracts and the process by which allocations were made and submitted. At the end of the training, vaccinators assigned to Advance decision were asked to select their allocations by using the page on their smartphone application. Assistance was available from training sta for those who required it. Vaccinators assigned to Immediate decision were told they would select their allocations using their smartphone application on Monday morning before beginning work. A hotline number was provided if assistance was required for those in the Immediate condition. The training activities on December 5, for the December 8-9 drive were identical. However, because vaccinators had previously been trained on the smartphone application, this portion of the training was conducted as a refresher. 2.4.2 Experimental Timeline Figure 2 summarizes our experimental timeline and the sample for each vaccination drive of our study. Drive 0, Failed Drive, September 26-30, 2014: We had hoped to begin our study on Friday, September 26th, 2014 with a training session. 336 vaccinators had been recruited, were randomized into treatments, and trained. Advance allocation decisions were collected from half of the subjects on Friday, September 26th. On Monday, September 29th, when we attempted to collect immediate allocation decisions, there was apparently a disruption in the mobile network that prevented 82 of 168 Immediate decision vaccinators from submitting their allocations. This caused us to abandon this drive for the purposes of measuring preferences for subsequent tailoring of contracts. The drive, however, was completed and intertemporal bonuses were paid. For the 82 individuals who did not make their allocations, we contacted them, allowed them to continue working, and paid bonuses for all. Figure 2 provides sample details. For completeness, we present data from Drive 0 in Appendix Table A.3, but do not17 use Drive 0 for the purposes of tailoring contracts.27 Drive 1, November 7-11, 2014: Of the original 336 vaccinators in our failed drive, 57 did not participate in the next drive organized for November 7 - 11. We recruited replacements with the help of the Department of Health, identifying a total of 349 vaccinators to participate in the intertemporal bonus program. The entire sample was re-randomized into interest rate and allocation timing conditions. Training was conducted on November 7, and Advance allocation decisions were collected. The drive began on November 10, and Immediate allocation decisions were collected. 174 vaccinators were assigned to the Advance Choice condition and 175 were assigned to the Immediate Choice condition. While all 174 vaccinators in the Advance Choice condition provided an allocation decision, only 164 of 175 in the Immediate Choice condition provided an allocation. Because 11 vaccinators attrited from the Immediate Choice condition, we also provide bounds on the estimated e ect of decision timing using the method of Lee (2009). In addition, for 232 vaccinators, we have allocation decisions in both the failed drive, Drive 0, and Drive 1, forming a potentially valuable panel of response. Figure 2 provides sample details. Drive 2, December 5-9, 2014: Of the 338 vaccinators who participated in Drive 1 and provided an allocation, 337 again participated in Drive 2. These vaccinators were randomly assigned to be tailored or untailored in their Drive 2 bonus contracts. Importantly, vaccinators retained their Advance or Immediate assignment, such that Drive 2 delivers a 2x2 design for tailoring and allocation timing. This allows us not only to investigate the e ect of tailoring, but also whether the e ect of tailoring depends on whether present bias is active. 27Appendix Table A.1 checks for balance by failure of the smartphone application in Drive 0.

Assignment to the advance choice and immediate choice condition in Drive 2 is inherited from vaccination Drive 1. Note that: (i) 57 vaccinators participated only in Failed Drive 0; (ii) 6 vaccinators participated in Drive 1 only; (iii) 1 vaccinator participated in Failed Drive 0 and Drive 1, but not in Drive 2 (iii) 67 vaccinators participated in drives 2 and 3 only; (iv) 271 vaccinators participated in all three rounds.19 2.4.3 Sample Details Table 1 summarizes our sample of vaccinators from Drive 1 and provides tests of experimental balance on observables. Column (1) presents the mean and standard deviation for each variable; columns (2) to (9) present the mean and standard error for each of our eight treatment arms, and column 10 presents a p-value corresponding to joint tests of equality. Our sample is almost exclusively female, more than 90 percent Punjabi in all treatment arms, and broadly without access to formal savings accounts. Vaccinators are generally highly experienced with an average of 10.5 years of health work experience and 10.4 years of polio work experience. Consistent with randomization, of the 8 tests performed, only the test performed on an indicator variable equal to one for Punjabi subjects suggests baseline imbalance. 3 Results We rst report results related to the elicitation of intertemporal preference parameters, then evaluate the possibility of tailoring incentives based on individual preferences.28 3.1 Elicitation of Time Preferences 3.1.1 Aggregate Behavior Figure 3 presents median behavior in the elicitation phase of our experiment, graphing the allocation to the sooner work date, v1, for each interest rate.29Separate series are provided for Advance and Immediate choice. In Panel A we provide data for our Full Sample of 338 vacci- 28In addition, to test just the e ect of providing the $10 bonus, we randomly assigned 85 vaccinators in Drive 0 to carry a phone but not receive an incentive. 73 of these vaccinators also participated in Drive 1, retaining the same `phone only' treatment status. In Drive 1, vaccinators in group attempted 169.472 vaccinations (s.e. = 15.98) and in the phone plus incentives group attempted 201.32 vaccinations (se = 7.73) yielding an estimated increase of 31.85 attempts (s.e. = 18.49, p = .09). 49.3% of vaccination attempts were successful for the `phone only' group while 49.1% of vaccinations were successful for the `phone plus incentives' group. The di erence in success rates between the two groups is small (0.2 percentage points) and statistically insigni cant (p=0.69). We discuss data on task completion in detail in Section 4.1.2 below. 29We opt to provide medians as the average data are in uenced by several extreme outliers in allocation behavior. Qualitatively similar patterns are, however, observed.20 Table 1: Summary Statistics and Covariates Balance Full Advance Decision Immediate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) Demographics Gender (Female = 46 40 45 41 46 38 39 Notes: This table checks balance across the eight treatment groups.

In Panel B we focus only on our Tailoring Sample of 281 vaccinators, trimming 57 vaccinators with extreme allocation behavior that would imply individual discount factors from equation (3) outside of the range of [0.75, 1.5]. Two features of Figure 3 are notable. First, subjects appear to respond to the between-subject variation in interest rate. As the value Rincreases, vaccinations allocated to v1count relatively less to- wards reaching the two-day target of V= 300. Vaccinators respond to this changing incentive by reducing their allocation of v1. Second, there is a tendency of present bias. Vaccinators appear to allocate fewer vaccinations to v1when making Immediate choice.21 Table 2 presents corresponding median regression analysis for aggregate behavior in Drive 1.30We regress v1onRand whether the allocation decision is immediate. Column (1) echoes the ndings from Figure 3, Panel A: in our Full Sample, vaccinators assigned to Immediate choice allocate a median of 2.00 (s.e. = 1.13) fewer vaccinations to v1than those assigned to Advance choice. Similar patterns are observed in column (2), focusing only on our Tailoring Sample. Vaccinators in the Tailoring Sample allocate a median of 3 fewer vaccinations to v1 when making immediate choice. As discussed in Section 2.4.2 above, 11 vaccinators attrited from the sample in the immediate choice condition in Drive 1. Bounding the e ect of being assigned to the immediate choice condition on v1allocations using the method of Lee (2009) provides a lower bound of \u00003:78 tasks (s.e. = 2.06) and an upper bound of 0.205 (2.06) tasks.

Circles are advance choice groups and diamonds are immediate choice groups.23 3.1.2 Aggregate Preference Parameters The raw data of Figure 3 and analysis of Table 2 indicate responsiveness of vaccinators to our experimental parameters, Rand whether allocations are Immediate or Advance. Equation (2) links allocation behavior to these experimental parameters via a structural model of choice. In Table 3 we present parameter estimates from maximum likelihood estimations of equation (2) with\u000f\u0018N(0;\u001b2) under a set of structural assumptions and sample restrictions. In columns (1) and (3) of Table 3, we present estimates restricting = 2 (quadratic costs) for the Full Sample and the Tailoring Sample. These estimates serve as an aggregate benchmark for our individual analysis which calculates individual discount factors under the assumption of quadratic costs. In column (1), we estimate a daily \u000eof 1.013 (0.018), of 0:955 (0:037). Though we nd an aggregate present bias parameter less than one, echoing the raw results, our estimate of cannot be statistically distinguished from 1, 2(1) = 1:50;(p= 0:22). A similar nding is obtained when focusing only on the Tailoring Sample in column (3). In columns (2) and (4) of Table 3, we relax our restriction of quadratic costs and attempt to estimate the shape of the cost function. In these estimates we restrict 2[1;4] by estimating the parameter of a box constraint, a, such that = 1 + 3\u00011 1+exp(a). This restriction ensures allocations are indeed minima (i.e., > 1) and allows costs to be substantially convex (i.e., up to quartic). Relaxing our restriction on alters somewhat the conclusions with respect to discounting. In particular, and\u000eare both estimated to be further from 1 in columns (2) and (4) relative to columns (1) and (3). In column (2), we estimate an aggregate of 0:878 (0:094), close to the estimates from controlled laboratory choices over e ort (Augenblick et al., 2015; Augenblick and Rabin, 2015). Once again, however, our estimate of cannot be statistically di erentiated from 1, 2(1) = 1:69;(p= 0:19). It is important to note that in both columns (2) and (4) the cost parameter ais estimated to be in excess of -15, implying extremely close to 4. Estimating close to the edge of the box constraint may suggest some mis-speci cation in functional form or constraint choice. In section 4.1.2, we attempt to evaluate the appropriateness of our functional form assumptions24 Table 3: Aggregate Parameter Estimates, Drive 1 Full Sample Tailoring Sample (1) (2) -125.092 -94.034 117.861 202.774 Notes : This reports structural estimates of ,\u000e, and obtained using Maximum Likelihood Estimation based on Equation (2). Standard er- rors are reported in parentheses. Estimates in columns (1) and (3) are obtained imposing the restriction = 2. Estimates in columns (2)-(4) remove this restriction.25 and assess plausible alternative formulations. These exercises identify an important issue with respect to the estimates of Table 3: the estimated parameters predict more sensitivity to R than truly exists in the data.31This potential mis-speci cation presents a clear challenge for using individual preference parameters for tailored contracts. Having committed to a possibly mis-speci ed functional form ex-ante, any success in tailoring contracts should likely be viewed as a lower bound on the potential bene ts of such initiatives. 3.1.3 Individual Preference Parameters The aggregate estimates of Table 3 mask substantial heterogeneity across subjects. Following equation (3), we calculate individual discount factors for each vaccinator assuming quadratic costs. For those vaccinators assigned to Advance choice, this discount factor corresponds to \u000ei, while for those assigned to Immediate choice it corresponds to ( \u000e)i. In Drive 1, the median [25th-75th %-ile] discount factor in Advance choice is 1.015 [0.88, 1.18], while the median discount factor in Immediate choice is 1 [0.84, 1.21]. As noted above, an important minority of vaccinators have extreme discount factor calcu- lations. Fifty-seven of 338 subjects in Drive 1 have implied discount factors either above 1.5 or below 0.75.32We term such vaccinators the `Boundary Sample.' As our tailoring exercise focuses on individuals with discount factors between 0.75 and 1.5, we restrict our individual analysis to the 281 vaccinators in the Tailoring Sample and discuss the Boundary Sample in robustness tests (see section 4.2). Figure 4 presents histograms of implied discount factors for the 281 Tailoring Sample vaccinators in Advance and Immediate decisions. Two features are notable. First, in both contexts substantial heterogeneity in discount factors is observed. The 25th to 75th percentile ranges from 0.92 to 1.15 in Advance choice and from 0.88 to 1.15 in Immediate choice. Second, a present bias is observed in the shape of the distributions. The 31Appendix Figure A.7 reproduces Figure 3, with in-sample predictions from Table 3, columns (2) and (4). Though the estimates do match the responsiveness of behavior from R= 1 toR= 1:1, they do not generate the lack of sensitivity for other changes in R. 32Such extreme behavior is slightly more pronounced in Immediate choice (34 vaccinators) relative to Advance Discount Factors Figure 4: Individual Discount Factors in the Tailoring Sample Notes : This gure provides histograms of one period discount factors separately for subjects in the Advance Choice condition (left panel) and the Immediate Choice condition (right panel). The sample is restricted to vaccinators in the Tailoring Sample (vaccinators with R\u0003 i\u00150:75 orR\u0003 i\u00141:5). one period discount factors are skewed below 1 in Immediate relative to Advance choice. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test marginally rejects equality of distributions ( DKS= 0:15; p= 0:09). The observed heterogeneity in discount across vaccinators resonates with prior ex- ercises demonstrating heterogeneity of preferences even with relatively homogeneous samples (see e.g., Harrison et al., 2002; Ashraf et al., 2006; Meier and Sprenger, 2015). Further, this heterogeneity carries some promise for the possibility of individually-tailored contracts.27 .8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 .75 .85 .951.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 1.45 .75 .85 .951.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 1.45Untailored TailoredDrive 2 Interest Rate Drive 1 Discount FactorPanel A50 100 150 200 250 507090110130150170190210 507090110130150170190210Untailored TailoredDay 2 Vaccinations Day 1 VaccinationsPanel B Figure 5: Discounting and Tailoring28 3.2 Tailored Contracts Individual discount factors from Drive 1 in hand, we turn to the possibility of tailoring intertem- poral contracts to individual preferences. Of the 281 vaccinators in the Tailoring Sample, 280 participated in Drive 2.33Of these, 142 vaccinators were assigned a value of Requal to their discount factor. That is, tailored vaccinators were assigned R\u0003 i= ( 1d=1;i\u000e)i, which should in- duce equal provision of e ort through time, v1;i=v2;i. The remaining 138 vaccinators serve as control and were assigned a uniform random interest rate ~Ri2U[0:75;1:5].34 Panel A of Figure 5 plots the individual discount factor measured during Drive 1 against the assigned Rin Drive 2 separately for the tailored and untailored groups. In the left panel, by design, there is no clear relationship between discount factors and the assigned interest rates. In the right panel, there is a strict one-to-one mapping along the 45 degree line between discount factors and the Drive 2 interest rates, consistent with the assignment R\u0003 i= 1t=1;i\u000eiin the tailored group. Panel B of Figure 5 plots vaccinations allocated to the rst day of the drive against vac- cinations allocated to the second day of Drive 2 separately for the tailored and the untailored group. Notable from Figure 5 is the relative dispersion of the untailored controls around the 45-degree line of equal provision relative to the tailored treatments. We examine di erences in the distance from the 45-degree line of equal provision using the metricjv1;i v2;i\u00001j. The mean distance for the untailored group is 0.61 (s.d. = 3.64) while the mean distance for the tailored group is 0.14 (s.d. = 0.23), t278= 1:53;(p= 0:13). The lack of statistical signi cance is due primarily to several substantial distance outliers. Trimming the top and bottom 1% of the sample of Drive 2 allocations, the mean distance for the untailored group is 0.15 (s.d. = 0.19), while the mean distance for the tailored group is 0.10 (s.d. = 0.11), t265= 3:10;(p<0:01). 33Vaccinators from the boundary sample were allowed to participate in Drive 2 and were either assigned ~Ri2U[0:75;1:5] if they were in the untailored control group (31 subjects) or assigned Ri= 0:75 orRi= 1:5 if they were in the tailored group and had R\u0003 i<0:75 (15 subjects) or R\u0003 i>1:5 (11 subjects). See section 4.2 for analysis of the boundary sample. 34As noted in section 2.3, assignment to the tailored or the untailored group was conducted via strati ed randomization with strata based upon the tercile of di erences from equal provision of e ort in Drive 1.29 In Table 4, we provide corresponding least squares regression analysis. Following best practice for such analysis (Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009), we control for xed e ects for each stratum in the strati ed randomization. In column (1), we analyze all 280 subjects and note a sizable reduction in distance under tailoring that falls just outside the range of signi cance. Echoing our raw results, when excluding outliers in column (2), we nd that tailoring serves to reduce distance from equal provision signi cantly by around six percentage points. Relative to the untailored controls, tailoring reduces distance from equal provision by around one-third, indicating substantial bene ts to our tailored policy initiative. In column (3), we additionally control for the value of R\u0003 ior~Riassigned in Drive 2. This regression identi es whether tailoring generates more equal provision for a given value of R, and hence controls for any di erences in interest rates across tailored and untailored groups. Again, tailoring serves to reduce distance signi cantly. Vaccinators assigned to Advance choice in Drive 1 remain in Advance choice in Drive 2, while those assigned to Immediate choice remain in Immediate choice. In columns (3)-(6) of Table 4, we examine di erential e ects of tailoring across these two groups. Given that the individual discount factors skew lower in Immediate choice, one might expect larger distance measures in Immediate controls (and hence greater bene ts to tailoring). This is precisely what is observed. Untailored Immediate choice is associated with signi cantly larger distance measures and tailoring for Immediate choice signi cantly reduces these distances. In columns (5) and (6), excluding outliers, we nd that tailoring in Immediate choice reduces distance from equal provision by around one-half. Note that this e ect size (8.4 percentage points) is similar to the e ect of moving a vaccinator from advance to immediate choice in the untailored group (8 percentage points). Tailoring in Advance choice appears to directionally reduce distance as well, but the e ect is not signi cant, potentially due to the relatively small average distance measure identi ed in untailored Advance choice. The ndings of Table 4 indicate potential bene ts to tailored policy initiatives. For a given interest rate, matching this interest rate to individual preferences generates smoother30 service provision. The e ects are to reduce distance measures by around one-third on average and around one-half in Immediate choice. This suggests that policy makers wishing to alter intertemporal choices of workers may be able to achieve their goals through tailored contracts. Our ndings show particular promise for tailoring contracts to change behavior in settings where present bias is relevant.

We rst examine the robustness of these results to estimation using only within-subject variation from our panel of subjects who participated in Drives 0 and 1, and who changed from Advance to Immediate choice. We then examine the validity of a set of structural assumptions required to infer discounting parameters from vaccinator allocation behavior. 4.1.1 Within-Subject Variation As shown above, in Drive 1, relying on between subjects tests, we cannot reject = 1 in any speci cation. Given the wide heterogeneity in observed patience regardless of decision timing, one may fail to statistically identify present bias even if it exists on average. Indeed, most studies of present bias and dynamic inconsistency are conducted as within-subject exercises, potentially because of such wide heterogeneity. Fortunately, our failed Drive 0 and the corresponding re-randomization in Drive 1 allows us to identify present bias within-subject for vaccinators who changed from Advance to Immediate choice (or vice versa) across drives. We re-conduct the analysis of Table 3, focusing on a panel of 126 vaccinators who changed between Advance and Immediate choice across Drives. Using such within-subject variation, we reject the null hypothesis of no present bias at the 5% level. Moreover, the e ect is robust to just examining those who transitioned from Advance to Immediate, or just those who transitioned from Immediate to Advance. See Appendix Table A.2 for details. One critique of our between-subject design is that all subjects in Immediate choice made their decisions on the same day. Some idiosyncratic shock on Day 1 of Drive 1 could lead to present bias. These ndings indicate that if something speci c is occurring on32 Day 1 of Drive 1, a similar shock must occur several weeks previously on Day 1 of Drive 0.35 These 126 vaccinators also provide an opportunity to investigate present bias at the in- dividual level. Following equation (3), we calculate a discount factor for each condition the vaccinator faces. The parameter \u000eis identi ed as the discount factor from Advance choice while is identi ed as the discount factor from Immediate choice divided by that of Advance choice. Interestingly, as in as in our analysis of discount factors, we nd \u000eis centered around 1 with a median value of 1.04, and that is skewed below 1 with a median value of 0.95. Sixty-nine (54.8%) of 126 vaccinators have <1, 6 (4.8%) have = 1, and 51 (40.5%) have >1. A sign test for the null hypothesis that the median is equal to 1 yields a p-value of 0.12 (two-sided test).36Together, these results show that general patterns of present bias are observed at the aggregate and individual level when investigating only within-subject variation in a sub-sample of 126 vaccinators who change between Advance to Immediate choice across conditions. See Figure A.8 for graphical detail. 4.1.2 Structural Assumptions As in any structural exercise, a set of assumptions are required to infer discounting parameters from vaccinator allocation behavior. Six assumptions are relevant for the present discussion, which we discuss below. Assumption 1: Stationarity of the Cost Function: We assume the cost function is the same for day 1 and day 2. If sooner costs are forecasted to be more severe than later costs, vaccinators may appear disproportionately impatient, while if later costs are forecasted to be more severe, they may appear disproportionately patient. Further, if perceived costliness of vaccinations 35More concretely, if vaccinator A is assigned to advanced choice in Drive 0 and immediate choice in Drive 1, and vaccinator B is assigned to immediate choice in Drive 0 and advanced choice in Drive 1, then an idiosyncratic shock (say it is local to immediate choice, such as a revelation that it is raining on the rst day of the drive) needs to a ect vaccinator A when the drive starts during Drive 0 (in September) and vaccinator B when the drive starts during Drive 1 (in November). Randomization at the level of the vaccinator, among vaccinators all working in two neighborhoods in Lahore, narrows the set of plausible shocks that would satisfy these conditions. 36For the one-sided test with an alternative of <1, thep-value is 0.06. Excluding a single subject with in excess of 19 reduces the two-sided (one-sided) p-value to 0.10 (0.05).33 changes from Advance to Immediate choice, present bias measured by is con ated with non- stationarity. Importantly, our monitoring technology provides time-stamps and geo-stamps for vacci- nation activity. Time stamps are recorded every vaccination attempt, while geo-stamps are collected approximately every 10 vaccination attempts. This may provide independent means for assessing the costliness of tasks from time use. For each vaccinator, we identify the median time lapse between vaccination attempts and the median distance covered per 30 minute win- dow each day.37Of our 338 vaccinators, measures for median time lapse between vaccination attempts are available for 277 on either Day 1 or Day 2 and for 228 vaccinators on both days of Drive 1.38Of our 338 vaccinators, measures for median distance traveled every 15 minutes are available for 274 on either Day 1 or Day 2 and for 224 vaccinators on both days of Drive 1.39 Vaccinators take around 3.4 minutes between vaccination attempts and walk around 0.06 miles per 15 minutes on Day 1. Focusing on individuals with measures on both days of the drive, we nd that time taken and distance traveled are uncorrelated both with Advance choice and with discount factors within condition. Time and distance are also uncorrelated with Advance 37We focus only on the distance traveled and time taken for vaccinations between 8 am and 6pm each day. The distribution of time taken and distance traveled carried some extreme outliers for some subjects. As such, we felt the median was an appropriate summary statistic. Though we had expected to receive geo-stamp data approximately every 10 vaccination attempts, when the monitoring data arrived we noted substantial variance in the number of vaccinations with common geo-stamps and sequences of geo-stamps which `bounced' back and forth between geographic coordinates. In order to not overstate subject movements, we opted to take average coordinates within a 15 minute window and calculate direct-line distance between window-average coordinates as our measures of distance. 38265 vaccinators have Day 1 lapse data while 240 have Day 2 lapse data. Of the 73 vaccinators with missing Day 1 data, 68 completed either zero or one vaccination on Day 1 such that time lapse between vaccination attempts is not calculable. The remaining 5 conducted vaccinations but did not have phones that interacted with the server to report time use. Of the 98 vaccinators with missing Day 2 data, 92 of them completed either zero or one vaccination on Day 2 and the remaining 6 did not have phones that interacted with the server to report time use. Those vaccinators who completed vaccinations but did not have interaction with the server had their vaccination records pulled manually from their phones after the drive. 39260 vaccinators have Day 1 distance data while 238 have Day 2 distance data. Of the 78 vaccinators with missing Day 1 data, 72 completed four or fewer vaccination attempts on Day 1 such that distance traveled between 15 minute windows is not calculable. The remaining 6 conducted vaccinations but either did not have phones that interacted with the server to report location or had faulty Global Position Systems (GPS) in their phones. Of the 100 vaccinators with missing Day 2 data, 96 of them completed four or fewer vaccination attempts on Day 2 and the remaining 4 did not have phones that interacted with the server to report location or had faulty GPS.34 choice and discount factors on Day 2 of the drive. Further, di erences in time taken or distance walked are statistically indistinguishable from zero, uncorrelated with allocation timing, and uncorrelated with discount factors within condition. These data indicate stability in required average e ort per vaccination which is unrelated to assignment to Advance or Immediate choice, and that changes in e\u000ecacy are unrelated to measured preferences. This suggests that perceived changes in costs likely do not drive our measures of patience or our nding of present bias.40 These results are all presented in Appendix Table A.4. If Advance and Immediate choices were governed by di erent, but constant, cost functions, this could result in another violation of stationarity. This possibility can be investigated directly in the data. Because we have experimental variation in interest rates in both Advance and Immediate choice, the cost parameter, , can be estimated for both conditions. In Appendix Table A.5, we report estimates of a single discount factor and for both Advance and Immediate choice. While costs are estimated to be similarly convex in both Advance and Immediate choice, discount factors vary in an economically meaningful way. Furthermore, while we fail to reject that the discount factor is equal to one in Advance choice, we reject the null hypothesis of one in Immediate choice. Appendix Table A.5 in- dicates that non-stationarity in discount factors is more apparent than non-stationarity in costs. Assumption 2: Unobserved Idiosyncratic Costs: We assume that vaccinations are the only argument of costs when identifying time preferences. However, there may be idiosyncratic costs across time or individuals that could in uence measured patience. For example, a vaccinator with an appointment lasting 2 hours on Day 1 and no appointments on Day 2 may nd it extremely costly to allocate vaccinations to Day 1. This may appear to the researcher as impatience, but only re ects the vaccinator's idiosyncratic costs across days. Further, if such idiosyncratic events are easier to re-organize when making Advance choice, present bias may 40Ultimately, such stationarity is likely to be expected given that vaccinators are already well-versed in vaccination procedures, have an average of 10.5 years of experience as vaccinators, and received a half day's training on the vaccination monitoring application.35 be con ated with ease of scheduling. Here, again, the additional data on vaccinator time use available from the monitoring application is potentially valuable. We can investigate whether extended periods of non- vaccination exist and if they are correlated with measured preferences and allocation timing. As in the example above, a vaccinator with an extended period of non-vaccination may well be experiencing forecasted idiosyncratic costs unrelated to vaccinations. Appendix Table A.6 repeats the analysis from Appendix Table A.4, with dependent variables of the maximum daily time lapse between vaccination attempts and whether the longest daily break is in excess of two hours. Longest daily breaks are, on average, around 59 minutes on Day 1 with around 13% of vaccinators taking longest breaks in excess of 2 hours. Focusing on individuals with measures on both days of the drive, we nd that the length of longest breaks and the probability of 2 hour breaks are uncorrelated with Advance choice and uncorrelated with discount factors within condition. Almost identical patterns are observed on Day 2 of the drive. Di erences in break behavior across days are statistically indistinguishable from zero, uncorrelated with allocation timing, and uncorrelated with discount factors within condition. These data suggest that idiosyncratic costs identi ed from taking extended breaks do not explain the extent of impatience in the sample, and that potential di\u000eculties in rescheduling do not explain observed present bias. Assumption 3: Deterministic Environment: Our exercise assumes that individuals can per- fectly forecast their own future costs of vaccination. A plausible alternative is that costs are uncertain. The natural evolution of uncertainty through time may lead to di erences in mea- sured preference parameters across groups. Though the resolution of uncertainty may lead to apparent dynamic inconsistency, the direction is not clear. Some vaccinators may grow more patient as uncertainty is resolved, some less so.41 One potential, albeit imperfect, test for the e ect of uncertainty in the environment is 41Naturally, if shocks to costs do underly our observed di erences in patience across individuals, one might not expect to be able to tailor contracts at the individual level over time with the success that we have.36 to examine di erences in experience across individuals.42More experienced vaccinators may have a more complete understanding of the di\u000eculty of tasks and may face less uncertainty when making allocation decisions. As noted, vaccinators have an average of more than 10 years of experience in health work. In Table A.7, we separate our sample either at the median of experience (9 years) or at 15 years of experience.43Separating at the median, we nd virtually no di erences in estimated preferences. Separating at 15 years of experience, we nd that, if anything, more experienced subjects are somewhat more present-biased than their less experienced counterparts. This indicates that experienced individuals who are likely to have the least surprises in costs through time neither yield dramatically dif- ferent estimates of patience, nor are they disproportionately likely to be dynamically consistent. Assumption 4: Identical Cost Functions: Our aggregate exercise assumes identical costs across subjects, and our individual elicitation assumes identical quadratic costs. Though these as- sumptions allow for straightforward estimation and calculation of time preferences, any viola- tion would lead us to confound di erences in patience across individuals or across allocation timing with di erences in costs. One natural view would be to assume that individuals do not discount at all, \u000e= 1 and = 1, such that allocations identify only the shape of the cost func- tion. In this case, when R= 1, all vaccinators, regardless of allocation timing, should exhibit v1=v2= 150 for all values of .44Examining the Drive 0 and Drive 1 data, we nd that for 163 vaccinators who were assigned R= 1, the mean allocation is v1= 140:84 (s:d:= 24:76).45 Though the median allocation is indeed 150, responses range widely with 5th-95th percentiles of response being 103 to 160. If heterogeneity in costs were driving response and discounting was not a key feature of the data, one would not expect to see this extent of variation in response whenR= 1. Further, given random assignment to allocation timing, heterogeneity in costs does not easily rationalize the observed present bias in the data. 42This test is imperfect as experience may correlate with other di erences across vaccinators. 43Experience measures are available for 329 of 338 vaccinators in Drive 1. 44This is because the Euler equation reduces to (v1 v2) 1, which vaccinators allocated exactly v1=v2= 150.37 One additional point that warrants attention is that whenever we estimate the homogeneous cost function parameter, , substantial convexity in costs is estimated. Indeed, even with the relatively extreme curvature estimates, our estimated models predict more sensitivity to changing interest rates than exist in the data. We wondered whether one could identify subsets of vaccinators for whom behavior was more sensitive to price and hence curvature estimates were less convex. In Table A.9, we show that a subset of subjects, in particular those with more than 15 years of experience that are working in an urban environment, have substantially less convex cost functions relative to their less experienced or non-urban counterparts.46 Albeit exploratory, such analysis suggests that vaccinators who are experienced vaccinators and who are in an environment where they can vaccinate rapidly, are indeed more sensitive to price changes and hence have less convex estimated costs. Though such a nding helps to understand the relative lack of price sensitivity in the broad sample47, it also indicates a potential misspeci cation in costs. Not only are costs likely to be heterogeneous, they are also likely to be more convex than our quadratic assumption for large swathes of our sample. Viewed in this light our relative success at tailoring contracts assuming quadratic costs and ignoring heterogeneity should likely be viewed as a lower bound on the promise of such exercises. Assumption 5: Inability to Renege: The contracts we implement to elicit preferences feature a completion bonus of 1000 rupees if both targets, v1andv2, are met. The bonus is sizable relative to daily earnings of 100 rupees prior to our study. The design choice of such a large bonus was made purposefully to prevent vaccinators from reneging on their contract choices. At any given point in time, not completing allocated vaccinations generates a 1000 rupee penalty. As such, vaccinators should forecast that they will indeed complete the required vaccinations and 46We identify a vaccinator as working in an urban environment if the average distance traveled per vaccination attempt over the two days is less than 0.1 miles. Average distance traveled is the ratio of total distance traveled over the two days of the drive divided by the total number of vaccination attempts during the drive. We determine a vaccinator's position in space every 15 minutes while they are working as the average GPS coordinate recorded by their smartphone over that 15 minute interval. We calculate the total distance traveled as the sum of distances traveled between these average coordinates. 47That is, it may just be particularly di\u000ecult to move tasks through time for relatively inexperienced and non-urban subjects.38 allocate them according to their preferences. If vaccinators forecast not being able to complete the required vaccinations, then allocation choices may not re ect their true preferences, and hence be e ectively cheap talk.48 Our monitoring application allows us to assess, ex-post, the extent to which vaccinators succeeded or failed to reach their allocated targets. We have comprehensive completion data for 288 of 338 vaccinators in Drive 1.49Of these 288, 142 (49.3%) met or exceeded their targets ofv1andv2. The data indicate that many who fell short came close to completion. 207 vaccinators (71.9%) met or exceeded their targets on one of the two days and an average of 75.5% of total target vaccinations were completed. Figure A.9 presents the histogram of average completion proportions across subjects.50Two hundred and two vaccinators (70.1%) completed an average of 70% or more of their target vaccinations. These ex-post completion rates indicate that a majority of vaccinators likely forecasted reaching their targets. Additionally, in Appendix Figure A.6 we plot for each half-hour of Drive 1 the total number of attempted vaccinations along with the probability of successful vaccination and the probability that no child was reported as present. Reporting that no child was present is likely to be less time consuming than a successful vaccination and easier to falsify. The vast majority of vaccination activity occurs before 3:00pm, and we nd evidence that vaccinators' proportion of successful or failed vaccination attempts remains largely steady throughout the workday. This further suggests that allocated vaccination attempts are conducted with due diligence. In Appendix Table A.8, we investigate the relationship between allocation timing, measured patience and completion rates. Two general patterns arise. First, vaccinators making advance choice are somewhat more likely to complete their targets; and, second, higher measured discount factors are related to higher completion rates, particularly for the second day of the drive. The observed correlation is consistent with the view that impatient vaccinators delay vaccinations believing they will complete them, but subsequently fail to follow through. 48Sizable bonuses to limit the possibility of reneging are also implemented in Augenblick et al. (2015). 49The remaining 50 vaccinators did not activate their smartphone application or submitted zero vaccinations on both days of the drive. 50Average completion proportions are calculated as 1 =2(min(Completed 1=v1;1) +min(Completed 2=v2;1))39 Interestingly, the correlation between completion on both days and measured patience is somewhat stronger in Immediate choice ( \u001a= 0:24; p < 0:01) relative to Advance choice (\u001a= 0:10; p= 0:21), suggesting that some failure to complete is linked to delay associated with present bias. For such patterns to exist without choices being informative of preference, some aspect of the decision environment would have to cause uninformative responses to appear less patient and disproportionately so in Immediate choice. Assumption 6: No Biases in Choice: Our study assumes that the allocation environment itself induces no biases in choice such that vaccinator allocations are directly informative of preferences. A substantial literature in experimental economics suggests that aspects of the decision environment may deeply in uence measures of preferences (for recent examples, see Harrison, Lau, Rutstrom and Sullivan, 2005; Beauchamp, Benjamin, Chabris and Laibson, 2015). One common view is that subjects are biased towards the middle of a choice set. In our environment, this could involve subjects opting for either equal allocations of v1=v2, or choosing an allocation in the middle of their budget constraint, v1=Rv2. Only 31 of 338 vaccinators (9%) exhibit v1=v2. Taking a less conservative measure of v2\u00002:5\u0014v1\u0014v2+2:5, we nd that still only 58 of 338 vaccinators (17%) are within 5 vaccinations of v1=v2.51Only 35 of 338 vaccinators (10.3%) exhibit v1=Rv2. Taking a less conservative measure of Rv2\u00002:5\u0014 v1\u0014Rv2+2:5, we nd that 83 of 338 vaccinators (25%) are within 5 vaccinations of v1=Rv2.52 Taken together, this suggests that biases towards the middle of the budget constraint or towards equal allocation are unlikely to be driving substantial portions of allocation behavior. 4.2 Tailoring Robustness Tests Our Drive 2 data show that vaccinators who are given bonus contracts with a value of Requal to their estimated discount factors provide signi cantly smoother service. Here we examine robustness of this result to alternative comparison groups, alternative measures for smoothness 51As an even less conservative measure, 145 of 338 (43%) satisfy v2\u000010\u0014v1\u0014v2+ 10. 52As an even less conservative measure, 137 of 338 (40.5%) satsify Rv2\u000010\u0014v1\u0014Rv2+ 10.40 in service provision, and alternative measures for treatment. We conclude the section by pro- viding results from a set of additional exercises assessing the value of atheoretic approaches to tailoring, and the possibility for alternative interventions based on di erent policy preferences. 4.2.1 Alternative Comparison Groups Our results demonstrate that, relative to a comparison group with uniform random values of R, tailoring serves to reduce distance to the policy target by around one-third. A natural question is whether these tailoring bene ts are observed relative to alternative controls. In Appendix Table A.10 and Appendix Figures A.10 and A.11, we present three additional analyses. A rst natural control is the use of a single value of Rapplied to all individuals. Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare only a single value of Rgiven our uniform random assignment protocol. However, we can examine a section of the untailored group around a given value. In column (1) of Table A.10, we repeat the analysis of Table 4, column (3), but use as the comparison group only those untailored vaccinators who received a value of Rwithin one standard deviation of their group's meanR\u0003 iof 1.036. Tailoring continues to decrease the distance from smooth provision relative to this more limited control group. Appendix Figure A.10 provides corresponding graphical analysis. In column (2), we repeat this analysis excluding those individuals from the untailored group who randomly received a value of ~Riwithin 0.10 of their true value of R\u0003 i. The bene ts of tailoring are observed with increased precision.53A second potential control group would be a subset of the untailored group who receive the same distribution of Ras those in the tailored group. Matching on the 1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th and 99th percentiles, column (3) and Appendix Figure A.11 demonstrate that relative to a control group receiving a matched distribution of R, tailoring continues to signi cantly reduce the distance from smooth provision. 53Comparing tailored individuals to those who received close to the untailored group's mean value of R\u0003 iis important because, in principle, the mean value of R\u0003ishould yield smooth provision for the average subject. Not only is the average distance for these comparison groups substantial, 0.132 to 0.150, but the tailoring yields additional bene ts at the individual level by leveraging the heterogeneity in discount factors across vaccinators.41 4.2.2 Alternative Measures for Smooth Provision Our analysis measures the distance to equal provision using the metric jv1;i v2;i\u00001j. In Table A.11, we reconduct the analysis of Table 4, using ve alternate measures for smoothness. Panel A presents the Euclidean distance to the 45 degree line,jv1;i\u0000v2;ijp 2. Panel B presents the Euclidean distance normalized by the total number of vaccinations allocated,jv1;i\u0000v2;ijp 2(v1;i+v2;i). Panel C presents the number of sooner vaccinations that would need to be reallocated to reach the 45 degree line, jv1;i\u0000300 1+Rj. Panel D presents probit regressions for needing to reallocate more than 25 vaccinations, jv1;i\u0000300 1+Rj>25. And nally, Panel E presents the value of the policymaker's objective function, min[v1;i;v2;i]. Across all speci cations, the main conclusions are reproduced. However, the results with respect to additional tailoring bene ts in Immediate choice fall, at times, outside the range of statistical signi cance. These alternative measures of smooth provision indicate that our results on the potential bene ts of tailoring are not an artifact of how one measures the outcome of interest. 4.2.3 Alternative Sample Restrictions and Treatment Measures Our tailoring exercise focused on vaccinators with discount factors between 0.75 and 1.5. Of 337 vaccinators in Drive 2, 280 satis ed this requirement. Those vaccinators whose discount factors fell outside of this range were given either R= 0:75 or 1.5 depending on which bound they were closest to. For such individuals, tailoring is not a binary treatment, but rather a continuous di erence between their discount factor and the exogenously given one. Indeed, for all vaccinators in the untailored group, treatment is also a continuous measure. In Table A.12, Panel A, we reconduct the analysis of Table 4 using as the measure of treatment the absolute di erence between each vaccinator's discount factor and their assigned interest rate, which we label Tailor Intensity . The main results are reproduced; the closer discount factors are to interest rates, the smoother is provision.54In Panel B, we include those individuals in the Boundary Sample with discount factors that lie outside of the bounds of interest rate 54Restricting attention only to the untailored group reveals directionally similar, though insigni cant, results across all speci cations.42 assignment. Including these observations does not alter the conclusions; however, it should be noted that treatment is no longer orthogonal to individual preferences as extremely patient and impatient vaccinators will receive larger treatment intensity on average.55 4.2.4 Atheoretic Approaches Our exercise demonstrates that structural estimates of time preferences can be useful in pre- dicting subsequent behavior. An alternative to developing a structural model of choice would rely on the researcher recovering the relationship between key parameters of interest, Rand 1d=1, and behavior, and developing a subsequent prediction without ltering the relationship through the structural model. We examine one example of such an exercise. For Drive 1 behavior, we recover the rela- tionship between v1andRand1d=1by conducting a Least Absoluate Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with penalty parameter chosen via 10-fold cross validation (Tib- shirani, 1996) of v1on a cubic polynomial in Rinteracted with 1d=1.56The corresponding selected lasso coe\u000ecients deliver an atheoretic representation of the most predictive (in terms of cross-validated mean squared error) relationship between v1and key parameters of interest in Drive 1. Given the values of Rand1d=1provided in Drive 2 and the Drive 1 lasso coe\u000ecients, we predict the Drive 2 value of v1for each individual.57Similarly, we predict Drive 2 value ofv1from the assigned values of Rand1d=1and the individual discount factor identi ed in Drive 1. In Appendix Figure A.12 we examine the predictive validity of the structural versus the non-structural approaches by plotting predicted and actual values of v1in Drive 2 for the 337 subjects who participated in both Drive 1 and Drive 2. We also provide non-parametric 55Using the indicator for tailoring would not be an appropriate solution to this problem as tailored vaccinators with extreme patience or impatience may actually receive interest rates that are further from their policy-optimal interest rates than those in the untailored condition. 56The provided regressors are a constant and normalized values of R;R2;R3;1d=1;R\u00021d=1;R2\u00021d=1, and R3\u00021d=1. The lasso regression and cross-fold validation procedure were implemented using the glmnet package in R. 57Note that this prediction will be identical for all vaccinators given the same value of Rand1d=1, and hence will mispredict any heterogeneity across vaccinators.43 lowess curves for the relationship between predicted and actual values.58Notable from Ap- pendix Figure A.12 is the generally close adherence between structurally predicted and actual values. The lowess line follows the 45 degree line of perfect prediction through the majority of the space. Less adherence is observed between non-structural predictions and actual behavior. The structural predictions deliver higher correlations with real behavior ( \u001a= 0:18) than do the non-structural predictions ( \u001a= 0:16) and lower bias in prediction (27.9 vs. 32). However, the root mean squared error is lower for the non-structural predictions (32.8 vs 39.1). Hence, on the basis of bias and correlation, our structural exercise outperforms the machine learning lasso algorithm trained on Drive 1. There is an additional important di erence between the LASSO and structural predictions presented here. The structural prediction for a given vaccinator's behavior in Drive 2 derives from their allocation in Drive 1 and the interest rate assigned in Drive 2. It therefore relies on a single data point. By contrast, the LASSO prediction for a given vaccinator is derived by training a model on the entire cross-section of data from Drive 1, and then obtaining a tted value based on the interest rate assigned in Drive 2. This means the LASSO prediction will be identical for all subjects assigned the same interest rate while the structural prediction may vary depending on individually measured preferences. Hence, the two methods are not only di erent in the sense of being structural or atheoretic, they also di er both in the amount of data informing the prediction and in the extent of heterogeneity they can predict. 4.2.5 Alternative Policy Preferences While our results suggest that tailored contracts can improve success in achieving a Leontief policy objective, a natural question is whether this approach could be put to use to achieve other policy objectives. Ultimately, any attempt to tailor contracts will rely on whether ini- tially elicited preferences are stable. If vaccinator time preferences are stable, then changes in incentives will have predictable e ects on behavior. 58The lasso procedure on Drive 1 selects an intercept and Ras delivering coe\u000ecients of su\u000ecient size given the cross-validated constraint choice.44 To provide a general assessment of the promise of alternative policy objectives, we examine the stability of identi ed discount factors across Drives 1 and 2 by calculating R\u0001v1 v2= 1d=1\u000e; for each vaccinator in each Drive. Figure A.13 presents the calculated discount factors for Drive 1 and Drive 2 along with the 45 degree line for 317 of 337 vaccinators.59The correlation in discount factors across rounds is \u001a= 0:41;(p < 0:01), indicating stability in preferences.60 Our ndings correspond with those of Meier and Sprenger (2015), who investigate subjects participating in an identical monetary discounting experiment approximately one year apart and identify a one-year correlation of around 0.5 for monetary choices. The level of correlation in discount factors across drives indicates stability in preferences such that alternative policy objectives may also be achievable with tailored contracts.61 5 Conclusion Structural parameters for intertemporal preferences have been at the center of theoretical and empirical research modeling intertemporal choice for much of the last century. This paper seeks to understand a heretofore unexplored question: are the out-of-sample predictions given by structural estimates of discounting empirically valid? We couch this question in an e ort to customize contracts for 337 vaccination workers who spend two days each month attempting to deliver polio vaccines in the neighborhoods of Lahore, Pakistan. 59Eliminated from the gure and from our calculations of stability are 20 vaccinators with discount factors in excess of two in one or both drives. 60Including the remaining 20 extreme vaccinators, the correlation changes substantially to \u001a= 0:01;(p= 0:87). It should be noted that the correlation in identi ed discount factors is substantially higher in the tailored condition,\u001a= 0:67;(p<0:01), relative to the untailored condition, \u001a= 0:17;(p<0:05). We believe this is due to some sensitivity of behavior to extreme values of Rin Drive 2. For untailored subjects who coincidentally receive a value of ~Riwithin 0.25 of their value of R\u0003 i, the correlation in discount factors is \u001a= 0:53;(p<0:01). 61One natural alternative is to maximize performance, regardless of timing. In such a case, we consider a policymaker with linear preferences, P(v1;v2) =v1+v2, who wishes to maximize the total number of completed vaccinations regardless of timing. Maximizing this objective function subject to the vaccinator's o er curve, yields an optimal R\u0003 max=p 1t=1\u000e(1 + 1t=1\u000e)\u0000 1t=1\u000e. Unfortunately, our assigned values of Rare generally quite far from R\u0003 maxmaking it di\u000ecult to test for the possibility of a maximizing contract.45 We monitor our workers' e orts using a smartphone application developed especially for our project. Workers in the Advanced condition state their targets for both days of the vaccination drive on the Friday before the drive, which is conducted on the following Monday and Tuesday. Those in the Immediate condition wait until Monday morning to state their targets. Those who reach their targets get a 1000 rupee bonus (around $10 US). As anticipated, subjects stating targets on Monday morning are skewed to delaying vaccinations until day 2 of the drive. That is, vaccinators exhibit a present bias in e ort allocations. With assumptions on costs of delivering vaccines we are able to identify (somewhat rough) estimates of discounting parameters for each of our workers. In the second stage of our study, conducted a month later, half of workers were o ered a contract tailored to their own discounting parameters, designed to induce equal provision of vaccinations on both days of the drive. The initial preference measures are critical to the design of these contracts as, without a measure of preferences, there would be no prescription for contract terms. The policy objective of equal provision of vaccinations on both days is admittedly arbitrary. Hence, we view our exercise as a proof-of-concept for the possibility of tailored incentives. Our nding is encouraging. Those workers who receive e ort contracts that were tailored to their individual discounting parameters were signi cantly more likely to meet the policy objective relative to untailored workers. That is, using structurally identi ed estimates of dis- counting parameters to form a new incentive contract can indeed have a predictable e ect on behavior. To date, little research makes use of such predictive value of structural discounting estimates. Our results show not only that estimates are predictive, but also that useful parame- ter estimates are identi able from a very limited number of experimental choices. This suggests that the substantial e ort of articulating and estimating structural models in this domain has been well-invested. This paper also speaks to a recent discussion on the external validity of experimentally ad- ministered randomized control trials. Developing structural models through which to interpret experimental treatment e ects potentially provides a means for generalizing results (Acemoglu, 2016).62In our setting, trans- lating from our reduced form experimental treatment e ects to a structural model of choice requires a set of potentially strong (and implausible) assumptions.63Nonetheless, the nding of predictive validity in this case suggests there is indeed potential for using structure as a means of increasing the external validity of results obtained from a single sample. Separately, our results link to the growing literature on the personnel economics of the state (Ashraf, Bandiera and Lee, 2015; Bertrand et al., Khan and Rezaee, 2016). This literature emphasizes the idea that states play a vital role in delivering services and facilitating economic growth, and so their internal dynamics should be studied with the same degree of attention as has been applied to rms. Within this literature, there is interest in understanding whether heterogeneity in competencies and in motivation of state actors is linked to meaningful di erences in state performance or service provsion (Ashraf et al., 2015; Dal B\u0013 o et al., 2013; Deseranno, 2016; Callen et al., 2016). We take the additional step of asking not only whether this heterogeneity matters for outcomes, but also whether it can be acknowledged and re ected in the design of individual incentives. There are a number of clear limitations to our study which should be addressed by future research. First, our study sidesteps the critical issue of incentive compatibility by not informing subjects of Drive 2 when Drive 1 preferences are elicited. The mechanism design problem of eliciting preferences and tailoring on said preferences with complete information will be critical if one wishes to implement tailored contracts repeatedly in the eld. Second, future research should seek to gain more precise estimates of preferences. Our exercise requires restrictive assumptions that could be relaxed in the presence of more data. If our results point to a lower bound in the promise of tailored contracts, it is important to know how much more can be achieved. Third, alternative policy objectives and contract types should be investigated to 62Attanasio and Meghir (2012), Du o, Hanna and Ryan (2012), and Du o, Greenstone, Pande and Ryan (2016) provide examples in development of using experiments to estimate key policy parameters. 63Banerjee et al. (2016) discuss how the plausibility of such identifying assumptions might limit external validity.47 ensure robustness of the identi ed predictive validity. Our ndings have natural extensions to piece rate contracts, multi-period settings, and alternative policy targets that are worthy of study.48 References Acemoglu, Daron , \\Theory, General Equilibrium, and Political Economy in Development Economics,\" Journal of Economic Perspectives , 2010, A. and the Empirical Determinants of Form,\" Journal of Political Economy , 2002, 110(3), 564 { 591.
