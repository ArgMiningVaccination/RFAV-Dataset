Ex ecutive Summary Ozone Depletion and Climate Change T he Montreal protocol continues to be effective. The Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer concludes that atmospheric abundance of most controlled ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) is decreasing. There are several indications that the global ozone layer is beginning to recover from ODS-induced depletion. However, the variability of the atmosphere and the influence of climate change have hindered a definitive attribution of the observed global ozone increases since 2000 to the concomitant ODS decreases. In Antarctica, large ozone depletion continues to occur each year. In the Arctic, ozone depletion is generally less pronounced than in Antarctica but more variable: the very high stratospheric ozone concentrations observed in the spring of 2010 were followed by record-low concentrations in spring 2011. As a result of the success of the Montreal Protocol in limiting ozone depletion, changes in UV-B irradiance measured at many sites since the mid-1990s are due largely to factors other than ozone. Increases in UV-B irradiance (280-315 nm) ranging from 5 to 10% per decade have been reported for several northern mid-latitude sites, caused predominantly by reductions in cloudiness and aerosols. However, at some northern high latitude sites, UV-B irradiance has decreased during that period mainly due to reduction in snow- or ice-cover. Because of the large natural variability, any responses of UV- B irradiance to stabilisation of the concentrations of stratospheric ozone and possible beginning of a recovery are not yet detectable in the measurements. L arge short-term increases in UV-B irradiance have been measured at some locations in response to episodic decreases of ozone at high latitudes. For example, the low ozone in spring 2011 in the Arctic increased the erythemal (sunburning) dose averaged over the duration of the low-ozone period by 40-50% at several Arctic and Scandinavian sites. Corresponding increases over Central Europe were estimated to about 25%. F uture levels of UV-B irradiance at high latitudes will be determined by the recovery of stratospheric ozone and by changes in clouds and reflectivity of the Earth's surface. In Antarctica, reductions of up to 40% in mean noontime UV Index (UVI) are projected for 2100 due to the continuing recovery of ozone. These reductions are comparable in magnitude with the increases in UVI that occurred in the past due to ozone depletion. Because of the anticipated increases in cloud cover, the UVI is projected to decrease by up to 7% at northern high latitudes. Reductions in surface reflectivity due to ice-melt will continue to contribute to reductions in UVI by up to 3% in the margins of the Antarctic continent and by up to 10% in the Arctic, but confidence in the magnitude of these effects is low. xvi The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 With continued effective implementation of the Montreal Protocol, future changes in UV-B irradiance outside the Polar regions will likely be dominated by changes in factors other than ozone. By the end of the 21st century, the effect of the recovery of ozone on UV-B irradiance will be very small, leading to decreases in UVI of between 0 and 5%. Additional de creases of up to 3% in the UVI are projected due to the anticipated increases in cloud cover. Future changes in UVI would be likely dominated by decreases in aerosols, resulting in increases in the UVI, particularly in densely populated areas. For example, increases in the UVI of up to 40% are projected for parts of Asia, reversing the large reductions in UVI that have probably occurred in this region during the second half of the 20th century. The confidence in these effects of aerosol is very low due to uncertainties in the pr ojected amounts and optical properties of aerosols, as well as in future policy on emission controls. Human Health Chan ging behaviour with regard to sun exposure by many fair-skinned populations has probably had a more significant effect on human health than increasing UV- B irradiance due to ozone depletion. The increase in holiday travel to sunny climates, wearing clothing that covers less of the body, and the desire for a tan are all likely to have contributed to higher personal levels of exposure to UV-B radiation than in previous decades. Such changes in behaviour have both adverse and beneficial consequences for health. Imm ediate adverse effects of excessive UV-B irradiation are sunburn of the skin and inflammation of the eye (photoconjunctivitis or photokeratitis). Long-term regular low- dose or repeated high-dose exposure to the sun causes melanoma and non-melanoma (basal and squamous cell) carcinomas of the skin and cataract and pterygium (a growth on the conjunctiva) of the eye. The incidence of each of these skin cancers has risen significantly since the 1960s in fair-skinned populations, but has stabilised in recent years in younger age groups in several countries, perhaps due to effective public health campaigns. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. T he major known beneficial effect of exposure of the skin to solar UV radiation is the synthesis of vitamin D. Vitamin D is critical in maintaining blood calcium levels and is required for strong bones. People vary in how efficiently their skin makes vitamin D from sun exposure and perhaps in their physiological needs for this vitamin. Vitamin D deficiency might increase the risk of an array of diseases such as cancers, autoimmune diseases and infections. At present it is not clear if the low level of vitamin D is a cause of these diseases, occurs as a consequence of them, or is a marker of other factors that predispose to ill-health. S trategies to avoid over-exposure to solar UV radiation include staying indoors, seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, brimmed hats and sunglasses, and applying sunscreens. These methods should aim to balance the harmful and beneficial effects of sun exposure. Such a balance may be difficult to achieve in practice as the recommended time outdoors will differ between individuals, depending on personal factors such as skin colour, age, and clothing as well as on environmental factors such as location, time of day, and season of year. Current uncertainties centre on defining an optimal level of vitamin D and the amount and pattern of sun exposure required to achieve the optimum in different The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 xvii individuals. Thus, devising appropriate health messages for the public at the present time is not straightforward. Clim ate change may affect personal sun-exposure behaviour, but the impact is likely to vary according to season and location. For example, increasing temperatures may lead to decreased time outdoors in climates where it is already hot, but more time outdoors in cooler climates. Terrestrial Ecosystems T he effects of UV-B radiation on plants are influenced by various abiotic and biotic factors in ways that can have both positive and negative consequences on plant productivity and functioning of ecosystem. Ozone depletion, increased exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation, and climate change affect biological systems that result in intricate feedbacks and complexity. In mid-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere plant productivity has likely decreased slightly due to the increased UV radiation as a result of the ozone depletion. On the other hand, exposure to UV-B radiation can promote plant hardiness, and enhance plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens. It can also improve the quality, and increase or decrease the yields of agricultural and horticultural products, with subsequent implications for food security. E xposure to UV-B radiation can increase or decrease rates of decomposition of dead plant matter (litter), depending on prevailing climate and the chemistry and structure of the litter. In arid and semi-arid ecosystems (grasslands, savannas and deserts), photodegradation generally increases rates of decay of plant litter and is now being considered as an important driver of decomposition, although uncertainty exists in quantifying its regional and global biogeochemical significance. Changes in the decomposition of plant litter from exposure to UV-B and also UV-A (315-400 nm) and visible radiation have potential consequences for the cycling and storage of carbon and other nutrie nts. Solar UV radiation has the potential to contribute to climate change via its stimulation of emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and other volatile organic compounds from plants, plant litter and soil surfaces Mechanisms and sources of emissions of trace gas have been identified in plants and ecosystems. UV radiation together with other abiotic factors, in particular temperature, stimulates these emissions. The magnitude, rates and spatial patterns of the emissions remain highly uncertain at present. These UV radiation processes could increase emissions of trace gases that affect the atmospheric radiation budget (radiative forcing) and hence changes in climate. Wh ile UV-B radiation does not penetrate into soil to any significant depth, it can affect a number of belowground processes through alterations in aboveground plant parts, microorganisms, and plant litter. These include modifications of the interactions between plant roots, mic robes, soil animals and neighbouring plants, with potential consequences for soil fertility, carbon storage, plant productivity and species composition. xviii The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 T errestrial ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere are being affected by the Antarctic ozone 'hole.' Resultant changes in precipitation patterns have been correlated with ecosystem changes such as increased tree growth in Eastern New Zealand and expansion of agriculture in South-eastern South America. Conversely, in Patagonia and East Antarctica, declining tree and moss bed growth have been linked to reduced availability of water. A full understanding of the effects of ozone depletion on terrestrial ecosystems in these regions should therefore consider both UV radiation and climate change. Aquatic Eco systems Clim ate change and UV radiation affect phytoplankton productivity and species composition of marine ecosystems. Phytoplankton (primary producers) are decreasing a long the West side of the Antarctic Peninsula due to increased solar UV-B radiation and rapid regional climate change. Change in ice phenology as well as light and nutrient availability may affect species composition. Organisms mitigate UV-B radiation-induced damage by repair mechanisms or by producing UV-absorbing compounds. In teractions between climate change and UV radiation are having strong effects on aquatic ecosystems that will change in the future due to feedbacks between temperature, UV radiation and greenhouse gas concentrations. Higher air temperatures a re increasing the surface water temperatures of numerous lakes and oceans, with many large lakes warming at twice the rate of air temperatures in some regions. Species composition and distribution of many marine ecosystems may change with warmer oceans. For others such as corals, the warming may alter their tolerance of other stressors. This warming also can shift the th ermal niche of organisms towards the pole and causes changes in community structure. War ming of the ocean results in stronger stratification that decreases the depth of the upper mixed layer. The decrease in the depth of the upper mixed layer exposes organisms that dwell in it to greater amounts of solar visible and UV radiation which may overwhelm their capability for protection and repair. Enhanced stratification also reduces upward transport of nutrients across the thermocline from deeper layers. In the polar waters, increasing temperature results in explosions of phytoplankton growth under the ice and around the ice edges. In creased concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 are continuing to cause acidification of the ocean, which alters marine chemical environments with consequences for marine organisms. A cidification interferes with the calcification process by which organisms, such as phytoplankton, macroalgae and many animals including molluscs, zooplankton and corals, produce exoskeletons protecting themselves from predators and solar UV radiation. Consequently, they become more sensitive to UV radiation, so that they calcify even less and decrease their production of biomass. Clim ate change-induced increases in concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in inland and coastal waters reduce the depth of penetration of UV radiation . Increased extreme precipitation events and enhanced growth of terrestrial vegetation produce greater fluxes of UV-absorbing DOM from the landscape. This creates a refuge for UV-sensitive The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 xix organisms including some invasive species. Decreased penetration of UV radiation also reduces the natural disinfection of surface water containing viruses, pathogens, and parasites. Biogeochemical Cycles Clim ate change modulates the effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems resulting in UV-mediated positive or negative feedbacks on climate. For example, where photochemical priming plays an important role, changes in continental runoff and ice melting, due to climate change, are likely to result in enhanced UV-induced and microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and release of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Such positive feedbacks are particularly pronounced in the Arctic resulting in Arctic amplification of the release of CO 2 (see next point). S olar UV radiation is driving production of substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from Arctic waters . The production is enhanced by the changes in rainfall, melting of ice, snow and the permafrost, which lead to more organic material being washed from the land in to Arctic rivers, lakes and coastal oceans. Solar UV radiation degrades this organic material, which stimulates CO 2 and CO emissions from the water bodies, both directly and by enhanced microbial decomposition. New results indicate that up to 40% of the emissions of CO 2 from the Arctic may come from this source, much larger than earlier estimates. T he changes in climate associated with the Antarctic ozone 'hole' include changes to wind patterns, temperature and precipitation across the Southern Hemisphere. More intense winds lead to enhanced wind-driven upwelling of carbon-rich deep water and less uptake of atmospheric CO 2 by the Southern Ocean, reducing the oceans potential to act as a carbon sink (less sequestering of carbon). These winds also transport more dust from drying areas of South America into the oceans and onto the Antarctic continent. In the oceans this can enhance iron fertilisation resulting in more plankton and increased numbers of krill. On the continent the dust may contain spores of novel microbes that increase the risk of invasion of non-indigenous species. The ozone 'hole' has also helped to keep East Antarctica cold, but conversel y has helped to make the Maritime Antarctic region one of the fastest warming regions on the planet. These climate-related impacts of ozone depletion on ecosystems may also intera ct with changing UV radiation, leading to tipping points. T he carbon cycle is strongly influenced by interactions between droughts and intensity of UV-radiation at the Earth's surface. Increased aridity due to climate change and severity of droughts will change the amount of plant cover, thereby increasing UV-induced decomposition of dead plant matter (plant litter). These increased losses could have large impacts on terrestrial carbon cycling in arid ecosystems. L ignin present in all terrestrial vegetation plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, sequestering atmospheric carbon into the tissues of perennial vegetation . Although it is well known that lignin is one of the components of dead vegetation most resistant to biotic decomposition, new results have shown that lignin is readily decomposed with exposure to solar UV radiation. Consequently, UV-induced degradation of plant litter is correlated with its lignin content, reducing long-term storage of carbon in terrestrial systems. xx The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Air Quality UV radiation is an essential driver for the formation of photochemical smog, which consists mainly of ground-level ozone and particulate matter. Recent analyses support earlier work showing that poor outdoor air quality is a major environmental hazard. Greater exposures to these pollutants have been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in humans and are associated globally with several million premature deaths per year . Ozone also has adverse effects on yields of crops, leading to loss of billions of US dollars each year. These detrimental effects also may alter biological diversity and affect the function of natural ecosystems. F uture air quality will depend mostly on changes in emission of pollutants and their precursors; changes in UV radiation and climate will also contribute. Significant reductions in emissions, mainly from the energy and transportation sectors, have led to improved air quality in many locations. Air quality will continue to improve in those cities/states that can afford controls, and worsen where the regulatory infrastructure is not available. Future changes in UV radiation and climate will alter the rates of formation of ground-level ozone and some particulate matter and must be considered in predictions of air quality and consequences for human and environmental health. D ecrease in UV radiation associated with recovery of stratospheric ozone will, according to recent global atmospheric model simulations, lead to increases in ground- level ozone over large geographic scales. If correct, this would add significantly to future ground-leve l ozone trends. However, the spatial resolution of these models is insufficient to inform policy, especially for urban areas. UV radiation affects the atmospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals, OH, which are responsible for the self-cleaning of the atmosphere. Recent measurements confirm that on a local scale, OH radicals respond rapidly to changes in UV radiation. However, on large (global) scales, models differ in their predictions by nearly a factor of two, with consequent uncertainties for estimating the atmospheric lifetime and concentrations of greenhouse gases and key air pollutants. Projections of future climate need to consider these uncertainties. No new negative environmental effects of the substitutes for the ozone depleting substances or their breakdown-products have been identified. However, some substitutes for the ozone depleting substances will continue to contribute to global climate change if concentrations rise above current levels. Materials A trend towards environmentally sustainable materials in building has increased the use of wood and wood-plastic composites. Despite this trend, the use of rigid PVC, the most-used plastic in building, will continue to be popular at least in the medium term. Improvements are being developed that make PVC easier to process and environmentally friendly. The effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the lifetime of PVC building produ cts continue to be a concern. The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 xxi T he role of solar UV radiation in creating microplastics debris in the oceans from the weathering of plastic litter on beaches is an emerging environmental issue. These microplastic particles concentrate toxic chemicals dissolved in seawater and are ingested by zooplankton, thus providing a potential mechanism for transfer of pollutants into the marine food web. While the process has not been studied in any great detail, the production of microplastics will likely increase at high solar UV-B radiation levels and/or elevated temperatures. Nanos cale inorganic fillers can provide superior stability against solar UV irradiation relative to conventional fillers in coatings and plastics. Nanoparticle fillers in coatings, especially those in clear-coatings on wood or fibre-coatings of textiles, also provide enhanced stability. With nanoparticles that absorb UV radiation, such as the mineral rutile, the stabiliser effect is particularly evident. The benefits of nanofillers in bulk plastics, however, are less clear and more information is needed to assess their efficacy. Nanofillers may provide a low-cost means of stabilising some polymer and wood-based products and help increase service lifetimes in the face of variations in UV radiation or climate change. Clothi ng and glass can provide protection against exposure to solar UV radiation . Textile fabrics block the personal exposure to solar UV radiation, whereas glass usually blocks mainly UV-B radiation. Effectiveness of specific fabrics depends on the weave characteristics but can be further improved by surface-treating the fibres with a UV absorber. Glazing for windows is being developed to further improve their thermal properties and also results in increased filtering of the UV radiation with benefits for health of humans and indoor components of buildings and artwork. xxii The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 1 Chapter 1.

Among these, atmospheric ozone, which absorbs UV radiation, is of considerable importance, but other constituents of the atmosphere as well as certain consequences of climate change can also have major influences. Further, we assess the variations of UV radiation observed in the past and present, and provide projections for the future. Of particular interest are methods to measure or estimate UV radiation at the Earth's surface. These are needed for scientific understanding and, when they are sufficiently sensitive, they can serve as monitors of the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. Also assessed are several aspects of UV radiation related to biological effects and health. Implications for ozone and UV radiation from two types of geoengineering methods that have been proposed to combat climate change are also discussed. In addition to ozone effects, UV changes in the last two decades derived from measurements have been influenced by changes in aerosols, clouds, and surface reflectivity, and possibly by solar activity. Positive trends of UV radiation observed after the mid-1990s over northern mid-latitudes are mainly due to decreases in clouds and aerosols. Despite some indications from measurements at a few stations, no statistically significant decreases in UV-B radiation attributable to the beginning of the ozone recovery have yet been detected. Projections for erythemal irradiance (UVERY) suggest the following changes by the end of the 21st century (2090-2100) relative to present time (2010-2020): (1) Ozone recovery (due to decreasing ozone-depleting substances and increasing greenhouse gases) would cause decreases in UVERY, which are highest (up to 40%) over Antarctica. Decreases are small (less than 10%) outside the southern Polar Regions. A possible decline of solar activity during the 21st century might affect UV-B radiation at the surface indirectly through changes induced in stratospheric ozone. (2) Projected changes in cloudiness would lead to relatively small effects (less than 3%) except at northern high latitudes where increases in cloud cover could lead to decreases in UVERY by up to 7%. (3) Reductions in reflectivity due to melting of sea-ice in the Arctic would lead to decreases of UVERY by up to 10%, while at the margins of Antarctic the decreases are smaller (2-3%). Melting of sea-ice would expose the ocean surface formerly covered by ice to UV-B radiation up to 10 times stronger than before. (4) Expected improvement of air- quality and reductions of aerosols over most populated areas of the northern hemisphere may result in 10- 20% increases in UVERY, except over China where even larger increases are projected. The projected Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 2 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 aerosol effect for the southern hemisphere is generally very small. Aerosols are possibly the most important factor for future UV levels over heavily populated areas, but their projected effects are the most uncertain. Introduction For the purposes of the current assessment (2010-2014), which addresses negative and positive effects of solar UV radiation on humans, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, materials, and air quality (see other Chapters ), we assess short - and long-term changes in ambient UV radiation at the Earth's surface resulting from changes in atmospheric ozone and climate. Effects of ozone on climate and climate on ozone are also discussed. Absorption by ozone is the dominant factor controlling the levels of surface UV-B (280 - 315 nm) radiation for cloud -free and low -aerosol conditions. With the continuing success of the amended and adjusted Montreal Protocol in reducing the concentrations of the ozone depleting substances (ODSs) the focus is now on the detection of possible decreases in UV -B radiation in response to the first signs of recovery of the ozone layer. Changes in climate caused by the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may also affect the UV radiation at the Earth's surface indirectly, as detailed below. Current status of atmospheric ozone Since the last assessment of ozone depletion264 efforts to quantify the geographic and temporal variability of ozone have continued through ground- and satellite-based measurements. This extension of observations of ozone by four years has increased the statistical confidence in the estima ted long -term changes in total ozone column (TOC). There are indications that the global ozone layer is beginning to recover from depletion caused by ODSs. However, the variability of the atmosphere, the uncertainty of measurements, and the influence of cl imate change prevent unequivocal attribution of the observed increases in ozone since 2000 to decreases in ODSs .240, 265 Ozone at mid-latitudes and the tropics . The present (2008-2012) mean values of ozone relative to the 1964- 1980 mean are smaller by ~3.5% in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (35\u00b0N - 60\u00b0N) and by ~6% in the southern hemisphere mid-latitudes (35\u00b0S - 60\u00b0S). In the tropics (20\u00b0S - 20\u00b0N), no significant changes have occurred in total ozone over this period. The observed average changes in total ozone over time, relative to the 1998-2008 mean, in different latitude bands are shown in Fig. 1. Following the decline in total ozone between the 1960s and 1990s, levels of total ozone outside the polar regions have stopped decreasing since the late 1990s, consistent with the slow decline of ODSs over the same period.232 Several datasets indicate that total ozone has increased by ~1% since 2000 in the latitude band 60\u00b0S - 60\u00b0N in response to stratospheric ozone recovery. However, there is disagreement about the magnitude and statistical significance of this increase.265 Presumably any increase in ozone would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in surface UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface, by analogy with the increases in UV-B radiation observed for the ozone decline.263 Amounts of total ozone are subject to large year- to-year variability caused by variations in atmospheric circulation. Examples include the unusually high values in 2010 and low values in 2011 in the northern hemisphere mid and high latitudes. Because of these large variations, the relatively small increases in total ozone expected by the recent decline of ODSs are still not statistically significant.33, 42 Without removal of these circulation effects, attribution of ozone recovery to decreases in ODSs would not be detectable even in Antarctica before the period 2017-2021.94, 95 Separation of recent changes of ozone into contributions by ODSs, greenhouse gases (GHG), and natural low-frequency variability Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 3 remains challenging. For example, after removing the variations caused by the solar variability from satellite data for total ozone, the residuals averaged over the band 60\u00b0S- 60\u00b0N show a decline of about 5% between 1980 and 2000, followed by a partial recovery after about 2000.276 However, significant sporadic reductions in total ozone have been observed in geographically localised areas at high latitudes in South America56 and in northern high- and mid-latitudes,152 showing that the ozone depletion problem is not yet fully solved. Analysis of the variability of extreme values in the longest time series of total ozone (Arosa, Switzerland, starting in the 1920s) has revealed an increasing frequency of both low-ozone and high- ozone events, which dominate trends in the 1970s and 1980s. After removal of the extreme events from the original time series, the overall downward trend in the period 1970-1990 is reduced from 2.4% per decade to 0.9 % per decade.196, 197 However, since the extremes are relative to the long-term climatology, the values that were removed also include small values that have been caused by the increase in ODSs during that period. A similar study for Sonnblick, Austria, over a shorter period (1994-2011), revealed a decline in the frequency of low-ozone events and an increase in high-ozone events.76 In the northern hemisphere, the increase in tropospheric ozone from precursors (CO, NO x, and hydrocarbons) since pre-industrial times nearly equals the decrease in stratospheric ozone from increases in ODS s. In the southern hemisphere, the decrease in stratospheric ozone dominates the total ozone column. Currently, the impact of increasing N 2O, a source gas that leads to formation of reactive nitrogen Fig 1. Total column ozone annual mean deviations relative to the 1998 -2008 mean for different latitude bands as derived from different ground - and space -based datasets. Adapted from WMO 2015265 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 4 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 in the stratosphere, on ozone almost cancels the globally averaged increases from climate change effects193 (see discussion below). O ur present understanding is that the present levels of global total ozone are still less than the mean levels in the period 1960-1980. Over most latitudes, total ozone values have stabiliz ed after the mid-1990s, but the year- to-year variability has increased relative to the period before 1990, precluding the unequivocal detection of possible increases expected from the observed decline of ODSs concentrations. Ozone at hi gh latitudes Over the high latitudes (63\u00b0-90\u00b0) of both hemispheres, ozone depletion continues to occur during winter and spring. Compared to average values before 1980, the 2010-2013 mean total ozone is lower by ~27% in the southern hemisphere in October and by ~10% in the northern hemisphere in March.265 The Antarctic ozone hole has continued to appear each spring. The evolution of total ozone in Antarctica over the last decade has been significantly affected by variations in stratospheric temperature and circulation, which have masked the effect of the decreases in ODSs since the early 2000s. With an accurate account of circulation-induced changes, a small (3-8%) increase in total ozone over Antarctica during the last decade is now apparent.135, 203, 204 Even without accounting for these circulation effects, reductions in the severity of ozone depletion in Antarctica since the 1990s are now becoming clear.265 However, uncertainties in methods and measurements preclude a definite conclusion that the recent increases of ozone in Antarctica are due to declining concentrations of ODSs alone.265 Any reversal of total ozone trends is not yet apparent in the Arctic spring, where the largest ever ozone loss was observed in 2011.134, 188 The concentration of ozone in the Arctic stratosphere during spring of 2011 was the lowest since satellite records began in 1979. The minimum daily average column ozone (297 Dobson Units (DU)) was observed in March 2011.19 This value is 18 DU below the previous record-low observed in March 2000, and 100 DU (25%) below the average for 1979-1988. At some locations and times, amounts of total ozone observed between February and April 2011 were more than 50% below the climatological mean.11 The fraction of the Arctic vortex area with total ozone below 275 DU is typically near zero for March, but reached nearly 45% in March 2011.152 In that year, the minimum total ozone in spring was continuously below 250 DU for about 27 days, and values between 220 and 230 DU were observed for about one week in late March,152 leading to increases in UV-B radiation, as discussed later. This large chemically-mediated loss of ozone in the Arctic was the result of an unusually prolonged cold period in the lower stratosphere and an anomalously strong Arctic vortex, which weakened the transport of ozone from middle latitudes111 and facilitated the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). These clouds provide surfaces for heterogeneous reactions that activate stratospheric chlorine, which in turn destroys ozone in catalytic cycles. Temperatures below the threshold for the formation of PSCs of about 77\u00b0C occurred between December 2010 and early April 2011. Over 80% of the ozone present in January from about 18 to 20 km altitude had been chemically destroyed by late March, which is roughly twice that in the previous record-setting winters of 1996 and 2005.152 Chemical and transport anomalies for 2011 stand out as extreme events, greater than 2 (standard deviation), while the total anomaly was nearly 3,111 The amount of ozone loss and the chemistry of the Arctic stratosphere in the spring of 2011 was remarkably similar to that commonly observed in Antarctica, justifying the conclusion that there was an Arctic ozone hole in 2011.82 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 5 There are indications that this Arctic ozone depletion event contributed to the smaller total ozone values recorded at mid-latitude locations. Measurements at 34 European stations revealed that the total ozone over Western Europe from late March to late April 2011 was 15%-25% less than the mean value for this period over the last decade.183 There is no indication that the extreme meteorological conditions that led to the loss of ozone in the Arctic in 2011 were driven by climate change.188 Severe ozone depletion as occurred in 2011 or even worse could possibly happen over the next decades under similar conditions of long-lasting cold stratospheric temperatures.225 The effect of these large reductions of ozone on surface UV-B is discussed later. Effects of depletion and recovery of ozone on climate Changes in stratospheric ozone influence climate both directly through radiative effects and indirectly by affecting stratospheric and tropospheric circulation.265 Ozone depletion has been the dominant driver of globally averaged cooling that occurred in the lower stratosphere during the last part of the 20th century,93 but no statistically significant temperature change has occurred there since the mid-1990s.215, 238 Episodic warming over this period has occurred due to aerosols after major volcanic eruptions.215 Cooling of the stratosphere due to ozone depletion over Antarctica is, in turn, the dominant driver of circulation changes in the southern hemisphere troposphere during summer (see also Chapters 3 and 5). According to model simulations, these changes have led to changes in surface wind patterns, pole-ward shifting of the midlatitude maximum of precipitation119 and increases of moisture in subtropics.106, 118, 119, 200, 229, 256 Opposite effects for the southern hemisphere circulation and climate would be expected for the future from the projected recovery of stratospheric ozone. However, increases in GHGs would compensate partly these ozone recovery-induced effects on climate.6, 120 , 161, 187, 222, 227 For more detailed discussion on the effects of ozone depletion and recovery on climate see the WMO Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2014.265 Indirect effects of climate change on surface UV radiation Climate change may have indirectly influenced the levels of UV radiation in the past by altering the amounts of ozone, UV-absorbing tropospheric gases, aerosols, and clouds in the atmosphere. These influences will likely continue into the future.110, 265 Future changes in the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, either due to melting of sea-ice and ice-caps at high latitudes252 or due to reduced snow-cover may also be important. Cooling of the stratosphere resulting from increased concentrations of CO 2 and other GHGs will lead to greater concentrations of ozone in the future because the destruction rates of ozone in the cooler middle and upper stratosphere, outside the Polar Regions, will decrease. However, at high latitudes, where temperatures in the lower stratosphere may drop below the threshold for the formation of PSCs, heterogeneous chemistry on the surfaces of these clouds in the presence of chlorine can potentially lead to rapid loss of ozone. An example of these processes is the annually recurring springtime Antarctic ozone-hole. For the Arctic, chemistry-climate models (CCM) suggest that, while in the near future there is a chance of low springtime ozone in individual years, there is no indication of a formation of regular Arctic ozone holes.141 Although a much wider area may be susceptible to heterogeneous processes later this century, the projected smaller concentrations of chlorine by that time are expected to moderate the potential for loss of ozone. Increasing concentrations of GHGs will increase the strength of the primary large-scale transport and overturning of the upper atmosphere (the Brewer-Dobson circulation), leading to decreases of ozone in the tropics and increases outside the tropics. Emissions of CH4 and N2O would also affect the Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 6 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 evolution of global stratospheric ozone, particularly in the second half of the 21st century, when concentrations of ODSs are expected to be small.265 The increases of ozone outside the tropics caused by rising concentrations of GHGs will be partly offset by additional chemical destruction arising from anthropogenic emissions of N2O.191 Clouds respond to climate-forcing mechanisms in multiple ways, and feedbacks of clouds can be positive or negative. Climate change is projected to reduce the amount of clouds in the future over most of the tropics and mid-latitudes, due mostly to reductions in low clouds.110 Changes in clouds in the marine boundary layer are most uncertain. Over higher latitudes (>50\u00b0), increases in fraction of cloud cover and optical depth are projected. These would increase the amount of solar UV radiation scattered back to space and, therefore, reduce the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Furthermore, clouds play a critical role in the climate system, since they can increase the planetary albedo, thereby counteracting global warming, but they can also contribute to warming of the troposphere through absorption of infrared radiation emitted from the surface. Reductions in the fraction of ice and snow cover, as well as changes in their characteristics (e.g., thickness of ice, depth of snow) may influence the exposure of ecosystems to solar UV radiation mainly through: (a) less UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface due to reduced surface reflectivity (see Surface reflec tivity, below) leading to less exposure; and/or (b) greater exposure to UV radiation for systems formerly under the ice or snow if that protective cover diminishes. Complete removal of ice would lead to much greater exposure to UV-B radiation, because transmittance of UV-B radiation through the existing snow-covered ice is much smaller than 1%.144 Recent observations in the Arctic suggest that the summer melt season starts earlier, the winter freeze occurs later, the areal extent of the ice has decreased, and more ice is failing to last through the summer.44, 136, 153, 179 Under such conditions, it has been estimated that over the course of one melt season nearly 40% more solar radiation would enter the ocean system.181 In recent years the extent of the northern ocean's ice cover has declined, with large interannual variability;21 while in Antarctica the sea-ice has been expanding since the 1980s.179 T he combined direct or indirect effects of these climate change-related factors would likely influence the levels of solar UV radiation in the future and modulate the effects of the projected recovery of ozone. This interaction, which depends on latitude and on the emissions of GHGs, increases the complexity of assessing the future levels of solar UV radiation at the Earth's surface. Projections for these factors by climate models can be used to estimate the UV radiation in the future; however, with large uncertainty, as discussed later. Other factors affecting UV radiation As UV radiation propagates through the atmosphere, in addition to being affected by ozone, it is modified through absorption and scattering by atmospheric constituents, including aerosols and clouds, and by reflections on the Earth's surface. The effects of the most important factors are discussed in the following sections based on established knowledge and on new findings, in order to assess the relative importance of those factors on UV irradiance that reaches the surface in the context of ozone and climate changes. In addition to UV-B irradiance, the erythemally weighted irradiance (UVERY) and the UV Index (UVI), both defined below in \"Biological effects of UV radiation\", are used in the following as these quantities appear frequently in the cited literature. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 7 Aerosols Aerosols (particles suspended in the atmosphere) interact with solar photons and thus can have a significant effect on atmospheric transmission of solar radiation (see also Chapter 6). These particles may be natural (e.g., wind-generated dust and sea salt), anthropogenic (e.g., sulfate, soot, and organic particles), or a mixture of both. The particles scatter and absorb sunlight, with relative probabilities that are complex functions of their size, shape, and chemical composition. They have important effects on air quality and climate, and a considerable body of knowledge has been developed on their sources, properties, and sinks.109, 166 Observational methods include evaluation of trends in visibility,34, 62, 201, 202, 251, 266 in-situ determination of size-resolved chemical and thermodynamic properties,32, 43, 114, 142 and remote global-scale detection from ground-based networks and satellite platforms. The AERONET network provides total (scattering + absorption) aerosol optical depth, , at a wavelength of 340 nm as well as several visible wavelengths ; but absorption optical depths, abs, are only available at wavelengths of 440 nm and longer .63, 88 Satellite-based instruments measuring aerosols include the MISR, MODIS and CALIOP.117, 174, 194 Global climatologies of aerosols have been developed based largely on satellite observations.126, 273 Many observations have documented reductions in ground-level UV irradiances in the presence of aerosols.30, 86, 133, 263 Reductions range from a few percent or less at non-polluted locations, such as New Zealand,146, 155 to over 50% in polluted cities, such as Mexico City,176 and can be more than 90% for biomass burning aerosols, such as in Russia in 2010.36 The reductions are typically greater at UV than at visible wavelengths, implying that the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is larger at these wavelengths as well. Quantitative effects depend on aerosol type, and enhancements compared with clear-skies may even occur in some conditions, such as in bright scattering hazes.61 Extrapolation from visible wavelengths is often based on a simple power model for AOD: , w here , the \u00c5ngstr \u00f6m exponent, p arameterizes the strength of the wavelength dependence and has typical values between 0.5 and 2.0 at visible wavelengths .63 Extrapolation to UV wavelengths is often a reasonable approximation for scattering but less so for absorption, which is more dependent on chemical composition. Some aerosols (e.g., sea salt, sulfate, and nitrate) have negligible absorption at visible as well as at UV-A (315 - 400 nm) and UV-B wavelengths. For dust and soot, the absorption spectrum is suffic iently broad that UV properties can be estimated by extrapolation from visible wavelengths. However, for organic aerosols, the state of knowledge is extremely poor, as these particles, depending on their origin and environmental conditions (e.g., humidity), have highly variable chemical composition. So called \"brown carbon,\" mostly composed of combustion-derived organic aerosols, is now recognized as a significant contributor to climate radiative forcing due to its absorption of solar radiation at visible wavelengths72, and is likely to have even larger effects on UV spectra. Measurements on organic particles derived from burning of biomass show \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponents for absorption as high as 6-7 when extrapolated into the UV range,103, 127 and UV mass absorption coefficients in the range 1-10 m2 g-1, the latter value approaching that of black carbon. The total AOD includes both scattering and absorption, but it is predominately the absorption that is most important in reducing the intensity of UV at the Earth's surface. For example, decreases in AOD account for 4.2% of the UV-A irradiance increase at Thessaloniki during 1998-2006, while the additional Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 8 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 2% increase can only be explained if the absorption efficiency of aerosols has also decreased over that period.122 The relative importance of scattering is defined by the single scattering albedo (SSA), sca sca sca abs , so that the scattering component is \u00d7 w hile the absorption component is (1 - )\u00d7. Based on radiative transfer model calculations (TUV, http://acd.ucar.edu/TUV ) with typical input parameters (TOC: 300 DU, solar zenith angle (SZA): 20\u00b0, surface reflectivity: 0.05,), Fig. 2 illustrates how clear-sky surface erythemal irradiance (UV ERY) depends on the total AOD and on SSA, for different target orientations. With non-absorbing aerosols ( = 1), reductions are small and enhancements can even occur for vertically oriented cylindrical surfaces. In contrast, strongly absorbing aerosols ( = 0.6) cause significant reductions in radiation regardless of target geometry. Direct measurements of at UV wavelengths are difficult because the absorption by aerosols co-occurs with scattering, and with absorption by gases, especially ozone, but, also NO2, or SO2 at UV- B wavelengths. Fig. 3 presents a summary of such studies. Values below 400 nm cluster near 0.8 - 0.9, below typical visible values of about 0.9 or larger. The different results are almost certainly due to different aerosol types present, and more recent studies noted strong UV absorption in biomass-burning aerosols.36, 50, 103 A likely explanation for this enhanced absorption of UV is the presence of organic material in the particles. A major new insight of the past decade is that organic aerosols (OA) are more abundant than previously thought, often exceeding the concentrations of sulfate aerosols.97, 114, 274 They have both natural and anthropogenic sources, the largest being the photo-oxidation of hydrocarbons emitted by vegetation, but other major sources include combustion of biomass, and the production and use of fossil fuels. Many UV- absorbing organic chromophores have been identified in collected aerosol and rain samples, including conjugated carbonyls and nitrates.23, nitroaromatics,59, 275 and organic peroxides.66 Laboratory-generated OA, such as from smog chamber simulations of the oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons, are found to absorb below 400 nm but not necessarily at visible wavelengths.140 Atmospheric aging of OA also appears to increase UV absorption244, although photo- bleaching has also been reported.199 Therefore, OA have the potential to induce large variations in surface UV radiation, but quantification is still very uncertain and caution should be used when estimating changes in UV radiation in regions where large concentrations of these organic particles are found. Fig 2. Variation of UV ERY with aerosol optical depth, for different values of the single scattering albedo, , and different receiver geometries (horizontal, spherical, and vertical cylinder). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 9 Trends in aerosols over the past few decades have been derived from analysis of surface radiation network data and satellite-based observations. Decreases in aerosols have occurred over the US and much of Europe35, 233 and the associated brightening has been detected at visible and UV wavelengths.58, 164, 271 However, increases in aerosols have occurred in South and East Asia.268, 273 In some cases, the mass concentrations of aerosols have decreased but the AOD has still increased due to a shift in the size distribution of the aerosol particles.254 Historical (1850-2000) reconstructions of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols have been derived summarising the known historical changes.139 Future trends of aerosols are of great interest to climate studies, and scenarios spanning a large range of uncertainties have been developed.14, 228 Global emissions of sulfate may already have peaked two decades ago and may now be decreasing, while those of fossil fuel black and organic carbon are expected to peak in the next few decades. Evaluation of the effects on UV radiation is relatively straightforward for sulfate and black carbon, but is highly uncertain for organics, especially if these absorb UV as discussed above. In many cases, it is difficult to separate anthropogenic from natural influences, for example, changes in dust or sea salt from winds affected by climate change, or changes in biogenic aerosols following deforestation or other major changes in land use. This adds uncertainty to future projections because of the challenges in modeling the complex interactions. Clouds Clouds play an important role in modifying the solar UV radiation that is received at the Earth's surface, generally leading to attenuation, but in some conditions to enhancement. A recent example of the latter is from measurements in Spain, which have shown that clouds can enhance UVERY by up to 22%.57 Reductions of irradiance depends on cloud cover, depth and type (water/ice), and can be Fig. 3 Summary of available measurements of aerosol single scattering albedo, , at climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 10 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 moderated by surface reflectivity, particularly when the latter is high (e.g., snow, ice), leading to increased irradiance at the surface through multiple scattering of radiation (see discussion in next section). Effects of clouds are more pronounced in the visible than in UV wavelengths. Even under skies covered completely with clouds, the UVI can still be high: maximum UVI values close to 10 and average values of about 3 were measured at an urban location in Brazil (19.9\u00b0S; 858 m altitude) under overcast conditions, predominantly of cumulus clouds.223 Typical noon UVI values at this location under cloud- free skies are about 8.3. Cirrus clouds are formed of relatively large ice crystals which efficiently scatter the solar radiation towards the ground, with only small losses compared with the clear-sky case. According to model calculations based on global estimates of optical depth of cirrus clouds averaged over the period 1984-2007, surface UV-B radiation has been attenuated on average by up to ~2% compared to clear skies.124 In the Arctic region, clouds could be affected by the loss of sea-ice. Based on satellite data for the period 2000-2010, a 1% decrease in sea-ice cover leads to a 0.36-0.47% increase in cloud cover, suggesting that a further decline in sea-ice cover would result in an even cloudier Arctic.148 Due to the complexity of the processes involved, it is difficult to simulate the impact on UV radiation from the combined reduction in sea-ice and increase in cloudiness. The spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of clouds makes it difficult to accurately assess and quantify their effects on radiation. Thus empirical parameterizations are often used to describe their effect, such as the cloud modification factor (CMF), which is defined as the ratio between the measured surface irradiance to the corresponding clear-sky value. It describes the average effect of clouds, implicitly taking into account the optical thickness of clouds (COT). A clear exponential dependence between the CMF derived from UV measurements and the COT from a Cimel sun-photometer was found; for COT between 10 and 50 the CMF ranged from 0.7 to 0.25.4 Since our last assessment243 there has been little new information on how clouds affect the solar UV radiation received at the Earth's surface. Experimental evidence is constrained by the uncertainty in the measurements and by the complexity of the cloud characteristics. Climate change is projected to alter the amount of clouds over particular areas and, as the ozone layer recovers, clouds will have an important role in controlling the future levels of solar UV radiation that would be available for the ecosystems. Surface reflectivity The reflectivity of the Earth's surface, usually referred to as \"surface albedo\", is defined as the ratio of the reflected to the incident amount of radiation. The radiation reflected upwards from the surface undergoes subsequent scattering by air molecules and particles, resulting in enhancement of the irradiance at the surface. These effects are greater when the surface is covered by highly reflecting material, such as snow or ice. Most materials have low UV reflectivity, with only snow and ice having UV reflectivity greater than 0.5, whereas many surfaces have relatively high reflectivity in the visible. Consequently, effects of ice and snow are more readily apparent for radiation in the UV than in the visible region. The sea-surface also reflects radiation impinging on the water, but less effectively compared to snow and ice. The roughness of surfaces also affects their reflectivity. The fraction of reflected radiation generally increases with the angle of incidence of the photons; hence it depends on season and latitude. In the Arctic and Antarctica, this effect becomes more important due to the larger SZAs and the prevalence of diffuse radiation in these regions. Spectral measurements of UV irradiance at Ny \u00c5lesund, Svalbard, (79\u00b0N) revealed an enhancement in clear-sky irradiance at 320 nm of about 15% between two sites affected differently by the reflectivity of the snow-covered surface and the partially ice-covered ocean. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 11 The effect was doubled under overcast conditions.128 Deposition of black carbon aerosols on snow or ice may substantially reduce the reflectivity, resulting in weaker solar irradiance at the surface. For example during the snow-melt period, the reflectivity at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland, decreased from 0.65 to 0.45 at 330 nm and from 0.72 to 0.53 at 450 nm, partly due to deposition of black and organic carbon.163 In mountainous regions, reflections of radiation may occur both on the surface (usually covered by snow) and from the top of clouds located below the altitude of the site, while multiple reflections may occur between snow-covered surfaces and the base of the clouds. These complex processes can result in considerable enhancements of incident irradiance. At Sonnblick, Austria, clouds below the observatory increased the average reflectivity by 0.28 \u00b1 0.15, leading to increases in irradiance between 2% and 14% in most (~75%) of the investigated cases. Compared to snow-free conditions, enhancement of 22% in irradiance at 305 nm arose from a mean reflectivity of 0.68 under clear-sky conditions. Analysis of total sky images revealed that enhancements can also be observed when the solar disk was obstructed by clouds or under overcast skies.224 In the context of climate change, reductions in surface reflectivity due to melting snow or ice would result in reduction of irradiance over land, but to enhancement of irradiance received at and under the sea-surface in regions where sea-ice disappears. This situation may occur, for example, in the Arctic during the summer period in the 2030s.252 Model simulations for several scenarios suggest that snow depth in April on Arctic sea-ice would decrease over the 21st century due mainly to the loss of sea-ice area in autumn and, to a lesser extent, in winter,101 which results in smaller snow accumulation. When snow depth becomes shallower, reflectivity is reduced and, in turn, the UV radiation at the surface is also reduced, while more radiation is transmitted through the ice below the snow. The sea-ice cover of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the Arctic is currently undergoing a fundamental shift from multiyear ice to first-year ice, which is generally thinner and spatially heterogeneous with a more complex pattern of reflection and transmission of solar radiation.79, 181 When annual Arctic sea-ice starts melting, it becomes less reflective than old ice, leading to reductions in UV irradiance at the surface. In Antarctica, sea ice is generally expanding rather than shrinking. This expansion is not uniform, but varies regionally. Glaciers in western Antarctica have become thinner230 and loss of ice sheets is projected for the future in this region.115, 198 Reductions in surface reflectivity are expected to play an important role for the levels of UV radiation in the future over areas that in the past were covered by ice or snow, such as the high and polar latitudes and the high mountains. Implications can be expected for ecosystems in these areas, either from the reduced (mainly terrestrial systems) or from the enhanced (mainly aquatic systems) exposure to UV radiation. Over other regions, except over smaller, high-reflecting areas (e.g., salt lakes affected by dust deposition), the changes in reflectivity are likely to be small and thus unlikely to have a significant effect on UV. Solar activity Solar activity, particularly the 11-year solar cycle, influences UV-B radiation that penetrates to the surface of the Earth, mainly through changes induced in stratospheric ozone, rather than direct ly due to increased solar emission. In the upper stratosphere, solar activity affects the photochemical production of ozone by UV-C (200-280 nm), while in the lower stratosphere it affects ozone predominantly by changing the atmospheric circulation.104 This latter effect is the most important for UV radiation at Earth's surface because it occurs in the layer where ozone is abundant. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 12 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Recent observations from the SIM and SOLSTICE instruments onboard the SORCE satellite revealed an 'exceptionally' low minimum in the solar activity, with larger reductions in the emitted UV- C radiation during the declining phase of the 11-year solar cycle (2004-2008) than at the same phase of previous solar cycles.150 These reductions were about 8 times larger than expected by semi-empirical models.91, 92 The inconsistencies of these observations with the perception of variations in solar irradiance from earlier measurements and models have been assessed recently,67 along with the relevant implications for the variability of sratospheric and total ozone. Inclusion of these new observations of solar variability in photochemical models and in CCMs revealed decreases of ozone in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere (related to photochemical processes), allowing penetration of more UV-B radiation to lower altitudes in the stratosphere and below. However, it has been suggested that penetration of UV-C in the lower stratosphere will enhance the ozone production there (self-healing effect), and in turn reduce UV- B radiation penetration to Earth's surface.91, 234 The net effect on UV- B has not yet been quantified. Recent studies1, 149, 151, 175, 231 suggest that solar activity may evolve into a declining phase in the course of the 21 st century resulting in weaker emission of solar UV radiation. CCM simulations for the future showed that such strong reductions in UV-C radiation would lead to significant decreases in the production of stratospheric ozone from the photolysis of oxygen. This would slow down the recovery of stratospheric ozone by more than 10years or even cancel it,2 leading to greater levels of UV-B radiation at the ground for as long as the concentrations of stratospheric ozone remain small. These effects are most pronounced in the region between about 40\u00b0S and 40\u00b0N, where UV-B radiation is already high, and would be likely reinforced by the projected strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Detection of the effects of solar activity on surface UV radiation measurements is difficult, as they are masked by stronger natural variations due to other factors. An average decrease of about 1.8\u00b11.0% in ground-level irradiance from solar maximum to solar minimum for the UV-A and 2.4\u00b11.9% for the 400-600 nm spectral band was reported by correlating 17 years of spectral solar irradiance measurements at the South Pole with the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (indicative of the 11-year solar activity).78 As the effects appear too large to originate directly from differences in the radiation emitted by t he Sun, it was suggest ed that the se decreases are partly due to a small variation in atmospheric attenuation with the solar cycle, with the greatest attenuation occurring at solar minimum. However, there is no experimental proof of this suggestion. Although direct influence of solar activity to UV radiation at the surface is small, indirect effects, through changes in the production of ozone, can be more important. If a substantial solar minimum occur s in the future, it may influence global climate and the ozone layer, and could lead to increases in UV- B radiation at the surface. UV radiation changes and trends derived from measurements Measurements of UV radiation Ground-based. With few exceptions, e.g., 15, 38 coordinated measurements of UV radiation from the ground started in the late 1980s after the discovery of the ozone hole.69 It is therefore not possible to directly assess changes in UV radiation for the entire period between the 1960s (i.e., the time before concentrations of ODSs in the atmosphere became important) and the present. Several ground-based networks now provide data records in excess of 20 years with instruments deployed in the U.S.,81, 125 Canada,74, 96 South America,28, 60 Europe,131, 164, 211, 220, 245 New Zealand,155, 156 Australia,87 the Arctic,20 and Antarctica.17 Relatively few measurements have been performed historically in Africa, the Middle East, Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 13 and Asia, but several programs have recently been established in Nepal,218 Thailand,26, 112 and China.105 By the mid-1990s, the technology of UV radiation measurements with spectroradiometers had already reached a level of accuracy that would allow the detection of changes in UV of a few percent at stations with appropriate quality control protocols.257 A European project has been completed which aimed to provide traceable solar UV irradiance measurements with an uncertainty of less than 2% (http://projects.pmodwrc.ch/env03/). However the methods developed in this activity have not yet been implemented in operational UV monitoring. Recently, array spectrometers have been adapted for spectral irradiance measurements in the UV. These instruments have been used to quantify the effects of solar UV-B radiation in terrestrial ecosystems (see Chapter 3). However, being single monochromators, they are susceptible to stray light problems in the UV- B.129, 212 Efforts have been made to determine the uncertainty of this type of instruments.45, 46 Because of their large uncertainties compared to scanning spectroradiometers, these instruments are not yet widely used in UV monitoring programs. Spectroradiometric measurements of UV irradiance on a flat, horizontal surface are most common and generally considered the most accurate method to quantify UV radiation. However, this geometry is not the most appropriate to gauge exposure levels of humans and most animals because the anatomical distribution of UV exposure is highly heterogeneous, poorly correlated to surface irradiance, and, in the case of humans, influenced by factors such as posture, orientation to the Sun (see Fig. 2), skin color, clothing, and other sun-protective behaviors.247 In principle, the most accurate method to quantify human exposure is to measure the incident solar spectral radiance distribution (which may originate from the Sun, the sky, and radiation scattered upward from the ground) and integrate this distribution over all exposed parts of the human body.214 The development of a system capable of measuring sky radiance at different zenith and azimuth angles within seconds rather than minutes enables new possibilities to study the spectral influence of fast changing cloud conditions without the disadvantages of scanning instruments.195 This method is still under development and has not yet been reported for exposure studies. In an alternative approach,247 measured global-horizontal, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal and upwelling irradiance, were combined with a three-dimensional numerical model of the human body to calculate exposure. An important conclusion of this study as well as of Seckmeyer et al.214 was that the contribution of diffuse UV radiation to total sun exposure is larger than commonly expected, explaining almost 80% of the cumulative annual exposure dose. Satellite based. The estimation of UV irradiance at the ground has been repeatedly undertaken from various satellite-borne sensors.7, 54, 147 As these products are mainly derived by models fed with measured or estimated radiation-related parameters, they are associated with relatively large uncertainties, which vary ac cording to location, season, atmospheric situation and the characteristics of the satellite instrument. Known sources of errors that affect the accuracy of the derived surface UV irradiance include: absorption and scattering by tropospheric aerosols, inhomogeneities of clouds, assumptions or estimations of the surface reflectivity, variability of altitude within the sub-satellite pixel, various modeling parameterizations, and the inability by current satellites to distinguish between clouds and surfaces covered with snow and/or ice. It is important to note that ground-based observations are point measurements while satellite observations are representative for a pixel of several square kilometers. This difference must be taken into account when comparing satellite- and ground-based measurements ; particularly when the ground-based instrument is located in a non-homogenous area (e.g., mountains). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 14 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 In the previous assessment243 it was noted that, although satellites have the advantage of near global coverage, satellite-borne instruments cannot adequately probe the boundary layer (approximately the lowest 1-2 km) of the atmosphere. Therefore, they tend to overestimate UV radiation when absorbing aerosols are present,7 particularly under clear skies. In a recent study in Santiago, Chile, a city with heavy air pollution and complex surrounding topography, this effect was quantified, reporting an average overestimation of UVI by about 46 % from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) for the period 1995-2007, and by about 47% from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for the period 2005- 2007.28 These results were qualitatively confirmed by two other studies.47, 54 Similar results were found for four locations in Thailand,26 with average biases between 40% and 60%. Smaller biases were reported for locations with smaller aerosol concentrations. In France, UVI derived fro m OMI and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, (GOME-2) was found larger by about 6% during 2008-2009,113 while in Southern Spain for the period 2004-2008, the average bias was about 12%, rising to 19% for days with large aerosol optical depth (>0.25 at 440 nm).3 The UVI derived from TOMS has been also compared with ground-based data at 27 stations of the USDA network, showing results consistent with the above studies, with an average positive bias in the satellite estimates of the order of 15% over all sites. Under clear skies, the biases can be either negative (up to 3.4%) or positive (up to ~24%), depending on the am ounts of tropospheric aerosols and UV-absorbing air pollutants.267 Comparison of satellite retrievals of UV irradiance from OMI with UV spectra measured at six Austrian sites with altitudes ranging between ~600 and ~3100 m concluded that the satellite estimates were significantly smaller (average ratio 0.89, range 0.6-1.35) for most stations due to erroneous correction for effects of cloud s.250 In contrast, under cloud-free conditions, the satellite data were closer to the ground-based measurements, but they cannot distinguish between mountain and valley sites due to the large variability in altitude within a short horizontal distance, smaller than the size of a pixel. The main deficiencies in the satellite retrieval algorithm arose from the incorrect determination of the effective surface altitude and albedo due to the complex topography. Such deficiencies have been taken into consideration in the Semi-Analytical Cloud Retrieval Algorithm (SACURA) in which the background spectral albedo is properly specified and cloud parameters are derived from the infrared sensors of the satellite.177 Comparisons of estimates based on satellite data and radiative transfer modelling with observations at two locations in Belgium reveal ed a good agreement with correlation coefficients 0.88 and 0.91 for UV-B and UV-A irradiance respectively. Variations of UV radiation in time and space UV radiation at the Earth's surface varies with season, time of day, latitude, and altitude. It is also affected by the absorption and scattering processes from atmospheric constituents, as discussed above. Latitudinal variations in annual doses of UV-B and UV-A have been assessed with high- resolution measurements from ground-based spectroradiometers that comply with the quality standards of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC)154 (Fig. 4). For all sites, the annual averages were derived from at least 10 years over periods where trends in irradiance were small. As expected, doses of UV-B and UV-A are generally largest close to the equator and smallest at high latitudes. Doses at high-altitude sites (South Pole, Mauna Loa, Boulder and Summit) are larger than for sites located at similar latitudes but at sea level.263 This is most obvious when comparing data from Barrow (71.3\u00b0N; 8 m altitude) and Summit (72.6\u00b0N; 3202 m altitude), where the annual doses of UV- B and UV-A at the latter site are about 58% and 83% larger due to higher elevation and different surface reflectivity, respectively. Surface reflectivity in the order of 0.98 also contributes to the relatively large Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 15 doses at the South Pole and Summit, while attenuation of UV radiation by aerosols is responsible for the relatively low dose at Tokyo. Latitudinal gradients are stronger in the UV-B than the UV-A region, partly because photons travel a longer path through the atmosphere for the lower solar elevations prevailing at higher latitudes, allowing greater absorption of UV-B radiation by ozone. Another factor contributing to the differences in gradients of UV-B and UV-A is the relatively small ozone column in the tropics. As a consequence, the ratio of annual dose of UV-B/UV-A is roughly 0.03 close to the equator, 0.02 at mid- latitude sites and less than 0.02 at high latitudes (Fig, 4, lower panel). It is interesting to note that the UV- B/UV-A ratios are not very different in polluted locations, such as Tokyo, compared with clean-air sites, suggesting that the optical depth of aerosols in the UV-B is not very different from that in the UV- A region, and/or that the wavelength dependence of the single scattering albedo throughout the UV region is small (see Fig. 3). It has long been known that mid-latitude UV levels in summer are larger in the southern than in the northern hemisphere.209 Factors contributing to this disparity include the smaller Sun-Earth distance during the southern-hemisphere summer, plus smaller ozone columns and less attenuation by aerosols at southern latitudes. However, for annual doses, the hemispherical differences are relatively small (Fig. 4, upper panel). Satellite observations indicate that the greatest UV levels at the surface of the Earth occur in the Altiplano region of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina, where the UVI in summer may exceed 20.269 The large UV levels in this region can be attributed to small SZA, overhead Sun, small total ozone, high elevation (hence less aerosol and unrestricted horizon), and minimum Earth-Sun separation in the austral summer. These findings have recently been confirmed by ground-based spectroradiometric measurements at the Chajnantor Plateau (23\u00b0S, 67\u00b0W; 5100 m altitude) of the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile.48 The measured UVI peaked at a value of 20 under broken cloud conditions and was 18 for clear skies. Very high UVI values were reported for locations in Tibet in 2008-2010.170 The measured monthly mean UVI in July was 14.5 in Tingri (28.7\u00b0N; 4335 m altitude) and 12.9 in Lhasa (29.7\u00b0N; 3683 m altitude), with a peak value of 20.6 in Ti ngri. Extremely high UV levels (UVI of up to 19 for clear sky and up to 22 under broken cloud conditions) were also measured at sea-level in the tropical Pacific (3.6\u00b0S, 85\u00b0W), when total ozone was 234 DU.71 These values are more than double those that are common at northern mid-latitudes in summer.70 More recently, UVI values higher than 40 have been reported at Licancabur, Bolivia (5916 m altitude).29 However, these data are inconsistent with the satellite-derived ozone columns. Further work is needed to verify the result. Fig. 4 Latitudinal variation of UV -A (315 -400 nm) and UV -B (280 - 315 nm) annual dose (top) and the ratio of UV -B/UV -A dose (bottom). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 16 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 During the Arctic spring of 2011, when total ozone was extremely small, greatly increased levels of UV radiation were recorded at thirteen Arctic and sub-Arctic ground stations. Measurements of the noontime UVI during the low-ozone episode exceeded the climatological mean by up to 77% at locations in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, and by up to 161% in Scandinavia.20 The cumulative UV dose integrated over the duration of the low-ozone period increased by 40-50% at several sites in the Arctic and Scandinavia, and exceeded the climatological mean by more than 3 at seven sites and by more than 4 at two sites. Despite these large relative enhancements, absolute UV anomalies remained small (less t han 0.5 UVI units at the western-hemisphere sites) or moderate (1.0 and 2.2 UVI units at the Scandinavian sites) because the low-ozone episode occurred at a time when the Sun was still low in the sky. In Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, the UV increases can be explained by low ozone, but at the Scandinavian sites, they were caused by a combination of low ozone and the absence of clouds. Despite the low absolute levels of UV radiation at northern polar latitudes, biological systems during this Arctic event may have been exposed to greater UV than usually experienced. The small ozone values observed in 2011 in the Arctic propagated to midlatitudes and, as a consequence, ozone columns over Western Europe were 15-25% below the long-term mean between late March and late April 2011.183 Model assessments suggest that noontime erythemal doses on clear-sky days were larger than usual by about 25% during the affected period. However, such increases have not been confirmed by measurement, so far. Furthermore, it was found from ground-based and satellite observations that the interannual variability in springtime ozone in the Arctic was correlated with ozone in the summer and explain ed 20- 40% of the summer UV variability at some locations.121 Particularly for spring 2011, it was estimated that the massive ozone depletion in the Arctic increased the March-August cumulative erythemal clear-sky UV dose in the northern hemisphere outside the tropics by 3-4% compared to the climatological mean, with about 75% of the increase accumulated after the breakup of the polar vortex. Unusually large UV levels were observed between 11 and 30 November 2009 over the southern tip of South America (~55\u00b0S) when the center of the Antarctic vortex became stagnant just south of South America for a three-week period, leading to ozone columns continuously more than 2 below average. Ground-based measurements for three stations located in this region showed UVI values of 10 to 14, which, for clear-skies, typically only occur at latitudes lower than 40\u00b0in the northern hemisphere.56 Analysis of 30 years of satellite observations revealed that this event was unique for the latitude belt of 52\u00b0to 56\u00b0 S. In August 2011, southern Australia was affected by ozone-poor air originating from tropical latitudes, resulting in measured UVERY levels of up to 40% greater than normal.87 This is an example where meteorological factors have produced anomalous reduction of ozone on an almost continental scale and longer duration than previously observed. The combined effect of all the factors discussed previously may result in very high levels of UV radiation at mid and low latitudes, primarily at high-altitude locations. These high-UV episodes will continue to occur in the future during low-ozone periods, irrespective of the recovery of ozone. Observed long-term changes in UV radiation In view of the expected rebound of stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery to levels before the 1980s, an important question is whether this change is reflected in the trends of UV radiation measurements. At most locations, any trends are currently still below the detection threshold imposed by instrument Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 17 uncertainties and variabilities due to factors other than ozone, such as changes in aerosols, clouds and surface reflectivity. For example, over the period of the peak ozone depletion between the 1980s and 1990s, ozone and cloud effects contributed equally to the UVI increases over populated areas of the northern mid-latitudes.143 Long-term changes in UV radiation can be estimated both from space and the ground. Satellite observations have large uncertainties as discussed above. Changes in UV radiation at different spectral bands over the period 1979 to 2008 have been derived from a series of polar orbiting satellite instruments for the latitude range of 55\u00b0S to 55\u00b0 N,99 and results were summarized in the last assessment.157, 243 A similar study for the time period 1997-2010 based on measurements of three satellites (TOMS/Nimbus 7, TOMS/Earth Probe and OMI)108 has qualitatively confirmed the earlier work by Herman.99 Over this later time period, the derived linear trends in erythemal irradiance (same for UVI) ranged between 0 and +5% per decade between 50\u00b0S and 50\u00b0N. These positive trends are significant at the 95% level with the exception of the equatorial zone and winter months of both hemispheres. Largest increases were observed during spring and summer at mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere where the largest decrease of ozone was observed (Fig. 5). However, most of the UVERY changes due to ozone have occurred during the 1980s and the early 1990s; therefore, the calculated linear trends do not necessarily reflect a tendency in ozone that would continue into the future. At high-latitudes, satelli te-based estimates of surface UV radiation can be too low by up to 50%, when high albedo from snow and ice cover is misinterpreted as clouds.235 These systematic errors can also affect UV trend assessments. For example, it is difficult to quantify changes in UV radiation from space measurements over high-latitude locations that are affected by sea-ice variability.99 For these reasons the trends discussed above were derived only for latitudes lower than 55\u00b0. The combined effect of the surface reflectivity (RS), clouds, water haze, and aerosols on UV-A radiation, which is not affected by ozone, can be inferred by the, so-called, \"Lambertian equivalent reflectivity\" (LER), which represents the equivalent scene reflectivity as seen from space after removal of Rayleigh scattering effects.137 The atmospheric transparency T is approximately T = (100LER)/(100 - RS), where LER and RS are expressed in percent. Because the reflectivity of most surfaces is small (typically 2-4 % over land), a decrease of LER will lead to an increase in T by approximately the same amount. The LER at 340 nm during the past 33 years (1979- 2011) has recently been analyzed globally100 and changes in surface irradiance at 340 nm, but without accounting for effects of local air pollution sources, can be inferred from this study. Between 1979 and Fig. 5 Monthly linear trends (%/decade) of erythemal irradiance derived from TOMS and OMI data from 1979 to 2010 according to Ialongo et al.108 All trends are positive. The data are zonally averaged for every 5\u00b0 of latitude from 50\u00b0 S to 50\u00b0 N and represent mostly changes that have occurred in the first half of this period, when ozone depletion was progressing. Adapted from Ialongo et al.108 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 18 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 2011, most of the decreases in LER (resulting in an increase of surface radiation) occurred over land, with the largest wide-spread decreases taking place over the US (0.97% per decade), Brazil (0.9 % per decade), and Europe (1.4 - 1.9 % per decade). Over India, southern China, and Indochina, LER has increased by 1- 1.5 % per decade (Fig. 6). A trend that is twice as large was observed on the west coast of South America, but there was almost no change over most of Australia. These trends can be translated into downward trends in UV-A radiation, caused only by changes in cloudiness and partly in aerosols. In the ocean region near the Antarctic Peninsula (160\u00b0 W - 50\u00b0W), LER has decreased strongly ( >2% per decade), probably due to changes in clouds and sea-ice. Neither of these studies took account the effects of absorbing aerosols in the estimates of irradiance. Therefore, these trend estimates may not accurately reflect changes for regions where concentrations of absorbing aerosols and air pollutants have changed over time, such as in urban areas. The variability of solar UV irradiance at 305 and 325 nm between 1990 and 2011 has been assessed from ground-based measurements at twelve sites in Canada, Europe, and Japan (latitudes between 25\u00b0N to 60\u00b0N).272 For these sites at least, this period can be divided into three sub-periods that are characterized by different physical processes. UV radiation decreased during the first period (1991-1994), greatly affected by stratospheric aerosols from the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991. The volcanic stratospheric aerosol layer had two effects: it induced destruction of ozone through heterogeneous chemical reactions249 and reduced the path-length of UV-B solar radiation through the ozone layer for small solar elevations due to increased scattering by the aerosols.16 Both mechanisms led to an increase in UV-B at the surface after the eruption in1991, which became smaller in the next years as the aerosol effect decayed. The second period (1995-2006) was characterized by a 1.4% per decade increase in total ozone, coinciding with a significant decline of the aerosol optical depth over the regions of study. This \"brightening\" effect (increase of the atmospheric transparency T) more than offset the effect of the increase in ozone, resulting in positive UV trends of 9.4% per decade at 305 nm and 8.8% per decade at 325 nm. The third period (2007-2011) showed statistically significant evidence of a slowdown or turning point in the upward trends in UV-B radiation over Canada, Europe, and Japan. These results are consistent with the decrease in LER seen from satellites (Fig. 6) and observations of surface shortwave (300-3000 nm) solar irradiance, which indicate that the brightening effect \u2014 which started in the late 1980s and is mostly attributed to changes in cloudiness and aerosols \u2014 has slowed down during the last few years or is no longer progressing.10, 110, 185, 205 However, since some of the sites discussed above272 are located in urban areas affected by air pollution, results cannot be simply applied to a global scale or to sites located at higher altitudes, where aerosols may evolve differently or remain constant.172 Fig. 6 Trends in LER (combined reflectivity from clouds, aerosols, and the surface) as seen from space. Trends in LER smaller than 0.3% per decade are not statistically significant from zero. Negative trends in LER lead to positive trends in UV -A by approximatel y the same amount. Trends in LER outside Polar Regions are caused by clouds and not aerosols. A dapted from Herman et al .100 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 19 Several recent studies reported positive trends in UV at European sites caused by reduction in cloud cover are consistent with satellite observations (Fig. 6). A statistically significant increasing trend of 6.6% per decade in daily maximum UVI from 1993 to 2008 was found for Reading, United Kingdom, presumably caused by reduction in midday clouds, since ozone remained constant.226 Increases in erythemal dose of 5.5\u00b11.0% (1) per decade were found for April-October in the period 1976-2008 from ground-based UV measurement at Belsk, Poland (51\u00b0N).131 At both locations, the total ozone levels had stopped declining in the mid-1990s, and the observed increases in UV were attributed to decreasing attenuation by clouds. In such locations, which are dominated by cloudy weather, any effects from changing aerosols cannot be detected as the optical depth of clouds is much greater than that of aerosols. Similarly, the trend of increasing spectral UV irradiance at Hoher Sonnblick (Austrian Alps, 3106 m altitude) was also attributed to decreasing attenuation by clouds (5.8% per decade during summer), confirmed by synoptic observations of clouds and measurements of duration of sunshine. Spectral irradiance at 315 nm was found to increase between 1997 and 2011 from 9.3% per decade at SZA=45\u00b0(spring-summer) to 14.2% per decade at SZA=65\u00b0(whole year).75 Because ozone has been increasing by 1.9\u00b11.3 % per decade over this period, the increase of irradiance at 305 nm was smalle r (between 5.1% and 7.9%) and not statistically significant. Trends in monthly average UVI at Barrow, Alaska (71.3\u00b0N), calculated from spectral UV measurements between 1991 and 2011 were not statistically significant, except for October (-14% per decade).18 This large trend was attributed to decreasing surface reflectivity as the onset of snow cover in autumn has been delayed at this site with a statistically significant trend of 13.6 days per decade. This study emphasizes the importance of climate factors on long-term changes in UV radiation. After removing the annual variability, UV irradiance at 305 nm was found to decrease with an average rate of 3.9% per decade for 1991-2011 over four northern hemisphere high-latitude stations (Barrow, Sodankyl\u00e4, Jokioinen, and Churchill), whereas no significant change was found for irradiance at 325 nm, which is only slightly affected by ozone.65 For the three southern stations examined (Ushuaia, Palmer, and Syowa) no significant changes for either wavelength were found. The above studies indicate that factors other than ozone have dominated changes in UV radiation during the last two decades at many sites. They also indicate that UV-B irradiance has stopped increasing at mid-latitude locations in response to the slowdown of the decline of ozone. Simulations of historic changes in UV radiation As mentioned in our previous assessment,157, 243 changes in UV radiation over timescales of centuries to a few decades can be estimated using various proxies or simulated variations of factors that may directly or indirectly affect the solar UV radiation at the Earth's surface (see also Chapter 3). Although such estimates have large uncertainties, they are useful in assessing qualitatively the causes of the variations in UV radiation that may have occurred in the past. A modelling study255 suggests that levels of UV-B radiation in year 2000 were 2-8% lower than in 1850 over the northern hemisphere and the tropics, and higher by 4% and 30%, respectively, over the mid- and high-latitudes of the southern hemisphere. At most locations outside the tropics, the UV- B changes were caused by changes in tropospheric ozone, except for the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes where changes in tropospheric ozone and aerosols are equally important. These increases in tropospheric ozone in the northern midlatitudes counteracted the increases of UV-B due to stratospheric ozone depletion in the 1900s. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 20 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Artificial neural networks trained with measured erythemal irradiance, duration of sunshine, and a combination of measured and modeled total column ozone, were used to reconstruct the daily erythemal dose for Potsdam, Germany from 1901 to 1999 (Fig. 7).116 A positive, statistically significant trend was found for the first half of the 20th century, in line with the observed negative trend in cloud cover. Since 1950, the trend in annual UVERY was negative until the mid-1980s, when it turned positive again. However, for both these latter periods, the trends were not statistically significant. These estimates do not include potential effects from aerosols, which have decreased substantially in the second part of the 20th century (as discussed above), and would likely result in further increasing of UVERY in the 1980s and 1990s. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the ozone data before 1949, and implicitly in UVERY, is higher because it has been obtained by a CCM. In a study for Australia, the UVI under cloud-free conditions was calculated with a radiative transfer model over a 50-year period (1959-2009) based on measured meteorological parameters.145 After the 1990s, an overall increase in annual mean UVI of 2-6% relative to the 1970-1980 levels was reported for all latitudes in that country. UV radiation under the water The amount of UV radiation under the water surface of the ocean, lakes, and rivers depend on the available radiation field reaching the water surface and additionally on the transparency of the water body. The first is determined by the absorption and scattering processes of solar radiation in the atmosphere, as discussed above, and, at high latitudes, on the amount of ice over the water and the amount of snow over the ice. The transparency of water depends on the concentrations of dissolved and particulate material in the water, with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) being the dominant attenuator of solar UV radiation178, 270 and Chapter 5. The attenuation of solar UV radiation penetrating into the water column (quantified with the diffuse attenuation coefficient Kd, m-1) can be Fig. 7 Reconstructed annual total of UV ERY time series (blue line, left -hand scale, lower graph, \"ER\"), mean annual total ozone in DU (gray line, right -hand scale) and mean annual sunshine duration (SD) in minutes per day (red line, left -hand scale, upper graph) for Potsdam, Germany, 1901 until 19 99 (thin lines, annual values, thick lines 7 -year running averages). Adapted from Junk et al.116 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 21 measured directly by radiometers or spectroradiometers, but such monitoring programs are sparse.13, 270 Recently, measurements of the spectral shape of surface reflectance from the MODIS satellite have been used successfully to derive globally the diffuse attenuation of coastal waters.13 In some areas, the penetration depth of solar radiation into the water is large, such as in the South Pacific Gyre, where irradiances at 305, 325, 340 and 380 nm were reduced to 10% of their initial value at 28, 42, 59 and 110 m of depth, respectively.237 These constitute the greatest depths of penetration ever reported for oceanic waters and are comparable with those measured in the clearest fresh waters.80 In contrast, large attenuation of solar irradiance was measured in 2004 in the Mackenzie Delta Lakes, Canada, with different gradients in renewal rate of water, concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, because these lakes are shallow, UV-B and UV-A radiation is still able to penetrate the top 19% and 31% of water columns, respectively.84 Thus, climate change effects on composition of DOM may significantly alter the UV radiation environment in such circumpolar delta lakes. The influence of inputs of DOM from rivers into the Arctic Ocean can now be inferred from analysis of satellite data (see Chapter 5 ). In Polar Regions, sea-ice prevents a large fraction of UV radiation from reaching the (liquid) ocean surface, while a few centimeters of snow over ice almost completely blocks the transmission of UV-B radiation.144, 180 Solar radiation under \"first-year\" ice in the upper ocean is spatially heterogeneous and depends on wavelength, thickness of ice, and the area and geometric distribution of melt ponds and bare ice surfaces.79 Although there is an exponential decay in transmission or radiation through the ice sheet, it was reported that the transmission of radiation in the water under the ice can increase with depth when bare and ponded sea-ice surfaces are interspersed close to the observation site. 79 Projections based on earth-system models and radiative transfer calculations suggest that, compared to the 1950s, up to 10 times more UV-B radiation will enter large parts of the Arctic Ocean by 2100, mainly because of the partial disappearance of sea-ice.77 The future evolution of sea-ice and its snow cover is linked to changes in climate and will likely lead to increases in UV-B radiation reaching the ocean surface beneath the ice. The complex radiation field beneath the first-year sea-ice during the melt- season has significant implications for biological production, biogeochemical processes, and the heat balance of sea-ice and under-ice ocean waters. Effects of UV penetration into the water column, as well as the modification of the ratio UV-B/UV-A by CDOM in the water column, are discussed further in Chapter 5. Projections of UV radiation: Causes and health effects Projected changes back to the 1960s and out to the 2090s relative to the present Surface UV radiation in the future will be influenced by: increases in stratospheric ozone due to reduction in ODSs; changes in ozone and cloudiness induced by increasing concentrations of GHGs; changes in tropospheric UV-absorbing aerosols; and decreases in surface reflectivity at high latitudes and high altitudes. Simulations of these UV radiation levels are usually derived from radiative transfer model calculations that use input parameters estimated by climate models. In our previous assessment,157, 243 we reported estimates from model projections9 suggesting that, by about 2050, the UVERY would decrease relative to 1980 by 2-10% at mid-latitudes, and by up to 20% at northern and 50% at southern high latitudes, mainly due to the recovery of stratospheric ozone and to changes in cloudiness. In the tropics, UVERY was projected to be higher by less than 2%. We also compared model projections between 2100 and 1960 to estimate the effects of climate change on surface Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 22 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 UV, because the ozone depletion started after 1960 and ozone recovery would have been completed by 2100. By the end of the 21st century UVERY was projected to: a) remain below 1960 levels due to changes in clouds and GHG-induced transport of ozone at mid-latitudes, b) decrease at high latitudes (particularly in the Arctic) by 5-10% due to changes in clouds, and c) increase in the tropics by 3-8% due to decreases in clouds and ozone, induced by GHGs. However, these projections did not consider changes in aerosols and surface reflectivity. Similar results were reported by another simulation64 that accounted also for the effects of changing albedo and cloud cover. By assuming typical aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo values over Europe, in addition to projections of ozone, small reductions in erythemal and the vitamin D-effective daily doses were predicted for 2006-2100,52 and were attributed to the recovery of stratospheric ozone and partially to reduction in the optical depth of aerosols. A recent modelling study focussing on the Arctic Ocean77 projected reductions in UV-B irradiance by the end of the 21st century relative to the levels in the 1950s over a large fraction of the area. Under clear skies, UV-A irradiance is projected to decrease on average by 4-7% (depending on scenario and season), entirely driven by decreases in surface reflectivity, while UV-B is projected to decrease on average by 10-18%, mainly due to the projected ozone recovery. Under all skies, these effects are modulated by clouds, leading to changes in the monthly mean noontime UVI from +15% to -38%, depending on the location and season. Increases in irradiance were found only during August for the latitude band 55-65\u00b0N, caused by the projected decrease in cloudiness. In this assessment, we provide updated estimates of the projections of the previous assessment,243 taking into consideration effects from most factors affecting the UV radiation at the Earth's surface. This analysis is based on recent projections of cloudiness, ozone, surface reflectivity, and aerosols for the period 1955-2100 by different Earth-System models that were included in the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CM IP-5),236 and for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emissions scenario 4.5. For the ozone projections, the ensemble mean of the CESM1(WACCM) model,68, 85 which includes interactive chemistry, was used. These projections have also been used in the fifth IPCC A ssessment Report.110 Changes in annually averaged noon UVI due to changes in these factors are shown separately in Fig. 8 between the past (1955-1965 mean) and the present (2010-2020 mean) and between the present and the future (2085-2095 mean). Separating the effects of changes in surface reflectivity, aerosols and clouds on UV radiation is potentially challenging because of the interactive influence of these factors on irradiance. Despite these inter-connected effects, the largest changes in reflectivity are projected for high and polar latitudes due to melting of ice or snow, while the largest changes in aerosols are projected for mid-latitudes and the tropics, particularly over regions with strong anthropogenic activities. Effects of changes in aerosols. The future evolution of aerosols and their radiative effects depend on emissions scenarios which may differ from the actual development, both in terms of amount and composition of aerosols. Current trends in air pollution (hence in aerosols) show large regional differences;102 at some regions decreasing (Europe and North America) and at others increasing (Asia). For all emissions scenarios associated with the (RCP), aerosols are expected to decrease significantly in the second half of the 21st century globally,138 and particularly over Asia as a result of measures for improvement of air quality,14, 228 even though the air pollution there is presently increasing.102 H owever, even if these scenarios were realistic, there would still be large uncertainties in the simulations of UV radiation due to poor knowledge of the spectral absorption efficiency of aerosols (i.e., Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 23 of SSA) and its wavelength dependence. Most climate models use input parameters that are appropriate for less absorbing aerosols, which result in underestimation of their effect on UV radiation. The UVI simulations shown here are based on projected aerosol optical depth values from the earth-system models. Because of the lack of specific SSA predictions, climatological values for SSA126 were used, assuming no change with time, which may also be unrealistic. Finally, over areas dominated by clouds, the projected Fig. 8 Simulated annually averaged percentage changes in noontime UVI (or erythemally -weighted UV irradiance) relative to the \"present\" (i.e., 2010 -2020). The left column shows simulated changes since 1955 - 1965. The right column shows the simulated changes expected from the present to the period 2085 -2095. Effects of aerosols, surface reflectivity, cloudiness and total ozone on UVI are shown in each row, wi th our assessment of the confidence in UVI projections. Note the two different color -scales. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 24 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 effects on UVI from changes in aerosols are more uncertain, particularly for large SZAs, for highl y absorbing aerosols, and for highly reflective surfaces. High levels of air pollution in the 1950s and 1960s over some urban areas in Eastern Europe should have resulted in less UV radiation at that time; the simulations show that estimated improvement of air quality since then35 yielded increases in the UVI of up to 40% in the 2010s. Unfortunately, no high- quality direct measurements of UV radiation exist for that period, and neither have the reconstructed data series (see previous discussion) been forced with aerosol data to show this effect. However, measurements in Moscow revealed a ~4% increase in UV-A radiation from 1981 to 2003 due to reduction of aerosols.263 In contrast to central Europe, UV radiation may have decreased in eastern Asia (by ~25%), due to increases in air pollution.253 The decreases in UV (by ~15%) over north-west Africa are not statistically significant and are probably caused by the large differences among the model projections. By the end of the 21st century, the improvement of air-quality over most populated areas of the northern hemisphere may result into small increases in UVI compared to 2010s by 10-20%, except over China where much larger increases are projected. The projected aerosol effect in the southern hemisphere is generally very small, because sources of aerosols are weaker compared to the northern hemisphere, and aerosols originate mostly from the ocean, while the fraction of land with important anthropogenic activities is very small. Consequently, the assumed changes in aerosol amount with time are generally very small there.35 I n our assessment, estimates of the characteristics of aerosols in the past and understanding the effects of changes of aerosols in the future are highly uncertain at present. Although we have tools to carry out the UV calculations, knowledge of the input parameters to the RT models, and a complete understanding of interactions between the various effects is still lacking. Therefore, the simulated changes in UV radiation shown in Fig. 8 are associated with significant uncertainties, and particularly for the potential aerosol effects, are only illustrative. Despite the uncertainties, it is likely that, outside the polar regions, changes in aerosols and their properties in the future will be more important for the levels of UV at the surface than those from changes in ozone. Effects of changes in surface reflectivity. As discussed previously, surface reflectivity is projected to decrease between the 1960s and the end of the 21st century over areas that were covered by sea-ice and snow earlier in this period, whereas in other areas the expected effects, mainly from changes in land-use, would be much smaller. Projected effects on UV radiation are therefore significant only over high and polar latitudes. Over the Arctic, large reductions in reflectivity due to sea-ice melting have already occurred; hence the simulated UVI is ~5% lower than in the 1960s, over and close to areas covered by sea-ice. These effects are most pronounced in the summer and autumn, when the sea-ice disappears over large areas. This phenomenon is projected to continue through the end of the 21st century,181 resulting to decreases in UVI with respect to the present by up to ~10%. In Antarctica, ice cover has generally increased slightly (as discussed above), while a small fraction of sea-ice has been lost in localized regions (mainly over the Weddell Sea), leading to small decreases in annual average UVI of less than ~2%. Small decreases are projected also for the future since Antarctica will be still covered by snow and ice by the end of the 21st century. However, other factors (e.g., ozone, clouds, and aerosols) that might be different from present would likely modulate the reflectivity effect. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 25 Effects of changes in clouds. Effects of clouds on climate are significant and complex; and their representation in climate models continues to be a challenge. Many cloud processes, including aerosol- cloud processes, occur at scales smaller than those resolved in large-scale climate models. Therefore, general circulation models typically use parameterisations to represent a range of cloud properties. A recent assessment reports considerable improvements in the ability of models to account for effects from clouds.192 For the UV projections presented here, the effect of clouds on UVI was estimated through the CMF calculated from projections of all-sky and clear-sky total solar radiation by the Earth system models. Extrapolation of the CMF from visible to ultraviolet wavelengths is based on empirical relationships. Changes in the CMF between the two periods shown are directly translated into changes in UVI due to clouds. The modification of solar radiation by clouds depends on aerosols in the underlying layers and on surface reflectivity, as both lead to increasing multiple scattering of radiation. These factors are implicitly taken into account in the total radiation projections, but their effect on the derived CMF is small. The projected changes in noontime UVI due to clouds are mostly negative. Cloudiness is projected to increase over the Arctic Ocean due to increased evaporation as sea-ice declines. Therefore, the highest decreases in UVI are simulated for latitudes north of 60\u00b0N, and are up to 4% from the 1960s to the 2010s, and about double this between the 2010s and the 2090s. Pole-ward of ~60\u00b0S, reductions of up to 3% in the UVI have been projected for both periods, mainly over the ocean. At all other latitudes the projected changes are very small, ranging between -2% and +2%. Effects of changes in ozone . Depletion of ozone has led to increases in UV-B radiation during the 1980s and 1990s, and recovery of ozone will likely lead to reductions of UV-B relative to present levels. According to state-of-the-art simulations by CCMs, it is likely that, by the early-2030s, total ozone columns at mid-latitudes will exceed 1980 values.265 The projected increases in total ozone are due t o declining concentrations of ODSs and increases in the concentration of greenhouse and other source gases. Declining ODSs, stratospheric cooling, the possible strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and other factors are likely to result in a \"super-recovery\" of mid-latitude ozone columns, after 2040 to 2060, i.e., to levels greater than observed in the 1960s, leading to smaller levels of UV- B. The future levels of ozone will greatly depend on future emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere, but also on influences from possible volcanic eruptions. Simulations indicate that the differences between GHG scenarios become important only in the latter half of the 21st century, and are largest in the northern mid-latitudes.265 Improved understanding of the effects of Mt. Pinatubo eruption on stratospheric ozone suggests that a major volcanic eruption in the near future (while atmospheric chlorine levels from ODSs remain elevated) would result in lower levels of stratospheric ozone over much of the globe that would persist for several years.5 In the Arctic, the evolution of springtime ozone in the future is uncertain because it is still debated whether changes in ozone will be driven by increases in PSCs from stratospheric cooling or by decreases in PCSs from stratospheric warming due to increases in planetary wave activity.141 Despite these open issues, the simulations and predictions of total ozone are more certain than the evolution of the other factors discussed above. Compared to the levels in the 1960s the UVI levels in the 2010s are higher only at southern high and polar latitudes where the ozone hole continues to form during the austral spring, and forces the annually averaged UVI to be up to 70% higher. Increases in UVI everywhere else are very small or close to zero. The pattern for the future is a near-complete reversal, as Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 26 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 UVI is projected to decrease over Antarctica in the 2090s by up to 40% compared to the 2010s. Decreases in the UVI are projected for the rest of the mid-latitude areas ranging between 5% and 10%. In the tropics, the changes are very small (\u00b12-4%). Overall effects . From the above discussion of individual factors that will affect the levels of UV radiation by 2100, it appears that the ozone will continue to be the dominant factor over Antarctica, while clouds and surface reflectivity will dominate the changes over the Arctic. The effects of the aerosols, although highly uncertain, are potentially very important, and will probably dominate future changes in both the UV-B and UV-A radiation in highly populated regions. Because the largest potential effects are also the most uncertain, we do not attempt to combine the four panels to show an overall effect. In our last assessment, it was projected, on the basis of models available at that time, that there would be increases in UV at low latitudes by 2100 (where the UV is already high). The presen t assessment does not support that general statement. Fig. 8 shows a more complex picture and any projected increases (due mainly to reductions in cloud) are smaller than provisionally projected. Effect of the Montreal Protocol on UV radiation The amended and adjusted Montreal Protocol continues to be successful in reducing emissions and atmospheric abundances of most controlled ODSs, and has been hailed as the most effective environmental treaty ever. As a result of its success, the concentrations of most of the man-made chemicals that led to ozone depletion are declining, and ozone is judged to be on a path towards recovery.265 Despite their long atmospheric lifetimes, by 2012, the total combined abundance of anthropogenic ODSs in the troposphere had decreased by nearly 10% from the peak value in 1993. New estimates of the contributions of specific substances or groups of substances to the decline in tropospheric chlorine and bromine are now available.265 Several attempts have been made to quantify the success of the amended and adjusted Montreal Protocol by comparing the environmental implications of ozone differences in the future \"world expected\" with those in the future \"world avoided\" by its successful implementation. A recent model simulation, that included the effects of coupling with the deep ocean,83 showed that without the Montreal Protocol, ozone concentrations would have continued to decline, with an acceleration of that decline in the latter part of this century. In 2070, the stratospheric ozone layer would have collapsed to less than 100 DU worldwide and the peak UVI would have reached values greater than 35 in the tropics; at the sunlit northern polar cap UVI values would have been in the range 5-15, which are similar to or larger than the values found in the subtropics and tropics in 2000. Such an enhancement of UV irradiance at the surface is beyond anything that modern ecosystems have presumably experienced. Another simulation64 that accounted also for the effects of climate change (e.g., changing albedo and cloud cover), reported the geographical distribution of changes in UVERY that would occur without the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. For the no-Montreal Protocol simulation, dramatic increases in erythemal irradiance between the 1970s and 2100 were calculated, with 5-fold increases over populated areas, corresponding to summer UVI in excess of 50. An early attempt to quantify the health effects concluded that the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has been hugely beneficial to avoid the health risks, such as skin cancer, which are associated with high UV, while there is only a small increase in health risks, such as vitamin D deficiency, that are associated with low UV.168 Fig. 9 shows the projected changes in ozone and UVI that would have occurred in the \"world avoided\" case.167, 168 The plots compare only latitudes 50\u00b0N and 50\u00b0S, but similar Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 27 patterns are seen for other latitudes. The rate of ozone decline would have accelerated markedly after 2040, reaching minimum values of approximately 100 DU, similar to the lowest values seen during the most severe Antarctic ozone hole, by 2070. By that time, peak UVI values at mid latitudes would have been approximately 3 times as high as in the period prior to the onset of ozone depletion. The present differences in peak UVI values between the northern and southern hemispheres would have persisted and amplified by the 2060s. Summer-winter contrasts in UVI would have been amplified in absolute terms (differences), but reduced in relative terms (ratios), which may have had important implications for vitamin D production. The effects on projected skin cancer rates were further estimated in a later study that also included the effects of projected future changes in cloud cover.246 The study showed that, due to the decreases in ozone over the latter part of the 20th century, the incidence of skin cancer would rise by approximately 4% around the mid-21st century, but with large geographical differences. Of the regions tested, the largest increases (170-200 cases per million) were projected for the Australian region, but since the skin cancer models used as inputs were developed for the Netherlands and did not take account of behavioral changes in sun-exposure, their relevance to other regions is questionable. Van Dijk et al.246 predicted that, without the Montreal Protocol, there would have been much larger increases in rates of skin cancer. Even by as early as year 2030, 2 million cases of skin-cancer would have been prevented yearly, which is 14% fewer skin-cancer cases per year (see Chapter 2 for further details). This assumes no changes in human behavior with regard to sun-exposure. However, because there is a time delay of several decades between peak UV and subsequent diagnosis, the increase in year 2030 is attributable mainly to the relatively small ozone depletion that was present around the turn of the century (see Fig. 9). Further studies investigating the health effects early in the 22nd century would give a more realistic assessment of the true benefits of the Montreal Protocol. Biological effects of UV radiation The damaging or beneficial biological effects of UV radiation have a unique dependence on wavelength, which is quantified by weighting functions, also called \"action spectra\".157, 208 Action spectra typically increase by several orders of magnitude towards shorter wavelengths in the UV-B region (see examples in Fig. 10). Because of this wavelength sensitivity, biological effects depend strongly on the spectrum of the incident radiation. The shape of the spectrum depends on the amount of atmospheric ozone and the path of solar radiation through the ozone, which is a strong function of SZA. To quantify a biological effect, the solar irradiance spectrum at the Earth's surface is multiplied with the action spectrum for this effect, and the result is integrated over wavelength to derive the biologically effective UV irradiance (UVEFF). Fig. 9 Simulations of the \"world avoided\" total ozone (top panel) and UVI (bottom panel) between 1974 and 2075 for latitudes 50 N and 50S. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 28 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Sensitivity of biologically effective UV radiation to changes of ozone The sensitivity of UV radiation to changes of ozone depends greatly on wavelength. Because every biological effect has a unique dependence on wavelength, to quantify the changes in biologically effective UV radiation due to changes in ozone, these wavelength dependencies should be taken into account. The relationship between change in total ozone column (TOC) and change in biologically effective UV irradiance can be quantified in terms of the Radiation Amplification Factor (RAF). For small (<10%) changes in ozone the RAF is simply the relative fractional change in effective UV irradiance with fractional change in total column ozone: ( / ) / ( / )EFF EFF RAF UV UV TOC TOC , w here UV EFF and TOC are the respective changes in UV EFF and TOC. For example, RAF=1.5 means that a 1% decrease in ozone will lead to a 1.5% increase in biologically effective UV radiation. For larger (>10%) changes in ozone, the power form165 is more appropriate: / ( / )RAF EFF EFFUV UV TOC TOC , w here the subscripts (+ and -) refer to the cases with larger or smaller values of ozone, respectively. Biolog ical effects that are dominated by UV-B wavelengths have larger RAFs than effects where the contribution from the longer wavelengths is significant. As an example, we illustrate this for the case of vitamin D production by UV radiation, because this topic has received prominence in recent years, and the action spectrum for previtamin D3 production is controversial.171 Table 1 shows the RAFs for three suggested action spectra for previtamin D3 production (Fig. 10) compared with the RAF for erythema for typical conditions in January and July. The previtamin D3 -related action spectra are for illustrative purposes only and although the accuracy of the currently -accepted spectrum24 has been called into question ,171 we are not in a position to advocate any change to it. A comprehensive list of RAFs and action spectra for a large variety of biological effects was included in the previous assessment report .243 Table 1 RAFs for action spectra calculated on the basis of daily integrals for latitude 30\u00b0N. This is an update of Table 1 from McKenzie et al.157 Effect RAF Jan (290 DU) RAF July (305 D U) Reference Erythema (CIE, standard reference) 1.1 1.2 CIE;40 McKinley and Diffey Webb Previtamin 1.7 173 Previtamin D3 2.6 2.2 Bolsee et al.22 Fig. 10 Biological action spectra for erythema and production of previtamin D3 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 29 RAFs also depend to some degree on factors other than SZA and ozone that alter the shape of the solar spectrum, such as extinction by aerosols or the vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere.248 Limitations of the RAF and its application to other action spectra have been discussed in more detail elsewhere.165 New numerical parameterizations have recently been developed to calculate biologically effective irradiance as a function of TOC and solar elevation angle for commonly used action spectra.99 Furthermore, a new method has been devised to calculate RAFs from measurements of UVERY and TOC during times when UVERY is also affected by clouds and aerosols.182 While the basic understanding of the sensitivity of UV radiation to changes in ozone has not changed since the last assessment, additional studies are now available that corroborate the magnitude of this sensitivity and allow refinement of the values of action spectra. The action spectrum for erythema There have been slight variations in the definition of the action spectrum for erythema since it was first introduced.160 Their action spectrum for erythema was standardized by the Commission Internationale de l'\u00c9clairage (CIE) in 198739 and updated in 1998.40 Deviations in erythemal irradiance resulting from the two versions of the action spectrum are less than 0.5% for SZAs <40\u00b0and increase to around 2% at 85\u00b0SZA259 and the RAF changes by less than 0.02 (Fig. 11). Even though the differences are small, this change is important due to the large number of studies and time series that have been based on the CIE 1987 action spectrum. In accordance with Webb et al,259 we recommend that the standard action spectrum for erythema recommended by CIE40 should be used in the future. M easurements of personal exposure to UV radiation To dat e, the most widely used method for personal UV exposure studies is to equip volunteers with small dosimeters attached to various parts of the body. Dosimeters may be based on photoresponsive films, which change their transmission upon exposure to UV radiation,27, 219, 242 DNA molecules in cultures of immobilized spores with a spectral response corresponding to erythema,71, 216, 217 and photodetectors that convert UV radiation into signals of voltage or current.206, 207, 260 The ability to convert doses absorbed by polysulphone (PS) badges into biologically effective solar UV exposure was assessed,221 taking as example two relevant effects for human skin: induction of erythema and production of previtamin D3. Comparisons of doses derived from PS badges positioned horizontally Fig. 11 Ratio of radiation amplification factors (RAF) calculated for the CIE 1998 and CIE 1987 erythema action spectra. The figure is based on model spectra that were calculated for different solar zenith angles and total column ozone210 and subsequently weighted with either the CIE 1998 or the CIE 1987 erythema action spectrum. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 30 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 and at different inclination angles (to simulate various anatomic sites of the human body), revealed larger deviations at large solar zenith angles and/or for high reflectivity surfaces.31 More recently, electronic dosimeters have become available, and their use is becoming more widespread.55, 159, 213 The accuracy of measurements of two types of personal dosimeters, namely PS films and electronic ultraviolet (EUV) dosimeters using an aluminum gallium nitride (Al 27Ga73N) photodetector, have recently been assessed.213 PS dosimeters showed mean absolute deviations of 26% relative to a reference spectroradiometer, with a maximum deviation of 44%. Since the PS doses were derived using a single calibration curve, further experimental investigation of these dosimeters is needed to better assess their accuracy. The calibrated EUV dosimeters showed mean absolute deviations of 15% (maximum 33%), which were partly caused by small, but significant sensitivities to visible radiation (i.e., stray light). It was concluded that calibrating UV sensors by direct comparison with a reference instrument leads to reliable results and that these simple devices are useful to estimate personal UV exposures. They should not be used, however, as an inexpensive replacement for meteorological grade instruments. Inexpensive, non-scientific instruments for UVI measurements have recently become available. These sensors are part of watches, portable weather stations, and handheld UV meters. The accuracy of several of these devices has been assessed.51 While the measurements of some test devices agreed with those of a reference spectroradiometer to within 20%, some instruments overestimated the UVI by up to a factor of three and hence did not provide trustworthy results. Health-related exposure to UV radiation Exposure to sunlight, specifically the UV radiation, has both positive and negative health effects, as discussed in Chapter 2. Despite the positive effects, it is excessive sun-exposure which has been of greater concern, because of its adverse effects to humans, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, materials, and air quality (see all Chapters of this report). Quantification of exposure of humans to UV radiation is complex as many factors are involved, including the natural variations of radiation, the orientation of the exposed parts in conjunction with the time and location, behavioral aspects, clothing, as well as effects of reflections on the surroundings.242 This complexity is confirmed by recent exposure studies using personal dosimeters which include: seafarers of merchant vessels,71 farmers at a mid-latitude site,206 urban dwellers engaging in typical outdoor activities such as shopping, walking, cycling, and sightseeing,207 professional cyclists,216 young (age 9-12) skiers,217 vineyard workers,219 and people engaged in activities such as walking, sitting, and lying.260 From measurements with personal electronic UV dosimeters in New Zealand over a few weeks (outside the peak summer period),158, 159 it was shown that cumulative doses received by dosimeters w orn on the wrist were typically less than 2% of the available ambient doses, and that the equivalent full body exposure is less than 1% of the ambient. This implies that the people wearing the dosimeters were probably indoors for about 95% of the time. These studies suggest that personal UV exposure is better approximated by dosimeters and diaries than by measurements of the ambient UV irradiance. Furthermore, the translation of traditional global-horizontal irradiance measurements into exposure levels relevant to humans therefore depends critically on information on behavior and location. Maximizing the benefits while minimizing the damage is a multifaceted problem in which many of the elements are important and need to be quantified.258 A recent attempt has been made to quantify the Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 31 available ambient UV doses each month, including both beneficial and detrimental effects, in Northern Eurasia.37 As discussed above, problems arise when one uses UV measurements on a horizontal surface to perform risk-benefit assessments because they do not yield the actual doses people get while they are outdoors as different parts of the body are exposed at different angles. More realistic UV doses for people who are outdoors engaged in a variety of different activities can be estimated from simple geometrical parameterizations.190 As part of further refinements, the importance of including the effects of clouds and aerosols in parameterizations to derive vitamin D-effective irradiance from erythemal irradiance was highlighted by Feister et al.70 They showed from 4 years of measurements in Germany that optically thick clouds can strongly modify the ratio between erythemal and vitamin D-effective irradiance, suggesting that the parameterizations derived for cloud-free conditions are not always applicable. Similarly, the role of shade has been emphasized by Turnbull and Parisi241 who measured the spectral dependence of the ratio of diffuse to global UV radiation, and showed that under clear skies this ratio decreases with wavelength throughout most of the UV region for wavelengths greater than 300 nm. For example, for unpolluted conditions at SZA=40\u00b0, the diffuse to global ratio decreases from ~0.6 at 300 nm to ~0.3 at 400 nm. This means that in the UV-B region, the protection offered is less than one would estimate from our perception of the visible solar radiation. To get protection sufficient for most purposes (e.g., Solar Protection Factor >30) from UV-B radiation in the shade, it is important to ensure most of the diffuse sky radiation is also blocked. Interestingly, because the wavelengths for previtamin D production are slightly shorter than for erythema, this implies that exposure to diffuse light, such as in the shade of trees or buildings, may slightly favor the production of vitamin D while minimizing the risk of erythema in non-covered skin. The field of atmospheric UV research is plagued with difficulties in nomenclature. A recent report41 highlights some of the issues, taking vitamin-D synthesis, a beneficial effect, as a specific example. Terminologies for the standard vitamin-D dose (SDD) and the minimum vitamin-D dose - for daily sufficiency - (MDD) are proposed, analogous to the standard erythema dose (SED) and minimal erythema dose (MED) that are in common use for erythema. Note that the quantitative value of the MDD is not yet known; nor is there agreement on the recommended minimum levels of the status of vitamin- D (see Chapter 2). In the present literature, the SDD has confusingly been defined in terms of a physiological response. In recognition of the fact that currently accepted action spectra may be revised if new data become available, continuation of spectrally resolved irradiance measurements will allow reprocessing of biologically effective irradiances and doses in the future. Effects of geoengineering on ozone and UV radiation Geoengineering -or \"climate engineering\"- refers to a broad set of methods and technologies that could be used t o deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) has been suggested as a means to counteract the warming from increasing GHG by reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth's surface. Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CDR) aims at reducing the future concentrations of CO 2 by accelerating the natural removal of atmospheric CO 2 or increasing the storage of carbon in reservoirs.110 O f those two geoengineering methods, only the SRM would directly influence the amount of UV radiation received at the Earth's surface. Space reflectors, injection of aerosols in the stratosphere, or Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation 32 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 seeding of marine clouds would reduce the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface. In contrast, increasing of surface reflectivity by creating micro bubbles at the ocean surface, growing more reflective crops, or painting roofs and other built structures in light colors may lead to increased surface UV radiation through scattering of reflected radiation towards the ground. The injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere53 is one of the methods suggested to reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, through increased scattering of solar radiation to space. However, it is known that stratospheric sulfate aerosols from volcanic eruptions and natural emissions deplete the stratospheric ozone, and similar effects should be expected from stratospheric aerosols introduced for SRM, leading ultimately to increases in the amount of UV-B radiation reaching the surface, which are larger than the reduction achieved from the SRM. This is further supported by recent modelling studies98, 189, 239 suggesting that such interventions would lead to a general decrease in stratospheric ozone concentrations mainly via changes in photolysis rates, tropical upwelling of ozone-poor air, and an increase in available surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry. Considering the role of very short-lived halogens in the stratosphere (e.g., Bry and Cly) increases in annual average UVERY of up to 5% in mid and high latitudes were simulated for the 2040s due to the impact of stratospheric sulfur on ozone.239 Recently, it was projected that the increase in UV- B radiation at the surface due to ozone depletion could be offset in the 2040s by the screening due to the SRM aerosols in the tropics and mid-latitudes, while in polar regions the UV-B radiation would increase by 5% on average, with 12% peak increases during springtime.186 Other potential UV-related impacts of geoengineering have been investigated with models, revealing effects on cloud cover132 and rainfall patterns,73 both of which ultimately lead to changes in UV radiation at the Earth's surface. Model simulations showed that SRM to counteract a 1% annual rise in atmospheric CO 2 suppresses the increases in precipitation that would otherwise accompany the rising GHG, had geoengineering never been used. However, in some of these sensitivity studies extreme and perhaps unlikely scenari os73 have been assumed. For example, the effect of geoengineering with sulfate aerosols was investigated in a world with a different climate by first setting global CO 2 levels at an extremely large level of 1,120 parts per million (ppm) or four times the pre-industrial level.240 They found t hat global precipitation rates would increase by approximately 7% compared with pre-industrial times, but with high spatial and temporal variability. However, when they re-ran the models, with SRM geoengineering included, they found a 4.5% reduction in global precipitation. Again, there was a high degree of variability, but notably, decreases in precipitation rates on land and in oceans were much more similar. The interactions and feedbacks of the suggested geoengineering methods with the natural variability of the atmospheric and surface reflectivity are not yet fully explored. The atmosphere is a complex system and any deliberate interventions should be treated with great care as they may have unanticipated adverse effects. Moreover, with the current observing systems, it would not be feasible to assess whether the small intended changes in solar radiation at the Earth's surface from the implementation of geo-engineering would have actually occurred. Gaps in knowledge Simulations of surface UV radiation for the future are limited in accuracy due to difficulties in assessing the combined effects of clouds and aerosols that are expected to change. Over ice- and or snow-covered Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on UV radiation The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 33 areas, these effects are even more complicated. Additional uncertainties for UV projections arise from the scenarios describing the evolution of the atmosphere in the future. Significant changes in aerosol concentrations are expected in the future (both positive and negative, depending on the region). The effect of these aerosols on surface UV irradiance will depend strongly on their single scattering albedo. However, even for the aerosols that are present in the current atmosphere, this parameter is not well quantified in the UV-B region because of confounding effects of ozone absorption. Better quantification of the SSA in the UV-B region over a wide range of aerosol types (possibly involving laboratory studies to avoid the effect of ozone) would increase our ability to model the effects of aerosol on UV radiation at the Earth's surface. To our current understanding, variations in solar activity lead to decreases in total ozone of up to 3% between the maximum and the minimum of the 11-year solar cycle. However, the relative contributions of solar activity-induced radiative and dynamical effects on ozone are not yet fully resolved. Moreover, there are still uncertainties in the measurements of solar spectral irradiance outside the Earth's atmosphere. Improvement in the understanding of these processes and the availability of higher quality information of the UV-related factors would strengthen our ability to effectively interpret ongoing changes and predict future changes in UV radiation. Instruments at the ground measure UV irradiance directly and the results are therefore more accurate than the inversion results from satellite data, but the spatial coverage of surface observations is sparse and vast regions of the Earth (e.g., Africa, Siberia, the global oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere) are not being monitored from the ground. In light of these limitations, robust assessments of long term changes in UV radiation must be based both on observations from space and from the ground. Assessment of the long-term benefits of the Montreal Protocol requires inputs from both the atmospheric sciences and the health communities. To date, the health costs of non-implementation of the Montreal Protocol have been calculated only up to year 2030. Because of the lag between UV exposure and onset of diseases this is representative only of the changes due to ozone depletion up to year 2000. This severely underestimates the true benefits of the Montreal Protocol because ozone changes would have become much larger in the latter half of the 21st century (see Fig. 9). There is incomplete characterization of many action spectra of interest. Examples are the action spectrum for the formation of previtamin D3 from sunlight and the action spectrum for melanoma in human skin. These are required for quantitative assessments of the environmental effects of future changes in UV radiation, particularly those due to changes in ozone.

For many fair-skinned populations, changing behaviour with regard to exposure to the sun over the past half century - more time in the sun, less clothing cover (more skin exposed) , and preference for a tan - has probably contributed more to greater levels of exposure to UV-B radiation than ozone depletion. Exposure to UV-B radiation has both adverse and beneficial effects on human health. This report focuses on an assessment of the evidence regarding these outcomes published since our previous report in 2010. The skin and the eyes are the organs exposed to solar UV radiation. Excessive solar irradiation causes skin cancer, including cutaneous malignant melanoma and the non-melanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and contributes to the development of other rare skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma. Although the incidence of melanoma continues to increase in many countries, in some locations, primarily those with strong sun protection programmes, incidence has stabilised or decreased over the past 5 years, particularly in younger age- groups. However the incidence of the non-melanoma skin cancers is still increasing in most locations. Exposure of the skin to the sun also induces systemic immune suppression that may have adverse effects on health, such as through the reactivation of latent viral infections, but also beneficial effects through suppression of autoimmune reactivity. Solar UV-B radiation damages the eyes, causing cataracts and pterygium. UV-B irradiation of the skin is the main source of vitamin D in many geographic locations. Vitamin D plays a critical role in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the body; severe deficiency causes the bone diseases, rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Although many studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, more recent evidence is less compelling, with meta-analyses of supplementation trials failing to show a beneficial effect on the health outcomes that have been tested. It continues to be difficult to provide public health messages to guide safe exposure to the sun that are accurate, simple, and can be used by people with different skin types, in different locations, and for different times of the year or day. There is increasing interest in relating sun protection messages to the UV Index. Current sun protection strategies are outlined and assessed. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 50 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Climatic factors affect the amount of UV radiation received by the skin and eyes, separately from the effect of ozone depletion. For example, cloud cover can decrease or increase the intensity of UV radiation at Earth's surface and warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns may alter the amount of time people spend outdoors and their choice of clothing. The combination of changes in climate and UV radiation may affect the number of pathogenic microorganisms in surface waters, and could have an impact on food security through effects on plant and aquatic systems. It remains difficult to quantify these effects and their possible importance for human health. Introduction Stratospheric ozone limits the amount of biologically damaging UV radiation in the UV-B waveband that reaches the Earth's surface - a 1000-fold reduction in mutagenic UV radiation.311 Depletion of the ozone layer results in greater potential exposure to UV-B radiation, while, for humans, actual exposure also depends on their behaviour, such as time spent outdoors, use of shade, and wearing of sun protective clothing. Global climate change is altering the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer and, through effects on cloud cover, will modify the levels of UV radiation at Earth's surface (for detail, see Chapter 1). Loss of snow cover will decrease albedo in mountain regions, possibly reducing UV radiation incident on body surfaces. Changing climate may also alter human behaviour with regard to exposure to the sun. Warmer temperatures may accelerate the genesis of skin cancer and vitamin D production. In the following sections, we assess the health risks associated with ozone depleti on, focussing on effects related to UV radiation in the UV-B wavelengths. In addition, the risks and benefits of changing personal exposure to UV radiation under the combined effects of ozone depletion and global climate change are considered. Effects of solar UV radiation on the skin Human skin comprises an outer thin epidermis of about 10 cell layers and typically <100 m deep and an inner layer, the dermis, that consists mainly of connective tissue and gives skin its mechanical properties. Epidermal cells are mostly keratinocytes, with melanocytes in the basal layer producing melanin that determines pigmentation of the skin. UV radiation is absorbed in the skin by specific molecules called chromophores, with the ensuing chemical changes initiating multiple biological processes. UV-A radiation penetrates the skin to a greater depth (into the dermis ) than UV -B radiation. Exposure to solar UV radiation may cause skin cancer and photo -ageing, but also initiates the synthesis of vitamin D which is critical for human health. Skin cancer Solar UV radiation is the major environmental risk factor for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs).394 Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is the least common of the skin cancers, but accounts for most deaths due to skin cancer. NMSCs include basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and other rarer skin cancers. BCC occurs approximately 3-4 times more frequently than SCC. It has the lowest mortality rate but can cause significant ill-health due to extensive local invasion, particularly when it arises on the face. It is difficult to assess whether, or to what level, alterations in ozone or climate have contributed to the rising incidence of skin cancer globally. Over the 20th century, increasing travel to sunny locations and changed styles of clothing, at least in some populations, ha ve led to higher personal exposure to the sun. This has probably been a more important driver of the increasing incidence of skin cancer than changes in ozone or climate.3 Changes in the diagnostic criteria for skin cancers, including the use of dermoscopy or epiluminescent microscopy and molecular classif ication,97 a lack of accurate recording of lesions, and a more general growing awareness of skin Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 51 cancer and conservatism (erring on the safe side) in diagnoses,116 may also have introduced temporal biases in some instances. Cutaneous malignant melanoma Geographic variation and temporal trends in incidence and mortality . World- w ide, it is estimated that there were around 230,000 new cases of CMM and 55 ,000 deaths in 2012.174 The incidence varies widely from country to country (Table 1), with the highest age-standardised annual incidence rates (~35 per 100 000 population in 2012) in Australia and New Zealand.174 CMM is rare in darker skinned populations, such as in South Asia.201 The incidence of CMM in fair-skinned populations has approximately doubled every 10-20 years since the 1960s and this trend is projected to continue for at least 20 more years104 (Table 1).

Mortality due to CMM is stable or decreasing in Australia,338 some parts of the USA,125 and Western Europe,184 with this decrease likely due to earlier detection of the tumours, possibly as a result of more self-awareness of risks of skin cancer in subgroups of the population. Anatomica l location . In fair-skinned populations, melanomas in older people occur predominantly on the head and neck and are associated with chronic cumulative exposure to the sun. In younger people, the lesions most frequently occur on the trunk and extremities, thought to be the result of high overall exposure to the sun, episodes of sunburn in childhood, and the presence of multiple or atypical naevi (moles).75 The trunk is the site where the greatest increase in the number of cases in both sexes over the past 30 years has occurred,118, 383 likely reflecting the increase in intermittent high dose exposure leading to sunburn as a result of wearing clothes with less coverage of the skin, and increased travel to sunny climates.86 Melanoma in deeply pigmented skin . There is a paucity of information about the incidence, or any change in incidence, in CMM in population groups with darker skin. The risk of CMM is estimated to be around 20-times lower in Black compared to White Americans.320 A recent study in the North- East USA found no increase in the annual incidence of CMM in Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks since 1992, but a 4% increase in non-Hispanic Whites.69 In contrast, there is evidence of increasing incidence of CMM in Hispanics from California between 1988 and 2001.70 Darker-skinned people are more likely than those with fair skin to have advanced CMM at diagnosis in the USA69 and in Brazil,323 with a reduced chance of survival. The lower limb and/or hip is the commonest site for CMM in the dark-skinned populations of South Africa (around 70% of CMM) and Kenya (75%),273 particularly the sole of the foot.272, 273 As these body sites are not normally UV-irradiated, direct exposure to the sun i s unlikely to be a risk factor although UV-induced systemic effects could be involved.2 Exposure to the s un as a causative factor in melanoma . Exposure to the sun is a key risk factor for CMM.183, 211 Incidence is greater at locations closer to the Equator (more UV radiation) in fair-skinned populations.104 For example, in 2012, the age-standardised incidence (World Standard Population, per 100,000) was 35.8 in New Zealand and 34.9 in Australia, compared to 14.6 in the UK and 9.6 in Canada.174 Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of CMM in people who self-report higher levels of sunburn, and in those with phenotypic characteristics associated with greater sensitivity to UV radiation, including fair skin, light hair and eye colour, poor ability to tan, freckling, and having multiple naevi (moles). Childhood exposure to the sun may be particularly important ; for example, migration from a high to a low latitude location before age 10 years207 or 20 years205 confers a greater risk of melanoma than migration at an older age. Recent experimental studies indicate that both UV-A and UV- B radiation are involved in the development of CMM.267 Initiation of melanoma following UV- A irradiation involves oxidative damage to DNA and requires the presence of melanin, whereas UV-B-induced melanoma is independent of melanin and involves direct UV-B-induced damage to DNA.267 A two-hit model proposes that initiation of the tumour follows DNA damage induced by UV radiation, and then progression to melanoma depends on the host's genetic make-up (particularly for melanoma of the trunk) and/or tumour promotion by ongoing exposure to both UV-A and UV-B radiation.247 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 53 There is growing interest in the effects of exposures in early life on the risks of diseases that develop later in life. One indication that exposure early in life is important for melanoma comes from observations that, in predominantly fair-skinned populations, people with the disease are more likely to have be en born in particular months of the year, compared with the general population. In two studies, young women (aged 15-24 years) with CMM from northern England26 and Sweden73 were significantly more likely to have be en born in March (early Spring). The data are consistent with the two-hit model suggested in animal studies247 - early exposure to UV radiation during the months soon after birth initiates the first event, then later exposure causes progression to CMM . It is interesting to note that, in the past, exposure of infants to sunlight was encouraged in some countries, a practice that has not continued in more recent years.145, 146, 281, 307 The higher incidence of small (<2 mm) melanomas during summer compared to winter in Northern Ireland (1984-2006) is consistent with exposure to UV radiation having a short-term promotional effect on melanocytes.63 Genetics of cutaneous melanoma . Susceptibility to CMM is partially determined by genetic factors (reviewed in Eggermont et al.5 and Nikolaou & Stratigos97, 266). A family history of CMM confers a two-fold increase in risk.278 Alternatively, in approximately 10% of people with CMM, there is a strong family history,158 associated with specific mutations in genes involved in control of the cell cycle (e.g., CDKN2A, CDK4 ). Increased risk in association with polymorphisms in other genes, including those associated with fair-skin phenotype (MC1R )158 and characteristic mutations in the tumour-control pathways,163 provide strong evidence of a causal role for UV radiation in the development of CMM. Very recently, further experimental corroboration for the involvement of UV radiation in accelerated development of melanocytes has been obtained.379 Most strikingly, recent studies show that melanomas (and cell lines thereof) have more mutations in their genomes than most other tumour types, e.g., more than 30,000 point mutations per cell, and hundreds of mutations in protein-coding genes. Tumours from sun-exposed skin have the greatest number of mutations, most of which are characteristic of those induced by exposure to UV radiation.33, 193 It is difficult to distinguish driver from passenger mutations, but special intron-exon comparative analyses provide evidence of driver mutations that are related to UV radiation.163 Non-melanoma skin cancer Geographic variation and temporal trends in incidence. BCC and SCC are the most frequently occurring cancers in fair-skinned populations . However , es tablishing accurate incidence data , an d comparing incidence rates between countries or regions , or over time , i s challenging for several reasons. First, these cancers may be treated using destructive therapies without prior biopsy, and such clinically -diagnosed lesions, particularly BCC, are often not included in es timates of incidence.111 Differences in therapeutic approaches between countries or changes over time can therefore have a considerable influen ce on comparisons and trends. Secondly, there are very few regions that require mandatory reporting of NMSCs to cancer registries and population-based studies are rare. Thirdly, most reports are person-based rather than lesion-based so they do not account for the multiple lesions often observed in people living at lower latitudes; and lastly, variability in the population used to age- standardise incidence rates makes reported results difficult to compare. Despite these difficulties, there is a strong association between intensity of ambient UV radiation and incidence of both BCC and SCC.402 In a recent review, the highest annual incidence rates were in Australia (>1000 per 100 000 population for BCC) and the lowest in Africa (<1 per 100,000 population).216 Data for the latter are sparse and the low incidence masks relatively high incidence in some sub-populations, for example among people with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 54 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 [see section below], and in Caucasians in South Africa, where BCC and SCC are typically among the top 5 or 10 cancers reported (depending on year).257 There have been substantial increases in the incidence of NMSC over the past several decades. Across Europe, the annual incidence of BCC was estimated to be around 50 per 100,000 persons in 1980.216 It has more than doubled since then in many parts of this region, and has quadrupled in the Netherlands.112 The incidence of SCC was approximately 10 per 100,000 persons in Europe in 1980216 with an increase to about 25 per 100,000 by 2000.216 There are no estimates of SCC and BCC separately for the United States, but a study of data from national Medicare claims suggests that the age-adjusted rate of procedures for skin cancer increased by 77% between 1992 and 2006.316 A recent quantitative review of data published between 1979 and 2012 showed that, in fair- skinned populations worldwide, after adjustment for age, sex, and the levels of ambient UV radiation, the average annual increases in SCC and BCC incidence were 4% and 1%, respectively.402 The incidence of SCC increased over time in both the older (60 years) and younger (<60 years) age groups, but only in the older age group for BCC. Exposure to the sun as a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer . As the studies showing latitudinal variation suggest, exposure to solar UV radiation is the primary cause of BCC and SCC ; almost 40% of the variability in incidence in SCC and BCC in populations of predominantly European ancestry could be explained by differences in the average daily levels of ambient UV radiation alone.402 Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the timing and patterns of exposure to the sun that give rise to the two tumour types are different. SCC appears to be strongly associated with cumulative exposure to the sun. In fair-skinned people, SCC is rare on parts of the body that are not routinely exposed to the sun114, 300, 344 and the presence of actinic keratoses, which are a marker of cumulative exposure to the sun, confers a 30-40-fold increase in the risk of SCC.194 In contrast, BCC appears to be caused by intermittent exposure to the sun;28, 83 up to 25% of BCCs occur on the trunk or l ower limbs344 and the association with actinic keratosis is considerably weaker than for SCC.185 However, some studies have found no difference in the pattern of exposure in relation to the risk of BCC and SCC,173 possibly because the risk factors for BCC vary according to the site and/or subtype of BCC. For example, chronic exposure to the sun may be more important for nodular BCC commonly found on the head and neck, and intermittent exposure to the sun more important for superficial BCCs that have a tendency to occur on the trunk.260 It is of interest to note that there is a 3-fold increased risk of developing CMM after either SCC or BCC, even after adjustment for the self- r eported reaction of the skin to chronic exposure to the sun.305 This may indicate risk factors in com mon between the NMSCs and CMM, e.g., susceptibility of specific skin phototypes, and excessive (intermittent) exposure to the sun. Non-melanoma skin cancer in more deeply pigmented skin . There have been few studies of i ncidence of NMSCs in dark-skinned populations.216 Data collected by the National Cancer Registry of South Africa in the early 2000s indicated that the annual age-standardised incidence (per 100,000) of reported SCC was 4.6, 7.0, 41.5 and 101.3, and of reported BCC was 4.7, 13.0, 85.7 and 311.1 in the Black, Asian, Coloured and White population groups respectively.272 The epidemiology, clinical presentation, and prognosis of NMSC differ between people with fair skin and those with darker skin. For example, in several studies, SCC was more common than BCC in those with deeply pigmented skin142, 273 and the se tumours typically arose in sites of chronic inflammation or scarring, so that solar UV radiation may not be the major risk factor.2 In contrast, the site-distribution of BCCs is similar in fair- and dark-skinned populations, occurring predominantly on the head or neck, suggesting that exposure to UV radiation is an important risk factor. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 55 Over time, there has been little increase in the incidence of NMSC in Asian populations and almost none in dark-skinned populations (reviewed in Agbai et al.31 and Gloster & Neal2, 131). However, mortality and morbidity from NMSC is disproportionately high in dark-skinned populations in comparison with incidence, due to diagnosis occurring at a more advanced stage, atypical presentation, lack of screening, and socioeconomic factors.2 Public health education regarding protection against the sun and self-awareness, tailored appropriately for each population group, should be expanded to include people of all skin types.408 Genetics of non-melanoma skin cancer . Common variants in several genes influence the risk of BCC, including those in known pigmentation genes.256, 341 In addition, there are rare genetic disorders in which NMSCs arise at a young age and incidence is dramatically increased. For example, incidence of skin cancer in people under the age of 20 years is increased 10,000-fold in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, a disorder where the repair of UV-induced DNA damage is severely impaired.88 SCCs and BCCs are the cancers with the highest mutational loads (33 and 76 mutations per million DNA-bases, respectively), especially those from skin regularly exposed to the sun.93, 181 The majority of these mutations bear the \"UV (cytosine to tyrosine transitions at Both BCC and UV-signature mutations in tumour suppressor genes ( PTCH1 and p53 respectively),51, 181, 411 suggesting these are key abnormalities driving the development of these tumours.102 These genetic studies clearly indicate the causal role of exposure to UV radiation in the development of NMSC. Skin cancer in oculocutaneous albinism. O culocutaneous albinism (OCA) refers to a group of congenital developmental disorders in which there is either partial or complete lack of melanin in the skin, hair and eyes.229 The number of melanocytes is not reduced, but there is decreased or absent production of melanin due to mutations in genes in the melanin biosynthetic pathway.229 The four major types (OCA1, 2, 3 and 4) are present at different frequencies in various populations throughout the world; for example OCA2 is the most common type in sub-Saharan Africa.229 Globally, about 1 in every 17,000 people have OCA (with about 1 in 70 people carrying the OCA gene),78, 135 but this figure can be considerably higher, such as 1 in 3900 in South Africa.195 People with OCA experience visual impairment including photophobia (discomfort from exposure to light, leading to avoidance ).348 They are also highly susceptible to skin damage induced by solar UV radiation and it has been estimated that the risk of NMSC in people with OCA in Africa is one thousand times greater than that of the general population.167 In most instances, the skin cancer occurs at 20-30 years of age, which is considerably younger than in those without OCA.219 Cutaneous Fig. 1. Human skin shows cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD, red nuclei) when a biopsy is taken immediately after 4 standard erythema doses of simulated solar radiation. Note the presence of CPD in the epidermal basal laye r that contains stem cells and that CPD are also present in the dermis.

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 56 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 tumours in Africans with OCA are predominantly SCCs, with BCCs less frequent, and CMMs only occasionally seen,189, 225 although the last may be under-reported as they are normally amelanotic (non-pigmented).285 Most commonly, the skin cancers in Africans with OCA occur on the head and nec k and tend to progress rapidly with metastasis to the cartilage, bone, and muscle, resulting in high mortality.9, 219 The key role of exposure to the sun in the oncogenic process is emphasised by finding a n increased frequency of skin tumours and lower life expectancy in people with OCA living in equatorial regions of sub-Saharan Africa than in parts further from the Equator.219 Viruses and skin cancer There are two instances (see following sections) where an association between certain viruses and skin cancer has been demonstrated. In both cases, the tumours occur predominantly on body sites most exposed to the sun, suggesting that exposure to solar UV radiation is likely to play a crucial role in the carcinogenic process. Merkel cell carcinoma and polyomavirus. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive, neuroendocrine skin cancer with high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality.172 It mainly affects fair-skinned, elderly people (peak age around 75 years) or those who are immunosuppressed , particularly if they live in a sunny location.172 The tumours occur most frequently on sun-damaged skin on the head and neck.129 There is a positive correlation between ambient levels of UV radiation and age-adjusted incidence of MCC across the USA.244 The incidence has risen in recent years, for example, from 0.15 cases to 0.44 cases per 100,000 between 1986 and 2001 in the USA.162 This coul d be explained by increasing life expectancy, greater exposure to the sun and the rising number of immunosuppressed people in the general population as a result of an increasing number and range of organ transplants399 and infection with HIV.172 Merkel cell polyomavirus is present in around 80% of MCCs. The viral DNA is integrated into the host DNA and is thought to cause cancer after genomic mutations that eliminate its ability to replicate but maintain its oncogenic function (reviewed in Arora et al.11). Exposure to UV radiation may play a role in the integration or mutagenic process es (for example, Demetriou et al.95 and Mogha et al.82, 250) or in suppression of the immune response to the virus.37 Squamous cell carcinoma and papillomaviruses. Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) can infect the squamous epithelium of the skin and may play a causative role in the development of cutaneous SCC. Phylogenetic analysis of HPVs describes 120 differen t types across 5 genera.34 Several studies have found that the presence in serum of antibodies to the beta or gamma HPV types is associated with an increased risk of SCC.8, 108, 298 Furthermore, people with SCC have higher levels of beta HPV DNA in hair follicles of the eyebrow (used as a marker of infection) than controls without SCC.261 The beta and gam ma HPV types code for proteins that affect the normal controls of the cell cycle and may also subvert the normal immune response. The mechanism by which various types of HPV might influence the risk of cutaneous SCC is unclear, but is most likely through potentiating the effects of exposure to UV radiation.48 Photoageing Chronic exposure to solar UV radiation results in photoaged skin, which is wrinkled, leathery, shows loss of elasticity, and is often associated with the development of SCC. Photoageing results from the UV-induced degradation of proteins such as collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix of the dermis. UV-A radiation may be primarily responsible for chronic photoageing, given its greater depth of penetration.218 In addition, a role for UV- B radiation is indicated. First, UV-B radiation can directly degrade some proteins, such as fibrillin and fibronectin, involved in maintaining the structure of the dermis.259 Second, the action spectrum for the induction of matrix metalloproteinase (an enzyme that degrades collagen) in human skin is similar to that for erythema, suggesting that this is Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 57 primarily an effect of exposure to UV-B radiation.358 While not a risk to health per se, photoageing of the skin incurs considerable costs through the use of cosmetic and hydrating agents to improve the appearance and feel of the skin. Melasma Melasma appears as dark, macular, pigmented patches on the brow, cheek, upper lip and jaw, and is due to a localised increase in melanin production.334 It can result in profound emotional and psychological stress, significantly reducing quality of life.182 Melasma is particularly common in adult women living in tropical areas of the world and occurs more frequently in individuals with skin types of intermediate pigmentation (i.e. types III-V) than in those with fair (skin types I and II) or very dark skin (skin type VI).143, 334 Its prevalence has been estimated as 3.4% in the general population in Beirut, Lebanon, 10.1% in Cuzco, Peru,334 34% in adult women in Botucatu, Brazil,80 and 40% in adult women and 20% in adult men in South-East Asia.335 The precise pathophysiology of melasma is unclear, but is known to be complex. There is a genetic predisposition and several environmental triggers, one of which is exposure to sunlight. For example, a report from Tunisia indicated that 51% of patients recognised exposure to the sun as a triggering factor and 84% as an aggravating factor, with high lifetime exposure to the sun increasing the risk of severe melasma three-fold.138 A case-control study in Brazil found that patients with melasma had a greater number of years of seaside or rural residence and greater exposure to the sun at work or during leisure than the controls; there was a lack of association with sunburn, implying that cumulative exposure to the sun may be more important than acute exposure.143 Solar UV radiation can i nduce proliferation and migration of melanocytes67 and the production of several cytokines that increase the production of melanin. In addition, inflammatory cells, especially mast cells, which produce a variety of potent pro-inflammatory substanc es, are likely to play key roles.154 Effects of solar UV radiation on the eye The eye is partly protected from direct UV radiation by the brow ridges. This means that reflected radiation is likely to contribute more to the total UV radiation received than occurs for the skin. Higher intensity UV radiation induc es the most damage, although less intense exposure over a long period also increases the risk of disease. Transmission of UV radiation through the eye (Fig. 2) generally decreases with increasing age, but there is wide inter-individual variability.321 The cornea filters out wavelengths less than about 280 nm, although this is relevant for artificial sources only, as sunlight at the Earth's surface is confined to wavelengths >290 nm. There is further absorption in the aqueous humour (Fig. 2). The lens of a young child (e.g., <5 years) transmits close to 100% of the Fig. 2 A schematic drawing of a section through the human eye, with an enlarged schematic of the lens to the right Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 58 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 visible light spectrum (wavelength >400 nm), but absorbs UV radiation, except for a small window at 320 nm.12 The lens of an older person (e.g., 60+ years) commonly filters out even some of the short blue visible light (400-500 nm) so that this, and UV radiation of shorter wavelengths, do not reach the retina. Exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of a number of ocular conditions, with the strongest evidence of a specific effect of UV-B radiation for photokeratitis, pterygium, and cataract. Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis Exposure of the eye to high-dose UV radiation from the sun can result in inflammation of the cornea (photokeratitis) and/or conjunctiva (photoconjunctivitis) (Fig. 2). The maximum sensitivity is to the UV-B wavelengths.74 The damage is probably caused by oxidative stress,41, 61, 62 with the squamous cells of the epithelium of the cornea, the keratocytes of the stromal layer of the cornea, and the endothelial cells lining the back of the cornea, being affected. Transmission of UV radiation decreases across the cornea from the centre to the periphery, due to scattering and absorption.90 The centrally located endothelial cells receive a higher dose of UV radiation, and show evidence of higher oxidative stress than cells in the periphery. It is the damage to these central corneal endothelial cells that particularly causes corneal swelling and temporary loss of vision in UV-induced photokeratitis.90 Pterygium Pterygium, a wing-shaped invasive growth of the conjunctiva (Fig. 3), is common in adults living in environments with high UV radiation. For example, it affects at least one eye in approximately 10% of: adults (15 years) on Norfolk Island, Australia;332 south Indians (40 years) in Chennai, India;16 and indigenous people (40 years) in Central Australia.203 Some recent studies show that the prevalence of pterygium increases with increasing age and is more common in men than women,16 but the increase with age is not consistently found.332 Key risk factors for pterygium are greater time outdoors (including sports with high ocular exposure to UV radiation , such as surfing353), rural residence, having a skin type that tans333 and non-use of spectacles.16 Of note, the only study that has examined the risk of pterygium in association with wavelengths of solar radiation other than those in the UV range (using retrospectively reconstructed exposure behaviour during working hours) found a stronger association with visible light, and a weaker but still significant association with UV-B radiation.355 Recent evidence suggests that a pterygium is not always benign: there is histological evidence of inflammatory and dysplastic changes in the epithelium and underlying connective tissue,132 neoplasia in 2-10% of excised pterygia.13, Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea and conjunctiva Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea and conjunctiva (SCCC) is rare; the annual incidence in the USA is estimated to be 0.84 per 100 000 population.98 The incidence is higher in men, and in association with older age, residence at lower latitude, infection with HIV, and high exposure to UV Fig. 3 Pterygium of the eye.

Melanin in pigmented irises may absorb UV radiation, leading to fewer cataracts in those with more pigmented, than less pigmented, irises.215 Lens es in older individuals may be more susceptible to UV-induced cataracts due to poorer defence against oxidative damage and decreased repair mechanisms.177, 196, 409 In the large Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study with participants aged 65-84 years , the incidence and progression of cortical cataract (but not nuclear cataract) were associated with higher levels of estimated exposure to UV-B radiation (calculated based on an empirical model incorporating self- reported time outdoors and use of protection from the sun).346 In contrast, in the 15 year follow-up of participants in the Beaver Dam Eye Study,190 there was no association between exposure to the sun (as measur ed by residential history) and cumulative incidence of any type of age-related cataract, after controlling for age and sex. However, the combin ed use of sun-sensitising medications and high exposure to the sun led to a significantly increased risk of cortical cataract.190 Ocular malignancies There is strong evidence to support exposure to UV radiation as a risk factor for tumours of the eyelid and weaker evidence for ocular melanomas (reviewed in Yam and Kwok403). Over 90% of the malignancies of the eyelid are BCCs, particularly affecting the lower lid (50-65%), but also the medial canthus (inner corner of the eye, 25-30%), upper eyelid (15%) and lateral canthus (outer corner of the eye, 5%).403 SCC accounts for most of the remainder of the periocular cutaneous tumours.403 Me lanomas of the eye can involve the surface (i.e. the eyelid or conjunctiva), or occur at an intra-ocular location, affecting the elements of the uvea (i.e. the iris, ciliary body, and choroid; Fig. 2) . Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy (>90 %) and the leading cause of death from intraocular cancer.115, 282 The reported annual incidence varies from 0.53 to 1.09 cases per 100,000 population, and is stable or decreasing.115, 282 Uveal melanoma is primarily a disease of white populations; light-coloured irises, blond hair, and fair skin are risk factors.228 There is mixed evidence implicating UV radiation as a risk factor for uveal melanoma: latitudinal variation in incidence is not consistently found;282 occupational exposure to UV radiation may have a protective effect, but intermittent exposure may increase risk (reviewed in Mallet et al.228). People with the disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which there is impaired ability to repair UV-induced DNA damage (see discussion above), have a 58-fold increased risk of uveal melanoma.53, 228 Genetic studies show that the mutation patterns of the most frequently mutated genes in CMM and uveal melanoma (i.e. BRAF vs. GNAQ, GNA11 identified CMM ( RAC1 ) is also found in 20% of uveal melanoma cell lines.228 Given the strong evidence supporting a role for UV radiation as a cause of CMM, these studies also provide some evidence that exposure to UV radiation is a risk factor for uveal melanoma. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 60 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Age-related macular degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the cause of 7% of blindness worldwide in 2010,47 and was the most frequent cause of blindness in older (50-75 years) white populations in Europe.299 UV radiation had been discounted previously as a risk factor in AMD as it does not reach the retina. However, recognition of the considerable individual variability in the transmission of longer UV- B/shorter UV-A wavelengths (<320 nm) in older adults (60+ years) has led to reconsideration of a potential role of UV radiation. Possible mechanisms include: UV-induced oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, particularly in the macular region of the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium;126 and/or upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) and transcription factors (e.g., STAT3). Higher vitamin D status is associated with lower risk of AMD in women <75 years, but a higher risk in women 75.242 In a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and cross-sectional studies, higher exposure to the sun was associated with a 38% increase in the odds of having AMD.347 However, blue light (400-500 nm) may be more important than UV radiation as a risk factor for AMD.230, 391, 403 Other possible effects on the eye There is a well-established association between spending less time outdoors and an increased risk of developing myopia in childhood.137, 140, 141, 331 While early hypotheses focused on the importance of variation in focal length with a mix of indoor and outdoor activities, more recent work suggests the importance of exposure to light, possibly through increased secretion of dopamine in the retina, with effects on the growth of the eye.262 The wavelength dependence of this effect, and whether the pathways are mediated by vitamin D405 or not,331 are currently unknown. Evidence from animal studies suggests that UV irradiation of the eye can cause systemic immunosuppression,159, 160 but the relevance of these findings for human health is unclear at present. Effect s of solar UV radiation on immune function and consequences for disease Mechanisms UV photons penetrate the epidermis and upper dermis359 and are absorbed by chromophores (Table 2), which then initiate a cascade leading to changes in immune responses. Table 2 Cutaneous chromophores involved in the initiation of UV-induced changes in immune function (reviewed in127).

However, an action spectrum for the UV-induced suppression of the human immune response to a previously-encountered antigen (termed memory or recall immune responses) has been constructed: it has two peaks, one within the UV-B waveband at 300 nm and one at 370 nm in the UV-A waveband.77, 232 There is also evidence from studies in both humans and mice that interactive and additive effects between wavebands can occur.175, 292, 306 Briefly, exposure to UV radiation causes up-regulation of some innate immune responses, and down-reg ulation of some acquired primary and memory immune responses, mainly through effects on T cell activity (reviewed in Gibbs & Norval,163 Schwarz & Schwarz,169 and Ullrich & Byrne369). The up-regulation includes the production of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the epidermis,72, 130 possibly through a vitamin D pathway (see below). The AMPs provide immediate protection against a variety of pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses having a viral envelope) and they are also involved in the promotion of cell growth, healing, and angiogenesis. In contrast to these stimulatory functions, exposure to UV radiation induces T regulatory cells (T regs) and other cell types which contribute to immunosuppression and help to restore cutaneous homeostasis.72, 258 Mediators such as platelet- activating factor, prostaglandin E 2, histamine, and tumour necrosis factor-, are produced locally at the irradiated site. These alter the migration patterns and functions of variou s populations of immune cells. The end result is the generation of cell subsets with suppressive activity which are thought to remain for the life-time of the individual.233, 264 The UV-induced alterations in the normal immune response can be beneficial for some human diseases and detrimental for others. Vitamin D, synthesised following exposure of the skin to UV-B radiation, also has positive and negative effects on immune-related diseases. Indeed, it is difficult to distinguish between immunoregulation by vitamin D and other mediators induced by UV radiation,20, 148, 245, 324, 375 since the downstream effects on immune parameters are similar. For clarity, the effects of UV radiation and those of vitamin D have been assessed separately in the sections below. We first focus on the effects of UV radiation on immunity, and address vitamin D-related effects on immune function in the section specifically on vitamin D. Polymo rphic light eruption Polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is the commonest of the photodermatoses, with a prevalence of up to 20%.330 PLE is manifest as an intermittent itchy red skin eruption which resolves without scarring after a few days to weeks. It occurs 2-3 times more frequently in women than in men, with onset typically in the first three decades of life,330 and is found predominantly in those with fair skin, although al l skin types can be affected.330 A recent study of Indian patients with dark skin phototypes (IV and V) who suffered from various photodermatoses revealed that PLE was the commonest of these, affecting 60% of the group.381 The lesions occur most often in the spring and early summer or during a sunny holiday, following the first exposure to a large dose of sunlight. After repeated exposures, the lesions are less likely to occur. This process, called photohardening, is used therapeutically with good results. Recent investigations indicate that key events in photohardening Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 62 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 include a decrease in the number of Langerhans cells in the epidermis and recruitment of mast cells into the dermis,398 together with changes in systemic cytokine levels.397 PLE is immunologically-mediated as a result of a failure to establish the normal suppression of immune responses following exposure to UV radiation. The antigen involved has not been identified but is likely to be novel, induced by the DNA damaging properties of UV radiation. Various abnormalities in the cutaneous immune response following UV radiation have been demonstrated in people with PLE compared with controls.121, 136 This disease therefore illustrates the positive evolutionary advantage of UV-induced immunosuppression in individuals who are not susceptible to PLE and what can happen if it is absent. Ast hma Asthma comprises a group of diseases that present as wheeze, chest tightness, or shortness of breath , occurring as a result of obstruction of the airways and restriction of airflow that is usually reversible . The level of severity, frequency of symptoms, age of onset, main inflammatory phenotypes, and triggers and pathways are variable. Th is heterogeneity may explain the current lack of consistency in results from studies examining the relationship between UV radiation and the risk of asthma. There are anecdotal accounts that sunny holidays or living at high altitude decrease asthma symptoms. The prevalence of asthma was inversely associated with the intensity of UV radiation,197 or past personal exposure to solar UV radiation.170 However, in a study where different sub-types of asthma were considered, residence at latitudes closer to the equator (and with greater intensity of UV- B radiation) was associated with an increased risk of having asthma in atopic participants (with a history of allergic responses to specific antigen s) but a decreased risk in those without atopy.276 These findings highlight the importance of differentiating between subtypes of asthma in examining associations with exposure to UV radiation. Nevertheless, individual-level exposure to UV radiation was not measured (only latitude and ambient UV radiation), so that the results could reflect exposure to other latitude-associated factors such as temperature and indoor heating. Infection and vaccination Studies over the past 20 years have shown that exposure to solar UV radiation suppresses microbe- specific acquired immune responses in animal models of infection. This modulation can lead to an increased microbial load, reactivation from latency, and more severe symptoms, including death (reviewed in Norval et al.268). A recent study showed that spending 8 or more hours outdoors per week when the UV Index was 4 was associated with an increased risk of ocular recurrence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection resulting in eruptive lesions.224 UV radiation prior to vaccination causes a less effective immune response in several mouse models (reviewed in Norval & Woods271), but whether exposure to UV radiation adversely affects the course of infections and the efficacy of vaccination in humans remains an open question. Despite the paucity of new information, there remains the possibility that UV-induced immunosuppression could convert an asymptomatic infection into a symptomatic one, reactivate a range of persistent infections, increase the oncogenic potential of microbes, and reduce the memory immune response, for example after vaccination, so that it is no longer protective. Autoimmune diseases Many autoimmune diseases are considered to have both environmental and genetic risk factors. Evidence to support the importance of environmental exposures comes from geographic al variation (changing incidence with changing latitude), temporal patterns (such as variations in incidence with season or season-of-birth) and results from observational epidemiological studies. Several studies show an inverse association between exposure to UV radiation and immune-mediated diseases, Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 63 suggesting that the UV may be protective. In many cases, the assumed pathway has been through enhanced synthesis of vitamin D (see section on Vitamin D below). However this evidence is now being re-evaluated in light of possible alternative pathways, including UV-induced immune modulation and altered susceptibility to relevant viral infections, and non-UV pathways such as changes in the secretion of melatonin (reviewed in Hart et al.147). While there have been suggestions that exposure to UV radiation may be important for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (for example, Nerich et al.263), type 1 diabetes,291 and rheumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and others),124 the strongest evidence is for multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis . Ma ny studies (but not all) have shown that the prevalence, incidence, or mortality from multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with increasing latitude and decreasing altitude or intensity of ambient UV radiation, in predominantly fair-skinned populations (reviewed in Hewer et al.155). In the US Nurses Health Studies, a latitudinal gradient present in a cohort of female nurses born before 1946 was not apparent in a similar cohort born after 1946.153 The findings reflected an increase in incidence in the south in the later cohort (rather than a decrease in the north). One explanation given to explain this change was that increasing sun-protective behaviours in the south had reduced the difference in personal dose of UV between the north and south.14 Studies from the northern395 and southern343 hemispheres show that, compared to the general population, people with MS were more likely to have been born in late spring and less likely to have be en born in late autumn. This timing would be consistent with a hypothesis that exposure of the mother to more UV radiation during the late first trimester, when the foetal nervous system is developing and maturing, is protective for the development of MS in later life.343 Alternatively, it is also possible that exposures early in infancy, rather than in pregnancy, influence risk, or other factors that vary seasonally could be important. Animal studies suggest that UV-B irradiation can prevent the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, used as a model for MS,30 and there is supportive evidence from recent studies in humans.221, 413 T he role of UV-induced immune suppression in skin cancer C utaneous m alignant melanoma. Evidence that the immune response is important for the development of CMM is clearly shown by the increase in incidence following organ transplantation that requires ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive medications.377 UV radiation, particularly UV-B, can cause suppression of many aspects of cell-mediated immunity but, until recently, how it influenced the initiation of CMM was unknown. In a transgenic mouse model, the recruitment of macrophages to the skin following UV-B irradiation and their subsequent proliferation were shown to be critical in the survival of melanocytes, including those with UV-induced DNA damage.144, 406, 407 In addition, inflammation induced by UV radiation increased metastasis of melanoma, with neutrophils being the main drivers of the inflammatory process.23 Consistent with these reports from animal models, in patients with metastatic melanoma there was a shorter survival time if metastases contain ed a high proportion of macrophages.103 Non-m elanoma skin cancer. Tumours induced by UV radiation are highly antigenic. UV-induced i mmune suppression plays a critical role in the development of NMSC as evidenced by the dramatically increased incidence in immunosuppressed people, for example, following organ transplantation.251 This is especially shown for SCCs in organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive drugs that suppress T cell activity, suggesting that effector T cells are of particular importance in the control of SCC.270 Furthermore, T regs induced by UV irradiation infiltrat e SCCs and surround BCCs. Pharmacologically blocking steps in the pathway of UV-induced Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 64 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 immunosuppression may be effective in preventing the development of skin cancers and actinic keratoses.270, 349, 360 UV-induced vitamin D and its impact on health Metabolism of vitamin D Vitamin D can be synthesised in the skin or ingested in the diet or as a supplement. The pathway by which vitamin D is produced in the skin and metabolised to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D) is shown in Fig. 4. Synthesis is initiated by absorption of UV-B radiation by 7- dehydrocholesterol. The enzymatic steps converting vitamin D to 1,25(OH) 2D occur predominantly in the liver and the kidney but also in other tissues , including the skin . Both pre-vitamin D 3 and vitamin D 3 can be converted to inactive photoproducts by continued UV-A or UV-B irradiation (discussed in Galkin & Terenetskaya120 and Norval et al.269). Once pre- vitamin D has formed and isomerization to vitamin D has occurred, there is preferential degradation of vitamin D compared with synthesis of pre-vitamin D at wavelengths of UV radiation between 300- 330 nm.386 This may explain why vitamin D toxicity from exposure to solar UV radiation does not occur and may be of importance to public health messages about safe exposure to the sun -- recurrent shorter periods of exposure to the sun are preferable to prolonged exposure to achieve vitamin D production while minimizing UV-induced damage of DNA .389 Vita min D status - assessment and geographic variability Vit amin D status is assessed by measuring the concentration of the intermediate metabolite, 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (Fig. 4) in serum. Vitamin D deficiency is reportedly widespread Fig. 4 Synthesis of vitamin D and the vitamin D metabolic pathway. VDBP: vitamin depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 65 globally, but it is important to note that there are considerable problems with the accuracy and reproducibility of vitamin D assays327 as well as a lack of consensus on the concentration of 25(OH)D that denotes deficient, insufficient, sufficient, or optimal vitamin D status.317 Common cut-off points are provided in Table 3 Table 3 Commonly used cut-off points for vitamin D status based on serum concentrations of 25(OH)D in nmol L-1 Author Year Sufficiency 52.5-72.5 75 There is a striking lack of data on the vitamin D status of infants, children, and adolescents and an almost complete lack of data from Africa and South America.157, 280, 382 Variation in vitamin D status according to latitude is apparent when results arise from a single assay with good agreement across batches of samples,222 and is stronger where blood is taken in winter compared to summer.223 Comparisons across studies may not show a latitudinal gradient due to the analytical challenges and lack of standardisation of the season of blood collection.157, 280, 382 In addition, contributions to vitamin D status from dietary intake and sunny holidays may obscure latitudinal gradients that would otherwise occur. For example, a lower latitude holiday in the previous year with the purpose of sun-bathing was associated with higher 25(OH)D levels by 20-30 nmol L-1 in the following winter months in residents of Uppsala, Sweden.39 Skin pigmentation and vitamin D status Within a given location, people with darker skin commonly have lower concentrations of 25(OH)D than those with fairer skin296, 310 and this is usually attributed to the photoprotective properties of melanin. However, recent work highlights the importance of cultural practices, or personal preferences, leading to avoidance of the sun.186 In a recent study, however, black Americans (n=2,085) had lower concentrations of 25(OH)D, but also lower concentrations of vitamin D binding protein, than white Americans.296 The consequence of this was similar (calculated) levels of \"free\" (not bound to vitamin D binding protein) or loosely bound (to albumin), i.e. bioavailable, 25(OH)D. This observation may explain why black people with low total 25(OH)D have higher bone mineral density than white people with similar 25(OH)D concentrations. Furthermore, it may mean that vitamin D status should be defined by the concentration of bioavailable, rather than total, 25(OH)D.36, 295 Several recent experimental studies have examined the impact of pigmentation of the skin on synthesis of vitamin D. Most of these,210, 340 although not all,44 show that, for a specific dose of simulated solar UV irradiation there is a greater increase in the concentration of 25(OH)D in fairer- skinned than in darker-skinned participants. The lack of effect in the latter study has been attributed to the short wavelength UV-B output from the source lamp, resulting in penetration only into the superficial layers of the epidermis above the main concentration of melanin.40 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 66 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Exposure to the sun and vitamin D status In gene ral, laboratory studies show an initial linear dose-response between exposure to UV radiation and change in concentration of 25(OH)D,46 but a plateau with continuing exposures over a longer period of time.236, 293, 312, 389 Results suggest that the shape of the dose-response curve depends on the baseline concentration of 25(OH)D, with a greater response to UV irradiation44 and no plateau effect in those with a lower starting concentration (<50 nmol L-1),248 although conflicting results have also been obtained.107 U nderstanding the relationship between the dose of UV radiation, the surface area of skin exposed and the production of vitamin D is important for the development of public health messages. Results from population-based epidemiological studies and experimental studies using artificial irradiation, demonstrate that exposing a larger area of skin to UV radiation results in a greater increase in the concentration of 25(OH)D.45, 188 Field studies have shown that increases in the concentrations of 25(OH)D are positively associated with DNA damage (assessed by concentration of CPDs in urine), suggesting that improved vitamin D status is always associated with some potentially mutagenic damage to DNA.289 However, production of vitamin D may be optimised, and skin DNA damage minimised, by increasing the body surface ar ea exposed, and decreasing the UVB-dose per unit area. The World Health Organization's INTERSUN programme recommends sun protection when the UV Index is 3 and there have been concerns that there may be little or no vitamin D production when the UV Index is <3. However, recent computational work suggests that vitamin D could be synthesised at these lower levels of UV radiation, albeit more slowly.237 Webb and colleagues have shown that, for the white-skinned population of Manchester, UK, a normal lifestyle with relatively short, regular exposures to summer sunlight in northern mid-latitudes could increase vitamin D enough at the end of summer to maintain sufficiency levels (>50 nmol L-1 or 20 ng ml-1) throughout the winter.388, 389 Evidence of associations between vitamin D and human disease The vital role of 1,25(OH) 2D in maintaining the concentration of calcium in the blood within a narrow range is well-established; vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. In recent years, many protective functions have been attributed to vitamin D. However, two recent systematic reviews of observational and intervention studies cast doubt on the importance of vitamin D in decreasing the risk of many of these diseases.18, 361 Imm une function, infections, autoimmune diseases and cancer Many of the cell types involved in immune function are able to convert 25(OH)D to the active form, 1,25(OH) 2D.392 The actions of 1,25(OH) 2D are mediated through ligation with a nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) that regulates gene transcription, or via rapid-response membrane receptors. The VDR is expressed on many human cells, including those with immune functions. Polymorphisms in the VDR can affect the effectiveness of gene transcription, altering the action of the active hormone. Immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive pathways are induced by 1,25(OH) Hewison68, 156 and Christakos et al.255). Immunostimulatory effects include the production of AMPs such as cathelicidin by macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, and the maturation of macrophages. Immunosuppressive effects include the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells and their ability to present antigens. Furthermore, 1,25(OH) 2D can inhibit the differentiation and proliferation of B cells and their production of antibodies, and activate T reg cells that have suppressor activity. These multiple effects make it difficult to determine what role, if any, vitamin D has in protection against disorders of immunity. Studies of infectious diseases (using tuberculosis and respiratory viral infections as examples), autoimmune Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 67 diseases (using multiple sclerosis as an example), and the risk of cancer incidence and progression are discussed below. Vitamin D and tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis , is a massive global health burden, with an estimated 9 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths each year. Infection can lead to symptomatic active disease or, more commonly, to a latent infection which can reactivate later in a small proportion of cases. Recent studies suggest an association between low vitamin D status (or lower ambient UV radiation as a presumed proxy) and the prevalence of TB (reviewed in Ralph et al.302), but it is not clear whether low vitamin D status increases the risk of symptomatic TB or vice versa. A beneficial effect of vitamin D is plausible through its immune properties, such as the macrophage-induced death of the M. tuberculosis .302 However vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant to standard antimicrobial therapy has shown no clinical benefit in most studies.231, 303, 390 In a trial in Mongolian children, supplementation with vitamin D stimulated innate immunity against M. tuberculosis , which could be sufficient to prevent the infectious process.122 Further research using optimal doses of vitamin D suppl ementation and with exploration of the effect of host determinants, such as VDR genotype, are required to establish whether improving vitamin D status could aid in the prevention or treatment of TB. Vitamin D and respiratory infections . Viruses infecting the respiratory tract and causing disease, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, are a leading cause of hospitalisations and death in young childre n, and of serious illness and death in those over 65 years. Examples include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. Viral respiratory infections are most common in winter and least common in summer. This seasonal pattern is diminished in the tropics where there is also relatively little seasonal variation in solar UV-B radiation, although there are two peaks of infection in some countries, perhaps reflecting the rainy seasons.42 It is hypothesised that vitamin D-dependent immunoregulation mediates the se seasonal patterns.325 Recent observational studies typically show that lower concentrations of 25(OH)D are associated with greater risk of having a respiratory tract infection (for example35, 54, 128, 161). However, in most cases, study participants had disease symptoms when they were first assessed, so that low vitamin D status could be either a cause or a consequence of the infection. The results from supplementation trials with vitamin D are inconsistent, as indicated by the following studies. Separate trials in Japanese370 and Mongolian57 children showed reduced incidence of respiratory infection in the supplemented groups, and there is some evidence of benefit in postmenopausal women,6 young Finnish men200 and older Australian adults (using antibiotic use as a surrogate for infection).364 In contrast, trials of supplementation in adults from the United States208, 304 and New Zealand254 failed to show any beneficial effect of vitamin D. Reducing the risk of infectious diseases would have significant impacts on personal morbidity and global economies; however, the role of vitamin D in promoting this is unclear at this time. V itamin D and multiple sclerosis. Observational studies consistently show that higher concentr ations of 25(OH)D are associated with lower risk of MS (reviewed in Hewer et al.155), and that vitamin D deficiency is associated with decreased responsiveness to MS treatment, and may be a risk factor for higher MS disease activity and more rapid progression (for example, Ascherio et al.15). Most studies, however, cannot distinguish between cause and effect ; that is, does low vitamin D status cause the disease or does the disease cause the low vitamin D status? Indeed, there is evidence that concentrations of 25(OH)D are reduced by inflammation.308 Further, a review of randomised controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D in people with MS found no evidence Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 68 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 of improvement in clinical endpoints.18 Overall, the authors hypothesised that either uncontrolled confounding or reverse causality provided an explanation for the strong and consistent associations in observational studies and the lack of effect of supplementation. It is also important to consider possible heterogeneity in MS, coupled with a lack of understanding of the timing of the onset of disease pathology and thus the most appropriate time to test vitamin D status or to give vitamin D supplementation. In addition, the risk factors for disease onset may differ from those of progression.220 Vitamin D and cancer risk . Vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of developing cancer as 1,25(OH) 2D has regulatory effects on cellular growth, apoptosis and formation of new blood vessels . Observational studies consistently show associations between low circulating 25(OH)D and increased risk of colorectal cancer (reviewed in Autier et al.18) but, for other cancers, there have either been too few studies or the results are inconsistent.18, 361 Trials do not show evidence of beneficial effects with vitamin D supplementation.38 In addition to the reasons discussed above for similar discrepant findings in relation to MS, the null findings from trials with supplementation of vitamin D may be due to too low a supplement dose, poor compliance, too short a follow-up, inadequate statistical power of the study, or, parsimoniously, suggest that vitamin D has no effect.18 I t is particularly difficult to assess the effects of vitamin D on risk of skin cancer, as UV radiation induces both. Production of 1,25(OH) 2D in the skin enhances the repair of UV -induced DNA damage.76, 133 Cohort studies have shown protective351, 374 and adverse1 associations between concentrations of 25(OH)D and risk of NMSC and similar inconsistencies for risk of CMM.1, 226 Post- hoc analyses of the Women's Health Initiative trial did not show a protective effect of supplementation with vitamin D on risk of NMSC or CMM, but in people with a history of NMSC, the incidence of CMM was reduced in those randomised to 400 IU of vitamin D per day.352 I n summary, the evidence that higher vitamin D status is protective for cancer is weak and inconsistent, except possibly for colorectal cancer risk. If vitamin D deficiency is truly a risk factor, it is low concentrations of 25(OH)D (i.e. <30 nmol L-1) that are associated with increased risk with little additional benefit for concentrations >50 nmol L-1.286 Vitamin D and cancer-survival. Higher vitamin D status has been positively associated with survival from a number of different cancers,18, 329 but there is a paucity of trial data, and confounding by severity of disease or co-morbidities is highly likely. At this time there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. Effects of vitamin D on other health conditions. Several studies suggest that maternal vitamin D deficienc y is associated with adverse outcomes in the offspring across multiple domains: bone mineral content,410 cognitive function,393 depression and risk of eating disorders,5 and autism.393 Furthermore , vitamin D deficiency in early life has been linked to increased risk of schizophrenia in later life.234 These results may indicate that vitamin D status during pregnancy is important for foetal development, but further research will be required to confirm whether these are causal associations or due to a related factor(s). Prospective studies have reported moderate to strong inverse correlations between concentrations of 25(OH)D and cardiovascular diseases, concentrations of serum lipids, inflammation, disorders of glucose metabolism, weight gain, mood disorders, declining cognitive function, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, impaired physical functioning, and mortality. In contrast, intervention trials show no effect of vitamin D supplementation on these outcomes.18 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 69 U-shaped associations between vitamin D metabolites and disease Recent research shows that both high and low concentrations of 25(OH)D are associated with increased disease risk - a so-called U-shaped association. Table 4 provides a summary of studies showing thi s effect. Table 4 Health outcomes for which a U-shaped association with serum 25(OH)D levels has been des cribed, and the 25(OH)D level of lowest risk Disease / condition and reference Concentration (nmol L-1) of lowest risk, i.e. the turning point of the U -shaped dose response All-cause mortality94, 239, 328 80-100 Cardiovascular events91, 412 50-100 Cancer 240 100 (men only) Prostate -age births among white women43 60-70 Physical frailty in older women99 50-74.9 An additional U-shaped association has been shown between concentration of 1,25(OH) 2D and viral load in patients with HIV.29 There is a trend to advocate ever higher cut-off s to denote the concentration of 25(OH)D concentrations that is optimal to prevent disease.380 It is therefore important to continue to investigate possible disease risks at higher concentrations of 25(OH)D, especially if the aim is to maintain such levels over the long-term. Other effects of solar UV radiation on human health Chronic exposure to UV radiation has been weakly linked to a range of other adverse health outcomes, including: decreased epidermal22 and subcutaneous187 lipid synthesis resulting in weakening of the barrier function of the skin; hearing impairment, through oxidative stress pathways;241, 243 lactase non-persistence;350 increased risk of prostate cancer;255 and acquired bilateral nevus-of-Ota-like macule, a common pigmentation disorder in Asian females.384 In contrast, there is evidence of a protective effect of higher UV radiation on development of restless legs syndrome191 and keloid formation in scars.396 There are a growing number of studies examining the apparently beneficial effects of exposure to the sun. A recent study has shown that UV- A irradiation is effective in lowering blood pressure, possibly through UV-A-induced nitric oxide bioactivity.214 A reduced risk of cancer and particularly breast cancer has been reported in association with greater exposure to the sun in early life,404 as well as a decreased risk of myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality, and hip fracture in those below age 90, where history of skin cancer was the measure of past exposure to the sun.52 In Chile the most frequent cases of food-related anaphylaxis occur at higher latitudes where there is lower solar radiation.168 Personal protection from solar UV radiation The threat of increasing levels of UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion, and rising skin cancer incidence rates, led to the development of sun protection programs and strategies. Despite the Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 70 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 partial recovery of the ozone layer (reviewed in Chapter 1), such strategies remain important because changes in climate are likely to alter both ambient UV radiation and behaviour that affects exposure to the sun. A sustained effort is required to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to exposure to the sun, especially in young people.24 Several recent surveys indicate that adults,55, 119 adolescents,309 and children,89, 96 still commonly report having been sunburned in the previous year, and this applies to both fair- and dark-skinned populations .27 Whi le in some locations, a majority of children use some form of photoprotection, particularly shade,89, 96, 105 this is not true of adults.55 Good knowledge of protection from the sun may not translate into attitudes and practices for reduc ing exposure.89, 105, 253 Further, more education about the specific needs for photoprotection in different situations may be required. In a sample of young German children, parental knowledge of appropriate use of shade, clothing, a sunhat, and sunscreen was considered to be adequate for summer holidays at the beach, but not for everyday outdoor activities.209 In a Danish study, travel to a sunny destination was common (almost 50% of those aged 15-59 years took such a holiday each year), with a high likelihood of sunburn and intentional tanning.192 There are limited data on strategies for photoprotection in tropical countries but one survey in adolescents living in Bangkok, Thailand, found that sunscreens, sun-protective clothing, and shade were seldom used, particularly in males, compared with Western countries.356 In a study in Philadelphia, USA, Hispanic adolescents and young adults who showed evidence of greater adoption of US culture were less likely to use sunscreen and more likely to deliberately expose themselves to the sun than those who retained their traditional culture.151 Barriers to personal protection from the sun in young Australians include peer pressure, lifestyle, fashion and social norms.294 T he ultraviolet index (UVI) is routinely published in the media in some countries, available online,58 on a mobile phone,17 on mobile phone apps,92 or can be approximated using a compact disk as a sundial.59 However, its use to guide behaviour in relation to exposure to the sun remains limited.252 Furthermore, the specific guidance in relation to the UVI varies across different countries. For example, i n Australia, photoprotection is recommended when the UV Index is 3.58 In New Zealand, a \"UV Sun protection Alert Period\" is provided daily, rather than the UVI, and is defined as the period of the day where the forecast clear-sky UVI is >3.301 The United States Environmental Protect ion Agency provides a UV Alert when the forecast UVI is at 6, with advice to minimise time in the sun and use protection.100 As noted, exposure to the sun when the UVI is <3 is relatively ineffective for vitamin D production, whereas, for some fair-skinned individuals, even short exposures at a UVI of 6 may result in erythema. It is difficult to provide blanket recommendations, even according to the UVI and skin type, as there is wide variation in the minimal erythema dose (MED, the dose of UV radiation required to cause a slight reddening of the skin) even within a specific skin type, and different messages may be required for different regions.408 It is not generally realised that measures for protection against the sun may be required on cloudy days, in addition to clear days, due to diffuse solar UV radiation,7, 378 and that some shade devices, such as umbrellas, provide incomplete protection from UV-B radiation.198 Sunscreens Public health bodies have long advocated the use of sunscreens as a means of photoprotection. A long-term prospective study in Queensland, Australia, showed that daily use of sunscreen reduced the incidence of SCC372 with some evidence of reduction in the incidence of CMM.134 In addition, such use also reduced photoageing of the skin.171 However, a recent meta-analysis of the effectiveness of Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 71 interventions promoting use of sunscreen in adults and children in recreational settings showed no reduction of sunburn in adults and only a modest effect in children.315 Sunscr eens are formulated and tested for their ability to prevent erythema (inflammation) in vivo and their index of efficacy is the sun protection factor (SPF).178 The labelled SPF is equal to: [MED protected skin ]/[MED unprotected skin ], when tested under laboratory conditions with simulated solar radiation. The erythema action spectrum dictates that this is primarily an index of protection from UV-B radiation although sunscreens are also required to have a measure of protection against UV- A radiation.113 Sunscreens with uniform absorption across the whole UV spectrum (broad-spectrum) provide photoprotection that is similar to shade or some types of clothing fabric87 (for more detail, see Chapter 7). Some UV radiation filters may also have anti-inflammatory properties,71 in which case the SPF may be more than a measure of optical filtering.322 O ne requirement of the SPF test is that sunscreen is applied at a coverage of 2 mg cm-2, but several studies have shown that people apply much less (for example, Petersen et al.287). The thickness of the application is also dependent on the formulation, with coverage of only 0.22 mg cm-2 achieved by children applying sunscreen with a roll-on.85 Use of a higher SPF sunscreen or two applications of sunscreen can achieve a greater level of protection.290, 357 In addition to inadequate thickness of application, failure to apply sunscreen to all areas of exposed skin also limits the amount of photoprotection achieved. There are concerns that using sunscreen will decrease synthesis of vitamin D. Current evidence suggests that, if sunscreen is correctly applied, there may be no increase in concentrations of 25(OH)D following exposure to the sun.109 However, with usual applications, there is minimal impairment of the synthesis of vitamin D.213, 374 T raditional topical sunscreens depend on the filtering or scattering of UV radiation, i.e. \"passive\" photoprotection. Table 5 summarizes some recent developments in compounds providing \"active\" photoprotection at a topical and systemic level.179 Table 5 Newer active sunscreens and evidence of their effectiveness Class Route and Effectiveness -melanocyte stimulating hormone analogues - stimulate melanogenesis (tanning), e.g., afamelanotide Sub-cutaneous; Effective in some photosensitive patients150, 204 Natural anti -oxidants, e.g., Vitamin A (retinol), Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), Vitamin E (tocopherol), Pycnogenol (pine bark extract), Carotenoids Oral; Not as effective as topical sunscreens66, 179 Nicotinamide (an amide form of vitamin B3) Topical; enhances DNA repair, prevents UV -induced immunosuppression, reduces incidence of NMSC65 Resveratrate, found in red wine, grapes, plums and peanuts Topical; Application immedi ately after exposure to the sun protected against erythema and sunburn cell formation401 Flavonoids, e.g., luteolin (a) Protects skin by a combination of UV -absorbing, DNA -protective, antioxidant and anti -inflammatory effects.400 Lycopene, found in tomato paste Oral; Ingestion over a 12 week period reduced acute & chronic effects of photodamage314 Green tea polyphenols Oral; Some evidence of modest effect152, 313 Diet rich in omega -3 fatty acids Oral; May reduce risk of skin cancer 217, 373 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 72 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Class Route and Effectiveness Liposomes containing natural endonucleases or photolyases Topical; Enhan ce nucleotide excision repair of UV - induced DNA damage; shown to reduce the incidence of solar keratoses and the severity of polymorphic light eruption.32, 81, 164 Overall, people are probably getting much less protection from the harmful effects of UV radiation than they believe when they use sunscreens, especially if their intention is to prolong their time in the sun. This is a public health issue that has to be addressed either by encouraging people not to go outdoors when the UVI is high, or to use appropriate clothing (see also Chapter 7) for sun protection.58 Alternatively, people need to apply sunscreen more thickly, or use sunscreen of a higher SPF to compensate for inadequate application. Clothing and Shade Clothing modifies the skin surface area exposed to solar UV radiation. It offers good protection against sunburn, although this is dependent on the properties of the fabric such as colour, structure (e.g., woven vs. knit and tightness of the weave for woven fabrics), and wetness ( see Chapter 7). Clothing typically strongly attenuates transmission of erythema lly-effective UV radiation (i.e. weighted with the erythema action spectrum) to the skin. However, this blocking of UV-B radiation commonly leads to low vitamin D status in people who wear full body clothing,275 for example for religious or cultural reasons.25, 149 It may be possible to design and manufacture clothing from fabrics that allows synthesis of vitamin D while preventing a visible erythema.339 However, it is likely that this will not protect from suberythemal damage, such as to the DNA of the epidermal cells. Shade-seeking is a well-recognized and effective way of reducing exposure to solar UV radiation, as evidenced by a lower level of sunburn212 and lower vitamin D status in adults from the USA who reported frequent use of shade on a sunny day, compared to those who used shade rarely.213 Provision of shade over playgrounds, particularly in sunny locations, is a relatively inexpensive method of mass protection from the sun. Nevertheless, a systematic review of 23 publications found no evidence that health promotion interventions had any effect in increasing shade-seeking in adults or children.315 Shade may be less effective at reducing exposure to diffuse UV radiation and this may account for about 80% of people's cumulative annual erythemal exposure.378 A recent study has used a manikin head (in a fixed position) to measure exposure to UV radiation under different conditions of shade, cloud cover and solar angle.283 This approach can be used to quantify the protective benefits of shade that are currently not well documented. Preventing skin cancer versus ensuring adequate vitamin D status There is no simple message to guide optimal levels of exposure to the sun. There is considerable variation between individuals in the doses of UV radiation that cause damage to DNA and induce synthesis of vitamin D. However, some broad recommendations can be made. Repeated short exposures to the sun are more efficient at vitamin D production than a single prolonged exposure.389 Levels of UV-B radiation are greatest at midday and vitamin D synthesis is thus most efficient at this time,238 although it is also the time when sunburn occurs most quickly.387 The amount of time in the sun that is needed for the synthesis of vitamin D varies according to location, time of day, and time of year. After controlling for the level of exposure to UV radiation, having more skin not covered by clothing is associated with higher concentrations of 25(OH)D in serum.45, 188 As noted above, there are conf licting results on the effect of darker pigmentation of skin on the UV-induced production of vitamin D. In high latitude locations where UV-B levels are too low for vitamin D synthesis and a Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 73 cooler climate may mean that little skin is exposed to the sun even during summer, greater intake of vitamin D may be required to avoid vitamin D deficiency. Prote ction of the eye One of the cheapest and most practical methods of protecting the eye from exposure to UV-B radiation is wearing a hat with a brim of at least 6-7 cm.58, 318 Sungl asses provide variable protection, and standards are more rigorous for UV-B than for UV-A radiation. For UV- B radiation the upper transmission limits range from 1.0% to 12.5% depending on the international jurisdiction and the type of use. For UV-A radiation, the limit is either a maximum of 50% of visible transmittance or is unspecified. The size of the frame and design can influence eye protection and some standards for sunglasses incorporate a minimum size limit.337 Wrap-around designs are most protective and are especially important when in highly reflective conditions, for example when skiing.337 Many ordinary eye-glass lenses have UV filters in them. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requires that contact lenses absorb at least 95% of UV-B radiation and 70% of UV-A radiation for a \"UV blocking\" claim. A recent survey on a selection of lenses showed compliance with claims for photoprotection.279 Studi es using manikin heads123, 385 have shown that, although the ambient UV radiation is greatest at solar noon, the highest dose of UV radiation was received by the eye at 4 hours before and after noon, when the solar elevation angle was low er. Thus, photoprotection of the eyes during outdoor activities is important not only at noon, but also at other times, and during winter.169 In some occupations, e.g., working on a building site, the reflectivity of the building materials may influence the amount of UV radiation received by the eye368 and should be considered when wearing eye- protection. Protection of the eyes from the sun should reduce the risk of pterygium; UV absorbing contact lenses that cover most of the cornea can protect against UV-induced damage.64, 337 Eye drops for the prevention of pterygium and photokeratitis/photoconjunctivitis through an ti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory pathways have been effective in animal models, but are not commonly used in humans.62, 202 Effect s of interactions between solar UV radiation and the environment Environmental contaminants may interact synergistically with UV radiation to harm human health. For example, in the presence of UV-B radiation, chrysene,4 a common environmental contaminant produced by incomplete burning of fossil fuels, and some pesticides,31 have adverse effects on human health, including through damage to DNA.101 Topical corticosteroids are unstable under UV- B irradiation, possibly causing skin damage as well as loss of therapeutic effect.246 Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly incorporated into sporting equipment, sunscreens, clothing and cosmetics (see also Chapter 7). Concerns have been raised about possible health risks of NPs.139, 199 A recent review of the evidence on NP in sunscreens concluded that \"on current evidence, neither TiO 2 nor ZnO NPs are likely to cause harm when used as ingredients in sunscreens \".362 Nevertheless, exposure of skin to UV radiation may enhance the penetration of engineered NPs,180 and the formulations using these particles are often used around the time of irradiation when skin damage may occur. Further, UV-induced immunosuppression could potentially impair an immune protective response induced by engineered NPs applied to the skin.180 On the positive side, UV radiation is a potent environmental disinfectant able to inactivate viruses in clear water (for further discussion see Chapter 4). This property is used in the SODIS (solar disinfection ) technique, where exposure of surface water within a transparent bottle to sunlight Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 74 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 effectively disinfects the water, decreasing the incidence of diarrhoea l diseases (reviewed in McGuigan et al.235). Health implications of interactions between ozone depletion and climate change Past studies have estimated the health gains in terms of skin cancers avoided through the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments.336 A recent update of this work that also integrated coupled climate-chemistry models has estimated that the world-wide incidence of ski n cancer would have been 14% greater (2 million people) by 2030 without implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments,376 with the largest effects in the South West USA and in Australia (see Chapter 1} for further details). Model es timates21 suggest that, by 2050, any increases in erythemal UV radiation above present levels will be small and confined to the tropical region (reviewed in Chapter 1). These should have only a small effect on the incidence of skin cancer79 but may impair immune responses to some vaccinations. However, outside the tropical region, erythemal UV radiation is projected to be low er especially in winter (reviewed Chapter 1 ) which could be detrimental for the vitamin D status of populations in these regions, as well as for diseases that may be modulated by exposure to UV radiation, such as some of the autoimmune diseases discussed above. Estimates of exposure times for erythema and vitamin D synthesis in Europe, taking account of ozone recovery and interactions with different concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG),79 suggest that there will be very little change in the exposure time for both endpoints for Southern Europe. However, an increased exposure time of about 30% for vitamin D production would be required in a worst case scenario in Stockholm in spring with high levels of GHG s.79 A major determinant of the received dose of UV radiation is behaviour in relation to exposure to the sun.288 Ambient temperature is likely to influence time spent outdoors. In temperate parts of Australia, the increase in temperature is likely to increase skin cancer incidence because people will spend more time outside with less clothing.206, 227 However, with the temperature increases in already warm climates, people will be more likely to stay indoors or to seek shade.223 Warmer ambient temperatures may have direct physiological effects to accelerate both skin cancer development371 and vitamin D production.366 In addition to these direct effects of interactions between climate change and ozone depletion and/or UV radiation for human health, there are potential indirect effects that may become important, but, at this stage remain ill-defined.363 Concurrent changes in climate and levels of ambient UV radiation will influence aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (see also Chapters 3 and 4) that may have consequences for food safety, quality and supply (reviewed in363). Migration of populations, often with dark skin pigmentation, from low-lying tropical regions because of rising sea levels, to higher latitude regions may increase the diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. Higher temperatures should foster microbial growth in surface waters, and this will be more pronounced in the presence of lower levels of disinfecting UV-B radiation, or where increases in colour due to dissolved organic matter limit penetration of UV-B radiation (for more detail, see Chapter 3, 4 and 5). However there has been little research to date that allows prediction or quantification of the risks to human health that might arise from these interactions. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 75 Gaps in our knowledge Considerable evidence from animal models suggests that UV-induced immunosuppression may increase the risk of some infections and decrease the protection offered by vaccination (reviewed in Norval & Halliday270). Studies in humans are required to determine whether any increased risk is clinically relevant, for example, requiring changes in vaccination protocols. Although some animal studies similarly suggest that vitamin D status affects the outcomes of vaccination or immune responses to infection, results from clinical trials mostly show no effect.106, 297 There is currently considerable controversy about which health conditions are influenced by vitamin D. Large-scale vitamin D supplementation trials that are in progress will provide some answers (see Table 1 in Byrne56). While there is consensus that vitamin D is important for bone health, there is lack of agreement about the concentration of 25(OH)D required. In addition, there is substantial individual variability in the change in concentration in 25(OH)D in response to UV irradiation and vitamin D supplementation, and in the clinical effects associated with different concentrations of 25(OH)D. The reasons for this are poorly understood, but are likely to depend on variation in the genes encoding the vitamin D binding protein and/or the vitamin D receptor. Production of vitamin D occurs readily at sub-erythemal doses, but repeated sub-erythemal exposures can also cause accumulation of CPDs that repair only slowly (over 24-36 hours) and thus may increase the risk of skin cancer.326 Until there is a better understanding of the numbers of CPDs that accrue during brief sun exposures, and their importance in determining the risk of subsequent skin cancer, it is difficult to recommend safe exposures which would result in sufficient production of vitamin D. There is a lack of data on the vitamin D status of infants, children, and adolescents and for populations in Africa and South America. Further, the lack, until recently, of accurate and precise assays has limited our ability to examine variability in vitamin D status across countries (for example those with and without fortification of food) and over time. The advent of the standardised vitamin D assays60 means that this is now possible. Development of a less invasive sampling method, for example using saliva, would allow more widespread assessment of the vitamin D status of infants and children. Protection from the sun is currently recommended by the World Health Organization when the UVI is 3. The corollary of this message is that photoprotection is not required when the UVI is <3. At these low UVI values, there is little UV-B radiation (and thus little vitamin D synthesis), but, with prolonged exposure, there may be a relatively high dose of UV-A radiation. With recognition that UV-A radiation can induce immune suppression77 and is involved in the initiation of CMM, but may also have beneficial effects on blood pressure, the doses received and potential health effects need to be better defined. The action spectra for a number of health outcomes have not been determined. These include cataract from protracted exposure, myopia, carcinoma in deeply pigmented skin, melanoma and production of pre-vitamin D from a polychromatic source (the sun) and in both dark and fair skin types. However, the relevance of the currently available animal models is uncertain so obtaining these action spectra with definite relevance to humans is very difficult. There is emerging evidence that exposure to the sun may have beneficial effects independently of vitamin D. The lack of a strong evidence-base challenges our ability to provide accurate guidance to the public regarding exposure to the sun. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on human health 76 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 As noted above, there is much uncertainty about the effect of the potential indirect interactions of climate change and ozone depletion on human health. Effects on disinfection of surface water and on supply and security of food could become important sources of risks to health, particularly in some regions of the world. Modelling now may be able to identify those areas at greatest risk, and allow forward planning to mitigate the risks.

Summary In this assessment we summarise advances in our knowledge of how UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) together with other climate-change factors influence terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. We identify key uncertainties and knowledge gaps that limit our ability to fully evaluate the interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on these systems. We also evaluate the biological consequences of the way in which stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed to climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the last assessment, several new findings or insights have emerged or been strengthened. These include 1) the increasing recognition that UV-B radiation has specific regulatory roles in plant growth and development that in turn can have beneficial consequences for plant productivity via effects on plant hardiness, enhanced plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens, and improved quality of agricultural products with subsequent implications for food security; 2) UV-B radiation together with UV-A (315-400 nm) and visible radiation (400-700 nm) are significant drivers of decomposition of plant litter in globally important arid and semi-arid ecosystems, such as grasslands and deserts. This occurs through the process of photodegradation, which has implications for nutrient cycling and carbon storage, although considerable uncertainty exists in quantifying its regional and global biogeochemical significance; 3) UV radiation can contribute to climate change via its stimulation of volatile organic compounds from plants, plant litter and soils, although the magnitude, rates and spatial patterns of these emissions remain highly uncertain at present. UV-induced release of carbon from plant litter and soils may also contribute to global warming; and 4) depletion of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere modifies climate directly via effects on seasonal weather patterns (precipitation and wind) and these in turn have been linked to changes in growth of plants across the Southern Hemisphere. Such research has broadened our understanding of the linkages that exist between the effects of ozone depletion, UV-B radiation and climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Introduction We have focused mainly on recent work in order to highlight the progress made to date, and to attempt an analysis of the complexity of both independent and interacting factors on terrestrial Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 96 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 ecosystems in terms of UV radiation and other environmental constraints, including emerging evidence of the role of stratospheric ozone trends in affecting climate. Ozone depletion, changed exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation, and climate change exert both individual and interactive effects on biological systems, with intricate feedbacks.12, 158 Some of the key factors interacting with UV radiation that affect organism response are water availability, temperature, and nutrient availability. UV radiation has also been implicated as a contributor to global warming through its stimulation of volatile organic compounds from plants, plant litter and soils. Emission of carbon dioxide ( CO 2) from plant litter and soils may also contribute to global warming.41, 76 O zone depletion modifies Southern Hemisphere summer weather through its effect on the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) with consequences for plant growth in South America, New Zealand, and Antarctica already reported.114, 140, 145 These impacts of ozone depletion on other climate factors (e.g., wind patterns, precipitation, and warming) may result in an increase in the interactive effects of UV radiation with drought and temperature. Other seasonal weather phenomena need to be taken into account to gain an accurate perspective of the different determinants of UV exposure of terrestrial organisms. These include La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o events, which change cloud cover, winds, sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric pressure at sea level. In addition, changes in land-use and vegetation cover, which also feed-back to climate systems, have implications for the exposure and thus response of organisms to UV radiation. During the course of research on the effects of UV radiation, much emphasis has been placed on the potential detrimental impacts on plants and ecosystems. However, the balance of recent evidence is shifting to show that while some detrimental effects do occur, UV radiation is also a key regulator of plant morphology and physiological, biochemical and genetic processes, and is important in animal and plant signalling. Following on from this line of investigation, it has also become apparent that UV radiation and climate variables can be usefully exploited for value-adding to, e.g., agricultural crops.155 The emerging concept, that agricultural156, 158 plants can become more hardy through exposure to UV radiation, represents a marked shift in perspective.155, 156 In addition, certain plants produce more medicinal compounds with exposure to UV radiation.164 The overall objective is to boost the quality and/or quantity of yield, usually selectively, e.g., by making plants less prone to attack by pests and diseases. Concepts such as that of \"eustress\" are also relevant. Eustress is analogous to 'priming' where a stress is imposed on plants to acclimatise them and develop tolerance, which facilitates better growth when exposed to a more severe stress.88, 156 Exposure to ecologically-relevant levels of UV radiation generally are not deleterious as long as plants are able to acclimate, although this depends on the environmental conditions including climate variables, latitudinal location38 and plant type (e.g., whether plants are herbaceous or woody). Consequently, the direct negative effects of exposure to UV-B radiation on plant growth, photosynthesis, and productivity are generally minor, or not detectable (summarised in meta-analyses by Searles et al.124 and Newsham and Robinson99). However, indirect effects of exposure to UV radiation are often more pronounced than direct effects and need to be addressed to obtain a holistic perspective of the role of UV radiation as a regulator and modifier of ecosystem and organism response. In this current assessment, we focus on the way in which UV radiation, stratospheric ozone trends, climate and other phenomena affect the biosphere, in order to better understand the current interactive effects from different stresses and to identify possible new interactions and their implications. This will allow for an evaluation of the capability of terrestrial ecosystems to adapt to a changing environment in which UV radiation plays an integral part in the response. Additionally, an Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 97 assessment of these interactive processes on organisms and ecosystems recognises that the effects of UV radiation often represent a balance of both positive and negative influences.158 Although the role of UV-B radiation is a major consideration in this paper, other relevant and often interacting factors, such as stratospheric ozone trends and climate change cannot be meaningfully separated. Multiple plant stresses and their implications in the response to UV radiation Evaluation of the effect of different levels of exposure to UV-B radiation, whether beneficial or not, is complicated by the dependency on many other variables, including the sensitivity of diverse ecosystems and species. This differential sensitivity, which results in distinctive response patterns, reflects the complexity of the biosphere as our understanding increases. UV radiation, temperature and drought The volume of research concentrating on the impacts of UV radiation and drought is indicative of the increasing awareness of a changing climate coupled with other interlinking factors. However, there are still several knowledge gaps, e.g., at the mechanistic level around drought and UV-B signalling interactions and the consequences at the molecular level leading to plant response. Areas such as the Middle East, North Africa, certain regions of Australia and the Mediterranean are particularly vulnerable to climate change.135 Research on plants originating from drought-prone regions (e.g., the Mediterranean area), provides insight into current and potential long-term constraints for growth of agricultural plants and ecosystems by increased temperature, scarcity of water and enhanced exposur e to UV radiation.28 Predicted decreased cloudiness in the Mediterranean area is likely to enhance exposure to UV-B and UV-A radiation (315-400 nm).160 Other co-occurring factors modifying UV radiation at the Earth's surface include air pollution and aerosol load (see Chapter 6). High solar radiation, high temperatures, and drought conditions can lead to an array of responses including oxidative stress and physiological and metabolic acclimation.55 The frequently observed, although not universal cross-tolerance to drought stress and UV radiation is in contrast to the increased sensitivity to UV radiation that can occur in adequately watered plants(Caldwell et al.30 and references therein and others22, 143, 150). For example, in many woody Mediterranean plants, several physiological and biochemical traits (e.g., plant growth, net rate of assimilation of CO 2, and photochemistry) show little response to changes in UV radiation against a background of high temperatures and drought periods.22 UV radiation and other stress factors can increase allocation of newly assimilated carbon to polyphenols, and in particular, the flavonoid compounds, indicative of an energy shift in order to acclimate to stress conditions (Ballar\u00e9 et al.12 and references therein and Guidi et al.55). The lack of a substantial response to UV radiation in many of the parameters measured in Mediterranean plants may also be explained by biochemical acclimation induced by the visible part of the solar spectrum, thus leading to acclimation to UV and ultimately adaptation.55 This involves effective scavenging of reactive oxygen species and other protective mechanisms such as morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes28 that contribute to drought and high temperature tolerance, as well as positive plant-insect interactions.90 Decreased plant productivity and changes in crop quality may, however, occur with long-term and multiple stress exposure. Significance of sequential stress In the context of interactive stresses, recent work has continued to address the importance of the sequence in which plants are exposed to the different stresses (reviewed in Bandurska et al.14, although further supporting research is needed in this area. Field studies also are lacking, which may Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 98 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 be a reflection of the difficulties encountered in trying to evaluate sequential stresses under more natural conditions. A growth chamber study by Bandurska and Cieslak14 showed that exposure of plants to UV-B radiation and drought, whether in combination or individually applied, affected metabolic processes differently at different locations within the plant. With separate applications of enhanced UV-B radiation and simulated drought conditions, plant growth is often retarded and oxidative stress increases. In general, exposure to both UV-B radiation and drought can elicit a number of physiological and biochemical responses that are common to both abiotic stresses. These involve increases in oxidative stress through production of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, growth inhibition and, in some cases, the induction of phenolic compounds (Bandurska et al.15 and references therein). UV-induced oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation, can be reduced by pre-exposing plants to mild drought conditions. Sequential or simultaneous exposure to stress factors can also be genotype-specific. For example, as illustrated in a growth-chamber study, drought-susceptible genotypes were more adversely affected by simultaneous application of enhanced UV-B radiation and drought conditions than the drought-tolerant genotype.60 However, the response may differ under natural environments. Where either drought or enhanced UV-B radiation is first supplied singly, the negative effects may be lessened when followed by the other stress.60 Similarly, pre-exposure of plants to enhanced levels of UV-B radiation before exposure to high levels of visible light and high temperature results in an increase in photosynthesis and relative growth.155 Pre-exposures to relatively high temperatures can also induce UV tolerance.73 These studies are of relevance particularly for horticultural practices, where vitality of plants can be increased through exposure to the relevant sequential stress prior to transfer from greenhouse/nursery to open field conditions. Fertiliser application and nitrogen deposition The degree of complexity of plant and ecosystem response to multiple environmental and climatic factors is becoming increasingly evident as research moves from single-stress experiments to more natural environmental conditions. This is exemplified by a number of recent field studies where application of fertiliser to plants exposed to enhanced UV radiation induced varied responses. Fertiliser can modify the effects of elevated temperature and UV-B radiation. For example, changes in some secondary metabolites, including certain phenolic compounds and alkaloids occur, as was shown in Norway spruce ( Picea abies L.).152 Furthermore, increased sensitivity towards enhanced UV-B radiation may result where fertiliser is applied in excess of recommended levels.130 This was manifested in a shift in biomass towards the shoots of field-grown radish plants, causing a loss in yield as compared to growth under recommended levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).130 In contrast, additional but not excessive N may alleviate the negative effects of UV- B radiation stress.57, 75 Volatile organic compounds Several environmental stresses, both biotic and abiotic, stimulate the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from plant tissues, partly as a protective mechanism.63, 109 While a large diversity of VOCs are produced from terrestrial ecosystems, only a few of these compounds contribute substantially to the total emissions.54 So far, only a few studies have focused on co-occurring st resses63, 107 to elucidate the potential interactive effects on VOC emissions. These stressors include UV radiation, drought, soil moisture, temperature, tropospheric ozone, and herbivore attack, presenting a challenge in terms of quantifying their individual and combined contributions to emissions of VOCs at a local, regional and global level. This complexity is further overlaid by the Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 99 variable nature of emissions according to type of plant. VOCs such as isoprene, are potential contributors to increasing greenhouse gases110 and thus may modify atmospheric composition, including extending the lifetimes of methane.7 For example, one of the major sources of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) is oxidation of isoprene, and scavenging of OH radicals by CO reduces the oxidation rate of methane, increasing its lifetime. Isoprene, the most environmentally important VOC emitted from terrestrial plants, contributes ca 50% of the total global biogenic VOC.54 While UV-B radiation and temperature can have interactive effects on VOC emissions, temperature is the more significant driver of increasing emissions. Those factors that stimulate VOC emission, including UV radiation,80 result in an energy- cost to plants with a potential loss in productivity as a result of allocation of energy and carbon into, for example, synthesis of isoprene.63, 128 The extent to which UV radiation plays a stimulatory role in VOC emissions is currently unknown. VOCs from a range of terrestrial and certain marine systems have been widely measured including in extreme environments such as the Arctic regions and deserts. The effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on emissions of VOCs from sub-Arctic peatlands are highly variable, even when averaged over a growing season, ranging from no detectable change to 60% greater compared to ambient UV-B treatments49, 141 and see Chapter 5. Thus, emissions of VOC from plants and peatlands reflect the prevailing environmental conditions, including temperature, availability of water and UV radiation80, 83, 112 and can lead to further interactions and feedbacks within the biosphere. Me thane, the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, is produced by both microbial and non-microbial mechanisms as well as through geological processes. Methane is emitted from peatlands and wetlands (Fig. 1) as well as from other vegetation types112, soils, surface waters, animals, and fungi (Wang et al.154 and references therein). Microbially-produced methane has been well documented (Wang et al.154 and references therein), while methane production from oxygen-rich environments (non-microbial production) has only recently been investigated and its implications discussed. Recent estimates of emission of methane from plants indicate that they may be very low, although these estimates have varied substantially (e.g., contributing from <0.2% to 40% of all methane released to the atmosphere).23, 70, 94, 163 The source of methane emitted from vegetation is still under investigation, with reports suggesting emission from an internal, plant structural cell wall component, pectin,95 or from surface waxes of leaves, production of which may be stimulated by UV radiation.26 Additional factors leading to the stimulation of methane emissions include production of reactive oxygen species induced by environmental stress and injury to plants.5, 27, 96 A s is the case for many of the non-methane VOCs, the magnitude of methane emissions is variable and dependent on location and ambient conditions including UV radiation. A long-term study over 6 years showed that enhanced UV-B radiation in a boreal peatland increased methane emission.112 A complementary study on emission of methane from trees growing in natural wetlands showed that emissions from trees exceeded those of the peatland on which they were growing. These studies found that wetland trees mediated emission of methane from the peatland.101 In contrast, a study of a wetland (fen) in Northern Finland over three growing seasons did not show UV-B induced changes in net emission of methane, although enhanced UV-B radiation contributed to a slight increase in the organic acid precursors for methanogenesis.98 In field experiments specifically studying the response of rice plants and paddy fields to enhanced UV-B radiation, UV- B supplementation using lamps significantly increased emission of methane from the paddy, especially between the tillering and heading stages of the rice. At the same time, decreased tiller number and biomass occurred as a response to the enhanced UV-B radiation levels.84 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 100 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 The important roles played by VOCs in ecosystem functioning - from inter- and intra -plant communications to plant chemical defence that decreases damage by herbivores - need to be analysed within a dynami c environment of interacting stresses from rapid and frequent climate events and changes in exposure to UV radiation. These factors should be considered when addressing the roles of different VOCs in mediating the diverse range of interactions occurring in ecosystems. In general, further investigations under natural environmental conditions are required to clarify the overall significance of UV radiation as a contributing factor to VOC emissions from plants and peatlands. The ozone 'hole' as a driver for Southern Hemisphere climate and ecosystem change The role of ozone depletion in Southern Hemisphere climate processes _ENREF_61 (see Chapter 1) has been largely overlooked in the biological literature and this section highlights some of the ways ozone depletion, independent of UV radiation, has affected ecosystems through climatic change. While these climate perturbations are likely to have had a significant impact over the past few decades they have only recently started to be considered at the ecological level. The ozone 'hole' moderates Southern Hemisphere climate Ozone depl etion and our response to it have had major implications for the Earth's climate. In the Southern Hemisphere, the ozone 'hole' has been a dominant driver114, 140, 145 of atmospheric circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1970's and has shielded Antarctica from much of the effect of global warming.39, 139, 145, 146, 161 The Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM), or Antarctic Oscillation, refers to the difference in atmospheric pressure between the mid- and high-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and thus the position of the polar jet. When the SAM index is positive the polar jet is located towards the South Pole, when it is negative it moves northwards. Since the late 1970s, the atmospheric polar jet has shifted south by 1-2 of latitude and increased in strength by 15-20%.72, 147 The observed trend i n the SAM has been largest during the austral summer and this is believed to be driven primarily by the development of the Antarctic ozone 'hole' (Thompson et al.140 and references therein). From records of ice cores it appears that intensification of the westerlies started over a century ago, driven by increases in greenhouse gases, but in recent decades the intensification associated with ozone depletion has been more pronounced.45 The SAM index is now at its highest level for at least 1000 years.1 Fig. 1 Wetland ecosystems, such as in south -eastern Louisiana, USA, are important sources of methane and have been the subject of a number of studies examining effects of UV radiation on methane emissions (Photograph: P. Barnes). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 101 Climate-related effects of ozone depletion on Southern Hemisphere ecosystems The changes to circumpolar westerly winds attributed to ozone depletion are likely to have far- reaching consequences for biological ecosystems, particularly due to the influence of wind on availability of water. The availability of liquid water to organisms broadly depends on the balance between annual precipitation and losses by evaporation, sublimation, and freezing. Increased wind causes evaporation, and in polar and alpine environments, sublimation and scouring of snow,40 In Antarctica, increased wind speeds have been linked to decreased growth rates of plants37 and changes in biodiversity in lakes62 in East Antarctica (Fig. 2). These changes are correlated with declining availability of water in East Antarctic coastal sites associated with increasing wind speeds and, in the case of moss growth rates, ozone depletion (Fig. 2). This research thus links ozone depletion to negative biodiversity outcomes through factors other than increasing UV-B radiation (reviewed in Robinson and Erickson.114). Winds also transport dust (including nutrients, seeds, spores, and other reproductive structures) from lower latitudes into the Southern Ocean and central West Antarctica (Fig. 2). Changes to either the location or strength of winds can affect the sources of dust and the quantities transported, with widespread implications including changes in productivity of the ocean. For example, increased wind-blown iron deposited into the ocean leads to phytoplankton blooms, indicative of increased productivity.33, 93 These biological impacts are not restricted to the Antarctic. Significant changes to tree growth across the Southern Hemisphere in the last 50 years, relative to the previous 250 years, correlate with ozone 'hole'-influenced changes to SAM151 (Fig. 2). This is illustrated by the ca 50% of the decline in growth rates of three species of trees ( Austrocedrus chilensis, Araucaria aracana and Nothofagus betuloides) America since the 1950s, associated with SAM-induced decreased precipitation in the Andes. Similarly, changes to circulation patterns have increased precipitation over sub-alpine areas of New Zealand resulting in greater than average rates of growth in another tree species (Halocarpus biformis ). In this case, a third of the growth increase was attributed to changes in the SAM.151 Fig. 2 The Southern Hemisphere showing impacts of the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on atmospheric circulation, wind patterns and precipitation, as well as oceanic currents and temperatures. Associated effects of these climate changes on terrestrial ecosystems are shown wher e available. Over the past century, increasing greenhouse gases and then ozone depletion over Antarctica have both pushed the SAM towards a more positive phase and the SAM index is now at its highest level for at least 1,000 years.1 During the summer months the positive phase of the SAM is strongly associated with ozone depletion. NZ, New Zealand. Figure produced by Andrew Netherwood has been modifi ed from Robinson et al.114 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 102 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Recent modelling studies suggest that stratospheric ozone losses since the 1970s have also increased the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in austral summer.24, 111 This has resulted in drying in the southern tip of South America and SW Australia, wetter summers in SE Australia, E New Zealand and SE South America and increased precipitation and freshening (increase in freshwater input) in the Southern Ocean69 (Fig. 2). Given the importance of water availability for all life on Earth, the vital role it plays in human and ecosystem health and for food security, these findings suggest that ozone depletion has far greater ecosystem impacts than previously anticipated. In particular, extremes of precipitation (droughts and floods) can be economically and socially devastating (cf. IPCC64). Changes to the Southern Hemisphere circulation processes can have wider modifying effects than simply on wind speeds and associated water availability. It has been suggested that the shift to warmer summers in Southern Africa strongly correlates with the large ozone 'hole' era (1993-2010).87 Manatsa et al.87 re-analysed satellite data, focusing on October-December, to separate the effect of greenhouse gases on the SAM index from those effects attributed to the ozone 'hole' (Fig. 2). While this analysis does not specifically link to biological impacts, it illustrates the potential effects of the ozone 'hole' in terms of human health, natural ecosystems, and agriculture. It also illustrates the need to investigate the role of the ozone 'hole' in ecological processes and systems other than those directly related to changes in UV radiation. Since ozone depletion is driving multiple stressors across the Southern hemisphere (e.g., increased UV-B radiation combined with either increased drought or increased precipitation), the interactive effects described above need to be considered. Recovery of the ozone 'hole' over the next century will have widespread and complex effects on the Southern Hemisphere climate processes with counter forcing from greenhouse gas emissions predicted to play a pivotal role.108 Contrary to expectations, some consequences of ozone depletion have been positive, such as maintaining Antarctica's cold temperatures, and their reversal may have negative effects for life on Earth. A more holistic picture of the true ecological consequences of ozone depletion on terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere is required in order to better project future changes and ways of mitigating risk.114 UV -B radiation and litter decomposition Decomposition of organic material is a crucial component of global biogeochemical cycles that affects soil fertility, the fate and residence times of carbon and nutrients in organic matter pools, and ultimately plant community composition and production (see Chapter 5). Although the activity and make-up of the decomposing microbial community (bacteria and fungi) are key determinants of decomposition, solar radiation, including the UV-B component plays a significant role. Recent studies, including several meta-analyses,71, 133 have increased our understanding of the ecological significance of UV-B radiation on decomposition, including the fundamental mechanisms by which UV-B (and UV-A) radiation modifies the decomposition process, and the potential linkages between changes in UV radiation and other climate change factors. These analyses indicate that UV-B radiation, at ambient or enhanced levels, has complex effects on decomposition of litter and can either retard or accelerate rates of decomposition depending on UV- B exposure, climatic factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation), and litter chemistry and structure. The conditions and ecosystems where UV-B radiation is expected to play a significant role in litter decomposition are described below. UV exposure of litter and wavelength sensitivity of decomposition processes Ultimately, the effectiveness of incident solar UV radiation on decomposition of litter is determined largely by exposure to UV and the sensitivity of the underlying decomposition processes to the Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 103 wavelength (Fig. 3). At present, little is known of the precise nature of the dose-response relationships for the various mechanisms of UV-driven decomposition and what action spectra best describe the sensitivity of these processes. This makes it difficult to quantitatively assess the importance of the effects of ozone depletion and associated changes in UV radiation on decomposition of litter, storage of carbon by ecosystems and the emissions of CO 2 and other trace gases from decomposing plant litter. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of factors such as cloud cover,12, 19 vegetation structure,19 litter depth,61 litter orientation,78 and soil coverage20 in altering the exposure of litter to UV radiation (Figs 3,4). Also, while several recent studies have shown that photodegradation can be driven by UV-A and visible radiation (photosynthetically active radiation; PAR, 400-700 nm) in addition to the UV-B component,9, 122 little progress has been made in developing action spectra for specific biotic (microbial) and abiotic (photodegradation) decomposition processes (Barnes et al.19 and references therein; but see Gao and Garcia-Pichel51). E ffects of UV radiation on decomposer microorganisms Solar UV-B radiation affects litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems via several mechanisms including direct effects on microbes and abiotic photochemistry (photodegradation), as well as through indirect effects mediated through alterations in leaf chemistry (Fig. 3; Barnes et al.19) These mechanisms can interact with one another and multiple pathways of decomposition can occur within a given process (see below). These processes are difficult to differentiate under field conditions. Hence, the quantitative importance of individual effects is largely unknown. In general, UV- B radiation tends to have negative effects on the growth, survival, and reproduction of microbes, which then retards rates of decomposition (Fig. 3; see also12, 19, 134). However, microbial species vary in their sensitivity to UV-B radiation, as evidenced b y studies demonstrating insensitivity of certain bacterial and fungal species to UV-B radiation in extreme environments.4, 127 Consequently, the overall effect of solar UV radiation (UV-B + UV-A) on the community composition of microbial decomposers is complex68, 106 and requires a multi-criteria approach. Fig. 3. Conceptual model of the direct and indirect e ffects of solar UV radiation (29 0-400 nm) on decomposition of terrestrial leaf litter, including potential interactions with other environmental factors. The total exposure to UV radiation of litter will depend on a combination of climatic, landscape/vegetation and species -specic factors. UV radiation generally reduces rates of biotic decomposition, whereas abiotic processes tend to enhance decomposition. Both processes exhibit distinct wavelength se nsitivities (as seen from action spectra) depending on the underlying chromophores and mechanisms involved. Indirect effects of UV radiation are primarily mediated by those on leaf chemistry and structure, leading, e.g., to decreasing attractiveness of the litter for decomposing microbes. The role played by UV radiation on decomposition can depend also on other environmental factors interacting with biotic and abiotic processes and leaf chemistry and structure. The net effect of solar UV radiation on rates of decomposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage will depend on the combined effects of biotic and abiotic processes and may be positive, negative or neutral. PAR, photosynthetically active radiation (400 -700 nm). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 104 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 UV radiation and photodegradation of litter The abiotic process of photodegradation occurs via photochemical mineralisation of photo-reactive compounds, such as lignin, and/or the transformation of compounds as a result of UV-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and other intermediates.9, 71 In addition, apparent photodegradation is enhanced in the presence of oxygen but can also occur under anoxic conditions,76 indicative of involvement of multiple chemical pathways.71 Generally, rates of photodegradation tend to increase with increasing moisture content of litter122, 131 and air temperatures.76 The effects of UV radiation on biotic (microbial) and abiotic (photodegradation) processes are not entirely independent and there is evidence that photodegradation can modify or partially degrade compounds in ways that enhance or retard subsequent microbial decomposition of litter (i.e. \"photopriming\"50, 85) Thus, even when direct photodegradation has a minor effect on loss of mass of litter , subsequent biological turnover can be positively correlated with the length of prior exposure to radiation.50 Photopriming may be of particular importance in the 'conditioning' of litter prior to its detachment from living vegetation (i.e. 'standing litter'; Fig. 4) and incorporation into the soil.9 However, photopriming can enhance carbon mineralisation from organic matter at the soil surface.89 In addition, susceptibility to photopriming will vary among plant species. Future photopriming experiments with multiple species in field situations are needed to assess whether this is a frequent or important facet of the photodegradation processes. Effects of UV radiation on decomposition mediated by plants Solar UV-B radiation can alter the chemistry and structure of living plant tissue, which then makes subsequent litter less suitable for the growth of decomposing microbes (Fig. 3;19, 134). These UV-induced changes in plant tissue chemistry generally involve stimulation of production of phenolic compounds that function in protection of plants against UV radiation,3, 124 although concentrations of other chemical constituents (e.g., C, N, P, K, lignin, Fig. 4. Temporal and spatial aspects of litter production and distribution in a semi -desert savanna in the Sonoran Desert, southern Arizona, USA. A. End-of-growing season standing litter of the C4 grass, Heteropogon contortus with the winter - deciduous shrub, Prosopis velutina before leaf drop. At this time of year there is significant potential for photodegradation of the standing litter of the grass. B. Spatial variation in bare ground, surface litter accumulation and light conditions under and near a P. velutina canopy after leaf drop and prior to the onset of the growing season. Once litter reaches the ground it can be redistributed across the landsc ape and mixed with soil such that microbial -driven decomposition increases while photodegradation decreases (Photograph: S. Archer). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 105 C:N) can change as well.134 UV-B-induced changes in leaf chemistry need further evaluation for their potential role in photodegradation. Interactive effects of UV radiation, climate and vegetation on decomposition Photodegradation results in the efflux of a number of gases, including CO 2,25, 76 CH 4,23, 95 carbon monoxide (CO),76, 122 and nitrous oxide (N 2O).50 Analyses suggest that photodegradation of surface litter can have measurable effects on landscape-level rates of flux of CO 2, and ultimately carbon storage.25, 120 The potential therefore exists for significant involvement of UV-driven photodegradation in influencing atmospheric CO 2 levels and carbon sequestration, at least in certain ecosystems. The magnitude of these effects, however, is at present uncertain. Under field conditions, the effects of UV-B radiation on microbial decomposition and photodegradation usually occur simultaneously, such that the net impact of UV-B radiation will reflect the balance of the biotic and abiotic mechanisms19, 131 (Fig. 3). Consequently, UV-B radiation can have a positive, negative or neutral effect on decomposition, depending on environmental conditions and quality of litter. Under dry conditions, exposure to UV-B radiation tends to increase decomposition via photodegradation. In contrast, where litter is exposed to UV-B radiation under moist conditions, rates of decomposition of litter generally decrease. This could reflect inhibition of microbial activity by the UV-B radiation. Results from a recent meta-analysis of 93 field and laboratory studies conducted across six biomes (natural environmental communities), revealed the complex role of UV-B radiation in decomposition of litter.133 These investigators reported that the direct effects of elevated and ambient UV-B radiation tended to increase rates of decomposition (7 to 23%). However, the indirect effects (i.e. plant-mediated effects) were variable in magnitude and direction (-7 to 12%) depending on exposure to UV radiation. None of these positive and negative changes were statistically significant, however. Overall, the effects of UV-B radiation on litter decomposition are influenced by exposure to UV-B radiation, climatic factors (temperature and precipitation), and litter chemistry. While these findings are generally consistent with our understanding of the role of UV-B radiation on decomposition rates, they do indicate that detecting a statistically significant effect of UV-B radiation on decomposition of litter may be often difficult within the limits of field experiments. In arid and semi-arid climates (referred to as dryland ecosystems), UV-B radiation has significant and measurable impacts on decomposition (Fig. 4). These ecosystems typically receive large solar UV radiation fluxes at ground level, high temperatures, and low and highly variable precipitation - conditions that tend to shift the balance of effects of UV-B radiation on decomposition in favour of abiotic photodegradation processes. Photodegradation is now being considered as an important process affecting carbon cycling and storage in these systems. However, most studies in drylands have not explicitly considered factors that routinely alter the exposure of litter to UV radiation (e.g., litter depth, soil-litter mixing and litter movement across the landscape). While such studies may reasonably determine decomposition of attached standing plant litter, their extrapolation to decomposition of detached plant litter on soil surfaces fails to account for these factors that can strongly mediate or even negate the abiotic effects. Thus, use of more realistic field conditions in experiments would serve to increase understanding and allow a more rigorous quantification of the role of solar UV-B and UV-A radiation on decomposition of litter and biogeochemistry. In general, these findings highlight the linkages between changes in UV-B radiation, climate, and land-cover and suggest that these may alter the magnitude and even the direction of the effect of UV-B radiation on decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 106 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 It is evident that the degree of photodegradation varies with plant species and chemical composition of the litter.76, 149 A meta-analysis of data from 50 field studies largely from dryland ecosystems71 showed that loss of mass due to photodegradation alone is, on average, 23%, but considerable variation occurs in rates among and within study sites. The variation in photodegradation was related to structural and chemical attributes of litter (area:mass and C:N ratios but not lignin content), precipitation, and exposure to solar radiation. This suggests that photodegradation may be an important but historically overlooked mechanism of decomposition in these systems and may account for the discrepancies between measured rates of decomposition and those predicted from ecosystem models based largely on climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and initial litter quality.2, 8, 71, 105 However, the role of the UV-B radiation component may be less effective than that of short wavelength visible radiation, as suggested by the meta-analysis of King et al.71 although more evidence is needed to confirm this. Elevated UV-B radiation and deposition of N also affect decomposition of plant litter, an important aspect of nutrient cycling (see Chapter 5). A field experiment in China showed that the combination of UV radiation and N deposition markedly increased the rate of litter decomposition under bamboo stands.132 Also, loss of carbon, phosphorus, and lignin degradation were promoted. Nitrogen deposition changes the availability of N in soil as well as the enzymatic activity of soil microbes such that increasing N can stimulate decomposition of litter. In contrast, enhanced UV- B radiation may decrease release of N from plant litter, probably through a direct effect on the microbial decomposers. Opposite outcomes of the effects of UV-B radiation and deposition of N have also been documented where the type of litter and ambient environmental conditions differ.132 U V radiation, soil organisms and belowground processes Previous assessments have reported that although UV radiation does not penetrate soil to any great extent, a variety of soil-dwelling organisms and processes below ground can be modified indirectly via the effects of UV radiation on plants and on plant litter. This occurs through UV-B-induced alterations in chemistry of the leaf, which in turn can affect the physiology and composition of species of decomposer microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in soil. There is considerable variation in these responses, depending on species, ecosystem type and developmental stages of the associated plants.12, 16, 31 While certain compounds in roots, such as flavonoids, can change in response to aboveground exposure of plants to UV-B radiation,77 a number of interactions in the soil immediately around root systems (rhizosphere) are mediated by flavonoids present in exudates of roots.34 These include signalling between and Rhizobium bacteria), mycorrhizal infection, and plant-plant allelochemistry (release of biochemicals by plants that may be harmful or beneficial, i.e. allelopathy ).59 Solar UV radiation has been implicated in playing a role in altering competitive interactions between invasive and native plant species by increasing the negative allelopathic effects of exotic species on native species.35 In field studies,129 exclusion of solar UV radiation significantly increased root growth, root nodulation, nitrogenase activity, and the leghaemoglobin and hemechrome contents in root nodules, suggesting a negative effect on fixation of nitrogen in certain species under ambient levels of solar radiation. The potential exists for significant modifications in soil invertebrate communities in Antarctic and Arctic ecosystems currently experiencing appreciable ozone depletion and climate change. Reduction in herbivory by insects under solar UV-B radiation would be expected to be driven largely by differences arising from plant biochemistry and composition of vegetation rather than by direct effects of elevated UV-B radiation on these organisms.100 Although additional studies are clearly needed, these findings suggest a role for UV-B radiation in several belowground Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 107 processes, which would have important consequences for mineral-nutrition of plants, storage of carbon in soil, biogeochemical cycles, and composition of plant species. Implications of UV-induced changes in plant defence systems Exposure of plants to solar UV-B radiation leads to an increase in several secondary metabolites that play a key role in the interactions of plants with other organisms, including herbivorous insects and microbial pathogens (Paul et al.106; reviewed in Ballar\u00e9 et al.11). Reduction in herbivory in insects exposed to solar UV-B radiation is well documented in field-grown plants12 with the majority (>80%) of such studies reporting increases in plant damage or insect growth when solar UV-B radiation is experimentally reduced.13, 74 Direct avoidance of UV radiation by many insects partly accounts for t he reduction in herbivory.91, 92 There are also some indications that, under ambient levels of UV- B radiation, infection of plants by pathogens is reduced.43, 56 Pretreatment of plants with UV-B radiation before inoculation with a pathogen can also increase resistance to infection.43 Some of the increased production of secondary metabolites by UV-B radiation that boost plant defenses against pests include leaf phenolics,43, 116, 162 conjugated polyamines,42 diterpenes44 and, in some cases, defense-related proteins such as proteinase inhibitors.42, 65, 136 On the other hand, phenolic compounds induced by UV-A radiation, may modulate the responses to UV-B radiation, via complex interactions between the UV-B photoreceptor, UVR866, 113 and UV-A/blue light signalling pathways.97 The functional relationships between UV-B radiation and resistance of plants to pests [involving salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways] are not yet well characterised (for review, see Ballar\u00e9 et al.11), although there is increasing evidence that some of the effects of UV- B radiation on resistance of plants to herbivory are mediated by increased JA signalling.42, 44 In addition, UV-B radiation can affect plant defense against herbivores and pathogens via mechanisms that are not mediated by JA. For example, UV-B radiation, acting through UVR8, increases resistance of certain plants to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea , and this effect is conserved in JA-insensitive genotypes.43 Protection and acclimation Apart from plant defense mechanisms that protect against pests and disease, other UV-acclimative processes involving accumulation of UV- absorbing compounds that result in changes in plant optical properties (primarily epidermal transmittance Ballar\u00e9, et al.12 and references therein). This acclimative r esponse varies according to a wide range of prevailing conditions including geographical and temporal, as well as with plant morphology (e.g., Ruhland et al.119) and increases understanding of the capacity of plants to respond to changing levels of UV radiation. Examples of dynamic acclimation include that of mature shade leaves of Populus tremuloides and Vicia faba where epidermal transmittance of UV radiation decreases when plants are transferred to sunny environments. Sun leaves, on the other hand, do not immediately respond by decreasing UV-absorbing pigments upon transfer to shade conditions.18 This ability to increase but not decrease transmittance of UV radiation r apidly may be associated with the location of the UV-absorbing compounds. Compounds bound to cell walls are less likely to be re-mobilised than those inside the cell.36, 115 Plants may also rapidly adjust their mechanism of UV-protection in response to daily changes in UV irradiances. Protection against UV radiation increases from dawn to midday and then decreases towards sunset.17 How plants achieve these rapid changes and what the significance is for function beyond protection from UV radiation is not yet known. Increased allocation of carbon to UV-absorbing compounds may divert carbon from growth and photosynthetic functions,138 such that reducing UV protection during times of the day when levels of UV radiation are small could enhance daily gain of carbon. In comparison to plants that maintain high UV protection throughout the day, Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 108 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 plants that exhibit diurnal changes in epidermal UV transmittance experience increased UV radiation exposure to the underlying mesophyll both early and late in the day but not at midday. It is possible that increased penetration of UV radiation at these times may protect leaves from photoinhibition that can occur at midday.155 Since UV-A radiation can also drive photosynthesis,144 the increased penetration of UV-A radiation may enhance photosynthesis at times of the day when leaves are light- limited. Added to this, several of the compounds induced by UV radiation (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol) inhibit the plant growth regulator, auxin, and its transport within the plant.48 Thus, maintaining high concentrations of flavonoids could interfere with plant growth during night-time periods. Although the processes of acclimation of plants to UV radiation are complex, it is now clear that the UV-absorbing acclimation involving UV-absorbers is much more flexible and dynamic than previously thought and has implications for evaluation of plant hardiness under different environmental conditions. Revisiting the potential for reconstructing past variations in stratospheric ozone and UV-B radiation The relationships between ozone and climate change are complex _ENREF_11 (see Chapter 1) and further investigation of the past nature of these relationships will lead to a better understanding of the physical interactions among solar activity, ozone and climate as well as more clarity on how ecosystems respond to changing UV-B radiation.86 The near ubiquitous response of plants to produce chemically stable UV-absorbing compounds, and thus achieve protection from UV-B radiation, means that plant tissues preserved in herbaria and in sedimentary and ice-core archives can be used to reconstruct past variations (prior to the instrumental period) in stratospheric ozone and UV- B radiation.81, 82, 118 In particular, UV-absorbing compounds bound to cell walls of plant tissues are extremely stable37 and may even persist in fossils.82, 118 In addition to tracking past UV-B radiation, plant material is increasingly being assessed for its usefulness as a biological proxy for historical availability of water ,117 temperature, and concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere (reviewed in Jordan67). Spores and pollen are common in the fossil record, and thus this type of proxy enables reconstruction of past UV-B radiation for providing spatial and temporal fidelity.81 UV-absorbing compounds (e.g., p-coumaric acid) in cell walls vary with latitude (and estimated exposure to UV-B radiation) in both spores of club mosses and in pine pollen. Greater variation is observed in samples collected from polar regions, where UV-B radiation has varied in recent decades due to ozone depletion, than in those collected from the tropics, where UV radiation levels have remained relatively stable.82, 159 Similarly, UV-absorbing compounds in these same tissues show good temporal correlations with independent instrumental records and model results, allowing reconstruction of ozone concentration and flux of UV-B radiation over decades82 to millennia.159 However, further validation of proxies using UV-absorbing compounds requires development of UV radiation dose-response curves, as well as confirmation of the long-term chemical stability of the UV- absorbing compounds within paleobiological samples.118 Methodological advances, especially in microspectroscopy,81, 82, 159 allow analysis of very small samples (e.g., 50 grains of pine pollen). Such micro-scale analysis would also permit UV- absorbing compounds to be tracked down the length of shoots of slow growing individual plants such as polar mosses.37, 117 Proxies that provide concurrent information on past climate and UV-B radiation, ov er centuries to millennia, would be especially valuable for greater understanding of past polar environments. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 109 Implications of exposure to UV radiation and climate interactions for food production and food quality Given the way in which solar UV radiation, stratospheric ozone, and climate variables have multiple and often interdependent effects on terrestrial and agricultural systems, it is logical that these effects will modify development, production and crop quality of agricultural crops.58, 123, 153, 156 However, there are currently few studies focusing on the interplay of climatic variables on crop quality.123, 156 In contrast, many studies have reported both negative and positive effects of UV radiation and other climate variables on crop production. The type of response in the crop is largely dependent upon species and cultivar, geographical location, genetic differences, and the co-occurring environmental conditions (cf.12, 79, 156). Where UV-B radiation has had a negative effect on crop production, this has been manifested mainly as small decreases in biomass, and reduced leaf area (Ballar\u00e9 et al.12 and references therein). As noted in previous sections, there are also indirect effects of UV-B radiation on plant growth, such as decreased herbivory due to increased secondary metabolites such as phenols, which is a positive plant effect. 90, 106, 162 Many investigations have documented changes in biochemical and regulatory pathways in plants under ambient and enhanced UV-B radiation, although few studies have explicitly related th ese to follow-on effects on quality of food crops.123, 156 The UV-stimulated biochemical changes also contribute to differences in taste and aroma in e.g., herbs, such as mints.46 Several field studies have shown that ambient UV-B radiation increases concentrations of chemical e.g., flavonols, esters and fatty acids, which can enhance the aroma and flavour of wine.32, 53, 137 Terpene emission from grapes also increases with enhanced UV-B radiation and may be another modifier of quality.52 In general, a number of stress factors, including UV radiation, tend to increase the concentrations of proteins and antioxidants and reduce those of starch and lipids.21, 153 While these biochemical changes often reflect acclimative response of plants to enhanced levels of UV radiation and other environmental stresses, they may have either positive or negative consequences for quality of crops in terms of nutrition and commercial use for specific products. The degree to which plants can modulate acclimative response to often rapid changes in UV radiation is also of interest for agricultural and horticulture practices. A lag in this response ha s implications for UV susceptibility of crops that are propagated in low UV radiation environments (e.g., greenhouses) and then subsequently transplanted to the field. This is illustrated by growth chamber studies with lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ), where new developing leaves require at least 6-8 days to fully acclimate to UV-B radiation and high levels of visible light (PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, 400-700 nm).155, 157 In terms of the beneficial effects of UV radiation on food crops, increased exposure to UV radiation through, for example, land-use changes and climate change, as well as manipulations of controlled growth conditions can be exploited to enhance food quality and nutritional value through the induced changes in secondary metabolism of plants. Visual sensitivity to and damage from UV radiation in terrestrial animals The range of wavelengths an animal perceives depends on the spectrum available in the environment, the degree to which this is transmitted through the ocular media and the visual pigments found in the retina. Visible light represents the spectrum perceived by humans but other animals often see a different range of \"colours\" due to visual pigments absorbing elsewhere in the spectrum. UV-vision is used extensively by a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates for critical life processes including mate selection and location of food resources in birds, fish, insects, spiders, and other taxa. Some Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 110 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 invertebrates are specifically able to detect and respond to UV-B radiation under natural conditions.91 The recent discovery that UV-vision (>300 nm) in mammals may be more widespread than previously recognised, suggests the need for more research into the ecological significance of this finding (Douglas and Jeffery47, and references therein). As with humans, animals can develop UV-related diseases, although research on these topics tends to be concentrated on economically important animals such as cattle. The occurrence of ocular squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) or \"cancer eye\" has been reported in cattle worldwide, with 10- 20% of animals in some Australian herds diagnosed with this disease. OSCC is the most common malignant tumour affecting cattle in North America and is responsible for significant economic losses (estimate of $20 million per annum in the United States alone; reviewed in Tsujita and Plummer142). In 2002, OSCC was the third-leading cause of carcass condemnation at slaughterhouses inspected by the US Department of Agriculture. European breeds of cattle, particularly those with light coloured skin such as Herefords and white-faced Holstein breeds, commonly develop OSCC, particularly when they are raised in regions with high natural levels of UV-B radiation (e.g., Australia, and the south- western USA); see also Ballar\u00e9 et al.12 While a proportion of the disease might be related to increasing U V radiation in areas affected by ozone depletion, the bulk appears to be caused by agricultural practices (e.g., lack of shade) and the movement of animals traditionally bred in low UV-B radiation environments to latitudes with higher UV-B radiation. Progress in technical and experimental issues Methodological issues in UV radiation supplementation studies, where filtered fluorescent UV lamps do not have a spectral output that perfectly matches the solar spectrum, were discussed previously.12 Briefly, Biological Spectral Weighting Functions (BSWF), dimensionless factors that represent the relative effectiveness of the different wavelengths of UV radiation in influencing a particular biological response, are used to calculate \"biologically effective\" UV radiation (see Chapter 1). This has been the only way to compare artificial UV radiation levels in experiments with solar UV radiation. A new filter termed the urate anion liquid filter has been developed that permits fluorescent UV lamps to much more closely approximate sunlight.121 This new filter removes more of the shortwave UV-B radiation ( 305nm) than more longwave UV-B ( 310 nm). While this filter was developed for laboratory use in algal studies, there is potential for it to be adapted to other systems. Accurate measurement of UV radiation is an essential aspect of experimental work on effects of UV radiation (see Chaper 1). Ideally these measurements are done with a spectroradiometer, where radiation is quantified at discrete wavelengths. Usually, double-grating spectroradiometers are used for these measurements, where two gratings are linked in tandem to refine the signal sent to the detector. This double-grating system reduces \"stray light\" in the instrument. For example, a small amount of stray visible radiation could swamp radiation of a UV-B wavelength being measured. An instrumentation innovation that is rapidly supplementing the mechanical double-grating spectroradiometer is the diode-array spectroradiometer. This instrument has no moving parts and can produce a spectral irradiance measurement almost instantaneously. In contrast, typical mechanical double-grating units require several minutes to complete a scan, during which irradiation conditions can change. Since diode-array spectroradiometers are much less costly than double-grating units, they may often replace broadband UV detectors in experimental studies. These spectral irradiance data will Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 111 be much more valuable than the broadband measurements. The unit's small size and portability is also an asset. However, they have limitations that users need to take into account. Stray light is a considerable issue as these are basically single-grating spectroradiometers. Some features of the instrument can help minimise this problem, but measurements in full sunlight may still not be accurate. These issues are discussed at length by Aphalo et al.6 and references therein. Sensi tivity of instruments to temperature is also an issue, especially when conducting measurements in the field. A 15% change in the sensitivity of a double-grating spectroradiometer over the range of 11.5 to 33.5 \u00b0C can occur.10 Temperature also affects diode-array units as wavelength accuracy, dark current offset, and spectral responsivity are all influenced by temperature.125 It is possible in some cases to develop correction algorithms for particular units (e.g., Baczynska et al.10), although one must consider whether differential heating of the unit in direct intense sunlight can be adequately simulated in a test chamber. Ideally spectroradiometers used in measuring sunlight should be temperature stabilised. Some ecological studies require measurements of time-integrated biologically effective UV radiation in environments where there is considerable spatial variability in UV irradiance (e.g., within plant canopies, soil surfaces under plant canopies and others). These applications require deployment of a number of inexpensive devices to measure the UV radiation. UV-absorbing polymers that were originally developed as human UV dosimeters (see Chapters 1 and 2) have been used to characterise the UV radiation environment of individual leaves in canopies,103 as well as to quantify fine-scale differences in exposure of plants to UV radiation in heterogeneous habitats.102 While these devices are no substitute for spectroradiometers, they can provide useful and inexpensive estimates of exposures to UV radiation for certain applications.126 Current polymers have wavelength sensitivities similar to common plant biological weighting functions29, 148 and have been developed with the inclusion of neutral density filters allowing estimates of exposure to UV radiation over periods of days to weeks.104 Provided these dosimeters are calibrated against spectroradiometers at the field l ocations where they are to be deployed, they may have particular utility for decomposition studies and those in areas under the ozone 'hole' where long-term continuous measurement of the incident UV radiation on standing and ground level plant litter is needed. Increased attention needs to be given to developing techniques and approaches that allow for the determination of realistic exposures to UV radiation of individual plants, natural ecosystems, and agricultural environments. The spectral sensitivities and exposures to UV radiation are needed in models that evaluate the combined effects of changes in UV radiation, climate, and vegetation on terrestrial ecosystems. The numerous technical issues involved in conducting experiments with UV radiation can, however, be intimidating to researchers starting work in this field. A comprehensive guide to all aspects of experimental design, implementation, analysis and instrumentation by Aphalo et al.6 will help standardize protocols and ensure reliable results that can be meaningfully assessed. Ga ps in knowledge Since the last assessment,12 evidence of the coupling of ozone depletion effects and those of climate change158 has been strengthened, and has revealed the complexity of the interactions that are occurring. The success of the Montreal Protocol has been two-fold, viz., the phasing out of ozone depleting substances (ODS) and the contribution to decreasing some of the load of greenhouse gases, since many of the phased out ODS are themselves greenhouse gases. It should also be recognised that exposure to changing levels of UV radiation is not only ozone-dependent, but also reflects changes in land-use and climate-related phenomena, such as projected changes in rainfall, increased cloud cover in some regions, and snow and ice melting. These events are likely to affect ecosystem functioning Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on terrestrial systems 112 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 and food production, all of which calls for a holistic approach to research that encompasses the role of UV radiation within a rapidly changing environment. From the research to date, evidence is accumulating that these interlinking factors of UV radiation, changes in ozone, climate, and environment are modifying responses of plants and ecosystems. Further evaluation of where the potential tipping points or beneficial effects are occurring will increase our understanding and ability to project potential future effects from the interactions between exposure to UV radiation and other simultaneously occurring environmental stresses. Currently, our knowledge of the consequences for the biosphere is far from comprehensive. What has become clear is that an integrative research approach under realistic conditions is essential for future projections of the response of ecosystems. For many of the processes discussed in this present paper, more empirical evidence is needed to determine the ecological significance of the role played by UV-B radiation in the presence of other environmental stresses. Apart from the focus on UV radiation over more than 25 years of the Montreal Protocol, ozone deplet ion has been implicated in changes to the climate of the Southern Hemisphere, highlighting the need to assess the impact of such changes on the ecosystems of this region.114 One of the key uncertainties here is the extent to which climate is affected by ozone depletion versu s greenhouse gas forcing and particularly the seasonality of these effects. Resolving this will improve understanding of how ozone recovery will feed back on these climate processes and is vital to our ability to model future ecosystems across half of the globe.

Higher air temperatures and incoming solar radiation are increasing the surface water tempe ratures of lakes and oceans, with many large lakes warming at twice the rate of regional air temperatures. Warmer oceans are changing habitats and species composition of many marine ecosystems. For some such as corals, the temperatures may become too high. Temperatur e differences between surface and deep waters are becoming greater. This increase in thermal stratification makes the surface layers shallower and leads to stronger barriers to upward mixing of nutrients necessary for photosynthesis. This also results in exposure to higher levels of UV radiation of surface-dwelling organisms. In Polar and alpine regions de creases in the duration and amount of snow and ice cover on lakes and oceans are also increasing exposure to UV radiation. In contrast, in lakes and coastal oceans the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial ecosy stems is increasing with greater runoff from higher precipitation and more frequent extreme storms. DOM thus creates a refuge from UV radiation that can enable UV-sensitive species to become established. At the same time, decreased UV radiation in such surface waters reduces the capacity of solar UV radiation to inactivate viruses and other pathogens and parasites, and increases the difficulty and price of purifying drinking waters for municipal supplies. Solar UV radiation breaks down the DOM, making it more available for microbial processing, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In addition to screening solar irradiance, DOM, when sunlit in surface water, can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increases in carbon dioxide are in turn acidifying the oceans and inhibiting the ability of many marine organisms to form UV- absorbing exoskeletons. Many aquatic organisms use adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of solar UV-B radiation (280-315 nm), including vertical migration, crust formation, synthesis of UV-absorbing substances, enzymatic and non-enzymatic quenching of ROS. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 122 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Whether or not genetic adaptation to changes in the abiotic factors plays a role in mitigating stress and damage has not been determined. This assessment addresses how our knowledge of the intera ctive effects of UV radiation and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced in the past four years. Introduction Interactions between climate change, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are altering exposure to UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems (see Chapters 1 and 5). Climate change is causing average global air temperature to rise and precipitation patterns to change, with important c onsequences for UV exposure in aquatic ecosystems. On a regional scale, changes in climate are highly variable in both space and time, leading to widespread floods in wetter regions, more severe droughts in drier regions, and increases in extreme storm events.70 Climate change is reducing annual snow and ice cover, increasing runoff and concentrations of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) in inland and coastal waters, and increasing the strength of thermal stratification in these systems. Rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration induces ocean acidification and alters seawater chemistry and consequently changes UV protection provided by calcified exoskeletons in many aquatic organisms as well as UV exposure levels in aquatic ecosystems. The ecosystem services provided by marine and inland waters include food and drinking water for a growing human population, moderating extreme temperature and weather conditions, and regulating important greenhouse gas concentrations such as that of atmospheric CO 2. Freshwater is an indispensible requirement for human existence as well as for all wildlife in terrestrial ecosystems and inland waters. Aquatic ecosystems generate both important regional food supplies as well as stimulate regional economies. Fisheries and aquaculture production have increased faster than the world's human population over the last 50 years but these increases may not be sustainable, constituting an important source of animal protein,33 and feeding approximately 1 billion people in Asia alone.159 In the next decade, fish production including that from inland and coastal fish farms is expected to exce ed that of other forms of proteins.33 Aquatic ecosystems provide other ecosystem services including recreation and tourism, with coral reefs alone are estimated to generate 9.6 billion US$ annually.114 All of these ecosystem services are being influenced by changes in climate and exposure to changing levels of UV radiation. Here we present an assessment of the advances in our knowledge over the past four years of how interactive effects of climate change and UV radiation are altering aquatic ecosystems, and the critical ecosystem services that they provide. Consequences of climate change on snow, ice, DOM, and exposure to UV radiation Melting snow and ice: Aquatic productivity under high solar radiation Over the last few decades, rising temperatures have reduced the sea and freshwater ice and snow cover with important consequences for underwater exposure to UV radiation. The global ocean temperature has increased by about 1\u00b0C over the last 112 years.38 However, the temperature was almost 2\u00b0C above the average from 1951 - 1980 in the Arctic108 and the wa rming of the water along the Antarctic Peninsula has been five times faster than the global Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 123 average over the past 50 years. One of the reasons for the large temperature increase and drop in ice volume at the poles is an effective feedback mechanism. Ice and snow reflect most solar radiation back into space. In contrast, water and soil absorb most of this radiation, which result s in a substantial warming and increased penetration of UV radiation into the ocean water. The higher water temperatures have reduced the Arctic ice cover by 49% during the summer compared to the average during the years between 1979 and 2000171. The total f loating ice volume dropped by about 75% during the same time period. Melting of the Arctic Ocean ice now typically starts in April, 50 days earlier than before the warming,74 and freezing starts in October, about 1 month later than in the past. In recent years Arctic ozone concentrations have decreased, but it is not clear if this trend will continue. It was the first time the O 3- depleted area was as large as that in the Antarctic.97 Higher water temperatures resulting in a thinner mixing layer and longer growing season together with increased O 3 depletion all have the pote ntial to increase exposure to UV radiation of aquatic organisms that live in the upper layers of the water column. Of major concern is how climate and UV radiation will alter phytoplankton biomass in the open oceans. Oceanic phytoplankton biomass is important in explaining variations in UV transparency and constitutes a large sink for atmospheric CO 2 by taking up a comparable amount of CO 2 as all terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite imaging of chlorophyll data shows that phytoplankton concentrations are much higher at polar latitudes than at mid or equatorial regions:115 e.g., chlorophyll a concentrations can exceed 20 mg m-3 in the Southern Ocean. Melting ice and snow affect phytoplankton, but local weather and mixing dynamics in the water c olumn contribute differently to the rate and direction of change and are influenced by local weather and mixing dynamics. Judging from 30 years of field studies and satellite chlorophyll fluorescence data, cumulated densities of phytoplankton have decreased by 12% along the West side of the Antarctic Peninsula (Bellingshausen Sea), which has been attributed to increased solar UV- B radiation (280-315 nm) and rapid regional climate change.103 In the North of the Antarctic Peninsula, however, a lower photosynthetic biomass production is attributed to denser cloud cover and the resulting decreased PAR (photosynthetic active radiation, 400 - 700 nm). In contrast, further south there is less mixing, fe wer clouds and consequently lower phytoplankton productivity.103 Increasing cloudiness has been found to limit phytoplankton productivity in the Arctic in open water.11 However, recent research suggests that thinning of the ice is increasing the overall primary productivity and algal biomass in the Arctic. Before recent Arctic warming, the ice cover was about 3 m thick and accumulated over several years, which prevented most light from penetrating into the water below and limited phytoplankton production. Currently the summer ice layer is only about 1 m thick. Pools from meltwater form on the surface, which function as \"skylights\". Reduced snowfall further enhances the light availability so that the penetrating solar radiation amounts to about 50% of that incident on the surface.40 This increased light availability fosters a large growth of ice algae and phytoplankton, which is further supported by nutrients upwelling from below. In 2012 a NASA research cruise (ICESCAPE) to the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska reported an unprecedented huge plankton bloom under the Arctic ice extending down to 50 m,4 \"as dramatic and unexpected as finding a rainforest in the middle of a desert\".162 This high chlorophyll concentration under Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 124 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 the sea ice was not known before and could not be detected by satellite-based remote sensing . Consequently the phytoplankton concentration was among the highest ever recorded extending down to 50 m. Similarly, it was found that these massive blooms occur all over the Arctic Ocean. In the open waters of the Arctic Ocean satellite data have shown a 20% increase in the chlorophyll content between 1998 and 2009.5 Very limited information is available on the effects of changing PAR and exposure to UV radiation on the structure of the food web and total system productivity. In contrast to the discovery of high phytoplankton concentrations under the ice, predictions for the future posit a gradual loss of marine ice algae through loss of sea ice, causing a cascade through the higher trophic levels of the food web. Additionally, meltwater from sea ice and glaciers reduces the salinity that negatively affects primary producers and the upper levels of the food web..28 The melting sea ice contains about four times more nitrogen than the bulk wat er,173 while increasing PAR results in an increase in the carbon to phosphorous ratio in plankton. Therefore reduced sea ice and increased PAR likely mean that phytoplankton food quality is reduced for herbivorous grazers. Changing ice phenology and light and nutrient availability may also affect species composition. Faster melting of sea ice shifts plankton species toward smaller cell types26 with a better capacity to absorb solar radiation and take up nutrien ts, which affects the subsequent food web including fish and mammals. During a 2010 cruise northwest of Svalbard even tropical Radiolaria were found in Arctic waters.15, 66 Out of the 145 taxa identified during the cruise, 98 had come from areas much farther south and tropical species were reproducing in their new habitat. Due to the decreased ice cover phytoplankton productivity has extended further north attracting more fish. For example, in the past, capelin - an important prey for Atlantic cod, had a maximal distribution up to 75\u00b0N, but capelin were found up to 78\u00b0N in 2012 with cod following them.123 Increasing dissolved organic matter and exposure to UV radiation The incre ased exposure to PAR and UV radiation, caused by the smaller and thinner ice and O3 depletion is partially offset in coastal and inland ecosystems by higher runoff from terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), which decreases water transparency. Increases in global temperature and precipitation (in some areas) are accelerating the release of DOM into lakes, rivers, and coastal oceans.81, 165 Strong inshore-offshore gradients in DOM are common to distances of 20 km or more from the shore in large lakes,16 and tens to hundreds of km in the Arctic Ocean (Fig. 1). Remote sensing of this DOM34 provides mechanistic insights into how DOM is changing UV irradiance in coastal and inland waters. The reasons for the increases in DOM in the Arctic appear to be related primar ily to a loss of permafrost. In 2012 a majority of North American and Russian regions reported a 6- 10% increase in the depth of soil that thaws annually relative to the average from previous decades.126 The amount of organic carbon stored in permafrost soils is more than twice that in the atmosphere. Thus, when permafrost thaws, large quantities of DOM stored in the soils can be transported to aquatic ecosystems and outgassed as CO 2 and/or CH 4 after being acted upon by UV radiation and microbes. This DOM is highly photoreactive so that exposure to Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 125 solar UV radiation and visible light accelerate its breakdown and release to the atmosphere as CO 2.25 When permafrost thaws, as much as one third of the organic residues can be converted to CO 2 within two weeks.163 The increases in greenhouse gases in turn increase warming and further thawing of permafrost with important consequences for the global radiative balance. DOM concentrations have more than doubled in many temperate inland waters in recent decades, and climate change has been suggested to play an important role in these increases,27 and is e xpected to lead to a 65% increase in DOM in boreal waters in the future.81 Increases in precipitation reduce the time that water spends in lakes, which reduces the degradation that occurs when DOM is exposed to UV radiation.79 The frequency of extreme precipitation events such as hurricanes and summer storms has increased in recent years and dramatically increases the export of UV- absorbing terrestrial DOM to aquatic ecosystems. Up to 63% of the annual DOM may come from the top 10% of precipitation events.78 A single hurricane can contribute up to 19% of the annual DOM input to receiving waters31 and increases in DOM associated with a single storm can decrease UV transparency of lake water by a factor of three.131 Lakes can act as buffers of the seasonal variability in DOM input to streams a nd rivers, thus moderating DOM increases in downstream regions during high flow periods, and increasing DOM concentrations during base flow conditions.54 This buffering of extremes does not seem to influence total annual outflow of DOM from the watershed.94 At the sa me time DOM inputs contribute to the role of coastal and inland waters in the global carbon cycle. Inland waters are net sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, venting carbon fixed by terrestrial land plants that have subsequently died and decomposed.155 Metabolism and UV-dependent photolysis of terrestrial DOM may have important consequences on greenhouse gas emissions from lakes and for global climate. Inland waters emit large amounts of CH 4, a greenhouse gas that is more than 20 times as potent as CO 2. The quantity of methane emitted from the world's inland waters is estimated to be equivalent to 25% of the Fig. 1 Image of Earth over the North Pole showing the extent of influence of terrestrial DOM inputs from rivers using an optical metric based on UV absorption - called the spectral slope (the slope of t he linear relationship between the natural log of the absorption coefficient and wavelength in the 275 -295 nm spectral range, nm-1). Although the satellite cannot detect these shorter wavelengths, algorithms have been developed that lead to an accurate rel ationship between spectral slope in this range and thus DOM source. Browner colours around the periphery of the Arctic Sea show greater inputs of terrestrial DOM, which is particularly pronounced above Eurasia (from34). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 126 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 global terrestrial carbon sink8 making inland waters important players in the climate-UV interactions, despite comprising only a fraction (1%) of the total water on Earth. In addit ion to the concentration of DOM, the radiation it absorbs influences exposure to UV radiation of inland and coastal waters. Changes in iron (Fe) concentrations, pH, and land-use patterns modify DOM optical characteristics, degradation, and absorption of UV ra diation. While the precise reasons for Fe increase are still not completely understood, there is evidence that waters with high concentrations of soluble Fe are feeding into the surface waters80 and contributing to higher UV absorbance of DOM. Photodegradation of DOM is higher at low pH and high Fe concentrations.119 Peatlands have higher DOM export than do agricultural watersheds and some agricultural landscapes may export more DOM than forested ecosystems.23 The susceptibility of DOM to degradation by UV radiation and visible light (photoreactivity) and microbial decomposition (bioreactivity) varies with the source of the DOM. The DOM from agricultural watersheds is less photoreactive than is DOM from forested lands, but these two types of DOM may be similar in their bioreactivity.95 When exposed to artificial UV lamps in the lab, DOM in water collected from the Chesapeake Bay during base-flow conditions is more photoreactive than that collected during snowmelt in trib utaries, but land-use (urban vs agriculture vs forested) made little difference. 96 These data collectively suggest that land-use patterns may alter not only the amount of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but also its quality, UV-absorptivity, and subsequent breakdown rates by UV radiation and microbial decomposition to CO 2 and CH 4. Apart from reducing the underwater UV radiation and visible light zone, increases in terrestrial DOM alter aquatic food webs via changes in ratios between different basal carbon and nutrient sources. In situ mesocosm studies have demonstrated that increases in nutrient- poor DOM inputs to Arctic lakes will decrease primary productivity and increase heterotrophy (uptake of organic material, in contrast to autotrophy, light driven photosynthesis ) within the lake.39 In contrast, addition of DOM with a higher nutrient content to a nutrient-poor alpine lake can stimulate autotrophy more than heterotrophy.77 Increasing DOM also traps heat closer to the surface of aquatic ecosystems, increasing surface temperatures, decreasing the depth of the surface mixed layer and decreasing temperatures in deeper waters. These patterns collectively lead to stronger thermal stratification.122 Vertical mixing in the water column largely reduces the UV-induced inhibition of photosynthesis dependent on the relative changes in mixing depth versus UV transparency. Further evidence shows that exposure of DOM to solar radiation can lead to the formation of ROS.73, 135 Increases in DOM may alter aquatic community structure by altering the temperature of inland and coastal waters, decrease exposure to UV radiation, and ameliorate effects of toxic metals and organic pollutants on fish and other aquatic organisms.143 Collectively these data indicate that climate change-induced inputs of DOM cause severe change in UV transparency and functioning of inland and coastal waters. While DOM provides a refuge from damaging UV radiation for many ecologically and economically important aquatic organisms, it also has the potential to increase the survival of pathogens.113 Higher concentrations of DOM reduce the effectiveness of natural UV radiation on disinfection of drinking water supplies as well as increase its cost and potential for production Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 127 of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts.57 Understanding the role of interactive effects of DOM, ROS concentrations, UV radiation and climate change in aquatic ecosystems will thus be important for sustaining structure and function of the aquatic ecosystem, for example, through fisheries production and potential to use the water as a drinking water resource. Thermal stratification and exposure to UV radiation Many aquatic organisms, such as zoo- and phytoplankton, are restricted to the upper mixed layer (UML), the lower boundary of which is the thermocline. Temperate latitudes are characterised by seasonal changes in temperature and irradiance, which are reflected in seasonal cy cles of abundance and species composition.12, 167 Tropical waters typically exhibit stable thermal stratification.47 In contrast to polar waters, where the UML can exceed 100 m, in tropical waters it is usually limited to the upper 10 - 35 m. Across latitudes, nutrient concentrations are higher in deeper layers, but the tra nsport into the mixing zone is limited. As a consequence, these two clearly separated layers shelter distinctly different organisms. At higher latitudes, the input of freshwater from melting ice increases stratification because freshwater is less dense than saltwater.144 Global climate change results in ocean warming, which makes stratification more pronounced and decreases the depth of the UML, causing organisms through all trophic levels to be exposed to increased visible and UV radiation.47, 158 In addition, it further limits the transport of nutrients from deeper waters because the lower boundary is more stable.150 Changes in wind speeds are also altering the depth of the UML in many water bodies. Higher temperatures mitigate the inhibitory effects of UV-B radiation by enhancing enzyme- mediated photo-repair as well as photosynthetic carbon fixation and quantum yield.61, 64 The molecular mechanism of this enhancement is based on a significantly higher gene expression and activity at 25\u00b0C compared to 20\u00b0C as well as augmented enzyme-driven repair. _ENREF_124 The mitigating effects of elevated temperatures can reduce the UV stress as has been shown in the South China Sea where the photosynthetic carbon fixation was less inhibited by UV- B radiation in the summer than in the winter.85, 167 The respiration index (log of oxygen to carbon dioxide pressure), which may increase with ocean acidification and changes in multiple climate change stressors, could affect photosynthetic production.46 In contrast, higher temperatures can impair the cell cycle resulting in lower growth rates.152 Vertical mixing in the water column largely reduces the UV-induced inhibition of photosynthesis in dependence of the mixing frequency and depth, since phytoplankton are constantl y moved from the surface to the thermocline and back . Being at the bottom of the UML allows organisms to repair damage that they encounter at the surface, e.g., phytoplankton communities in a coral reef ecosystem where an increased mixing rate and depth results in less UV-B-induced reduction of photosynthetic _ENREF_24 carbon incorporation.84 UV-A ra diation (315-400 nm) can have positive effects on the growth of larger phytoplankton cells under mixing conditions, since this radiation is used by the enzyme photolyase to split UV-B-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers harvesting of photosynthetic energy.85, 87 When stratification becomes more pronounced and the mixing layer shallower, hypoxic (low oxygen) areas in inland and coastal waters expand.75_ENREF_121 Harmful Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 128 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 algal blooms (dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria) can increase in intensity and frequency in both freshwater and marine habitats due to increasing nutrient availability from terrestrial runoff, rising temperatures and increased stratification.62 These organisms are not very sensitive to solar UV-B radiation. In summa ry, the increased water temperature due to global climate change reduces the depth of the UML and the organisms dwelling in this layer are exposed to higher UV radiation (Fig. 2). Damage from UV-B radiation encountered at the surface is mitigated by repair pr ocesses, which are activated when the organisms are passively transported to the lower boundar y of the UML. Higher temperatures favour enzyme-mediated repair of damage by UV radiation. Ocean a cidification and exposure to UV radiation The pH of seawater is in the range of 7.5 to 8.4 and is relatively stable due to buffering capacity. However, increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have lowered this value by about 0.1 units, which corresponds to an increase in the H+ concentration by 30%.125 Assuming increasing CO 2 emissions (IPCC A1F1 scenario), an atmospheric concentr ation of 800 - 1,000 ppmv is predicted by 2100, which will correspond to a pH reduction by 0.3 - 0.4 in the ocean, an increase in H+ ions in surfa ce waters by 100 - 150% 47. Oce an acidification in conjunction with UV-B radiation affects enzymatic and other biochemical processes in several aquatic organisms, such as phytoplankton, macroalgae and many animals, such as mollusks and corals.9, 65, 151 Phytoplankton may serve as a partial remedy to the problem, since they sequester CO 2 through photosynthetic carbon fixation.26 While many higher plants benefit from increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration, this does not support higher growth rates in phytoplankton.47, 48 The red tide microalga, Phaeocystis, showed a much lower growth rate under e levated UV-B which was more pronounced under elevated CO 2, indicating that increasing ocean acidification and UV-B act synergistically to reduce photochemical performance _ENREF_47 .24 Zooplankton seem to be little affected by water acidification, although acclimation leads to higher respiration and increased grazing rates.88 Their shells are mainly composed of Fig. 2 Combined effects of anthropogenic changes in the environmental condition in marine ecosystems, including UV, CO 2, and temperature . Increasing atmospheric and water CO 2 concent rations reduce the calcifying abilities of many organisms. Increasing water temperatures and incoming solar radiation decrease the depth of the mixing layer (exposing organisms to higher irradiances) and increase the temperature difference between surface and deeper layers. This temperature difference limits the exchange of materials such as nutrients between layers (modified from47). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 129 chitin, which is not affected by acidification. In contrast, those organisms with outer skeletons of calcium carbonate are affected . Increasing acidity affects calcification in phytoplankton,_ENREF_238 calcifie d macroalgae49_ENREF_158 and animals with exo- or endoskeletons such as corals, depriving these organisms of some defense against solar UV- B radiation.2_ENREF_190 UV-B ra diation strongly impairs the while UV- A radiation inhibits calcification.55 The calcified outer scales form a protective exoskeleton168 Cells grown at high calcium concentrations are more resistant to UV radiation than under limited calcium concentrations.168_ENREF_229 In Polar regions, dissolution of CO 2 from the air into seawater differs from that in low latitude areas. Low sea surface temperature means that more CO 2 is dissolved than in low latitude waters. Changes in carbonate chemistry of seawater in the high-latitude oceans are already becoming negatively affecting some species. Consequently, it is projected that within decades, large parts of the Polar oceans will become corrosive to the shells of calcareous marine organisms.22 The shells of pteropods, small marine snails (sea butterflies), that are key species in the food web, are already dissolving in parts of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.10 Ocean acidification has effects not only on biological processes but also on the uptake and availability of iron134 and ammonium.12 D egrees of sensitivity of aquatic organisms Mechanisms of UV radiation damage In the upper photic zone, aquatic organisms are exposed to solar UV radiation. Although the UV-B irradiance amounts to only a few percent of the total solar radiation, this wavelength ba nd ca n be hazardous since it affects biomolecules and cellular structures (Fig. 3 ) and may block enzymatic reactions and interfere with physiological responses such as motility and orientation.125 UV-B radiation can either directly alter biomolecules or induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the cell such as singlet oxygen (1O2).139, 172 Formation of ROS is augmented by increasing temperatures.104 Photosynthesis is specifically prone to damage by solar UV-B radiation. In addition to other targets, radiation damages the D1 protein in the electron transport chain of photosystem II (PS II), which is subsequently removed and during repair replaced with a newly synthesize d protein.59 Higher water temperatures enhance the repair process, while limited nutrient supply impairs the repair mechanisms.89 An unexpected finding was that UV- B radiation damages phytoplankton more by impairing repair mechanisms than by direct ly damaging the protein.166 In addition, solar UV-B radiation affects the accessory pigments that funne l solar energy to the reaction centres. The blue pigments, phycobilins, in cyanobacteria and red al gae are especially sensitive to damage.138 Another main target of solar UV-B radiation is the DNA in both prokaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (organisms with a cell nucleus) organisms. In addition to single- and double strand breaks and the formation of 6-4 photoproducts (and their Dewar valence isomers), the most frequent lesion induced by UV-B radiation is the induction of CPDs.124 Repair mechanisms for DNA damage include several mechanisms (such as excision repair, mismatch repair and SOS response), but above all the photoactivated CPD photolyase is engaged to break the dimers using the energy of UV-A radiation or blue light photon s.124 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 130 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Mechanisms to avoid or moderate UV-B radiation-induced damage include vertical m igration to move out of zones of excessive radiation found in zooplankton and phytoplankton or by mat formation.7 With the exception of very small cells (picoplankton), many aquatic organisms produce UV-absorbing compounds to prevent solar UV-B radiation from damaging the central regions of the cell such as the nucleus. Cyanobacteria synthesize scytonemin to diminish the impact of UV radiation.121 In addition, phytoplankton and macroalgae produce several mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs).93 UV-B radiation- induced reactive oxygen species removed by enzymatic reactions and non-enzymatic quenchers including carotenoids.136, 172 Animals such as zooplankton are not capable of synthesizing MAAs, but may take up these substances with their food and use them for protection fr om solar UV radiation. Several factors make accurate assessment and measurement of the effects of UV radiation on organisms in natural ecosystems very challenging. These factors include the wide variation among organisms in the mechanisms of defense against damage by UV radiation, the need to allow organisms adequate time to adapt to sudden highly elevated UV radiation levels, and assuring accurate measurements of UV radiation. Laboratory experiments with artificial sources of UV radiation often use excessive short wavelength UV- Fig. 3 Effects of solar UV radiation on biomolecules, cellular components and physiological responses as well as mitigating strategies and repair mechanisms (for details see text) . Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 131 B irradiance levels that are more damaging and have little ecological significance to natural solar radiation due to inappropriate balance in the spectral composition (see Chapter 3 ). UV radiation exposure levels in aquatic ecosystems exhibit strong gradients over time (daily to annual), depth, and distance from the shore. Different natural populations may vary in their sensitivity to UV radiation over time and may acclimate to the radiation, resulting in some adaptation. Parasite s and pathogens UV radiation plays an important role in the ecology of many infectious diseases of aquatic organisms, particularly when there is a pronounced difference in the UV radiation tolerance of the host and pathogen or parasite. For example, Metchnikowia is a fungal parasite that i s lethal to the important freshwater zooplankton grazer, Daphnia. Relative to its host, the pa rasite is extremely sensitive to UV radiation and longer wavelength sunlight. Thus in more UV radiation transparent water bodies, outbreaks of this parasite are suppressed and delayed until later in the autumn after incident solar UV radiation has subsided.113 Natural solar radiation is also highly effective at reducing viral infections in some aquatic organisms including fish and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Some experiments that have manipulated natural sunlight reveal a million-fold decrease in the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (HNV) in Atlantic salmon in treatments exposed to sunlight versus dark controls for just 3 hours.50 Viruses may be responsible for more than half of the mortality of aquatic cyanobacteria, which has led to interest in using cyanophages to control HABs of toxic cyanobacteria.71 The extreme sensitivity of many viruses to UV radiation damage suggests that knowing more about the changing underwater UV radiation environment may lead to new insights into the potential role of viruses in controlling HAB of cyanobacteria.71 Tr ematodes are some of the most common parasites in intertidal systems. Their larvae are free-living for short periods of time between hosts that range from snails to other invertebrates and birds. During this short, free-living period in very shallow aquatic environments the larvae may be exposed to high levels of solar UV radiation. Recent UV radiation exposure experiments in the laboratory showed that UV radiation caused DNA damage and oxidative stress in the larvae and no evidence of photoprotective MAAs or photoenzymatic repair.145 Similar experiments also demonstrated negative effects of UV-B as well as UV-A radiation exposure on the survival of larvae. In addition, susceptibility to infection of the amphipod secondary host increased when the host was exposed to UV radiation.146 Further experiments on this trematode parasite system revealed significant interaction effects between UV radiation and temperature, with greater UV radiation effects at 20\u00b0C vs 30\u00b0C.147 Parasites may also play some role in altering the exposure to UV radiation of infected fish hosts. Three-spined sticklebacks undertake daily vertical migration and are generally deeper in the water column during the day than during the night. However, individuals captured in the surface waters during the day have a higher parasite load than those captured at night, which increases the potential for this parasite to be transmitted to its definitive host - fish eating birds.120 Increasing evidence is accumulating for the direct and indirect effects of exposure to UV radiation on several marine fish species. Melanosis and melanoma skin Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 132 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 cancer rates of up to 15% have been reported in coral trout in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (Fig. 4).149 The role of UV radiation in the induction of this high prevalence is unknown. In shallow, UV-transparent aquatic ecosystems, such as coral reef flats, photobl eac hing may lead to destruction of corals and may result in further negative effects when UV radiation and interactions with multiple stressors occurs.63 B acter ia and viruses Heterotrophic bacteria and viruses are more affected by UV radiation than phytoplankton since they do not synthesize UV-absorbing pigments (but they can repair UV induced damage). Their small dimensions would require extremely large concentrations of these substances to effectively protect them from excessive short- wavelength radiation.170 These organisms respond to UV radiation with adaptive processes such as increased frequency of division, but exposure to UV radiation results in significant changes in species composition due to a varying UV sensitivity of different bacteria taxa.98 Acclimation to long-term UV exposure has also been found in natural sub-Antarctic phytoplankton communities. Inland and coastal waters are rich in bacterioplankton, which feed on the high concentr ations of humic substances.127 Bacteria are under pressure from UV-B and UV-A radiation component of sunlight, but recover when the solar radiation decreases during the daily cycle. The highest bacterioplankton activity has been found between 5 and 10 m, below the depths of high solar UV-B radiation exposure. Inhibitory effects of UV radiation on bacterial growth are mitigated by water mixing.13 Different strains have different sensitivity to higher temperatures and UV radiation, leading to selection of more resistant strains and species. Whether or not also genetic adaptation may mitigate the effects of altered stress parameters needs to be examined.53 Phytoplankton The amount of solar UV and visible radiation determines the species composition of phytoplankton blooms. Large-celled diatoms are less affected by solar UV- B radiation and can utilise high light irradiances.76 In contrast, small-celled phytoplankton such as the Fig. 4 Cancer lesions on Coral Trout from the Great Barrier Reef observed in up to 15% the natural population and thought to be due to exposure to solar UV radiation. Shown are individuals with only partial (a) and almost full body (b) lesions as well as close -up photographs taken under a microscope of healthy ski n (c) and skin lesions (d). Scale bars are 20 \u00b5m (from 149). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 133 ecologically important cyanobacteria and small eukaryotes experience more UV-B-induced damage than larger cells.90 In oligotrophic waters (waters with low nutrient contents) solar radiation induces a higher kill rate in marine picoplankton than in larger cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton.91 The main driver for mortality is UV-B radiation since filtering out this short wavelength radiation significantly enhances survival. Surface samples are more resistant to solar UV-B radiation than samples collected at depth. Exposing phytoplankton samples experimentally at a fixed depth inhibits photosynthesis more than under natural conditions, where the organisms are moved within the mixing layer.72 The mitigation of the UV-induced inhibition of photosynthetic carbon fixation depends on the mixing rate and depths as shown in tropical coral reef phytoplankton assemblages.84 Phytoplankton of the same taxonomic groups can have significant different sensitivities toward solar UV-B radiation depending on their geographical origin such as tropical, temperate and Antarctic habitats. In contrast to UV-B radiation, even the highest applied doses of UV-A r adiation did not cause growth inhibition. After periods of excessive UV radiation some phytoplankton species, such as the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, show a higher growth rate which partially compensates for prior UV-induced growth reductions. Photosynthesis in phytoplankton is damaged by UV- B radiation mainly at the D1 protein but with higher temperatures increasing the repair rate.89 P rimary production in freshwater systems is, in contrast to that in marine systems, often limited by phosphorus. Because of this, effects of UV radiation on phosphorus metabolism can be important in freshwater aquatic ecosystems. For example, in a high mountain mesocosm experiment, heterotrophic microorganism biomass (bacteria and flagellates) increased when phosphorus addition was reduced by 80% if UV radiation was excluded.101 Sereda et al. investigated how ambient UV radiation affects the phosphorus metabolism of plankton communities from 18 lakes in Ontario and Saskatchewan.133 The turn-over time for phosphorus and the steady state phosphate concentration increased when the organisms were exposed to UV radiation. The concentration of phytoplankton strongly depends on the pressure by grazers. For example, the seasonal abundance and feeding patterns of copepods in a pelagic food web in the White Sea showed that up to 85% of the daily phytoplankton biomass was consumed by calanoid copepods.100 Exposure to UV radiation affects the quality of phytoplankton in terms of food for zooplanktonic grazers.105 Therefore the level of UV-B radiation is an important modulator of the phytoplankton standing crop. Mitigation of UV-induced damage by UV-absorbing substances Phytoplankton use a number of effective repair mechanisms as well as UV-absorbing substances (mostly MAAs) to mitigate UV-B-induced damage of DNA and the photosynthetic apparatus. Samples from phytoplankton blooms under the ozone 'hole' counterintuitively show significantly less inhibition of the photosynthetic quantum yield by UV-B radiation than those from outside the ozone-depleted areas, indicating the protective role of their higher MAA concentration.21, 112 Another reason for these findings may be that large-size cells occur inside the blooms while outside the blooms smaller cells prevail, which, Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 134 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 due to their small size, cannot take advantage of the MAA protection. Ryan et al. experimentally measured the effects of UV-B radiation on sea-ice algae in Antarctica130 and concluded that brine channel communities were better protected from UV- B radiation.. They speculate that the high tolerance to UV-B radiation in the brine communities could be due to production of MAAs. Concentrations of UV-absorbing compounds such as MAAs increase with higher exposure to solar radiation in phytoplankton and macroalgae and decrease under experimental conditions without UV.137 In parallel, inhibition by UV radiation of growth and photosynthesis is mitigated with increased contents of MAAs _ENREF_34 . Higher levels of nitrate result in higher contents of MAAs, while phosphate limitation did not affect the MAA content.169 In addition to their UV-absorbing properties, MAAs antioxidants scavenging ROS.92 MAAs are produced in algal cells and protect against UV-B radiation. The production depends on species, degree of impairment, and locality.56 Lar ge differences have been found in MAA production that correlated with differences in species composition and sensitivity to UV-B radiation. Phytoplankton in inland and coastal waters are generally less tolerant to UV ra diation than open ocean assemblages. This is probably because they need less protection and therefore have developed lower MAA concentrations as a consequence of the lower transparency of the water.6 UV-B ra diation can impair growth and development, morphology, photosynthesis and nutrient uptake in coastal phytoplankton species.37 In the tropics UV-absorbing MAAs within phytoplankton cells show the same concentration year round, while in temperate waters MAA concentrations are lower in winter than in summer in surface waters <50 m.93 MAA expression is linearly related with the UV irradiance at the surface. In the tropics, phytoplankton is under considerable UV-B radiation stress on sunny days. On cloudy days microplankton (>20 \u00b5m) use UV- A radiation as an energy source for photosynthesis, while pico- and nanoplankton are impaired.86 Cloud patterns and density affect the level of UV radiation, but this has rarely been studied in detail. Along a 13,000 km meridional transect (from 52\u00b0N to 45\u00b0S) the highest MAA concentrations were found in the south (>40\u00b0 S) and in the north subtropical region.93 Interacting stress factors Satellite monitoring of the oceans, shows that phytoplankton concentrations have been declining at about 1% per year over the past 50 years.19 Laufkoetter et al.82 calculated a different number for the decrease (6.5% during the period 1960-2006), simulating phytopla nkton net primary production on a global scale with large spatial resolution. However, there are large areas of uncertainty: even though the external factors of temperature, pH, CO 2 supply, nutrients, PAR and UV irradiances and mixing depths are known to be primary variables driving photosynthesis and production, their interactions have not been thoroughly investigated.47 This interacting web can only be disentangled by multifactorial analysis and modelling.20, 58 In order to reveal the effects in nature with its fast changing temperature, solar radiation and nutrient availability, large scale, long-term studies are need ed in the relevant ecosystems.47 This is difficult and time-consuming because of the vast areas to be covered, the diversity of organisms and ecosystems and the low Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 135 concentrations of cells especially in open ocean waters. The effects of the many possible feedback mechanisms on marine primary producers are largely unknown. For example, do higher temperatures of the oceans result in denser cloud cover? This could result in lower exposure of the phytoplankton to solar UV radiation and PAR, favouring taxa that are more sensitive to UV radiation.67 Feedbacks have the potential to change the species composition of future assemblages of primary producers with large consequences for inland and marine food webs. Feedbacks between UV radiation and inland and coastal ecosystem organisms also have the potential to moderate climate. For example, phytoplankton and macroalgae produce dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP),129 that acts as an osmolytic substance or as an antioxidant. DMSP is excreted and broken down to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which enters the atmosphere and down-regulates global warming and reduces UV- B radiati on from reaching Earth. In temperate shelf areas, the key phytoplankton species, UV irradiance and nutrient concentr ations determine the seasonal cycle of DMS. Ocean acidification reduces DMS accumulation, enhancing global warming, but the role of UV radiation on the production of DMS has not been investigated.140 Increasing environmental pollution, such as crude oil spills affect algae and bacteria especially in the Arctic shallow-water marine habitats. Pyrene is a component of crude oil and accumulates in the sediment where it exerts a synergistically negative effect with increased solar UV-B radiation.116 Pyrene is taken up by and concentrated in the cells where it reduces growth rate. In the Greenland Current and Arctic Ocean persistent organic pollutants (POP) accumulate in phytoplankton as documented during the ATOS-ARCTIC cruise on board the R/V Hesp\u00e9rides.45 Exposure to solar UV radiation alters the fatty acid concentration in several phytoplankton groups117 and affects enzyme activity and nitrogen assimilation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton. However, the sensitivity of phytoplankton species to UV-B radiation is modified by the light history indicating some short-term acclimation to UV-B ra diation stres s.60 Comparable levels of solar UV- B radiation caused the same degree of growth inhibition in phytoplankton in coastal and offshore surface waters of the South China Sea under clear skies by about 28%. In contrast, inhibition by UV-A radiation was higher in open water samples (13%) than in coastal water samples (4%).87 Due to terrestrial runoff, coastal ecosystems often have higher nutrient concentrations than open ocean systems. I n some taxa, such as dinoflagellates, higher nutrient supply (N and P) augments the quantum yield resulting in a different species composition than in open oceanic waters.3 For example, dinoflagellates may outcompete diatoms when rivers deliver larger nutrient loads to coastal waters.141 High nutrient concentrations in coastal waters often induce blooms of toxic phytoplankton (e.g., dinoflagellates), which enter the food chain and can be poisonous to humans. Howe ver, solar UV-B radiation does not seem to impair these red tide phytoplankton species.62 The toxicity of many pollutants increases with exposure to UV radiation. Inland and coastal marine environments are under stress from these interactions between UV radiation and pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which form from Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 136 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 combustion engines, and water-soluble fractions of heavy oil that affect plankton communities. Toxicity of PAHs is enhanced by solar UV radiation as shown with natural phytoplankton communities from the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, Arctic and Southern Ocean.32 Natural phytoplankton communities pre-stressed with UV- B radiation are more susceptible to pollutants, such as atrazine, tributyltin or crude oil, which enter coastal waters from terre strial drainage or maritime traffic, than those grown under UV radiation-free conditions. B enthic organisms Several studies have demonstrated the response of benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms and communities to solar UV radiation in shallow aquatic habitats. In combined laboratory and field experiments freshwater snails were found to have several mechanisms to avoid damage from UV radiation including behavioural avoidance, photorepair, increased shell thickness, pigmentation and body size.1, 111 Juvenile benthic marine polychaetes showed reduced growth a nd development of tentacles when fed detritus derived from diatoms pre-exposed to artificial UV-B radiation from lamps versus diatoms that were not pre-exposed to UV-B radiation.106 Ostracods, small crustaceans that thrive in shallow benthic habitats, have shells that block 60- 80% of UV radiation, as opposed to the exoskeleton of more planktonic Daphnia that block only 35% of UV radiation.161 In a four month-long field experiment on tidal flats where the benthic community was followed when ambient UV-B or UVB+UVA radiation was excluded, the only structural change was a doubling of Ostracod biomass under UV radiation compared to PAR only treatments. Seaweeds are an important group of benthic organisms for coastal ecosystems. In addition to being primary producers, seaweeds shape local environments that are important for many animals including fish larvae. Seaweeds are located in fixed positions and need sunlight for photosynthesis and thus cannot escape exposure to high UV radiation. A substantial species-dependent variation in sensitivity to UV radiation correlates with vertical zonation ; and smaller and juvenile seaweeds are generally the most sensitive.14 Seaweeds have several life stages of which some are motile (zoospores and gametes) and important for the expansion of the species to new locations. These stages may also be sensitive to DNA damage by solar UV- B radiation as they have only one gene copy.109 The seafloor also harbours benthic communities in the form of invertebrates, bacteria, fungi and microalgae. An experimental study examined the effects of different radiation regimes on the development of these benthic communities in Spitsbergen.41 A total of 17 algal and invertebrate taxa were analysed. No detrimental effects were found from UV radiation (relative to PAR only); although in some species the abundance increased, especially under UV-A radiation. This indicates that at the community level the effects of exposure to UV radiation are dependent on species composition and successional stage. A recent stud y on the impact of multiple stressors, including UV radiation, temperature and ocean acidification on molluscan development30 showed that the embryos developed significantly better at 26\u00b0C than at 22\u00b0C. Mortality was significantly higher at 22\u00b0C and pH of 7.6. UV radiation had no significant impact on the embryonic development. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 137 Zooplankton Changes in species composition resulting from climate change160 may favour species that have different UV tolerances. Species that routinely experience high levels of UV radiation are better protected than those that are used to low levels of UV radiation, as was demonstrated by the differences in the UV absorbance of carapaces of Daphnia originating from high UV alpine and low UV boreal lakes.107 In a field survey in Argentina, the relative abundance of more UV-tolerant copepods versus less UV-tolerant Daphnia increased with the distance from the turbid input of a glacier, suggesting UV radiation as a possible regulator of zooplankton community structure, although a role for other factors that changed along the gradient cannot be ruled out.68 The response of species to UV radiation varies and is related to the extent of their ability to use various UV avoidance or protection strategies. Evidence confirms that exposure to UV radiation plays an important role in stimulating downward migration of zooplankton during the day in highly transparent waters. These observations have recently been integrated with past studies to develop a more comprehensive theory of daily vertical migration (DVM).164 Some of the strongest evidence for the importance of UV radiation in DVM comes from alpine lakes that lack the visually feeding fish that are often implicated in DVM. For example, in high elevation lakes in Northern Italy153 and Poland,118 crustacean zooplankton migrate to deeper depths during the day in spite of the lack of fish or other visual predators. In the Italian lakes the abundance of crustacean zooplankton in the surface waters of 13 lakes during the day was found to be similar in those lakes with and without fish, suggesting that it is not fish predation that excludes zooplankton from the surface waters of these lakes.154 In temperate lakes of glacial origin in situ experimental manipulation of fish and UV radiation in 15 m deep mesocosms similarly revealed that UV radiation induced stronger downward migration than did the presence of fish.128 In this same study, Daphnia we re found to migrate upward in the water column during daylight following a strong storm event that reduced water transparency to UV radiation and visible light. In some marine systems copepods may occur deep enough in the water column that UV radiation plays little or no role in DVM.68 Collectively these observations suggest that changes in water transparency due to climate change are likely to influence the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton, a critical link in both freshwater and marine food webs. The importance of the sublethal effects of UV radiation on both freshwater and marine zooplankton has become increasingly recognized. Sublethal effects of UV radiation on marine copepods include reduced egg quality and survival of larvae.68 In a series of laboratory experiments marine copepods grazed at higher rates on algae that had previously been exposed to elevated levels of UV radiation.35 Further advances have been made in understanding defense mechanisms against UV radiation in freshwater and marine zooplankton, including the trade-offs among multiple defenses and pressures from visual predators and other environmental factors. A recent meta- analysis shows that copepods from freshwater ecosystems have more carotenoids than marine copepods, but that the two groups have similar amounts of MAAs.68 Repair and antioxidant enzymes may similarly provide defense against UV radiation and visual predators simultaneously. Following exposure to artificial UV radiation, freshwater calanoid copepods Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 138 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 rapidly activated enzyme systems that reduce peroxidation, cell death, and damage to neurotransmitters.142 Freshwater copepods challenged by simultaneous exposure to fish predation and potentially damaging UV radiation can exhibit trait compensation wherein they increase anti-oxidant enzymes and decrease pigmentation, thus reducing damage by both threats.69 Higher concentrations of carotenoid photoprotective pigments have been observed in copepods in shallow turbid lakes with lower water transparency, apparently due to the lack of aquatic plants and increase in wind-driven turbulence that exposes the copepods to surface UV radiation.132 Fish, amphibians and mammals Recent evidence indicates that changes in the underwater UV radiation environment may play an important role in regulating invasive fish in cold, clear-water lakes. Studies of two species of invasive warm-water fish (bluegill and largemouth bass) and one native (Lahontan redside) fish in Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, have demonstrated strong differences in tolerance to UV radiation between native and invasive species. Warm temperatures in shallow near-shore habitats are necessary for the invasive species to breed. High UV transparency in these near- shore habitats prevents the warm-water invasive species from successfully breeding due to the low tolerance to UV radiation of their larvae. Climate change and other disturbances that reduce UV transparency of waters in the warmer shallow shoreline habitat can open an invasion window that permits the invasive warm-water species to become established and reduces native species population sizes through competition and predation.156 The differences in tolerance to UV radiation between invasive and native species can be used in fisheries management to exclude the warm-water invasive species by developing minimum UV attainment thresholds and maintaining high UV transparency of the shoreline breeding habitats.157 Histological studies have demonstrated that species of fish native to highly UV transparent lakes are also more tolerant of simultaneous exposure to solar UV radiation and pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than are invasive warm-water species found in characteristically less UV transparent lakes.52 UV radiation and PAHs exposure experiments confirmed these results as well as those showing that the native species have more melanin for coping with high UV radiation levels than do the invasive species.51 Othe r recent studies have demonstrated both behavioural avoidance as well as other indirect and direct damaging effects of UV radiation on fish. Experiments that manipulated natural UV radiation with filter foils demonstrated that the survival of freshwater yellow perch larvae is more negatively influenced by UV-A radiation and longer wavelength UV- B and UV-A radiation than by the shorter wavelength UV- B.17 Experimental studies manipulated exposure of two species of salmon fry to solar UV- B radiation in outdoor rearing tanks and tagged smolts using acoustic transmitters to examine their growth rates during rearing as well as subsequent survival rates in the marine environment.102 Exposure to UV- B radiation led to a decrease in early growth of Coho salmon, but had no effects on early survival of either species in the oceans. Exposure of European sea bass larvae to even low levels of artificial UV radiation in the laboratory led to behavioural avoidance, reduced ability to osmoregulate, as well as increased mortality.148 Atlantic cod larvae subjected to prior exposure to artificial UV lamps showed subsequent reductions in the ability to escape suction predators, but not tactile predators;43 feeding rates were also reduced compared to Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 139 unexposed controls.42 While these studies suggest reductions in feeding will translate to reduced survival under natural conditions,42 this speculation is in contrast to a prior study with largemouth bass larvae under more natural conditions in lakes, where the presence of UV radiation stimul ated feeding on zooplankton.83 An analysis of the relationship between brown trout biomass and DOM in 168 lakes in Southern Norway revealed a unimodal relationship with a peak in fish biomass at intermediate DOM levels;36 UV radiation wa s hypothesized to play a role in decreased biomass at low DOM levels. In a comprehensive assessment of exposure to UV-B radiation in amphibian breeding habitats, UV- B radiation levels were estimated to be high enough to seriously threaten wood frogs breeding in northern Minnesota vernal pools.110 Reductions in forest canopy cover due to timber harvest as well as changes in water transparency or pool depth related to climate change may further alter exposure to UV radiation in these amphibian breeding habitats. Marine mammals are being influenced not only by direct damage from exposure to solar UV radiation, but also indirectly through pollution of coastal marine habitats by anthropogenic sunscreen chemicals (sun-tan lotions). They contribute to the bleaching of corals by promoting viral infections and may change the sex of fish.29 Methods for identifying UV-induced skin damage in humans based on real time PCR and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) biomarkers have been recently modified and applied to whales.18 Individuals of three different whale species showed significant variations in mtDNA damage in the skin using these techniques. Different species of whales vary in their strategies for coping with exposure to UV radiation. Blue whales, which have relatively pale skin, vary their melanin production seasonally as UV radiation levels vary with their migrations across latitudes; the inver se relationship between melanin and levels of damage from UV radiation suggest that melanin is an effective defense against UV radiation in these cetaceans.99 Sperm whales, which spend more time in the high UV radiation environments at the surface of the ocean all year long, have more melanocytes than blue whales, but similar amounts of melanin.99 The widely used human sunscreen compound , octocrylene, has recently been found in the liver of dolphi ns off the coa st of Brazil.44 Thus it could also have effects on humans. G aps in knowledge While the response of aquatic biomass producers to solar UV- B radiation and global climate change have been characterized to some extent, the effects of interacting stress factors on natural assemblages and ecosystems needs to be further investigated. How the changes in phytoplankton species composition, due to differential sensitivity of individual species caused b y UV radiation and interaction with other environmental factors such as temperature, will aff ect the subsequent food web including fish and mammals also needs to be quantified. There are limited records on the dynamics of overall effects of UV radiation on physical, chemical, and biological attributes of oligotrophic biomass changes. Ocean acidification due to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations alters the marine c hemical environment, which in turn interferes with UV radiation-protecting calcification in many aquatic organisms including phytoplankton, macroalgae and animals such as molluscs and corals. Multifactorial effects including UV-B radiation and ocean acidification on diverse Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on aquatic systems 140 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 organisms as well as ecosystems should to be studied in order to understand the impacts of future ocean climate changes. Aquatic organisms employ several lines of defense mechanism to mitigate th e damaging effects of UV radiation. A number of ecologically and economically important organisms need to be screened for the presence of photoprotective compounds and molecular mechanisms of repair. There is limited knowledge on the cumulative effects of UV radiation -climate change interactions on the nature and type of invasive species and its impact on native populations in aquatic ecosystems.

Possible positive feedbacks discussed in this assessment include: (i) Enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of above ground litter due to aridification; (ii) Enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of photoreactive dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems due to changes in continental runoff and ice melting; (iii) Reduced efficiency of the biological pump due to UV- induced bleaching of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in stratified aquatic ecosystems, where CDOM protects phytoplankton from the damaging solar UV-B radiation. Mineralisation of organic matter results in the production and release of CO 2, whereas the biological pump is the main biological process for CO 2 removal by aquatic ecosystems. This paper also assesses the interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the biogeochemical cycling of aerosols and trace gases other than CO 2, as well as of chemical and biological contaminants. Interacting effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles are particularly pronounced at terrestrial- aquatic interfaces. Introduction The Montreal protocol has been successful in phasing out ozone-depleting CFCs and, as a consequence, stratospheric ozone concentrations are recovering at low and mid-latitudes145, 236 (see Chapter 1) . However, springtime ozone depletion is expected to continue at polar latitudes for many decades,8, 138 largely due to climate change. A major consequence of stratospheric ozone change is altered intensity of solar UV-B radiation which in turn affects the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and other chemical elements. Terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles are discussed here in the context of their possible interactions with UV radiation and climate change (Fig. 1). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 150 The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is also controlled by climate- related variables such as cloud cover and aerosols. In addition, the penetration of UV-B radiation into water bodies largely depends on the concentration and the optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (referred to as coloured dissolved organic matter , CDOM , hereafter). Climate-change related effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, e.g., desertification, ocean acidification and stratification, as well as land use change interact in various ways with solar UV radiation, resulting in UV-mediated feedbacks on climate. Feedbacks, combined effects and interactions of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles are discussed and assessed, and gaps in knowledge identified. Interactive effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems We include a section that summarises some important issues of climate change, since climate change modulates the effects of solar UV radiation of biogeochemical cycles. Climate change also affects the stratospheric ozone concentration and thus the intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Climate change and polar stratospheric ozone depletion Some chemistry-climate models and observations predict that an ozone 'hole' may still be present in the Antarctic spring in 2100.8 A large loss of stratospheric ozone, comparable to that in the Antarctic ozone 'hole', was also observed over the Arctic in spring 2011138 due, in part, to the extremely cold stratospheric Arctic winter 2010/2011.204 In spring 2011 increased levels of solar UV radiation were Fig. 1 Conceptual model of aquatic and terrestrial processes that are possibly influenced by interactions between UV radiation and climate change. Recent findings on these interactions are discussed in more detail in this assessment.

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 151 observed at Arctic and sub-Arctic ground stations.16 The Arctic stratosphere is particularly affected by r adiative cooling due to Arctic amplification (enhanced warming in high northern latitudes relative to the northern hemisphere).193 There are several reasons for the fast response of the Arctic to global warming, includin g increased advection of water from the Atlantic to the Arctic,167, 209 and reduced albedo due to sea ice melting and vegetation shifts.165 Hence, increasing attention is being paid t o Arctic tipping points.129 The term \"tipping point\" is used for systems (e.g., Arctic ecosystems), where a small change in forcing could potentially cause a large change in future ecosystems. Further detail on climate change and polar stratospheric ozone depletion is given in Chapter 1. Ice melting: effects on local climates Global warming has dramatically enhanced melting of glaciers, ice caps, and sea ice in both hemispheres, with the largest present rates of melting in the Northern Hemisphere.100, 198, 229 The Arctic sea ice, whose extent usually reaches a minimum each year in September, is particularly affected100, 229 (Fig. 2) (also see Fig. 1 in Chapter 4). Melting of Greenland and Antarctic sea ice is mainly due to warmer ocean temperatures.106 Increasing meltwater ponds on the surface of polar ice reduce albedo and allow more solar radiation, both UV and photosynthetically active radi ation (PAR ), to enter the water column through the ice63 (see Chapter 1). Screen and Simmonds193 suggest that positive ice-temperature feedbacks occur in the Arctic due to increases in atmospheric water vapou r content that enhances warming in the lower part of the atmosphere, especially in high northern latitudes. Sea ice melting at high latitudes could also be due to the transformation of solar UV- B radiation into heat by planktonic microorganisms in a cyclic reaction consisting of photooxidation of water at 300 nm that yields H 2O2 with subsequent decomposition of H 2O2 by catalase.152 The decline in Arctic sea ice affects local climates, particularly in North America, Europe, and East Asia with large impacts on biogeochemical cycles. For example, changes in rates of primary production and respiration i n terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may occur as a consequence of droughts and enhanced runoff of terrestrially derived organic carbon, respectively (see below ). These effects on local climates can be summarised as follows: The melting of Arctic sea ice results in increased air temperatures due to evaporation and condensation of surface water, changes in the turbulent heat fluxes and, as a consequence, in increased geopotential height over the Arctic.194 As a result, the jet stream is transformed into Rossby waves that are characterised by cold air moving to the north and warm air moving to the south.61, 62 The higher the amplitude of Rossby waves, the slower they move from west to east, resulting in more frequent episodes of blocking of weather patterns and therefore in longer lasting extreme weather events such as droughts, flooding, cold spells, and heat.61, 62, 79, 133, 218 Further impacts of land and sea ice melting are sea level rise,100 increases in freshwater input and hence changes in ocean circulation and reduced surface albedo99 (see Chapter 1), and enhanced Fig. 2 Arctic sea ice loss from 1979 to 2012 as derived from satellite passive microwave data. The yellow lines (after 2002) are from AMSR -E data. ( Panel b) of Fig. 4. 4 from Chapter 4 \"Observations: Cryosphere\" of the IPCC Report 2013, Working Group I: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis).100 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 152 exposure of organisms in aquatic ecosystems and on land surfaces such as tundra to solar UV radiation (this assessment and Chapter 4). Over the period 1901-2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 (0.17 to 0.21) m and the IPCC WGI Report 2013 (summary for policymakers)100 states with high confidence that the \"rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia.\" Interacting effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change on ecosystems The interplay between stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change affects atmospheric circulation, the speed and direction of winds, and, as a consequence, ocean mixing. There is a global trend of increasing values of surface and higher level wind speed, linked, in part, to stratospheric ozone depletion.126, 161, 241 Causes of this phenomenon have been reported more than ten years ago in a key paper by Gillet and Thompson.67 Based on observations and modeling results, these investigators found falling geopotential heights at constant pressure (500-hPa) at high southern latitudes from 1979- 2000 due to Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and thus decreasing temperatures. Concomitantly , 500-hPa heights were rising in the middle southern latitudes, due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and thus increasing temperatures. This interplay between Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change results in an upward trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).140, 141, 161 Positive SAM indices result in mean high values of the westerly polar vortexes and a poleward shift of the westerly wind belts at the Earth's surface.108, 126 As a consequence, net uptake of carbon dioxide in the Southern Ocean, believed to be a major sink for atmospheric CO 2,75, 101 may be reduced by enhanced wind-driven upwelling of carbon-rich deepwater.128, 232 Paleo-oceanographic studies suggest that a Southern Ocean CO 2 ventilation event might have caused glacial-interglacial changes in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration.30, 180, 202, 220 Changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation due to the combined effects of Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change alter Southern Hemisphere weather. These alterations potentially include increased incidence of extreme events, floods, droughts, and wildfires.177 Ocean warming, stratification, acidification, and deoxygenation Global warming results in increased sea-surface temperatures (SST) and, in turn, in thermal stratification. Another effect of increasing SST is ocean deoxygenation as a consequence of reduced oxygen solubility. Furthermore, increasing CO 2 concentrations result in ocean acidification.75 Ocean acidification lowers the saturation state of calcite and aragonite (Fig. 3) and thus the ability of calcifiers such as coccolithophores and corals to produce and maintain their shells of calcite and aragonite.66, 75 Fram ework building corals are also sensitive to ocean warming because of the breakdown of the symbiosis with symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), resulting in coral bleaching.34, 75, 83, 163, 205 Algae that no longer live in symbiosis with corals are less protected from solar UV-B radiation. Furthermore, iron stress of zooxanthellae has been shown to reduce the ir photosynthetic efficiency and to alter the pigment composition at elevated temperatures.201 The combined effects of increasing SST, ocean acidification and stratification, and solar UV radiation on marine ecosystems are likely to reduce the rate of primary production by phytoplankton (see below). Based on a Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model, Laufkoetter et al.123 reported a decrease in global net primary production of phytoplankton with increasing SST from 1960-2006. An excellent review article on these topics has been publi shed by Gruber.75 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 153 Changes in hydroclimatic conditions and continental runoff The i nterplay between global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion affects precipitation patterns in space and time and enhances the intensity of precipitation extremes.3, 51, 108, 14 7, 162 Cooling of the Antarctic stratosphere due to ozone depletion causes circulation cells to shift polewards, resulting in wetter conditions in the southern subtropics in the austral summer and drier conditions around 40oS.51, 108 On the other hand, strong El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, potentially due to global warming, cause the South Pacific convergence zone to shift towards the Equator with concomitant changes in hydroclimatic conditions resulting in more frequent weather events such as droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones.31 In the Northern Hemisphere, the intensity of heavy precipitation events has increased over much of the land area due to warming.43, 117, 147 Changes in hydroclimatic conditions may result in an enhanced input of terrestrial organic matter into aquatic systems12, 77, 210, 243 with consequences for the rate of UV-induced mineralisation of organic carbon (see below). Changes in continental runoff of CDOM have consequences for the transmission of solar UV radiation into water bodies and thus for the protection of phytoplankton against the damaging UV- B radiation (see below ). Remote sensing studies have provided new information on the extent of CDOM runoff and its impact on the penetration depth of UV radiation in the biologically-rich waters and coral reefs of South Florida (Fig. 4). Vegetation shifts, droughts, fires, and tipping points Cli mate related changes in the spatial distribution and regional intensities of precipitation and temperatures extremes, among other variables, drive vegetation shifts, droughts and the occurrence and extent of fires. This results in changes in the biogeochemical cycles that are initiated by UV interactions with the terrestrial biosphere and fire-scarred continental surfaces. Solar UV radiation also impacts the oxidative state of the atmosphere, in both the gas and aerosol phases, further Fig. 3 Global map showing oceanic regions of particular vulnerability to climate -change effects (see legend above) .

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 154 influencing greenhouse gases concentrations and budgets.14 This section seeks to provide heuristic linkages between climate related drivers such as wild fires, droughts and how UV fluxes, and changes and trends in UV fluxes, interact may push terrestrial ecosystems up to and over tipping points in ecosystem health. Intensification of agriculture and the evolution of natural landscapes and ecosystems to managed ecosystems have increased rapidly over the past 50 years.80, 87, 165 Changes in plant species also occur in regions that are undergoing large climate-related eco- system shifts.169 Climate- related changes in some of the Earth's largest terrestrial ecosystems are being detected.45, 70 Droughts, for example, are reducing terrestrial primary product- ion and are increasing in many regions of the Earth.13, 37, 192, 246 UV radiation interacts extensively with the biogeochemical cycles that are shifting with changing land surface characteristics. The interactions of vegetation with the changing UV fluxes result in altered trace gas emission to the atmosphere including volatile organic carbon compounds (VOCs) (see below and Chapter 3). These UV-induced trace gas emissions include both direct emission of VOCs from plants, thought to be weakly sensitive to changes in UV radiation, and UV interactions with burned and/or modified litter. It is, however, difficult to separat e changes in ecosystems due to ecosystem maturation and those due to climate change.18 As ozone, aerosols and trace gases change and evolve in the atmosphere, the UV radiation at the surface changes, as well as the characteristics of the surface itself.231 UV radiation-mediated release of trace gases and aerosols from the terrestrial biosphere then changes as a result of the altered make-up of the land surface. Fires have emerged as an important component of such land surface change.112, 230 Not only do fires input massive amounts of chemicals and aerosols to the atmosphere, altering atmospheric UV radiation and chemistry, but they also leave charred substrate behind. Charcoal can persist for long periods in terrestrial systems. As a re sult, increasing amounts of black carbon, an important constituent of charred substrate, are entering rivers and flowing into lakes and the ocean where photochemical transformations are important sinks.48, 102, 142, 213 The intent of this section is to highlight and draw attention to the often ignored interactions between UV radiation, atmospheric chemistry and surface land characteristics that are dependent on the extant ecosystems . The way in which these interacting systems are changing at the same time, often at different rates, is also addressed. Terrestrial biosphere tipping points occur due to the complex interactions between UV radiation, drought-induced aerosol distributions, anthropogenic pollution and column ozone depletion over specific areas.16, 27 UV radiation change s could represent the final source of variability that Fig. 4 Image showing UV attenuation caused by runoff of colored dissolved organic matter in coastal regions of South Florida. Results were derived from satellite measurements (MODIS/A) on 9 January 2009 using a model described by Barnes et al.11 Land is masked in black.

Figure modified from Barnes et al.11 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 155 push es/pulls the terrestrial biosphere over tipping points with large impacts on global biogeochemical cycles. Even with the general success of the Montreal protocol, there are still large areas with high UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface due to column ozone depletion.16 Tipping points in biogeochemical cycles may be traversed by strong gradients in surface UV radiation. Biogeochemical cycles are occurring over large regions of similar ecosystem make-up and experience large differences in UV flux due to atmospheric chemistry and physical climate variables such as clouds. As in the purely physical climate system, extreme events often have a greater impact on biogeochemical cycles than a change in the mean state.25, 134 There are direct feedbacks where the processes of afforestation lead to changes in the general circulation of the atmosphere resulting in changes in precipitation.217 Extreme events, physical climate system shifts, fires and droughts all may contribute to UV initiation of tipping points in both terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles. For example, extensive increases in melting snow and ice cover lead to increases in the exposure of aquatic ecosyst ems to UV and PAR ,63 which have the potential to create tipping points - shifts in photosynthetic vs heterotrophic organisms where community as well as ecosystem structure and function are fundamentally altered.38. As ecosystems change due to climate change, fire and droughts, the chemicals released (i.e. hydrocarbon, CO 2, CH 4, aerosols ) alter atmospheric chemistry. These biogeochemical changes have, in turn, implications for the residence times of greenhouse gases that are modulated by UV photochemistry. These interactions and biogeochemical cycling aspects of the Earth system often fal l outside of traditional boundaries of scientific specialization and are only now becoming more fully appreciated. Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the carbon cycle Carbon exchange between ocean and atmosphere Air-sea CO 2 fluxes vary locally and seasonally and depend on the partial pressure of CO 2 and, in turn, on ocean temperature, mixing, and biology.175, 195 The main biological process that controls the uptake of CO 2 by the ocean is the so- called biological pump (CO 2 binding in photosynthesis by phytoplankton and export of dead particulate organic matter to the ocean sediment) (Fig. 5). Rates of primary production depend on various factors including light and nutrient availability, temper- ature, and the species composition of phytoplankton. Also phytoplankton perform- ance is important for efficient CO 2 uptake and may be negatively affected by solar UV-B radiation.78, 242 Evidence has continued to mount that the concentration of CDOM controls the penetration of UV and short-wavelength visible Fig. 5 Schematic representation of the biological pump, indicated by the green arrows. The efficiency of the biological pump depends on the rates of both photosynthesis (primary production) with photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and the formation and sediment ation of particulate organic matter (POM). Numbers in red are from Houghton96 and correspond to approximate global mean fluxes in Pg C yr-1. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 156 radiation into lakes and the coastal ocean.11, 78, 158, 208, 242 CDOM effectively protects aquatic ecosystems from harmful UV-B radiation while permitting PAR to be transmitted into the water column. The degradation of CDOM by photochemical and biological processes leads to a loss of colour and reduced UV absorbance, both in the UV-B and UV-A regions.26, 69, 74, 85, 197, 216, 239 As a consequence of CDOM photobleaching, the penetration depths of solar UV radiation into water bodies increase, thereby increasing the exposure of phytoplankton to damaging solar UV-B radiation (also see Chapter 4). CDOM photobleaching is particularly evident in thermally stratified waters bodies.23, 85, 239 Stratification results in a shallower mixing depth, which in addition leads to a greater exposure of phytoplankton to UV-B radiation.226 Enhanced stratification, due to increasing sea surface temperatures, occurs mainly in low latitude marine environments where it also hinders the transport of nutrients to the euphotic zone from deeper water layers and hence negatively affects primary production.21, 123 Stratification has also been observed in ice-free Arctic marine regions due to increased meltwater input.32 Cai et al.32 predict that an ice-free Artic Ocean will not become a larger CO 2 sink due, in part, to an inefficient biological pump as a consequence of negative effects of solar UV radiation on phytoplankton. CDOM in aquatic systems originates from several sources. In the coastal ocean, continental runoff of CDOM plays an important role (see also above).57, 73, 158, 173, 197, 208 In the open ocean and large lakes, CDOM is a by-product of biological degradation of dead phytoplankton.157, 158, 216 Thus, a reduced concentration of phytoplankton will drive decreased CDOM production, further increasing transmission of UV radiation into the ocean. The observed reductions in chlorophyll concentration that have been attributed to increasing sea surface temperatures21 are probably caused by a combination of increased exposure to UV radiation and reduced nutrient upwelling.50 An important part of the biological pump is the export production, i.e. the formation and sedimentation of particulate organic matter (POM) stemming from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton material. The export production has decreased by 8% from 1960-2006 globally with strong spatial variability, based on model calculations.123 One reason for this decline may be a global decrease in the biomass of small phytoplankton and diatoms in the period 1960-2006 (8.5% and 3%, respectively123). Ocean acidification may further reduce the biomass of coccolithophores, small calcifying phytoplankton, and hence the production of CaCO 3 \"ballast\" that enhances sinking rates of carbonate-rich POM.75, 88, 89, 123 Overall, the interaction of solar UV radiation with climate-change effects such as ocean stratification is likely to decrease the efficiency of the biological pump and to cause UV -mediated, positive feedbacks on atmospheric CO 2 (see also below ). C arbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere The uptake of CO 2 by terrestrial ecosystems via photosynthesis of plants and the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere via decomposition of senescent plant material (litter) are affected both positively and negatively by solar UV radiation and climate change.10, 242 Climate change, and in particular the intensity and frequency of droughts in terrestrial ecosystems could negatively impact primary production by plants and crops and thus CO 2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems.13, 100, 246 At the same time, changes in climate that decrease cloudiness and increase UV radiation at the terrestrial surface may increase losses of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems due to increased photochemical degradation of plant material.7 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 157 A part of the CO 2 fixed by plants may be sequestered in forests or long-lived plant soil components such as woody tissue or peat in soil organic matter, thus increasing its residence time in organic pools. Plant litter on the soil surface is, however, subject to rapid degradation, which results in emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.24, 82, 184, 242 The release of CO 2 from terrestrial ecosystems by microbial degradation of soil organic matter is strongly affected by temperature and moisture.19, 135, 206 In addition, there is increasing evidence of abiotic decomposition of above ground litter due to UV radiation, particularly in arid and semiarid regions with low soil biotic activity.6, 7, 24, 42 , 53, 64 , 113, 125, 135, 143, 184, 206 Rates of plant litter photodegradation due to exposure to UV radiation depend on various factors, including: (i) plant cover,7 (Fig. 6), (ii) the intensity of solar UV radiation (altitude, latitude), (iii) exposure of litter mass to solar radiation due to differences in litter area to mass ratio, and (iv) chemical composition of plant litter 6, 113 (Figure 7 , also see Chapter 3). Recent information regarding the role of litter chemistry in determining the rate of UV-induced litter degradation has identified the importance of lignin in the process of photodegradation. Several studies have shown a decrease in litter lignin content with exposure to solar or UV-B radiation 59, 86 and that lignin content of litter is positively correlated with higher rates of mass loss (Fig. 7, Austin and Ballar\u00e9 6). The latter can be explained in terms of a higher percentage of aromatic components in lignin and thus a higher rate of light absorption in the UV and visible range. 6, 53, 64, 215 Although abiotic photodegradation increases with the lignin content, the rate of microbial degradation tends to decrease with increasing lignin content, due to the bio-recalcitrant nature of lignin6 (Fig. 7). Finally, there is some evidence that exposure of plant litter to solar UV- radiation can increase the bioavailability of some compounds to soil microorganisms,24, 42, 53, 64 although the mechanistic basis of this stimulation has not been established. The direct and indirect effects of UV radiation on decomposition of plant litter are likely to become a much more significant global pathway for terrestrial organic matter decomposition in the future. Aridification due to land use and/or climate change could amplify photodegradative losses from senescent plant litter, with large potential impacts on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Particular attention needs to be paid to Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. The Arctic region is experiencing rapid warming and its land area, including the tundra, has large stores of carbon that are likely to be rapidly converted to GHGs with warming. For example, losses from plant litter may be enhanced due to the thawing of permafrost 42 and Arctic tundra wildfires,136 (see also above). All of these global changes have potential to affect plant cover (Fig. 6)7 and hence increase the importance of photodegradation in these modified ecosystems. Fig. 6 Hypothesized effect of plant cover on photodegradation in terrestri al ecosystems. Plant cover is a key factor which will affect the degree of exposure to UV radiation and impacts of photodegradation as a vector of carbon loss in arid and semiarid ecosystems. As precipitation increases, primary production and resulting pla nt cover increase, thereby reducing the relative importance of photodegradation in mesic and humid ecosystems. Global changes such as shrub encroachment, increased fire frequency, invasion of non -native annual species and afforestation will all affect pla nt cover and consequently the relative impact of photodegradation on decomposition in these ecosystems. Red line shows the importance of photodegradation as rainfall increases, the dashed line is changes in plant cover. Green arrows indicate the direction of change in plant cover with global change. Figure modified from Austin.7 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 158 The terrestrial-aquatic interface Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are largely linked via the biogeochemical cycling of carbon. Runoff and leaching of plant litter is a major source of CDOM in aquatic environments, especially in freshwaters. In coastal marine environments, a large fraction of organic carbon originates from terrestrial ecosystems that is transported to coastal oceans (i) via rivers, 54, 56, 68, 130, 155, 210 and (ii) fluxes from wetlands, particularly from mangrove swamps 15 (Fig. 4). Terrestrial organic matter (tDOM), in particular its CDOM fraction, more strongly attenuates solar UV radiation than organic matter produced within lakes and the sea due to its relatively high aromatic content, 57, 74, 159, 173, 197, 211, 242 where the optical properties of terrigenous CDOM arise primarily from partially oxidised lignins originating from plant sources22 (see also above ). UV- induced photodegradation occurs more readily with terrestrially derived CDOM than with microbial C DOM74, 105, 179, 211, 242 where microbial CDOM is derived from autochthonous organic sources in the ocean and lakes such as dead phytoplankton cells. In the Arctic Ocean, continental runoff is a major source of terrigenous organic material and nutrients, thereby influencing water column stratification, gas exchange, light attenuation, surface heating, biological productivity, and carbon sequestration. A remote sensing study of the pan-Arctic distribution of tDOM and continental runoff in the surface Arctic Ocean indicated a correspondence between climate-driven changes in river discharge and tDOM inventories in the Kara Sea. 57 The major carbon substances resulting from UV-induced photodegradation of C DOM are inorganic species: dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and to a lesser extent carbon monoxide (CO)173, 197, 233 (see Fig. 8). Photochemical DIC formation may strongly impact carbon cycling in seawater and other natural waters. For example, the annual photodegradation of CDOM exceeded the annual terrestrial input of photoreactive CDOM to the Baltic Sea, indicating that photochemical transformation is a major sink for terrestrial CDOM in such coastal systems.1 Other mechanistic studies of the efficiencies of CDOM photodegradation have shown that DIC photoproduction rates are up to 30 times greater than CO photoproduction 173, 197, 233 (Fig. 8). Although not precise, these estimates suggest that CO 2 photoproduction rates are comparable to other oceanic CO 2 production terms, e.g., microbial respiration. UV-induced and the microbial degradation of DOM (respiration, see Fig. 5) result in production of CO 2. The rate of this process is largely controlled by the availability of DOM to heterotrophic bacteria, which in turn depends on the chemical composition of DOM.41, 178, 210, 215 UV- induced transformations generally decrease the bioavailability of microbial C DOM and enhance the bioavailability of terrigenous C DOM .41, 215, 242 Such a UV-induced enhancement also has been observed in the case of terrestrial plant litter where the term \"photochemical priming\" has been used to describe this enhancement (see Chapter 3 ). Fig. 7 Effects of lignin concentration on biotic decomposition and photodegradation. While biotic degradation of plant litter is inhibited by high lignin concentrations, lignin serves as a light absorbing compound facilitating photodegradation and carbon release from decomposing plant litter. Green circles indicate material of varying lignin concentrations which was decomposed in shaded conditions in contact with soil (biotic decomposition) while red diamonds indicate identical material of varying lignin co ncentrations that was isolated from the soil surface and exposed to full solar radiation. Figure modified from Austin and Ballar\u00e9.6 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 159 Climate change can influence the UV-induced degradation of CDOM through effects on its sources. For examples, melting of glaciers, ice sheets, and thawing permafrost heightens the input of microbial DOM into aquatic systems46, 52, 164 and this source of CDOM generally becomes less biodegradable when transformed by solar UV radiation. Furthermore, both changes in continental hydrology and land use change may increase fluxes of tDOM from land to ocean150, 174, 210, 222, 243 thereby enhancing UV- induced CO 2 production via mineralisation of tDOM.130 According to Regnier et al.174, the carbon flux to inland waters from soils has risen by 1.0 Pg C per year since preindustrial times. Also land use changes can affect sources of CDOM. For example, disturbance of peatlands has resulted in a 32% increase in fluvial organic flux from southeast Asia150 and this source of tDO M likely is photodegradable. Arctic aquatic ecosystems are particularly affected by increased input of DOM due to changes in rainfall, melting of ice, snow, and the permafrost. Depending on its source , DOM in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is subject to UV-induced or microbial mineralisation, where photochemical priming plays an important role.219 Links between carbon and nutrient cycles In aquatic ecosystems, CO 2 fixation in photosynthesis by phytoplankton (primary production) plays a key role in linking the carbon and nutrient cycles. The rate of primary production depends, in part, on the concentration and bioavailability of macro- and micronutrients present in the euphotic zone. Many nutrients are transported into the euphotic zone from deeper water layers.104 However, ocean stratification due to increasing sea-surface temperatures (SST) hinders the upwelling of nutrients and, as a consequence, negatively affects primary production and hence the biological pu mp21, 50, 123(see above). Micronutrients (essential trace metals including Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, and Cd) may co-limit phytoplankton growth and primary production in marine environments.110, 111, 127, 201 The biological availability of essential trace metals depends on their chemical speciation. In general, only dissolved and weakly-bound or unchelated metals are available to phytoplankton.4, 151 , 238 For this reason, oxidation and mainly reduction processes (redox reactions) induced by solar UV radiation play an important role in the formation of bioavailable metal species.84 Increased vertical mixing of water bodies reduces rates of UV-induced redox cycling of essential metals. For example, sea-ice loss in the western Antarctic Peninsula is hypothesised to reduce iron bioavailability because of greater vertical mixing in winters with little sea ice.225 Iron plays a key role as a micronutrient and co-limits phytoplankton growth particularly in the so-called high-nutrient-low chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic regions.110, 111 In oxygenated marine environments, Fe (III) is largely present in the form of solid Fe(III) phases, with low solubility. In the Southern Ocean, for example, dissolved iron concentrations range between 0.4 and 1.5 nmol L-1.189 However, these solid iron phases can undergo UV-induced dissolution yielding dissolved iron species20, 109 and this photochemical process has been shown to occur at pH-values of marine waters.20 Fig. 8 Measured ratios of sunlight -induced CO 2/CO photoproduction in oceanic water samples collected from a variety of locations and times. The average ratio is close to 20 in marine systems but somewhat lower in freshwaters.173, 197, 233 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 160 Ocean acidification (see above) can result in reduced availability of essential trace metals such as Fe, Zn, and Cd to phytoplankton, either via changes in the chemical speciation of metals or by decreasing the effectiveness of the enzymatic reduction of metals.199, 238 For example, the uptake rate of iron bound to the siderophore desferrioxamine B by a model diatom was by a factor of ~2 lower in seawater samples with pH 7.8 as compared to samples with pH 8.7.199 Ocean acidification also slows down nitrogen uptake by phytoplankton under low iron conditions by lowering the efficiency of N 2 fixation.200 Combined effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the biogeochemistry of trace gases and aerosols Terrestrial and aquatic environments are important atmospheric sources and sinks of trace gases and aerosols. Recent research on the air-sea exchange of trace gases has provided further evidence that these sources are strongly influenced by interactions between solar UV radiation and climate change. Methane Methane is an important greenhouse gas that is stored in various reservoirs in the terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric systems. UV radiation is involved in the release and exchange of CH 4 between these reservoirs as well as atmospheric chemical processes in the troposphere and stratosphere.49, 90, 156 Temperature, water vapour, stratospheric ozone, biomass burning, and lightning NO x are the dominant sour ces of inter-annual changes in methane lifetime.90 UV radiation plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of each of these sources in inter-annual changes in methane lifetime which is ~9 yr.149 The linkages and inferences of this section revolve around the UV-mediated atmospheric chemistry, ozone, OH etc. that drive atmospheric methane concentrations, and how CH 4 release and uptake from land, aquatic and atmospheric reservoirs is influenced by UV radiation and biogeochemical cycles in general. New satellite and airborne data assimilation techniques allow high-resolution, global estimates of the sources and sinks of atmospheric methane.97 These emerging technologies allow quantification and evaluation of the wild-fire production of atmospheric methane, an increasing source due to the climate related increas ed occurrence of wildfires.181, 224 UV radiation plays a critical role in the atmospheric chemistry of methane as well as modulating its production in soils and other components of the terrestrial biosphere,235, 245 although Morsky et al. 154 find its role in methane production in a sub-arctic fen was more modest. The release of methane to the atmosphere from land surfaces is dependent upon climate change in the terrestrial biosphere as well as heat and UV supply to specific methane reservoirs such as permafrost regions. Methane fluxes from the Arctic Ocean are strong and occurred mainly in areas of open water between sea-ice (leads) and fractional sea-ice up to 82o N.118 Additional sources from submarine permafrost regions have also been reported.196 Such ocean ic regions are likely to become increasing sources of atmospheric methane in the future due to climate-related changes in sea-ice cover. Warming has also been shown to affect the emission of methane in Western Siberian lakes with implications for atmospheric chemistry and UV interactions.168 We posit that as climate changes, ocean sea-ice coverage changes and often decreases, resulting in new and increased distributions of air-sea methane flux. The resultant methane releases will change and will be occurring simultaneously with the evolving atmospheric UV rad iation budget. Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is widely produced through interactions of solar UV radiation with organic substances in aquatic and terrestrial systems. The average ratio of measured CO 2/CO fluxes from Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 161 various marine environments is close to 20 (Fig. 8). CO participates in chemical reactions that change air quality and it is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH). Due to its significant effects on OH, CO also indirectly influences the concentrations of methane , halocarbons and other gases in the troposphere (see above ). Recent research has provided further evidence that UV-induced processes as well as abiotic thermal processes involving tDOM in aquatic systems and plant litter on land are significant sources of CO to the atmosphere.55, 113, 173 , 197, 207, 212, 233, 240, 244 tDOM generally is a more efficient source of CO (higher apparent quantum yields) than microbial CDOM derived from marine sources such as algal detritus. For example, CO photoproduction efficiencies in the Tyne estuary were highest for high CDOM riverine samples and almost an order of magnitude lower for low CDOM coastal seawater samples.212 One exception to this g eneral observation is the unusually high efficiency of CO photoproduction from CDOM within floating Sargassum colonies197. There are also significant CO microbial sinks in aquatic and terrestrial sy stems and the competition between these sources and sinks often results in diurnal fluctuations in the net exchange of CO between biosphere and atmosphere.190, 240, 244 An extensive study of the sea to air exchange of CO 2 in the sub-arctic estuarine water body, the Canadian St. Lawrence estuary system, showed that the rates of photoproduction and microbial consumption of CO are approximately balanced.244 Other findings are that the photochemical efficiency for CO production from DOM in aquatic systems decreases with increasing salinity across the freshwater-marine mixing zone.207, 233, 237, 245 Studies of terrestrial plants have provided additional evidence that exposure to UV radiation leads to production of CO from dead plant matter (litter) and that production rates depend on the litter traits.125 Studies of the effects of changing wavelength on CO photoproduction from litter are uncommon but one study showed that UV radiation induces CO production from Sequoia dendrongiganteum litter. CO emissions were strongly reduced in the absence of oxygen as compared to air.47 Other studies have shown that living plant leaves also photoproduce CO,29 although the production efficiency generally is much lower than for senescent or dead vegetation. Nitrogen compounds Among nitrogen-containing gases, nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2) play an important role in atmospheric chemistry, and many nitrogen gases have important interactions with UV radiation. In the troposphere, NO x enhances the formation of O 3 via UV-induced reactions (see Chapter 6 ). In the stratosphere, the opposite is the case, where NO x destroys O 3 by the following reaction: NO + O 3 NO 2 + O 2, where NO 2 acts as a catalyst in stratospheric O 3 destruction .170 Furthermore, the reaction of NO 2 with ClO yields ClONO 2, a reservoir of reactive chlorine that continues to play an important role in polar stratospheric ozone depletion in the Arctic and Antarctic spring. Given these important interactions, changes in the atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen oxides due to climate change or other human activity may indirectly affect ozone recovery and the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth\u00b4s surface. Anthropogenic NO x emission from combustion of fossil fuel, is an important source of NO x to t he atmosphere. Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) from natural sources is produced mainly by anaerobic bacteria that reduce nitrate (NO 3-) to nitrogen gas N 2;166 NO is also a by-product of the oxidation of ammonium (NH 4+) to nitrate by ammonia-oxidising soil bacteria.160, 166 Nitrous acid (HONO) emissions from ammonia-oxidising bacteria are comparable with emissions of NO.160, 214. Since soil emissions of both NO and HONO depend on the soil water content,160 increasing soil dryness, due to climate change, may increase the emission of NO and HONO from soils. UV-induced photolysis of HONO is a major source of the hydroxyl radical (HO) (up to ~30% of production in the lower atmosphere214). In addition to soil emissions of NO x from biotic processes, UV-induced photolysis of Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 162 NO 3- (photodenitrification) is an important source of NO x to the atmosphere.153, 176 This abiotic process has been shown recently to occur on the surface of nitrate-containing snow in the Arctic,153 and in sea salt particles containing Cl- and Br-.176 A nother key nitrogen-containing gas is nitrous oxide (N 2O), an important greenhouse and stratospheric ozone depleting gas. The surface emission of N 2O approximately balances the stratospheric N 2O loss170 via formation of the ozone destroying NO [N 2O + O* 2 NO, where O* is pr oduced via photolysis of ozone: O 3 + h O* + O 2] . In terrestrial ecosystems, N 2O is formed by denitrifying soil bacteria that reduce NO 3- to N 2.166 N2O formation in soils depends on soil water content (SWC) and temperature and occurs at higher SWC than soil emission of HONO and NO.28, 160 Van Groenigen et al.223 predict that rising levels of CO 2 will result in increased emissions of N 2O from upland soil due to reduced plant respiration and thus higher SWC. In addition, more frequent precipitation events, due to climate change, that increase SWC could thus enhance the N 2O flux from soils.28 In aquatic ecosystems, ammonia is produced by the UV-induced degradation of DOM184 and N2O by both denitrifying bacteria and ammonia oxidising archaea.188 N2O formation is particularly efficient in suboxic and hypoxic oceanic regions (~10% of the ocean volume).39, 228 The area of such regions is likely to expand (Fig. 3) due to the following factors: (i) eutrophication of coastal waters, (ii) decreasing O 2 solubility with warmer water temperatures, and (iii) shifts in respiration towards the upper oceanic water column because of reduced sinking velocity of particles in the ocean39, 88, 227 (see also above ). Furthermore, it has been shown that during storms, N 2O rich subsurface water is mixed upwards228 suggesting that more frequent storm events, due to climate change, may result in increased emission of N 2O from marine environments. In addition, sea-ice retreat has been suggested to decrease the residence time of N 2O in the surface water of the Arctic Ocean and thus could enhance the sea-air flux of N 2O.115, 172 Geoengineering via fertilisation of marine regions with iron could enhance marine N 2O production,103 (also see Chapter 1 ). Halogen compounds Biogenic processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are important sources of halocarbons other than CFC (e.g., methyl halides 3Cl, and CH 3I) 81, 121, 132 In aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton is involved in the formation of these halocarbons, particularly pico-sized phytoplankton,121 and to a lesser extent bacteria belonging to Erythrobacter or Pseudomonas .65 The rate of halocarbon production in aquatic ecosystems also depends on the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), with tDOM playing an important role in the formation of halocarbons such as bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2Br2).132 Hence increased fluxes of tDOM from land to ocean, due to climate change, may enhance the formation of halocarbons, particularly in eutrophic coastal waters. In addition to the biotic production of halocarbons, abiotic UV-induced processes could also be involved in the formation of CH 2ClI, and CH 2I2 in seawater.121 In the atmosphere, halocarbons are transformed into reactive halogen species (RHS, e.g., the r adicals Br and BrO), where the hydroxyl radical (HO., formed in reactions induced by solar UV radiation) acts as the oxidant.93, 214 In the troposphere, RHS react with ozone186, 187 and other gases, e.g., gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0)171 (see also below). Halocarbons can reach the lowermost stratosphere and undergo UV radiation-induced transformations yielding RHS, particularly BrO., that par ticipate in stratospheric ozone depletion.93, 94 Models suggest that the loading of the stratosphere with reactive bromine species will increase in the future due to climate change92 and thus the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere by RHS represents a positive feedback on solar UV radiation. This feedback could be enhanced by climate-change related processes, particularly by increased input Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 163 of tDOM into coastal zones132 and by increases in ocean mixing and thus transport of CH 3Br to the lower stratosphere.93 Aerosols Atmospheric aerosols play an important role in the biogeochemistry of greenhouse gases, atmospheric circulation trends due to changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry.137 The surfaces of atmospheric aerosol particles provide reactive multi-phase regions for chemical transformations in the atmosphere. Surfaces, as well as the liquid phase portions inside the aerosols, interact with UV radiation to process chemicals critical to climate and atmospheric chemistry in general. Aerosol distributions and trends in distributions due to climate change alter UV fluxes to Earth's surface. This is due to direct blocking of UV radiation by aerosols in the atmosphere and the fact that the distributions and the radiative and chemical make-up of the aerosols are evolving as climate changes. Aerosol s affect circulation directly via interactions with radiation with attendant thermal gradient impacts.122, 148 This means that strong feedbacks exist between aerosol distributions, UV radiation, and the circulation that influence precipitation and atmospheric transport.44 Chang es in the distribution of atmospheric aerosols are occurring at the same time as shifts in terrestrial and aquatic and marine ecosystems.191 UV radiation is involved in and affected by biogeochemical feedbacks that result from chemical exchanges at the Earth surface, physical circulation changes and human-induced modification of the environment. UV interactions with the liquid phase of marine aerosol particles result in trace gas production, which alter the oxidation state of the atmosphere. Fe compounds have recently been implicated in these aerosol multiphase interactions.139 Aerosols not only scatter and absorb atmospheric UV radiation they influence and change atmospheric gas and liquid phase chemistry. Urbanisation and managed agriculture have resulted in changing patterns of atmospheric dust distributions and deposition.120 These dust aerosols, which affect the transparency of the troposphere, have a concurrent impact on UV flux to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Non-Asian sources are a significant source of dust to the North Pacific98 and will likely result in significant changes in the supply of nutrients, as organically bound Fe and P is transported atmospherically from continental regions to ocean ecosystems.107, 150, 191 Information from studies of the impacts of volcanic supplies of aerosols are being used to predict the impact of future aerosol distributions on the carbon cycle.182 There is an emerging realisation that liquid phase UV-driven aerosol chemistry can influence biogeochemical cycling of atmospheric greenhouse gases.131 This means that not only do atmospheric aerosols modulate surface UV fluxes via their distribution in the atmospheric column, but also the multi-phase chemical processes that occur on/in aerosols affect the oxidative state of the atmosphere. An example of this multi-phase chemistry is the Fe chemistry in aerosols that influences atmospheric radicals, oxidative state and lifetimes of greenhouse gases139. These newly identified biogeochemical cycles assist in understanding some of the interactions between UV radiation, aerosol chemistry and atmospheric greenhouse gas distributions. Combined effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on chemical and biological contaminants Organics Global climate change and interactions with solar ultraviolet radiation will potentially influence chemical fate and bioaccumulation in terrestrial and aquatic environments.71, 91 Reviews and modeling studies have particularly focused on the Arctic and persistent organic pollutants (POPs)5, 72, 221 and predict the following effects: (1) Increased ambient temperatures could lead to increased emissions of chemicals through passive volatilisation from materials and stockpiles; (2) Increased emissions of Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 164 POPs are predicted as a result of changing land-use patterns and changes in global agricultural practices, such as pesticide formulations and application rates; (3) Changes in energy use will affect use and release of chemicals; (4) Increases in the frequency of forest fires will increase the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other combustion by-products such as charcoal and black carbon. Although POPs are chemicals such as chlorinated compounds that are resistant to biodegradation and/or to photodegradation through direct absorption of sunlight, these chemicals can be transformed by indirect photoreactions that involve natural substances such as tDOM (or related natural organic substances that were isolated from soils or natural waters), peroxides, nitrate or certain trace metals. Most of the recent examples of indirect photoreactions involve participation of tDOM.35, 36, 72, 76, 183 Chemicals having a wide variety of structural features participate in these indirect photoreactions including chlorinated contaminants,72, 183 antibiotics,76 beta-blockers,36 and other drugs.35 O ne manner through which environmental variables influenced by global climate change could affect contaminant toxicity involves direct effects of the variable on chemical characteristics. The toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), for example, can be photoactivated by solar UV radiation.91 The intensity and wavelength distribution of UV radiation, key factors in determining PAH phototoxicity, are likely to be affected by variables altered by climate change. For example, these variables could include decreases in pH that can increase water clarity, thereby increasing exposure of aquatic animals to UV radiation, and increased inputs of CDOM or particulate carbon to aquatic systems, which would effectively reduce UV penetration. Hence, specific influences of climate change on UV intensity in aquatic systems are likely to be site- and situation-specific. Although increased UV-B radiation can negatively affect the growth and viability of many organisms in aquatic food webs, sensitivity to UV radiation has the beneficial effect of disinfecting pathogens.1, 58, 144, 203 This process is facilitated by climate and UV-induced changes that alter exposure of surface-dwelling organisms through increased water transparency and stratification, and reduced ice and snow cover. For example, human pathogenic viruses, which are frequently found in rivers, lakes and drinking water, are sensitive to solar UV radiation203 and disinfection by solar UV irradiation (SODIS) is becoming a widely-used tool for purification of drinking water in developing countries.144 The observed increases in CDOM in aquatic environments can have opposing effects on pathogen levels. On the one hand, the increases in CDOM reduce UV exposure and thus disinfection by direct photoinactivation of parasites and pathogens. On the other hand, photoinactivation of pathogens can be enhanced through photosensitisation by CDOM.203 Inorganics: Mercury Mercury (Hg) is one of the inorganic priority pollutants and its biological availability and thus toxicity is strongly affected by solar UV radiation and climate change. Mercury is not an essential metal and is toxic at very low concentrations. Most mercury released to the atmosphere is in the form of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), which can be transported over long distances and is deposited mainly in the oxidised form as divalent mercury (HgII).40 In the oxidation process, the radicals BrO and Br, that are formed in UV-induced reactions, play a key role.171 In addi tion, UV-induced re-reduction of HgII occurs in the troposphere, however, at a lower rate than Hg0 oxidation.40 Following deposition to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, HgII undergoes methylation yielding methylmercury (MeHg), the toxic form of mercury. In sunlit surface waters MeHg may undergo UV-induced decomposition, a process that is enhanced by DOM.243 C limate change may amplify effects of solar UV radiation on the biogeochemical cycling of mercury. For example, ocean warming increases the sea-air flux of Hg0.119 As a consequence, the rate Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 165 of oxidation of Hg0 to HgII (via UV-induced formation of reactive radicals, see above) can be expected to increase since the oxidation rate depends on the concentration of both reactive radicals and Hg0. Hence it is likely that the combined effects of ocean warming and solar UV radiation on the biogeochemical cycling of mercury result in increased formation of the toxic form of mercury. Nanomaterials In addition to organic contaminants and mercury, new chemicals are coming into global markets that require initial assessment. Inorganic and organic engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and their composites with polymers and coatings (also see Chapter 7) are being introduced into the environment through widespread use in consumer products. Concerns about their health and safety have stimulated research on their persistence and toxicity. UV-induced photoreactions are important environmental processes for ENMs such as nanosilver, nano-titanium dioxide, fullerenes, carbon oxide. These photoreactions are sensitised by tDOM in some cases. For exa mple, nanosilver can be readily formed by the tDOM-induced photoreduction of ionic silver,2, 95 a sunl ight-induced process helps reverse toxicity associated with oxidation of nanosilver. UV- induced processes initiate the environmental release of ENMs from polymer nanocomposites by photodegradation of the polymer matrix.114 Gaps in knowledge Our understanding of the interacting effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen and halogen compounds, essential and toxic metals, and on the fate of organic pollutants has increased in the four years since our last assessment. However, there remain important gaps in knowledge. For example, climate models generally do not include effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles. To do this would be important for predicting trends in the net CO 2 sink strength of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are currently net CO 2 sinks on a global average, where the CO 2 uptake corresponds to ca 30% and 25%, respectively, of anthropogenic CO 2 emission.9, 33 However, the CO 2 sink strength of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may decrease due to climate change123, 124, 146 and interactions between solar UV radiation and climate change could accelerate this decline. Based on a biogeochemical elemental cycling model (without taking into account effects of solar UV radiation), Laufkoetter et al.123 simulated a decrease in phytoplankton net primary production by 6.5% within 50 years (1960-2006) on a global average, due to various climate-change related factors, including ocean stratification. A decrease in net primary production by phytoplankton is likely to reduce the efficiency of the biological pump and thus the CO 2 sink strength of aquatic ecosystems. Even without a decrease in the global CO 2 sink strength of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; their capacity to take up CO 2 does not keep pace with increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations.9, 116, 185 A s discussed earlier, an important effect of solar UV-radiation in aquatic ecosystems is photobleaching of CDOM, resulting in increased transmission of the damaging solar UV- B radiation into water bodies with negative effects on photosynthetic organisms (organisms such as phytoplankton that transform CO 2 into organic matter). The enhancement of UV-induced bleaching of CDOM due to stratification of water bodies therefore represents a UV-mediated, positive feedback on climate. In terrestrial ecosystems a positive feedback on climate is increased UV-induced decomposition and mineralisation of above ground litter (under release of CO 2) due to aridification and decreased plant cover from human activity. Important greenhouse gases other than CO 2 are nitrous oxide (N 2O) and methane (CH 4). Climate change, via changing precipitation and temperature distributions and extreme events, can Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on biogeochemical cycling The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 166 have large impacts on the emission of these gases. For example, N 2O and CH 4 emissions from plants may be increased through temperature effects, indirectly due to rising CO 2 levels. UV-induced inhibition of microbial processes in aquatic systems can also influence trace gas exchange such as CO and N 2O to air. Interactions in atmospheric chemistry also exist via UV-induced reactions involving N2O resulting in the formation of ozone destroying compounds. Halocarbons such as methyl bromide (CH 3Br), which are emitted by phytoplankton, are other gases that undergo UV-induced transformations to highly reactive species and thus also have the potential to cause stratospheric ozone depletion. Changes in oceanic phytoplankton distributions and community structure due to climate change is expected to alter rates of emission of these trace gases. Highly reactive species formed in UV-induced transformations of halocarbons also react with tropospheric pollutants, e.g., gaseous elemental mercury yielding the precursor of the bioavailable and thus toxic form of mercury. While there exists a large body of literature on the effects of climate change or of solar UV radiation on the fate of mercury, the interactive effects of climate change and solar UV radiation on the biogeochemical cycling of mercury have, to our knowledge, not yet been extensively studied. Levels of organic pollutants and pathogens in aquatic environments are affected by intera ctions with changing climate and solar UV radiation. For example, UV radiation can inactivate pathogenic viruses by direct pathways and also by indirect pathways that involve sensitisation by CDOM. CDOM, a climate-sensitive component of most aquatic environments, can also modulate pathogen levels by screening out the UV component of sunlight. The combined effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles are likely to be particularly pronounced in the Arctic due to Arctic Amplification that also hinders the recovery of the stratospheric ozone concentration in Arctic spring. As a consequence of Arctic stratospheric ozone depletion, increased levels of solar UV radiation reach Artic terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Negative effects of solar UV-B radiation on phytoplankton and thus on the biological pump are expected in ice-free Arctic marine regions, particularly in combination with stratification due to increasing melt-water input. Based on a radiation transfer model, Fountoulakis et al.60 predict that up to 10 times higher levels of solar UV irradiance will enter large parts of the Arctic Ocean by 2100, compared to the 1950s, mainly due to Arctic sea-ice melting. Furthermore, increased emissions of CO 2 via mineralisation of organic matter due to thawing permafrost and Arctic tundra wildfires as well as decreased albedo due to vegetation shifts,165 have large effects on carbon cycling in the Arctic219 and together can act as a positive feedback on global warming. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to Arctic tipping points.

Recent analyses support earlier work showing that poor outdoor air quality is a major environmental hazard as well as quantifying health effects on regional and global scales more accurately. Greater exposures to these pollutants have been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in humans and are associated globally with several million premature deaths per year. Ozone also has adverse effects on yields of crops, leading to loss of billions of US dollars each year. These detrimental effects also may alter biological diversity and affect the function of natural ecosystems. Future air quality will depend mostly on changes in emission of pollutants and their precursors, but changes in UV radiation and climate will contribute as well. Significant reductions in emissions, mainly from the energy and transportation sectors, have already led to improved air quality in many locations. Air quality will continue to improve in those cities/states that can afford controls, and worsen where the regulatory infrastructure is not available. Future changes in UV radiation and climate will alter the rates of formation of ground-level ozone and photochemically-generated particulate matter and must be considered in predictions of air quality. The decrease in UV radiation associated with recovery of stratospheric ozone will, according to recent global atmospheric model simulations, lead to increases in ground-level ozone at most locations. If correct, this will add significantly to future ground-level ozone trends. However, the spatial resolution of these global models is insufficient to inform policy at this time, especially for urban areas. UV radiation affects the atmospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals, OH, which are responsible for the self-cleaning of the atmosphere. Recent measurements confirm that, on a local scale, OH radicals respond rapidly to changes in UV radiation. However, on large (global) scales, models differ in their predictions by nearly a factor of two, with consequent uncertainties for estimating the atmospheric lifetime and concentrations of key greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Projections of future climate need to consider these uncertainties. No new negative environmental effects of the substitutes for the ozone depleting substances or their breakdown-products have been identified. However, some substitutes for the ozone depleting Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 180 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 substances will continue to contribute to global climate change if concentrations rise above current levels. Introduction The degradation of air quality is one of the major environmental hazards facing modern society. Human activities result in the emission of many chemicals to the atmosphere, which are either toxic themselves, or produce noxious compounds when exposed to ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation is an essential driver for the generation of ground -level ozone (O 3) and some particulate matter (PM, frequently called aerosol) including sul fate, nitrate, and organic aerosols . These pollutants have major health implications for humans and the environment . Future changes in tropospheric UV radiation, whether from stratospheric ozone changes or other factors such as clouds, are likely to contribute to trends in air quality and associated health effects . U V radiation makes hydroxyl (OH) radicals, the so-called cleaning agents of the troposphere. These radicals limit the atmospheric lifetime of many gases that are important to both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry as well as climate change, including methane (CH 4), hydrogen-containing halocarbons (e.g., hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrobromocarbons), and the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen (SO 2 and NOx ) . This paper provides an assessment of how UV radiation affects air quality, particularly ground-level O 3 and PM, in the context of the growing body of knowledge on their health impacts, geographic distributions, and long-term trends. It should be recognised that many factors drive these trends, including changes in both natural and anthropogenic emissions, as well as climate variability through changes in temperature, moisture, and atmospheric circulation patterns. Tropospheric UV radiation is one of these factors, and its effects can be approximately superimposed onto the effects of the other factors, but complex non-linear interactions must be considered to obtain reliable estimates. Since the previous assessment of the interactions between ozone depletion, climate change, and air-quality in the troposphere,135, 139 significant advances are noted in: (i) Understanding and quantifying the important consequences of poor air quality for human health, separating the effects of O3 and PM. (ii) Understanding changes in air pollution on urban and regional scales, in terms of changes in anthropogenic emissions (increases or decreases, depending on location) as well as long- range transport. (iii) Understanding long-term changes of key tropospheric oxidants (O 3 and OH) on continental and global scales, as anthropogenic emissions continue in an environment where both stratospheric ozone and climate are also changing. An equally important advance is a better understanding of uncertainties inherent in numerical models used to predict the future chemical composition of the atmosphere. These computer models endeavor to represent and integrate the many chemical, physical, and biological processes that control air quality as well as climate. Recent inter-comparisons among the models (see below ) highlight important differences that cast some doubt on the reliability of future projections, while also indicating the path to model improvements. Ozone-depleting substances could also affect air quality. While the long-lived chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs ) break down almost exclusively in the stratosphere, the halogenated replacements break down in the troposphere. The cycling of the halogenated species in the troposphere needs to be assessed to ensure that there are no other significant short- and long-term effects that will result from the replacements for the halocarbons. Health effects could result from exposures to these substances, and are therefore included in this assessment (previously this was included in the health assessment which now focuses on UV-mediated effects). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 181 This paper provides summaries of the state of knowledge on ground-level O 3, PM, and OH radicals, and addresses some of the more complex but still largely unquantified interactions between air quality, climate change, and human activities. An important additional interaction between air quality and stratospheric ozone depletion is the introduction of substitute compounds for ozone- depleting substances (ODS) pursuant to international agreements. The last part of this paper provides an update on selected substitutes whose potential environmental and health impacts should be considered. In summary, our assessment updates and reinforces several key conclusions. Air pollution is increasingly recognised as a major environmental hazard and a risk to human health, globally leading to several million premature deaths per year. Air pollution also damages vegetation and reduces agricultural yields, with associated economic losses estimated as $10-20 billion annually. UV radiation is an essential ingredient for the formation of ground-level O 3 and some PM, and of OH radicals that control the global self-cleaning capacity of the troposphere. Future trends in UV radiation will modulate future trends in air quality. Air quality is sensitive to other changes in the environment including atmospheric circulation, hydrological cycles, and temperatures, all of which are likely to change due to the combined effects of changing stratospheric ozone and climate. No new negative environmental effects of the substitutes for the ODS s have been identified. Ground-level ozone Health effects Tropospheric O 3 has significant effects on human morbidity and mortali ty. Premature mortality has been estimated in recent studies summarised in Tab le 1. Ozone and particulate matter (PM) often co- occur in the troposphere and therefore their effects on human health are difficult to separate. However, there appears to be no interaction between these in terms of premature mortality. Earlier epidemiological studies ( reviewed in 7) have supported this conclusion and further studies by the same authors5, 6 on the individual components of PM have shown that there is no interaction between these and ozone. Thus for the purposes of protecting human health, PM and O 3 can be treated separately. Premature mortality associated with exposure to ground-level ozone, while lower than that from PM, is still substantial with several hundred thousand people affected globally each year (Table 1). Recent studies are broadly consistent on effects of ozone o n mortality in humans from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Oporto, Portugal,30 Taipei,54 and Prague.55, 78 Table 1 Premature mortality from ground-level ozone (O 3) and particulate matter (PM) Premature mortality, millions per year Source Year Area From O 3 From PM OECD99 2010 Global 0.35 1.4 2050 Global 0.75 3.6 Lim et al.78 2010 Global 0.05-0.27 2.8-3.6 Fang et al.35 2000 Global 2005 US only 0.005 0.05-0.2 Ozone-related morbidities dermatitis,71 appendicitis,64 venous thromboembolic disease, and pulmonary embolisms29 have been Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 182 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 reported. Ozone may also interact synergistically with viral infections. A study in Hong Kong reported interactive effects between viral infections and concentration of O 3 that resulted in increased risks for hospitalisation for respiratory disease.151 The mechanism for this apparent synergism was not reported. A number of studies have extrapolated the effects of exposure to O 3 into the future. Based on the OECD99 study, premature deaths from ground-level ozone will increase to about 0.75 million per year worldwide by 2050. The greatest increases are predicted in India (130 premature deaths per million per decade by 2050) but those in OECD countries will be almost as large (95 premature deaths per million per decade by 2050), mostly as a result of greater sensitivity in an ageing population.99 Modelling of the interactions between concentrations of tropospheric ozone, precursors of ozone in the atmosphere, and climate change suggests that, by 2050, concentrations of O 3 will increase in developing countries and decrease in developed countries,72 due to regional differences in future emissions. Effects on plants For plants, the most important air-pollutant is O 3118, 148; particulates have not been observed to have substantial direct effects on plants. In our previous assessment,135 we noted that damage to crops by air-pollutants is likely to become more severe in the future. Since the last assessment, further studies have reinforced this conclusion. Based on a scenario of a world population of 9.1 billion, concentration of CO 2 of 550 ppm1, a concentration of ozone of 60 ppb (about 10 ppb above current), and the climate warmer by ca. 2\u00b0C by 2050, Jaggard et al.59 postulated that yields of major crops (e.g., wheat, rice, soy, and maize) may be reduced by about 5% because of O 3. However, this would be compensated by an increase in yield for most crops by about 13% because of the increased concentrations of CO 2, depending on water availability. In a review of studies on the effects of O 3 on plants, it was concluded that reductions in the yields of 18 to 27% result from exposures to O 3 at concentrations of 70 to 100 ppb, at the upper end of t ypical regional concentrations.74 Not all crops are equally sensitive to ozone. In a sensitive crop, such as soybean, yields in several cultivars were shown to decrease by as much as a factor of 2 with long-term exposure to 20-30 ppb (24 h our mean) of added ozone. 10 Reductions in photosynthesis upon exposure to O 3 were estimated in three different forest types and found to be statistically significant for an orange orchard, and observable for ponderosa pine.37 The potential for damage from O 3 in crop plants was assessed in relation to the IPCC (pessimistic) A2 scenario56 for 2100.2 Changes in gross plant productivity resulting from changes in tropospheric O 3 were projected to range from -40 to +15%, depending on location ( Fig. 1). In another example, the ranges of global crop losses for wheat and soybean in 2030 as estimated from the IPCC A2 scenario were 5.4-26% and 15- 19%, respectively.8 In this same study, yield reductions in the B1 (optimistic) scenario were 4.0- 17% for wheat and 9.5-15% for soybean, with monetised annual losses estimated to range from $12- 21 billion (year 2000 dollar equivalents). Although most of the research on the effects of O 3 in ecosystems has been directed toward plants, effects on soil microorganisms have also been reported.38 The abundance and diversity of methanogenic bacteria in soils of rice paddies were found to be reduced after exposure to elevated concentrations of O 3 (60 ppb) in ground-level air. 1 A ppm of X, parts per million, is a mixing ratio of 1 molecule of X per million molecules of air. Similarly, ppb is parts per billion. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 183 Overall, productivity and yields of crops will likely be reduced as a result of increases in concentrations of tropospheric O 3. There is some hope that genetic selection of plants tolerant to O 3 will mitigate these adverse effects on production of food and fibre but other plants in the ecosystem are likely to suffer greater adverse effects. These are expected to impact diversity and functions of natural ecosystems. Other effects of climate change, e.g., mediated by temperature and precipitation, will also affect yields of crop s. Photochemical processes Atmospheric ozone (O 3) is generated primarily in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions involving UV radiation. In the stratosphere, it is made directly by the photo-dissociation of molecular oxygen (O 2) into two oxygen atoms (2O), followed by the association of each of these atoms with remaining O 2 (see Table 2) to make two O 3 molecules. In the troposphere, this direct formation is not possible because photons of sufficient energy to dissociate O 2 ( <240 nm) are nearly completely absorbed by stratospheric O 2, and so are not available in the troposphere. Descent of stratospheric ozone to the troposphere does occur (e.g., during stratospheric intrusions common during springtime at mid-latitudes) but accounts for only about 1/10th of the tropospheric production in global models,155 and is only a minor source of ozone found near the surface in polluted regions. Formation of O 3 in polluted urban atmospheres has been recognised since the 1950s 44, and occurs when mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) are exposed to the UV radiation available in the troposphere. The chemistry leading to tropospheric O3 formation is generally complex because it (i) requires the absorption of multiple photons, ( ii) is augmented by several catalytic cycles, and ( iii) can be fueled by many different VOCs, including those of anthropogenic and biogenic origin. Table 2 provides a highly simplified schematic of the major chemical pathways. The production of tropospheric O 3 is autocatalytic because photolysis of an initial amount of O 3 (Table 2, reactions 3 and 4) results in two OH radicals, each of which can then continue through the reaction sequence to regenerate more O 3. Note that two photons are Fig. 1 Global assessment of the projected percentage changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) due to O 3 under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario in 2100 within the World Wildlife Foundation Global 200 priority conservation areas.

It is also very sensitive to the overhead ozone column (see Table 1 of McKenzie et al.90). Other sources of radicals include the photolysis of formaldehyde (CH 2O), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), and nitrous acid (HONO). These latter compounds are typically the products of previous chemical reactions initiated by O 3 and OH and so they are sensitive to the production of primary radicals (Table 2, reaction 3) and therefore to UV-B radiation as affected by changes in stratospheric ozone. Distributions and trends Tropospheric ozone has increased since preindustrial times, mostly because of increasing anthropogenic emissions of the precursor gases, VOCs and NOx. Relative to that, the effects of changing the UV radiation environment, e.g., from mid-latitude stratospheric ozone depletion, have been smaller but remain important due to the very large number of people living in areas with poor air quality. Urban ozone trends differ in different cities. Considerable progress has been made in reducing urban O 3 in Europe, the United States, and some other locations.22, 103, 149, 160 Fig. 2 shows the reductions in ground level ozone achieved in Los Angeles and Mexico City over the past several decades. In Beijing, from 2005 to 2011, ground-based measurements give daytime average O 3 increasing at 2.6 ppb (5%) per year.159 In comparison, increases of 3% per year over 2002-2010 have been reported for the tropospheric O 3 column above Beijing.146 Other Asian cities showing increases include Hong Kong (0.55 ppb per year over 1994-2007), Seoul (about 5 ppb over 1991-2007), and Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 185 Tokyo with a doubling of days with O 3 exceedances (incidences where air quality standards are exceeded ).160 Regional ozone (ozone averaged over large areas extending well beyond cities) is increasing at some locations, particularly in densely populated areas, for example 6-7% per decade in the Indo-Gangetic Plains.70 Regional production of ozone was also shown to be a factor limiting air quality improvements from local emission reductions during the Beijing Olympics.145 Background ozone continues to increase at many locations, such as central and northwestern Europe, but is decreasing in eastern and southwestern Europe.22, 149 Increases of 0.25 ppb/y ear have been reported for ground-level ozone at Mace Head, Ireland.32 In the western U.S., mid-tropospheric (3-10 km) ozone has increased by 0.6 ppb/year in the springtime over 1995-2008, and may be indicative of long range transport.24 Changes in the seasonal cy cle observed at various mid-latitude locations in the Northern Hemisphere are consistent with increasing emissions of precursors.104 On the other hand, a review of measurements made with balloon-borne instruments (ozone sondes) and surface observations at remote locations showed that most of the increases in both hemispheres occurred in the early part of the 20-40 year record, with more recent changes characterised by little or no increase.100 Changes in atmospheric circulation are also likely to have affected trends of tropospheric ozone. Some increases may have been due to changes in the rate of stratosphere-troposphere air exchange.48 Trends at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, were influenced by changes in circulation due to El Ni\u00f1o , transporting air masses from different regions of Asia to Hawaii.79 Prediction of tropospheric concentrations of O 3 via numerical models remains problematic, with large differences at regional22 and global scales.131, 155 This is illustrated in Fig . 3, where several global models, represented by different lines, are seen to differ by as much as 25% for current conditions, and future predictions show a wider range depending on the choice of future scenario as well as model. However, it should be noted that future photochemical ozone formation will in any case depend to a large extent on details of future emissions, particularly those associated with different fuel choices (e.g., diesel, gasoline, or biofuels). The specific response of tropospheric O 3 to future changes in stratospheric O 3 was modeled by Zeng et al.157 and Zhang et al.158, with both studies showing large-scale increases in tropospheric O3, as a net result of slowing both production and loss in response to declining UV levels. However the low resolution of their models (several degrees latitude x longitude) is insufficient to discern urban effects where higher levels of NOx are expected to maintain an opposite (positive) relationship between UV radiation and ground-level ozone80, 136 that would indicate improvement in air quality in response to recovery of stratospheric ozone. Global models also do not agree well with measurements of the background atmosphere, (e.g.,105) indicating that there is still significant work to be done in understanding this chemistry. These uncertainties make it difficult to identify precisely which g eographic regions will experience decreases in tropospheric ozone as stratospheric ozone recovers, Fig. 2 Improvem ents in air quality in Los Angeles and Mexico City.

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 186 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 and which ones will suffer increases. Nevertheless, all models agree that over large regions tropospheric ozone will increase. Nitrogen dioxide The near-term outlook for tropospheric oxidants can also be surmised from satellite measurements of NO 2 (see Fig. 4) a precursor of tropospheric ozone and an important pollutant in its own right. The geographic distribution agrees with the general understanding of major emission sources, particularly over the U.S., Europe, and East Asia. Trends, also derived from satellite-based observations, are shown in the lower panel for specific regions. Notably, decreases in NO 2 are seen to have occurred over the U.S. and Europe, in accordance with NOx emission reduction policies, and consistent with the reductions in urban ozone reported for these regions. However, positive trends are noted for east-central China, the Middle East, and north-central India. It seems likely that such recent trends will also continue into the near-term future, with the associated expectation that ground-level ozone (and other photochemical pollutants) may increase in some areas and decrease in others. Particulate matter Particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere consists of small solid or liquid particles suspended in air, also called aerosols . The size of PM is recognised as important for health effects, with PM smaller than 2.5 m (termed PM2.5) being inhaled deeper into lungs than larger particles, typically measured as all particles below 10 m (PM10). Health effects Particulate matter in the troposphere causes significant adverse health effects. A large body of literature spanning decades of research has been reviewed and assessed confirming this causal relationship (e.g.,142). Table 1 shows recent estimates of premature deaths from particulate matter . Recent studies have reported PM health effects from Fig. 4 Tropospheric vertical column of nitrogen dioxide, a major air pollutant and precursor of tropospheric ozone.

Drawn from data in Table 1 of Young et al.155. Thin lines are for individual model results, thick lines are multi -model av erages, for two scenarios of future emissions, RCP2.6 (green) and RCP8.5 (red), as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.57 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 187 different locations. In the time-series analysis of hospitalisations for venous thromboembolic disease in Chile between 2000 and 2007 discussed for ozone above, an increase in concentration of PM2.5 of 20 g m-3 resulted in a relative risk (RR) of 1.05 (95% CI 1.03-1.06) for all hospitalisations.29 A si milar RR was observed for pulmonary embolism. In a study of 90 cities in China over 1981-2000, those north of the river Huai had total suspended particulates (PM of all sizes) higher by 100 g m-3 (95% CI = 61-307) than those south of the river, and were associated with a decrease in life- expectancy of 3 years (95% CI 0.4-5.6 ).21 Much of PM2.5 is due to particles generated in the atm osphere by UV-dependent photochemistry (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, and organics, see below) , although other PM sources can be extremely important, e.g., biomass burning plumes reaching densely populated urban areas (e.g., van Donkelaar et al.143). Where control o f emissions into the troposphere has resulted in decreases in PM2.5, fewer health effects have been observed. In a study of life expectancy in 545 U.S. counties, reductions in PM2.5 of 10 g m-3 from 2000 to 2007 were associated with an increase in mean life expectancy of 0.35 years (SD = 0.16 years ).25 Overall, the global relevance of particulates to human health is very large, and substantial changes are expected to occur in response to changes in climate.129 Future predictions are uncertain due to limitations of atmospheric models and their assumptions110 and specifically for human health effects, the difficulty to clearly separate effects of O 3 and PM2.5.111. Future changes in aerosols are uncertain but may be substantial regionally. A multi-model analysis of past and future trends in aerosol, described in Fig. 8 in Chapter 1, indicates large changes in industrialised regions, particularly in China. Effects on plants Direct effects of PM on plants appear to be minor, for example by direct deposition of PM on foliage.142 However, two important indirect effects should be recognised. The first is an increase in diffuse visible radiation from the scattering of solar photons by aerosol particles, altering photosynthetic efficiency within partly shaded canopies. The second is the surface deposition of some aerosol chemicals, for example, the heavy metals Cu, Ni, and Zn, with potential effects on soil chemistry, microbial communities, and nutrient cycling.142 Atmospheric processes Particles in the atmosphere include those emitted directly, such as wind-blown dust and soil , combustion -generated soot (black carbon), and salt from sea-spray, as well as those formed in-situ by condensation of vapours , such as sulfates, nitrates, and many organics. The latter, secondary, aerosols depend on UV-initiated reactions of OH radicals (see section on Global OH models), and thus are likely to be affected by changes in stratospheric ozone. However, we note the absence of specific studies addressing how changes in UV associated with stratospheric O 3 would affect the formation and removal of tropospheric particles. The formation of sulfate and nitrate aerosols is well understood, in terms of the OH oxidation of SO 2 and NO 2 giving sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. While the majority of this production occurs in the gas phase, the sulfate and nitrate condense rapidly to form particles, particularly if ammonia is present. Chemical reactions in cloud and rain water can also contribute.122 Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which previous observations had shown to be seriously underestimated by models. While many details remain poorly understood, numerous studies support the basic conceptual model that hydrocarbons are oxidised (by OH and NO 3 radicals, and O 3) into a myriad of heavier more functionalised molecules as well as smaller fragments.12 Molecules with multiple functional groups Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 188 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 (e.g., alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, organic acids, nitrates and peroxides) typically have lower vapour pressures and therefore are likely to condense onto particles. However, quantification remains a problem due to the large number of chemical species contributing to particle mass. Significant advances in modelling have been made by classifying these multifunctional compounds according to relevant properties, such as vapour pressure,33, 61 solubility,50 oxidation state,68 atomic ratios (O, C, H, etc.),18, 46 and carbon number and polarity.102 In practice, for ambient aerosols many of these properties are not known and therefore cannot be used to constrain predictions. However, these modelling frameworks now allow exploratory sensitivity analyses to help identify the most important processes for more accurate parameterisation. Removal of aerosols from the atmosphere is poorly understood. Ultimate ly removal from the atmosphere occurs by wet or dry deposition. Incorporation of aerosol particles into raindrops (wet deposition) leads to lifetimes estimated to range from 0.5 to 2 weeks.26, 27, 67 Dry deposition of particles is generally slow er.122, 156 Distributions and trends The g lobal distribution of aerosols is shown in Fig. 5. Satellite observations and models agree on broad features, including the dust belt extending from N. Africa to S. Asia, biomass burning evident over tropical S. America, and high values over E. Asia. These optical depth values represent the entire aerosol vertical column and not necessarily those at ground level. Surface network data are available in many countries and ha ve been used to show detail ed geographical and seasonal distributions of major chemical constituents of collected particles (e.g., 45 for the U.S.). Heavi ly populated urban locations are of special interest, and some recently reported measurements in megacities are summarised in Table 3. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines are frequently exceeded by all cities listed. Reductions in PM concentrations are occurring in many cities, in some cases well-documented by long-term urban monitoring networks, and evidently related to emissions-lowering technologies for both fixed and mobile sources. However, measurements at many polluted locations are still sparse, making an assessment of trend difficult. Future concentrations of aerosols are subject to similar scenario assumptions as other pollutants.3, 123, 126 Organic and black carbon are expected to continue to increase over the next few decades globally, but then Fig. 5 Annual average aerosol optical depth at 550 nm from the MODIS and MISR satellite instruments (top and bottom, for the years 2004 -2006) and models (middle, for the year 2000). From Schindell et al.123 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 189 decrease, with timing and magnitude depending on the specific scenario. Organic and black carbon are expected to continue to increase over the next few decades globally, but then decrease with the timing and magnitude, depending on the scenario. On smaller geographic scales, aerosol concentrations are sensitive to local and regional emissions, and may improve or worsen depending on regulatory strategies. For example, a multi - model analysis of past and future trends in aerosols, described in Fig. 8 Chapter 1 , shows strong regional reductions of aerosol concentrations by 2090, particularly in China.

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 190 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Hydroxyl radicals Tropospheric self-cleaning capacity An important role of UV radiation in the troposphere is the production of OH radicals by photolysis of tropospheric ozone (Reaction 3 in Table 2) followed by reaction with H 2O (Reaction 4, Table 2). The OH radicals react with many of the gases emitted at the Earth's surface, including carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen and sulfur (NO 2 and SO 2), and hydrohalocarbons (HFCs and HCFCs). The reactions with OH determine the atmospheric residence time of the se gases, as well as their amount in the atmosphere since this is directly proportional to the product of emission rates and lifetime. Understanding OH is fundamental to understanding the chemistry of ozone and secondary aerosols, as well. Cycling between OH and HO 2 (Reactions 5 and 6, Table 2) is essential for tropospheric ozone formation. Notably, OH itself has a lifetime of only seconds, but it affects O 3 on the time scale of hours to days, CO over months, and methane over a decade. For this reason, direct detection of OH has focused on local short-term measurements, while longer-term impacts, for example, on methane lifetimes, have been estimated from global models. Local measu rements of OH Direc t measurements of OH are difficult because of its high chemical reactivity. Within seconds of being produced, OH reacts with various gases (see previous paragraph) limiting its concentration to low values (about 106 - 107 molec cm-3 during daytime, smaller at night) that are exceedingly difficult to detect and quantify. The high reactivity also implies that OH has high spatial and temporal fluctuations, being sensitive to variations in production (e.g., to variations in UV radiation, O 3, and H2O) as well as loss (e.g., via reactions with CO, NOx, or VOCs). For this reason, it is important to note that locally measured OH concentrations cannot be easily integrated spatially or temporally to estimate, for example, an annually averaged global OH concentration. The main objective of direct local measurements is to evaluate whether the variations in OH follow the expected variations in simultaneously measured meteorological (UV radiation, humidity) and chemical variables (O3, NOx, VOCs, etc.). Several techniques have been developed over the past few decades to detect and measu re concentrations of OH. Measurements have been reviewed by Heard and Pilling47 and more recently by Stone et al.133. Most of the recent measurements are consistent with model calculations within a factor of approximately two, (e.g., urban locations including New York City,115 Tokyo,63 Mexico City,34, 76 and Houston20). Studies in forested locations, specifically West Africa132 and northern Michigan43 also show reasonable agreement with models. M easured OH is much greater, by as much as an order of magnitude, than predicted by models in environments containing high concentrations of biogenic hydrocarbons (e.g., isoprene, methyl butenol, and terpenes) and low concentrations of NOx, including over the tropical forest of Suriname,69, 75, 88 Borneo,112, 147 the Pearl River Delta (PRD),51, 82 and suburban Beijing during low- NOx episodes.83 This apparent underestimation of OH by models has led to a re-examination of the chemistry of isoprene at low NOx, and to the suggestion that at least part of the OH initially lost by reaction with isoprene is later regenerated by secondary reactions.107, 108 Simulations using an env ironmental smog chamber also indicate the need for some recycling of OH by isoprene chemistry under very low NOx conditions, although not to an extent that would explain the large discrepancies between observations and models found over tropical Suriname.41 Several intercomparisons between different OH instruments show good agreement in some circumstances but also disagreement in others.40, 116, 120, 133 The largest discrepancies appear to occur Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 191 in environments dominated by biogenic hydrocarbons. For example, Mao et al. 85 found a factor of two difference between laser-induced fluorescen ce and a chemical analysis methods at Blodget Forest, California. Instruments have been developed recently to measure the total OH reactivity, i.e. the rate at which OH molecules are removed by reaction with the many constituents of sampled air (e.g., CO, VOCs, and NOx). The reactivity of OH provides an important constraint on the budget of OH since it must essentially balance the rate of production. Measurements show that this reactivity is larger than predicted from the simple sum of typically known constituents, indicating the presence of substantial but unmeasured amounts of other reactive compounds, by values ranging from 25-35% in Tokyo,154 about 30% in a terpene-rich mid-latitude forest,95 a factor of 2 in the Pearl River Delta81 and 60-90% in a boreal forest.97, 125 The missing compounds are presumed to be a multitude of partly oxygenated organic compounds (aldehydes, ketones, etc.) formed during the OH-initiated photo- degradation of VOCs. Despite unresolved differences among various OH instruments and models, some fundamental aspects of the photo-chemistry have been clearly demonstrated. Important in the present context is the theoretical expectation that, for relatively clean conditions, concentrations of OH should scale more or less linearly with the photolysis of O 3 to generate O* (Reaction 3, Table 2), j(O3), which in turn is dependent on the amount of UV radiation. This linear correlation has now been re-confirmed by direct measurements of OH and j(O3) over a year at Mace Head, Ireland9 and is in agreement with earlier observations in the tropical Atlantic14 and in the European Alps.117 Because tropospheric j(O3) values are sensitive to the overhead ozone column, with a ~1.5% increase in j(O3) for each 1% decrease in the O 3 column (see Table 1 of McKenzie et al., 90), these studies reaffirm the importance of stratospheric ozone to tropospheric OH and to the photochemistry of the lower atmosphere. Global OH models Estimat es of long-term changes in global OH are uncertain and variable. Empirical estimates, based on the measured concentrations of trace gases, such as methyl chloroform, whose emissions and OH kinetics are well known, are difficult due to large changes in emissions of suitable gases. An analysis of the decline in concentrations of methyl chloroform by Montzka et al.92 concluded that globally averaged OH varied by less than \u00b15% during 1997-2007. On the other hand, Monteil et al.91 interpreted measurements of methane isotopes (13C) to infer that the slowing of CH 4 trends in the early 2000s was due to increasing concentrations of OH, at about 5% per decade, due to global increases in NOx emissions. Thus, the direction and magnitude of recent trends in global OH remains unclear. Estimates over longer time scales are largely based on models, which differ significantly. This was demonstrated by the recent intercomparison of 16 global chemistry-transport models for predictions of the methane lifetime, which is limited by reaction with OH.94, 144. The modelled mean lifetime of methane was 8.6 \u00b1 1.2 years (range 6.4-11.6 years) for the year 2000. Pre-industrial (1850) to present day (2000) changes in OH were either positive or negative (see Fig. 6), depending largely on how each model specified relative changes in emissions of CO and NOx. Pike and Young109 showed that global concentrations of OH (and therefore the lifetime of CH 4) were sensitive to how models represent OH recycling by isoprene, which remains uncertain as discussed above. If such buffering of OH by biogenic VOCs is pervasive, it casts doubt on the strong sensitivities to anthropogenic emissions of CO and NOx shown in Fig. 6 for current models. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 192 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 An alternate approach to estimating changes in OH based on sulfate isotopic studies suggested a 10% decrease in global OH since the pre- industrial times,127 broadly in line with some of the models reported by Naik et al.94 However, the accuracy of this method remains untested. The multi-model mean changes in predicted OH concentrations at the surface, for the year 2100 and two different emission scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 have been calculated144 and are shown in Fig. 7. Substantial reductions in OH are expected throughout much of the southern hemisphere due to large increases in methane ( CH 4) in the RCP 8.5 scenario , while regional increases and decreases occur in both scenarios due to changes in shorter-lived precursors NOx and CO. Another model study focused on the recovery of stratospheric O 3 to 1980 levels (holding all other factors constant) predicted that global concentrations of OH will decrease by 1.7% due to the lower tropospheric UV radiation levels.158 Global models are also sensitive to climate change, including changes in temperature, humidity, stratospheric ozone, and uncertain NOx emissions from natural sources such as biomass burning and lightning.52, 62, 93 Thus, multi-model averages such as those shown in Fig. 7 do not truly reflect the model variability or actual uncertainties. However, i n clean marine atmospheres , concentrations of OH are well predicted by models ,11, 128 but other unidentified oxidants appear to be important.11 These other oxidants could be halogens. Clim ate-mediated changes in air quality Air pollution is a complex, multifaceted problem that can only be correctly considered when integrated within the whole Earth system. Direct emissions from human activities are well recognized, but emissions that would otherwise be considered natural can also change due to, for example, deforestation, biomass burning, and even feedbacks between air quality, climate change (especially the hydrological cycle), and ecosystem health. Atmospheric transport of pollutants and their precursors is subject to circulation patterns that are likely to change under a changing climate. In particular, changes in the frequency of stagnation episodes that limit the dispersion of pollutants may have large impacts on air quality in affected areas. Chemical transformations, e.g., those making ground-level O 3 from the photo-oxidation of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, are sensitive to climate variables including temperature and moisture, as well as UV radiation. Removal of pollutants occurs mainly via contact with the Earth's surfaces (dry deposition) or scavenging by precipitation (wet deposition). Both could change significantly in the future, e.g., changes in land-use altering rates of dry deposition, and changes in precipitation patterns modifying wet deposition rates. Fig. 6 Changes in globally averaged hydroxyl radicals ( OH) between pre -industrial times (1850) and present day (2000) calculated by 16 different models (model -mean for the year 2000 OH ~1.1x106 molec cm-3) for relative changes in emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) specified within each model (From Naik et al.94). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 193 Several potentially major interactions are discussed here. Many other feedbacks are possible and may be plausible but are not fully understood and cannot yet be quantified reliably. These are, by and large, outside the scope of the present assessment, except to the extent that we recognis e their existence and therefore provide a cautionary note that the general aspects of our assessment need to be evaluated carefully for any given location with full consideration of these additional factors. Ozone Concentrations of ozone in urban environments are determined by a number of key factors. Firstly, the amount of ozone in the air entering the urban environment may be important. Then, within the urban airshed, reactions involving a range of emitted chemicals, most notably VOC s and NOx, produce ozone as a result of UV-driven photochemistry. These chemicals arise from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources, the latter often being outside normal air quality management. Finally, a number of processes such as dry deposition (loss at the surface) might remove ozone from the atmosphere. Background ozone concentrations can be influenced by long-range air transport, and this is likely to be an important factor into the future, transporting air between continents.73 The background ozone concentrations can also be altered by changes in stratosphere/troposphere exchange and by the changes in global atmospheric composition, notably some greenhouse gases.93 By analysing the natural variability of stratospheric transport, it has been estimated that changes in stratospheric circulation due to climate change will lead to around a 2% increase in tropospheric ozone in the Fig. 7 (a) Annual average surface OH concentration, mean of 14 models, for the year 2000. (b) Model -mean % change in surface OH concentrations in 2100 relative to 2000, for the IPCC RCP 2.6 emission scenario; (c) same for RCP 8.5 scenarios (From Voulgarakis et al.144). Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 194 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 northern mid-latitudes by the end of this century.96 Although small, the significant geographic extent i mplies that this might be an additional factor affecting air quality. Increased temperatures at ground level are expected to increase biogenic emissions of reactive organics (e.g., refs60, 65). However, emissions may well depend on other factors as well, such as water stress on the plants.37 Indeed, changes in the climate, coupled to decreases in air quality, can substant ially alter biogenic activity in ways that are difficult to predict. Models suggest that other critical processes are also likely to be altered by climate change. Variations in cloudiness can alter the rate of photochemical production of ozone. Increased surface heating can result in changes in atmospheric movement (wind speed, both horizontal and vertical). Cloudiness can also be altered by human activity, with evidence that controls on air pollution have increased solar radiation at some locations.42 Finally changes in rainfall patterns and cloudiness can alter the rate of removal of both reactive precursors and ozone itself.72 Estimates predict increasing ozone concentrations at ground level throughout the 21st century, driven by all of these meteorological factors, which are regionally dependent. This can be offset by changes in emissions from human activity, which may either augment or reverse the overall trend, depending on the levels of controls implemented.23, 72 Significant regional air quality changes may result, even if only episodically.31 Particles The impact of climate change on aerosols remains highly uncertain. As mentioned above, increasing temperatures will increase biogenic gas emissions. The oxidation of these compounds will produce aerosols. Additional wild fires could become more important as a source of particulate matter.58 T hese aerosols can scatter radiation and reduce warming (a negative feedback), and also impact upon cloud properties.101 Changes in clouds in turn can alter the transformation (growth, chemistry) of aerosols in the atmosphere. In polluted environments the changes induced by climate will be overwhel med by anthropogenic emissions, but in locations where anthropogenic emissions are small these changes could be significant. However, the net effect of climate change on aerosols remains unclear.23, 58 While there has been a lot of work in this area (e.g., on climate/aerosol feedback models,19) the level of scientific understanding remains very low. Biological interactions between air-pollutants and climate change Increased ambient temperatures may interact directly or indirectly to exacerbate the effects of pollutants such as O 3 in humans. A study of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 2002 to 2006 in Buenos Aires showed a relative risk of 1.0184 (95% Confidence interval (CI) = 1.0139-1.0229) on the sam e day for each 1\u00b0C increase in temperature.1 Anoth er study in several large cities in the UK reported that temperature increased mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and other non-accidental causes.106 These authors also reported that the mean mortality rate ratio for O 3 was 1.003 (95% CI = 1.001-1.005) per 10 g m-3 increase in concentration. On hot days (greater than the whole-year 95th centile) this increased to 1.006 (95% CI = 1.002-1.009) but was only statistically significant for London. A study in older men in 2000 to 2008 in Boston showed that greater ambient temperature was associated with decreases in heart rate variability via dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.114 These warm-season associations were significantly greater when ambient ozone concentrations were above the median but were not affected by particulates (PM2.5). These studies are consistent with earlier analyses of the 2003 European heat wave episode39, 130 which attributed a significant fraction (20-60%) of excess mortality to the effects of elevated levels of O 3 and PM. Change in climate also may affect human health indirectly. A study on allergic respiratory diseases and bronchial asthma show ed that while exacerbation is related to air -pollutants, amounts of Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 195 allergen in the air are also important.28 The presence of allergenic pollens in the atmosphere might be prolonged by climate change and increase frequency and severity of these diseases. Halogenated organic and other substitutes in the troposphere Toxicity and risks of replacements for ozone depleting chemicals to humans and the environment The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has a regulatory process for evaluating alternatives for Ozone Depleting Substances ( ODS ) prior to their wide-spread use in the U.S. Anyone planning to market or produce a new substitute must provide 90-days advance notice to the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program at USE PA of their intent as well as providing health and safety information before introducing it into interstate commerce in the U.S. Normally the health and safety information will include information on chemical and physical properties, flammability and basic toxicological information, and more recently, global warming potential. The SNAP program reviews the information in the context of the proposed use, and issues one of 4 decisions: acceptable; acceptable subject to use conditions; acceptable subject to narrowed use limits; and unacceptable. This information on a particular compound is continually updated so that compounds may be proposed for additional uses or additional information may be added to the portfolio for a particular use that could change the initial decision. Updates on selected halocarbons Brominated substances. Natural bromo -carbons bromoform and dibromomethane are emitted from the oceans , and the ir emission strengths and role in the atmosphere are becoming better understood . These compounds release bromine upon oxidation in the atmosphere that is generally observed as bromine monoxide (BrO) . The presence of bromine can lead to depletion of ground level ozone .113 However, observations in other marine locations do not find such events occurring.86 In the tropics, where sources are believed to be the biggest and vertical motion is enhanced, it has been estimated that these compounds have a lifetime in the atmosphere of 1 to 3 weeks. However, even with this relatively short lifetime, over 90% of the bromine that is transported to the stratosphere comes from these species.53 Bromine monoxide (BrO) is also calculated to be a significant oxidant for dimethylsulfide (20%) in the clean marine environment of the southern hemisphere.15 This oxidation is a significant source of aerosol in this environment (nearly 20% of the total) and so has direct impacts upon cloud formation and light scattering, and hence climate. A large fraction of this BrO is derived from sea salt, and thus is an important part of the natural bromine background to which anthropogenic brominated organics are added. The overall significance of changes due to climate, as noted above, is not yet known. N -Propyl bromide (C3H7Br), or 1-bromopropane, was introduced in the early to mid-1990s as an intermediate in a variety of closed commercial manufacturing processes for products such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and quaternary ammonium compounds. From the mid-1990s, it began to be used a s a less toxic substitute for methylene chloride in open air uses such as vapour and immersion degreasing and cleaning of electronics and metals.98 In 2003, it was first proposed by the SNAP pr ogram as an acceptable alternative for CFC-113 and methyl chloroform in a limited number of specific applications where emissions could be tightly controlled for both environmental and exposure concerns. Specifically, these included use as a solvent in industrial equipment for metals, electronics, and precision cleaning and in aerosol solvents and adhesive end-uses. However, the final rule issued in 2007140 allowed use only as a solvent for industrial equipment; other uses such as aerosol solvents and adhesives are listed as unacceptable by the Agency. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 196 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 The SNAP program decisions were based on health data related to reproductive and neurological end-points for which they considered a work place standard of an 8-hour time-weight acceptable exposure limit (AEL) of 25 ppm to be acceptable.141 Subsequent to that information, reports have indicated that additional adverse effects have been added to the toxicological dossier for n-propyl bromide including immunotoxicity (significant decreases in a spe cific antibody) in rodents following 10 week inhalation exposures at levels of 125-500 ppm (mice) or (rat)4 and multi-site carcinogenicity two-year chronic inhalation exposures 250 or ppm in rats and mice.98 Chlorinated substances. Chloroform (CHCl 3) has a number of poorly known natural sources as well as anthropogenic sources .152 Peat bogs may be a large unrecognized natural source of chloroform (10% of the total).66, 124 Sources such as these are likely to be sensitive to both climate and land use change, and so represent an uncertainty in future predictions. Production and consumption of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) are regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Observations show that atmospheric CCl 4 mixing ratios are decreasing at a rate slower than expected from assumed phase-out schedules.77, 153 The sources and sinks of CCl 4, and their uncertainties, are beyond the scope of this paper, but it is probable that the slower decline is due to yet unidentified emissions. If such sources involve personal exposure, e.g., in solvent use, potential health effects may be anticipated.84 Chlorofluorinated Substances. Historically the first compounds developed as replacements for refrigerants, the largest sector where CFCs were used, were saturated hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and then saturated hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), both classes of compounds which because of their hydrogen content, were susceptible to attack from hydroxyl radials in the atmosphere resulting in shorter atmospheric lifetimes than CFCs. Readers are referred to earlier reports for a review about the human and environmental risks for many of these replacements. There is one compound in this category, trans-1-chloro,3,3,3- trifluoropropene (HCFO 1233zd(E)), which is just now being developed as a foam blowing agent, refrigerant, and solvent. A recent toxicology study138 reported that HCFO 1233zd(E) was not acutely toxic and was not associated with any genetic toxicity in a battery of tests. The compound had an acute 4-hour 50% lethal concentration value (LC 50) of 120,000 ppm in rats, and a no observed effect level (NOEL) in canine cardiac sensitization studies of 25,000 ppm. The heart was iden tified as the apparent target organ on the basis of his topathological observations from a 2 week range finding study in male and female rats exposed levels of 0, 2,000, 5,700 and 20,000 ppm 6 hours/day for 5 days/w eek, Males at the mid and high doses and females at the high dose developed multifocal mononuclear infiltrates of cardiac tissue. In a 12-week study at 4,000, 10,000 and 15,000 ppm, 6 hours/day for 5 days/w eek, a NOEL/lowest observed adverse effect level for multifocal mononuclear infiltrates of the heart was 4,000 ppm. In a full inhalation developmental toxicity study at concentrations of 0, 4,000, 10,000 and 150,000 ppm, HCFO 1233zd(E) was not associated with any effects on uterine, placental or fetal weights, nor were there any fetal abnormalities observed so that the study resulted in a NOEL for developmental toxicity of 15,000 ppm. Fluorinated substance s. Sulfuryl fluoride (SO 2F2) is a substitute for the ozone-depleting fumigant methyl bromide used on crops and soils. Several reports on its use in agriculture have been published recently13, 16, 17, 134 and it will likely become more widely used in the future. As previously stated,135 its atmospheric oxidation lifetime is estimated to be large (>300 years). However, SO 2F2 is relatively soluble in water and is expected to partition into cloud water and ultimately rain out of the atmosphere with a half-life of about 2 weeks. The major sink is the oceans where the ultimate breakdown Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 197 products are inorganic sulfate and fluoride. These breakdown products are not of concern for environment or health. However, SO 2F2 has a large global warming potential (GWP) and its use is likely to increase in the future, so that monitoring of concentrations in the atmosphere should continue. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs and HFCs): As has been discussed previously,135, 150 several of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used as substitutes for and a new fluorinated olefin ( (TFA) . TFA is stable in the environment but is water soluble and accumulates in playas, land-locked lakes, and the oceans where it combines with cations such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ( Na+, Ca++, the salts of TFA found in the oceans are naturally produced. These salts are inert and not of toxicological or environmental concern in the small concentrations ( 200 ng L-1) that are present in the oceans. Perfluoro-n-butyl iodide (PFBI) is a compound being investigated as a substitute for CFCs. Its use is being explored as a replacement in aircraft maintenance operations as an alternative cleaner for liquid and gaseous oxygen aerospace systems and as a wipe cleaner solvent. A recent publication89 summarised earlier preliminary toxicity testing results in which an acute inhalation of no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 3,900 ppm for cardiac sensitisation was established. Based on the results of a preliminary 4-week inhalation toxicity test, a 13-week inhalation study was conducted in which 15 male and 10 female rats per group were exposed by inhalation via nose-only exposure for 6 hours/day and 5 days/week to nominal concentrations of 500, 1,500, and 5,000 ppm PFBI. The 13- week inhalation exposure at 1,500 ppm was associated with increases in concentrations of thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone in serum of male and female rats. These concentrations returned to control values following the 4-week recovery period without exposure in males (the only animals given a recovery period). The authors noted that, based on published information, they assumed that the return to normal following the recovery period indicated that the hormonal changes were only transient and not adverse and that the changes in female rats would also return to normal. Thus the NOAEL was selected to be 1,500 ppm. The 3,900 ppm from the earlier work served as an occupational acute exposure limit for PFBI, while the 1,500 ppm NOAEL was converted to an occupational exposure limit (OEL) by adjusting it to an 8-hour/day time-weighted average exposure and applying uncertainty factors for animal to human, inter-human variability and subchronic to chronic extrapolation to arrive at a final value of 40 ppm. Modelling of susceptibility of the analogous compound (perfluoro-n-propyl iodide) to photolysis suggested a half-life of a few hours in sunlight. Based on rapid degradation, PFBI has zero GWP and is not an ODS. Its atmospheric degradation is likely to produce trifluoro acetic acid (TFA), analogously to many other fluorinated organics, e.g., some HCFCs and HFCs (see above). Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). Among the other new compounds being used as substitutes are those belonging to the class known as hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). Two examples currently being developed for use in the refrigeration, foam -blowing and/or aerosol sectors, recently been characteri sed toxicologically .119, 121, 137 In the case of HFO 1234ze, the compound was not acutely toxic at levels as high as 207,000 ppm following 4 hours of exposure and showed no activity in a battery of genetic toxicity tests. In addition, the compound did not induce cardiac sensitization at levels as high as 120,000. Following a 2 week range finding study at 5,000, 20,000 and 50,000 ppm 6 hours /day, 5 days/wee k, the liver and heart were identified as the target organs; however, in a subsequent 4 week study at 1000, 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000, and a 90 day study at 1,500, 5,000, and 15,000, only the heart was identified as the target organ. The associated finding was multifocal mononuclear cell Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on air quality 198 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 infiltrates with no evidence of fibrosis and no evidence of increase severity with increased duration of exposure. No new papers on the relevance of TFA to human health and the environment have been published in the literature since the date of the previous assessment (2010). Thus, projected future increased loadings of TFA to playas, land-locked lakes, and the oceans due to continued use of HCF Cs, HFCs, and replacement products are still judged to present negligible risks for aquatic organisms and humans. Gaps in knowledge A key air quality constituent is ozone, and any future changes in ozone have significant outcomes for both human and environmental health. However, the direction and the magnitude of change in tropospheric ozone due to recovery of stratospheric ozone are still under debate, may depend on location, and need to be better quantified. Modulation by UV radiation will modify the impacts of climate change and regulation of local emissions. This represents a significant gap in our understanding. Computer modelling now has the potential to address this issue, but still requires the development and refinement of parameterisations for physical and chemical processes, as well as future scenarios under different socio-economic assumptions. Particulate matter (aerosol) plays a significant role in climate change and also in air quality. While the role of UV radiation in PM formation is known, the sensitivity of PM properties to changes in UV radiation has not been sufficiently quantified. The oxidation capacity of the atmosphere remains poorly characterised in a number of environmentally sensitive regions, with an order of magnitude difference between measurements and models. Both measurements and our understanding of the key chemical processes have large uncertainties. One example of this lack of understanding is the uncertainty in future methane concentrations, with models predicting OH driven lifetimes that differ by a factor of 2.

Summary Materials used in exteriors of buildings and in construction are routinely exposed to solar UV radiation. Especially in the case of wood and plastic building materials, the service life is determined by their weather-induced deterioration. Any further increase in ground-level solar UV radiation, UV- B radiation in particular, will therefore reduce the outdoor service life of these products. Any increase in ambient temperature due to climate change will also have the same effect. However, the existin g light-stabilizer technologies are likely to be able to mitigate the additional damaging effects due to increased solar UV radiation and maintain the outdoor lifetimes of these materials at the present levels. These mitigation choices invariably increase the lifetime cost of these products. A reliable estimate of what this additional cost might be for different products is not available at the present time. Personal exposure to UV radiation is reduced both by clothing fabrics and glass windows used in buildings and automobiles. This assessment describes how the recent technical advances in degradation and stabilization techniques impact the lifetimes of plastics and wood products routinely exposed to solar UV radiation and the protection to humans offered by materials against solar UV radiation . Introduction Wood and plastics are used extensively as construction materials. Of the 280 million tons of plastics produced globally [2011 data], about 23% is used in building construction, the second largest market for plastics after packaging applications.120 Rigid poly(vinyl chloride) [rPVC ] is the dominant plastic used in building applications. Polymers are also used extensively in architectural and industrial coatings . Wood is used widely in building const ruction , o ften as the principal structural element . Annually, 1.8 billion m3 of industrial roundwood [all industria l wood in the rough] is harvested worldw ide. Materials for construction used in exterior applications require long -term durability that is delivered by stabilized plasti cs and coated or treated wood. Some of the materials used in agricultural and transportation applications are also regularly exposed to solar radiation, rain, and pollution but are expected to have service lives that span several decades. Those used as coatings on automobiles or on aircraft exteriors in particular are exposed to high heat and UV radiation fluxes on a routine basis. The ir outer clear-coat layers responsible for finish and gloss is often compromised by exposure to UV radiation. Fig. 1 shows the main uses of plastics in outdoor applications. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 208 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Plastics and wood absorb solar UV radiation and are inherently susceptible to damage , es pecially at high ambient temperatures. The primary cause of weathering damage to wood and plastics is from solar UV -B radiation that is efficiently absorbed by chromophores generally present in these materials. High humidity, temperature, and pollutants in air often accelerate light-induced degradation. With plastics, the damage ranges from uneven discoloration or surface changes to cracking and loss of material strength .112 With wood products, weathering degradation also renders the surface hydrophilic , f acilitating subsequent moisture absorption and surface biodegradation . 131 D epletion of the stratospheric ozone layer to any extent increases the fraction of UV-B (290 - 315 nm) in the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Potential latitude -dependent increase s in UV-B radiation can significantly shorten the service life of wood and plastics used outdoors, especially at locations where the ambient temperatures are relatively high. Levels of UV radiation are expected to decrease globally in the decades ahead (see Chapter 1 ), but there is still concern about its impact on materials due to the interactive effects with climate change. Climate change is widely expected to result in an increase in the average global temperature by 1.1 -6.4\u00b0C by the end of the ce ntury and there is an international effort to keep the increase unde r 2\u00b0C .75 Any increase in ambient temperatures exacerbates the damage as weathering reactions in both wood and plastics proceed at faster rate s at the higher temperatures .28 Intrinsic factors such as additive s or impurities of trace Fig. 1 Uses of plastic materials in outdoor applications. PE = Polyethylene; PP = Polypropylene; PVC = Poly(vinyl chloride); PC = Polycarbonate Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 209 metals (including pro-oxidant additives to make the plastic photodegradable)115 also tend to accelerate the rate of light-induced photo-damage to both classes of materials. The use of efficient UV stabilizers in compounding of plastics and effective surface coatings or treatments of wood, allow s them to be successfully used in long-term outdoor applications such as in cladding, panels, fencing, or decking. Even at concentrations as low as <0.1 % by wt., l ight stabilizers, such a s the Hi ndered -Amine Light Stabilizers [HALS] ca n control light -induced damage in plastics to yield service lives of several decades. Existing stabilizer and coating technologies are likely able to mitigate additional damaging effects from small potential increases in UV -B radiation in the solar spectrum reaching the Earth . 75 Eit her greater concentrations of stabilizers in plastics or the use of more efficient surface treatments for wood will have to be employed to mitigate these effect s. Intensive industrial research effort is focused on discovering better and lower -cost light stabilizers for specific classes of plastics used in building7 and improved surface coatings for preserving wood against weathering. New materials, additives or new variants of existing plastics that are more weather -resistant emerge in the marketplace regularly. Polymeric materials are also used to protect humans against exposure to solar UV radiation . These include c lothing made of synthetic fibers and plastic glazing used in buildings (and vehicles) filter out the UV radiati on. The e ffective use of these limit s exp osure and therefore the adverse health impacts of UV radiation on humans. This paper assesses the relevant literature published since the last r eport in 2010. Plastics use in building Unlike with biota, that may show a limited capacity to adapt to increased UV- B radiation levels and where evolution of new traits is relatively slow, man-made materials can be designed to withstand new, harsher, solar UV radiation environments. Plastics, for instance, can be formulated with either greater levels of conventional stabilizers or more efficient novel stabilizers , to ensure a minimal loss in their service life. A substitution of materials with different, more UV -resistant classes of plastic or non-plastic material is a second strategy. Surface coatings and modification s of wood can also be designed for better resistance to solar UV radiation . However, invariably, it is the economics of their use that will dictate the specific mitigation strategy adopted. Regardless o f the technology choice, it will inevitably add to the lifetime cost of using either class of materials. Durability of materials outdoors is determined primarily by the dose of solar UV radiation, especially the proportion of UV- B radiation the material will be exposed to. As the dose of UV-B is latitude and altitude dependent, the durability of a given material will vary widely with the geographic location. The certified lifetime for a plastic material assessed at one location cannot be assumed to be the same for another with a different UV environment. Global UV-A and UV-B radiation maps (for Nov. 1, 1978 to June 30, 2000 ) estimated from TOMS data, corrected for the effect of cloud ,92 (Fig. 2) illustrat es the wide range of UV -B radiation environments encountered at different locations around the World. However, these must b e viewed with caution. Firstly, they are generally based on data from a single satellite overpass each day, and amounts of cloud at that time may not be representative of a true average. Secondly, satellite estimations of UV tend to be too high under pollu ted conditions16. The main uses of plastics in building construction include plastic pipes, siding, windows, soffit, fascia, rainwater goods and decorative panels and a majority of these are made of rigid PVC (rPVC) . I n fact, 76% of the PVC produced globally is used in the construction of building s. T he most popular cladding in residential housing in North America is rPVC siding produced by a profile Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 210 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 extrusion process. In this application , t he useful lifetime of the product is generally determined by uneven di scoloration and loss of impact strength from photodamage by solar UV radiation. Polycarbonate [PC] glazing used in architectural window panels as well as continuous windows and domes is similar to or better in performance than the conventional glazing in several characteristics .104 One important advantage of these is their lower thermal conductivity , k, r elative to glass. The value of k for PC glazing panels are as low as 1.2-1.9 W/m2 (25-mm thickness), but new technology such as PC/aerogel composites25 can bring this value down to 0.5 W/m2 ( 25 - mm section ). In these products as well, discoloration induced by solar radiation, determines their useful lifetime. T he present push towards sustainable materials in construction has led to some reassessment of the use of PVC materials in buildings . 89 D espite its dominance in the building sector and excellent performance in construction , PVC is perhaps the worst choice of a plastic in terms of environmental merit .5 Not only does the production of PVC result in potenti al emission of toxic monomers and precurso rs to air but it is also compounded in to soft products with phthalate plasticizers that are potent endoc rine disruptor s. Nevertheless , no imminent move away from its use in buildings is apparent. Alternative plastics that can replace PVC in construction such as polyolefins are available, but at a greater lifetime cost. The susceptibility of these alternatives to solar UV radiation will also influenc e their lifetime costs. PVC in building and construction Improv ements in rigid PVC technology aimed at making it more environmentally acceptable, better performing, and with lower lifetime costs, are being made on a continuing basis. In the face of competition from alternative materials, PVC technology has advanced considerably . T he lighter micro -foamed PVC siding50 and the emerging (polystyrene) foam -backed PVC siding with greater insulation efficiency are examples of such improvem ents. Most of the PVC products are processed as extruded profiles. Recent introduction to the market of a new processing aid14 as well as an acrylic impact modifier13 for PVC extrusion prod ucts (in profile, window, and siding applications ) is a significant improvement in the technology. The new additives allow PVC to be extruded at a lower temperature with reduced risk of degradation and Fig. 2 A global map of the annual un -weighted mean dose of UVA (above) and UVB (below) in units of kJ m-2 day-1.

On heating, PVC breaks down emitting hazardous corrosive HCl gas making it difficult to process. Typically, either tin-based or lead-based heat stabilizers are used to allow the thermal processing of rPVC. A new thermal stabilizer4 with a lower tin content (19%) was recently commercialized for use in the same types of PVC products used in building. Improved processibility and superior thermal stabilization of PVC are afforded by the use of new stabilizers , which also are claimed to impart superior weatherability to the plastic material . Lower thermal degradation during processing improves the service lifetimes of rPVC products as it reduces the buildup of UV -absorbing functionalities in the polymer. No long -term UV -stability data for PVC compounds that incorporate these newer additives are as yet available. However newer tin -maleate stabilizers effectively control yellowing due to weathering of the material. Other manufacturer s76 have also introduced their own novel PVC additives for the same set of building products. The solar UV-B -induced degradation of rPVC is catalyzed by ZnO used as a filler in the plastic . 132 The findings have implications only in the management of plastic waste as o utdoor PVC products are generally formulated to be resistant to UV radiation. The wavelength sensitivity and activation spectra for typical injection molded rPVC formulations are known . Similar data for solvent -cast sheets of PVC, manufactured for graphic arts applications, were recently published and the merit of the material as a UV dosimeter discussed .8 The data on wavelength sensitivity as well as activation spectra determined for solvent -cast plastic generally agree d w ith those already published for injection molded rPVC.9, 10 This shows that the wavelength sensitivity of these materials is governed primarily by the nature of the polymer rather than the additives or processing -related factors. In accelerated weathering of plastics under laboratory conditions, it is essential to use a light source with a spectrum similar to that of sunlight. For example, mercury vapor lamps cannot be used as a substitute for a xenon source .69 Recent advances in PVC technology have contribute d t o improve d se rvice lifetimes of the material expos ed to solar UV -B radiation and the anticipated effects of climate change. Wood-plastic composites The 2010 global market for wood-plastic composites (WPC) was 2.3million tonnes and, g iven the short -term projected growth rate of 13.8%, per year this is expected19 to grow to 4.6 million tonnes by 2016. WPCs are essentia lly thermoplastic composites (of PE, PP, PVC, and polystyrene (PS)) highly filled with powdered wood . Often , pos t -consumer plastics are used in their manufacture. Embedding wood fibers in a polymer matrix restricts absorption of moisture and hence avoids fu ngal growth and biodegradation of the wood fraction .106 A higher -grade product results when a single type of plastic such as virgin PP is used 71, 133 and the compounding and/or processing operations are carefully controlled96 to obtain good dispersion of the wood filler. To improve miscibility of the hydrophilic wood and hydrophobic plastics in fabricating WPCs, compatibilisers are often employ ed.65, 109 Good adhesion between the phases was report ed, for instance , w ith maleic anhydride grafted PE and PP .94, 96 Continued search ing for good adhesion - promoters or compatibili sers for specific wood/plastic systems is critical for future growth of this technology. Alternatively, the wood fraction can be chemically functionalized (e.g., acetylated; 73) for better compatibility. Low processing temperatures (<200\u00b0C) have to be used in processing WPCs because the wood component can otherwise thermally degrade. However, WPCs based on waste plastics and wood powder can be processed using conventional equipment into \"plastic lumber\" that can be handled and worked on using tools designed for wood. WPC is promote d as a 'green' (environmentally friendly) material as it uses waste wood and often post-consumer plastic s as well .15, 24, 149 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 212 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Lignin in the wood fraction of WPC absorbs solar UV radiation and undergoes photo- degradation59 leading to delignification of the wood particles at the surface of the WPC material.108 Photod egradation is reported to cause discoloration and breakdown of the filler in PP/wood 26 and PE/wood WPCs .47 These changes render the surface s hydrophilic, encouraging fungal growth , and biodegradation of the cellulose rich tissue . 40 A bsorption of w ater by wood particles under freeze - thaw cycles cause s swelling/shrinkage o f the fibres that also destabilizes WPC creating voids or empty spaces in the matrix. These recent findings on WPC parallel what are already known mechanisms of degradation for wood species. Understanding all the degradation pathways involved for WPCs is critical to developing better UV -B stabilizers for the material . The main advantage of WPC is that hydrophilic wood fibres that absorb water and prone to biodegradation are embedded in plastic protecting them from solar UV radiation and environmental biod egradation. The color, mechanical properties and durability of WPCs vary with the species of wood fiber used. For instance, in WPCs made of high density polyethylene [HDPE] with Douglas Fir and HDPE- hybrid Poplar wood discolored the least (>15%) on exposure to solar -simulated radiation (xenon lamp) compared to HDPE composites with wood species such as Wh ite oak and Ponderosa pine . 47 A s expected, the plastic component of WPC also undergo es light-induced degradation. Of the common thermoplastics used in WPCs, polystyrene93 is the most susceptibl e. There is some evidence that the presence of wood in PVC - based WPCs may also promote photodegradation of the plastic matrix .31 Naturally, the same light stabilizers used with plastics are also effective in protecting WPCs; for instance, the use of HALS stabiliz ers in wood- HDPE31, 148 and light absorber (benzotriazole type) in wood -PVC30 composites have been successful. The extent of protection afforded depends on t he level of the stabilizer and its dispersion in the polymer matrix .88 Whether there is an advantage in using a single stabilizer known to be effective in both wood and plastics, to protect WPC is not clear at this time. Fig. 3 shows the effect of brown-rot fungi acting on a sample of WPC biodegrading the particles of wood exposed at the surface of the composite. A thin layer of plastic (or a cap layer) extruded on to the WPC surface may help seal in the se exposed wood particles at the surface, discouraging biodegradation .134 With a HDPE cap layer, the rate of discoloration from exposure to solar UV radiation was redu ced by 50% and access of the wood fibers to moisture was also substantially reduced .100 Blending UV absorbers with a HALS in the HDPE cap layer can further enhance photostabilit y.79 While several studies have established the effectiveness of cap -layer technology, its techno -economic feasibility in specific product categories remains to be demonstrated. Biodegradable and compostable plastics such as poly (lactic acid)122 or poly(3- hydroxybutyrate)141 have been studied for their Fig. 3 A.

The perceived sustainability of these potentially fully biodegradable WPCs that return all the carbon into the carbon cycle is attractive. However, the greater cost of these specialized plastics will likely preclude commercialization of such WPCs in spite of the claimed but questionable environmental advantage of biodegradability. Emerging issue of weathering and microplastics Weathering of plastics outdoors produces micro-scale plastic fragments that have serious environmental consequences.12 Microplastics (fragments in the size range of 1 mm to 1 \u00b5m) are primarily believed to be derived from weathered, brittle plastic litter and are widely accepted to be a serious ecological concern, especially in the marine environment.77, 147 The surface cracking of highly weathered plastics is the likely origin of microplastics.12 Plastic particles, regardless of size, concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs ).17 dissolved in the ocean water at very low concentrations . The distribution coefficients (K) of a compound between the plastic and water phase is the ratio of its equi librium concentr ation in the plastic and in sea water. For common POPs , values of the K between sea water and plastics are large, ranging from 104 to 105 in favor of plastic . This means the equilibrium concentration of a POP species can be several orders of magnitude greater in the plastic debris compared to in the sea water. Because of their small size, some of the microplast ics are ingested by zooplankton and other marine species ,54 thus providing a pathway for P OPs to enter the marine food web .130 The specific compounds of concern include endocrine disruptors (EDs) such as PCBs, BPA, phthalates, and residual polymer catalysts. Polypropylene (PP) is commonly found in urban litter and is an important generator of microplastics via surface photodegradation. The wavelength sensitivity of the surface cracking of PP stabilized by HALS was reported recently.58 The same logarithmic dependence of photo damage on the wavelength of exposure, already reported for various measures of damage , s uch as discoloration or mechanical properties, was also confirmed for surface cracking. This is the first reported action spectrum for crack formation and is relevant as microplastics originate from surface cracks. However, quantifying surface cracking was indirect and not entirely satisfactory, being based on a correlation between carbonyl index (a spectroscopic quantity) and the degree of cracking. Extrinsic fluorescence techniques using Rhodamine dye , r ecently used for the first time to study microstructural changes in polymers during UV degradation ,41, 42 hold more promise for quantification of weathering -induced microcracking of plastics. Higher degrees of crystallinity obtained under extensive weathering are one o f the main reasons for embrittlement. On weathering of semi -crystalline plastics (such as PE or PP ), it is the amorphous regions that oxidize first because of the lesser solubility and diffusion rates of oxygen in the crystallites. This was recently confir med for PE123 using dielectric relaxational spectroscopy, a technique not hitherto used for this purpose. In contrast , Ojeda112 reported that polypropylene samples underwent a decline (>12%) in crystallinity during natural weathering. The latter observation has not been satisfactorily explained although impurities or accumulation of product during degradation has been suggested as the cause. Research is needed to clarify the relationship between crystallinity changes and exposure to UV radiation during weathering. Plastics in solar photovoltaic applicatio ns While plastics also are being evaluated as solar thermal absorbers,81 it is the photovoltaic (P-V) applications that are of greater commercial interest .74, 105 Research emphasis appears to be divided between the solar UV -damage to light -harvesting semiconductor polymers in organic P -V devices20, 100, 151 and that of plastic encapsulants used to protect silicon P -V modules. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 214 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Recent designs of P- V modules utilize plastics extensively. Generally, two plastic protective laminates or sheets in the modules are affected by solar radiation (Fig. 4). Light transmitted through the transparent front panel reaches the exposed parts of the front sheet and the front surface of the back sheet, discoloring and weakening these after long durations of exposure . The back sheet is often constructed of a multi -layered laminate designed for the service life of the module (20 -25 years). These sheets are made of a poly(vinyl fluoride ) (PVF) outer layer, a thicker inner core of poly(ethylene terephthalate ) (PET) with titanium dioxide (for opacity), and a PVF surface layer (or a PE/EVA tie layer) . Of the plastics evaluated over the years, PVF has been selected as the best suited for the application. Long -term exposure can result in discoloration and lo ss of strength in these sheets and, alt hough accelerated test methods available20, 67, 84 they are inadequate to reliably predict their service lifetimes. PE and PET degrade under sol ar UV exposure and undergo yellowing and cracking. The back surface of the back sheet is also affected by diffused UV radiation that, along with high temperatu res83 cause initial damage within 5 years of o utdoor exposure .86 There is an urgent research need to a) develop weather resistant encapsulants as well as accelerated test methods to assess the long-term (> 20-30 years) service lifetimes of P -V modules, reliably. Any increase in UV -B radiation and/or temperature due to climate c hange will clearly accelerate the degradation, but techniques and standards to reliably quantify the effects reliably are still being developed .110 The lifetime of protective plastics is a determining factor in implementing large -scale economical P -V technology. Plastics in greenhouse covers Plasti c films and laminates are the leading greenhouse cladding materials used worldwide. Thin plastic films are sometimes used on conventional glass cladding to modify the spectral quality of light reaching the crops.80 Plastic panels have different transmission rates for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR , 400-700 nm ) and sometime s the plastics incorporate dyes or modifiers91 to change the transmitted spectrum of solar radiation. The photostability of the dye is a concern in this technology and has not been explored as yet in detail. Rigid plastics (>10 year service life) commonly used in greenhouses are fibre -reinforced polyester panels , polycarbonate ( PC), and acrylics. Flexible cladding (3 -4 years o f service life) is generally made from PE, ethylene copolymers, and PVC ; although PET is also sometimes used. Both classes of cladding undergo discoloration and loss of PAR transmission with weathering during us e.2 N anofillers have been evaluated in low-density polyethylene (LDPE ) and linear low -density polyethylene (LLDPE ) greenhouse films to improve mechanical properties and to reduce transmissi on of UV. Nanoscale oxides of titanium, zinc oxide, and silica were evaluated for this purpose .43 Nano - zinc oxide fillers improve weatherability of the film s via UV-absorption or shielding, without affecting their transparency for PAR wavelengths. With certain varieties of crops , som e degree of Fig. 4 Structure of a P -V Module showing the back sheet and front sheet material placement. Source: Courtesy of DuPont. Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 215 transparency to UV radiation might be needed to ensure a greater quality produce (see Chapter 3 ) and plastic films can be designed t o accommodate this need . The market for durable greenhouse films is large enough for specialty chemical companies (Clariant, Swizerland) to offer tailor -made light stabilization solutions designed for gre enhouse films .33 While t he potential for durable but UV - resistant greenhouse films based on nano -composites clearly exists the lifetime cost of their use has not been reported . Dependence of solar UV radiation damage t o greenhouse film s on the dose of solar UV -B radiation is of interest in developing lifetime assessments. Dehbi and colleagues38, 39 reported a U- shaped (nonlinear) dependence of yellow discoloration with duration of exposure for LDPE greenhouse films, in both nat ural and accelerated weathering. However, t his form of dose -response beha viour is unexpected and atypical and is likely an artifact of the layered structure of the film . Oreski and colleagues114 investigated the weathering changes in stabilized EVA copolymer greenhouse films (200 \u00b5m) and showed that only a thin surface layer was deg raded . Even in thinner films (30 \u00b5m) of EVA, the mechanical properties were not significantly affected at 1,000 h of accelerated weathering exposure at 60 W/m2 of UV irra diance (300 -400 nm ) at 40\u00b0C. Present -day stabilizer technology is clearly adequate for greenhouse film applications. Energy costs of maintaining greenhouse temperatures vary with the choice of cladding. In a new modelling study, Al -Madhouri and colleagues6 found that the low emissivity of PVC is a better choice than LDPE in conserving heat in greenhouses. The search continues for a single plastic ma terial that combines long -term resistance to solar UV radiation, transmittance of PAR , an d thermal insulation, and is ideally suited for greenhouses. Nanofiller in photostabili sation of plastic s The bulk of reported work on nanofilled polymers involves polymer-based coatings, especially clear coats used in protecting exterior surfaces from solar UV damage (these are assessed below ). Redhwi125, 126 studied three nano-composites of LDPE (with Clay, ZnO, and Silica at 5 % (wt)) and found that natural resistance of the plastic to weathering was not compromised by the presence of the nanofiller s except in the case of nanosilica. In studies on nanocomposite systems (40 -100 nm) in LDPE57 w as reported to control the loss in tensile properties relative to unfilled samples in accelerated weathering studies . Nanofillers generally need to be either surface -treated or a compatibili ser must be used in the formulation to ensure that high levels of dispersion are achieved throughout the material. While some wo rk has been carried out on this topic ,87 further information is needed across the wide range of filler and/or plastic s. T he stability of the compatibiliser s or modifiers t o UV radi ation also has not been studied in sufficient detail. In general, the inclusion of nanoscale fillers should impart increased photostability to polymer coatings (including wood topcoats) and bulk polymers. Because variables , suc h as the particle size distribution and dispersion effectiveness are involved , quan titative effects are difficult to compare even for the same nanofillers in identical polymer matrices . Different combinations of these have been used in differen t studies. It appears that , i n some systems at least, nanofillers yield at least the same level of protection as conventional fillers , b ut at a lower volume fraction and can therefore be an economical choice. However, further work is needed to elucidate the conditions under which they act as photostabilizers. Kingston et al.87 recently reviewed the potenti al for release of nanofillers from several nano - composites filled with multi -wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and concluded that the potential for release of MWCNT with typical intended consumer use is expected to be small . It is not known if weathering of the composite surfaces facilitates the release of nanofiller particles from filled -coatings Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 216 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 or composites . Release of nanoscale fillers from composites d uring their use is an emerging environmental concern and is being investigated. Temperature effects in solar UV-damage of materials At higher ambient temperatures the light-induced degradation rates of materials accelerate. In the case of wood, heat alone often does not result in significant degradation ; yet hi gher temperatures accelerate t he ph oto-degradation process. In modelling effects of temperature in weathering studies, ambient temperatures are typically used. However, because of the absorption of solar radiation, especially the infra red radiation , t he surface tempera ture of the sample is often higher by as much as 10-20\u00b0C (depending on the material) and should be used in more realistic weathering models. A sophisticated heat transfer model that allows the estimation of sample surface temperatures from metrological data (without resorting to expensive field measurements) has been developed and validated .23 Its availability will not only refine the modelling of damage estimates but als o contribute to the assessment of stabilizers. The surface cracking of light-stabilized PP exposed to xenon lamp radiation was recently reported.58 In this first quantitative study of light-induced crack formation, the activation energy estimated for this process was 20 kJ/mole. However, models based on Arrhenius equation68or the reciprocity rule are inadequate in describing the case of concurrent light -induced and thermal (photo - thermal) degradation of PP .53 The lack of a satisfactory general quantitative model is a major drawback in predicting the rates of degradation and service life in plastics exposed to solar UV radiation where heat build -up also increases the temperature of the material. This deficiency is particularly apparent in P-V device technology. The temperature dependence of UV radiation -induced photodegradation was recently demonstrated experimentally via the exposure of wood from c onifers and deciduous species to UV - B.136 However, as a me rcury vapor lamp that also emits UV -C radiation was used as the source in th is study , t he results are not pertinent natural weathering. Increase in temperature from 30oC to 80oC increased light induced colo r changes by 33 -57% in pine, spruce, ash, and poplar wood ,119 and the effect is more pronounced at greater humidity .135 The high temperatures used in the laboratory accelerated weathering tests report ed by Persze and Tolvaj ,119 do not correspond to realistic temperatures of storage or use of wood. Wood as a building material In North America 25% of the windows are made of wood with nearly 9 million units made in 2010. The overriding market trend for building materials in general is the increasing demand for \"green\" or sustainable materials of construction.89, 107, 127, 145 Exposed wood products are common in buildings, and these are generally surface - coated to ensure durability. A wide range of protective finishes such as paints, varnishes, stains, or water repellents are used for this purpose .46 Recent life -cycle analys es (LCA) confirm wood to be an environmentally friendly building material .66, 116 Photodegradation of wood Lignin in wood is a potent chromophore that readily absorbs UV radiation and undergoes ready photodegradation. This results in rapid color changes135, 137, 154, lignin degradation3, 117, 137 and loss in microtensile strength .142 As with plastics, the oxidative degradation process in wood also increases the carbonyl index (the relative spectral signal from carbonyl groups in its infra -red spectrum) as a result of lignin degradation .121 The fundamental measures in weathering are the efficiency of the photoprocess, the photodamage/mole of available photons and the action spectrum .11 The action spectrum for yellowing of mechanical pulp (newsprint paper ) under exposure to simulated solar radiation was re -investigated recently in a rigorous laboratory study . 70 T he action spectrum for Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 217 yellowing showed a logarithmic dependence of yellowing efficiency on wavelength as previously reported for newsprint paper.11 The se recent findings are in line with and confirm the known data on photodamage to wood. As with plastics, solar UV radiation typically penetrates only the surface layer of wood. Photodegradation of surface layers monitored by microtensile measurements142, 153 shows the damage is limited to about a 250-\u00b5m layer for Spruce wood exposed to simulated sunlight. Scanning electron microscopy showed some cellular damage at greater depths, but this was not supported by tensile property changes. The role of wood extractives in UV stabilization E xtractives are naturally-occurring compounds that can be extracted from wood using common solvents such as acetone, ether and methanol. Natural wood extractives, being good absorbers of solar UV radiation, protect the wood from photodegradation.29 Extractives in wood generally include phenolic compounds, stilbenes, and flavonoid s that act as antioxidants and light stabilizers. Nzo kou and Kamden111 found the extractives to act as antioxidants and a stabilizer agains t degradation by UV radiation , dur ing also showed that extractives slow down the rate of wood degradation in Cryptomeria japonica and Acacia confuse heartwood. Wood/LLDPE composites prepared with extractive -free wood (extractives removed by solvent extraction) showed poorer UV radiation stability compared to un-extracted wood fiber .131 In contrast to the above, Sharratt and colleagues ;130 however, reported that discoloration of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) exposed to simulated sunlight exposure, was unaffected by the presence of extractives. Consistent with this observation of UV-stabilizer activity of extractives, t ext ile dyes derived from plants have very good UV -protective properties .64 Drawbacks of extractives as stabilizers, however, are their water solubility and ready leachability from wood. While heat treatment, at least in the case of Merbau heartwood, appears to help prevent this72, a general solution to the problem is not available. Wood extractives, depending on the species, c ould be a new source of light stabilizers that can be further developed and refined to guard both wood and WPCs against damage caused by solar U V radiation . Stabilizing wood against UV radiation Impr oved protection of wood against solar UV radiation is afforded by coating the surface with layers containing light stabilizers129 such as HALS (or synergistic combinations of stabilizers51) or inorganic fillers. Coating and surface modifications (as with cap layers already referred to in connection with WPC) also reduced moisture pick-up and therefore increase fungal resistance37 of wood. A wide range of protective surface coverings or finishes such as paints, varnishes, stains, or water repellents45 are now commercially available. Transparent coatings that are not UV stabilized merely protect the wood agai nst moisture but are not effective in controlling light -induced damage .143 I n such finishes, the interface (between wood and the coating) is degraded by UV-B radiation transmitted through the coating. This influences the coating performance .36 However, coatings that are hydrophilic (e.g., waterborne acrylic) must also be avoided as they promote the diffusion of water into the wood .140 Moisture in wood can facilitate biodegradation by fungi such as white -rot fungi (Fig.5). Using conventional light stabilizers in clear coats on wood can be an effective stabilization technique. For instance, the generation of carbonyl groups by photodegradation of the underlying wood, is reduced by incorporating 2% of a conventional light absorber (Tinuvin-1130 or hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole) in the polyurethane surface coatings.32 Treatment of Yellow Cedar wood surface with a low molecular weight phenol formaldehyde resin, containing 2% Lignostab-Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 218 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 1198, a HALS, improved the weathering resistance.46 A low -cost wax coating was also found to control light -induced yellowing of Norway spruce wood .95 Of the waxes studied, high loadings (wax content 11.7%) of emulsion of montan wax was the most effective. The effectiveness of clear coats can be further improved by photo-stabilizing the underlying wood substrate itself prior to the application of coatings.36, 118, 143 Chemically bonding UV absorbers to the wood is effective for many wood species.45, 62 Pretreatment with a reactive UV-absorber 2-hydroxy-4(2,3- oil improved of Scots pine wood.113 Surface modifications involving UV stabilizers may hold promise in protecting high-cost wood species from photodamage. Changing the surface layer of the wood substrate by chemical reaction (as opposed to using a protective clear coat) can also retard photo- degradation .44 This can be cost -effective, as only a thin surface layer of wood needs to be chemically altered. Esterification using an anhydride reagent is a popular route to surface modification. Bhat et al .22 r eported that acetylation of Acacia mangium and Acacia succinic anhydride better controlled UV -induced discoloration and mechanical loss compared to surface propylation. However , esterification only partially controls photo -yellowing and lignin degradation in Rubberwood .129 In contrast to unmodified wood, es terified wood showed photo -bleaching .102, 129 Aromatic esters [via vinyl benzoate reaction] also performed satisfactorily in controlling discoloration .78 A novel process for benzoylation of wood meal was reported ,150 but the method uses ionic liquids (salts that are liquids <100 \u00b0C) and is therefore likely to be too expensive for commercial use. The same is true of surface treatment approaches that rely on silylation (using methoxysilanes) , despite their effectiveness in stabilizing wood , being as ye t too expensive for commercial use.18 Of the approaches available, the use of clear coats that are impervious to moisture but stabilized with conventional HALS or other stabilizers is the most effective (and also the most economical) approach for wood. It is also relatively environmentally friendly compared to other methods. Use of nanofillers to protect wood against UV radiation A majority of the studies reviewed suggest that nanoscale fillers in the topcoat or wood surface improve the UV stability of wood. While the economic feasibility of using nanofillers in wood coatings is not clear as yet, their performance is equal or better than conventional fillers at comparable volume fractions is supported by the recent research. Three strategies for stabilization have been Fig. 5 Cross section of Oak Wood being biodegraded by white rot fungi. Biodegraded cells and fungal hyphae within other cells can be seen. (100 X).

Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 219 reported: incorporating nanofillers in topcoats, applying nanofiller directly to wood, and generating nanofillers in the wood. Photostabilization of water-based polyurethane coatings intended for use on wood substrates, with 10-nm Ceria (CeO 2) nanoparticles49, 128 at a level of 0.4-1.4% has been reported. Nano-Ceria was also reported to stabilize PP.21 A similar improvement in controlling discoloration (and other surface damage such as reduction in gloss) was obtained with 7 nm nano-silica particles103 at 1-5 wt.% incorporated into polyurethane coating. The same was reported for 50-nm nano-ZnO124 in the same class of coating and for a 20-nm grade of the nanofiller at 1-2 wt.% in an acrylic wood sta in.34 However, using 0.5-1.0 wt.% of 20-nm rutile, a crystalline form of nano-titania, in similar coatings showed a decrease in photo-stability compared to base polymer, in terms of discoloration under accelerated weathering. Acrylic water-based coatings for wood, containing nano-titania (NT) as well as nano-ZnO34 have also been evaluated for control of discoloration, loss of gloss, and carbonyl group formation indicative of degradation. Fufa et al.55, 56 found NT in the topcoat of wood cladding to be only marginally better than the base coating (with no NT) in controlling discoloration and carbonyl formation in Norway spruce. However, a very low fraction of only 1 wt.% ( based on solids) of filler was used in that study. A 50 -m thick clear coat with 1.14 wt.% of NT filler afforded a much higher l evel of protection compared to that from a comparable coating with benzotriazole light absorbers .52 D irect deposition of rutile nanoparticles on hardwood surface (without a coating) is also an option; this is achieved by hydrothermal processing95 Such coatings are thicker and higher in concentration of NT particles, yielding excellent resistance against discoloration . Nanoparticles can also be chemically generated in situ on wood and bamboo surfaces95 and this greatly enhances t he material 's photostability. This was demonstrated with Chinese hardwood where the in -situ generation was followed by silylation treatment to increase hydrophobicity. Wang and colleagues144 studied NT coatings on Chinese fir wood followed by silylation. However, such two -step processes , es pecially those involving silylation , are likely to be too expensive for large -sc ale commercial use . Role of fabric in protection against UV radiation Personal protection afforded by clothing against the damaging effects of solar UV radiation is considerable and depends on fiber composition, (natural, synthetic or mixed fibers), fabric construction (porosity, weave and thickness) and dyeing (natural or synthetic dyes and their UV - absorbing properties .60 In addition, outdoor uses of fabric such as in tent s, awnings, shading , and sunshade fabrics also provide a protective role to humans from solar radiation. Clothing is in fact one of the best ways of protecting people against solar UV r adiation99 as even where the f abric materials themselves undergo limited UV-induced degradation they continue to provide excellent protection. The effectiveness of fabrics in this regard is quantified using the \"ultraviolet protection factor\" or UPF of the fabric. UPF is the ratio of the minimum erythe mal dose of solar UV radiation for skin protected by fabric to that unprotected .35 The percentage of effective UV radiation transmittance at each UPF value range is given in Table 1 . For instance a cotton T -shirt provides a UPF of 3 -5 (dry) and even lower when wet while denim has a UPF 1700. Dark colored fabrics have a higher UPF compared to light-colored ones .90 Several features of fabrics determine its UPF: (a) the porosity of the material or how open the structure is will be inversely proportional to the UPF; (b) the absorption of UV by the fabric material; (c) dyes, chemical reactants148, or UV stabilizers82applied to the fabric; and (d) moisture level of the fabric .146 Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials 220 The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 Table 1 The Relationship between UPF and fraction of erythemally effective UV transmitted through the material. (From Australian/ New Zealand Standard: AS/NZS 4399 (1996). Sun Protective Clothing: Evaluation and classification.) UPF range UV radiation protection category Effective UV radiation transmission %) 15-24 Good protection 6.7-4.2 25-39 Very good protection 4.1-2.6 40-50, 50+ Excellent protection <2.5, <1% Of these, the porosity or tightness of the weave is the dominant factor in obtaining UV radiation protection, followed by the ability of fibers to absorb UV radiation. Grifoni et al.63 com pared the UV protection afforded by natural-fiber fabrics (cotton, hemp, flax and ramie) and concluded that thicker fabrics with denser weaves (with a cover factor, CF > 94%) such as drapery fabrics usually showed UPF >50. Cover factor is the ratio of the area covered by the yarns to the whole area of the fabric. Cotton fabrics afforded excellent protection from UV radiation as conf irmed in other studies.82 Lighter textile -grade fabrics, however, showed high UPF values only when the porosity was low (Cover factor >94%). Different natural fibers have about the same UV absorbance , and the difference in the performance of corresponding fabrics is mostly determined by cover factor and dyeing. Commercial sun -protective garments (UPF 50+ that transmit <1% of UV radiation) perform by reducing their porosity or \"open areas\" in the weave of the fabric and using UV absorbers. Even these, when wet (with water filling the spaces) do not scatter but transmit UV, reducing their effective UPF value. The UPF of different fabric materials varies as follows: Cotton >Polyester> Nylon >Elastane60 Chemical modification of fiber surfaces can increase the UPF ratings. A particularly successful approach is the use of inorganic oxides (including nanoscale particles101 or zinc oxide in n1 and with titania -silica48, alumina or nanosilica98 particles in cot ton, yielded very high UPF values in th e hundreds (UPF > +50). While the untreated thick (tightly woven) fabric often has high UPF values to afford excellent protection , t he use of surface modification technologies allows even a lighter -w eight fabric to deliver the same high level of UV protect ion. Layer- by-layer (LBL) deposition of nanolayers of three brightner compounds also increased the UPF of cotton fibers (UPF >40) and improved durability in laundering as well.97 Optical whiteners abs orb UV radiation and re -emit as blue radiation (typically 420 -470 nm) . LBL has also been used to deposit nano -alumina on cotton .139 Despite the impressive performance of LBL technologies, they are expe nsive and are not near commercialization at this time. Chitosan metal complexes have also been used as organic stabil izer coatings on textile fibers but whilst these improve the antibacterial properties significantly they only provide a moderate improvement in UPF .61 Glazing and protection against UV radiation Window glass (glazing) filters out the solar UV-B radiation but allows some UV-A radiation to pass through; the transmitted fraction depends on the type of glazing used. In buildings and in automobiles where some of the solar radiation is screened by glass, sunlight reaching into the cabin can still cause discoloration of materials and bleaching of dyes. In spite of the lower efficiency of UV- A wavelengths (compared to UV-B) in discoloration, the relatively greater amounts of the former in the terrestrial solar spectrum can still affect exposed fabric and other materials. Individuals, however, are protected from the UV-B radiation by almost all the different types of glass used on residential, Ozone depletion and climate change: Impacts on materials The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel Report for 2014 221 commercial and automobile applications. Reported values for transmission of UV-A by different glazing are summarized below (Table 2138). Table 2. P ercentage Transmission of UV- A Radiation by different types of glazing materials Type of Glazing Thicknessa (mm) Percentage Transmission Residentia l windows Double glazed glass 3.0/3.0 57 Double tinted glass -blocking glass 3.0/3.0 0.1 Automob ile w indows Laminated windshield glass - 2-3 Tempered glass in rear and side window - 33-48 Grey priv acy glass - 8 Moon -roof glass - 2 a The two numbers refer to the two sheets of glass in double-glazed windows. Thermal performance of windows can be improved dramatically by incorporating monolithic or granular aerogel in the interspace between panes in double-glazed windows.85 According to B uratti25 the rate of heat transfer decreased by 23% in aluminium-framed windows using aerogel technology. An associated benefit is that the presence of aerogel also cuts down the radiation transmitted, especially UV-A and UV-B radiation in sunlight.

Ozone filters out damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The destruction of stratospheric ozone thus leads to higher levels of UV radiation at the surface of the Earth and this can cause damage to ecosystems and to materials such as plastics. It may cause an increase in the risk of some human diseases, for example, skin cancers and cataracts. The discovery of the role of the synthetic ozone-depleting chemicals, such as the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), stimulated increased research and monitoring. Computer models predicted a disaster if nothing was done to protect the ozone layer. Based on this scientific information, the nations of the world took action in 1985 with the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. The Convention and Protocol have been amended and adjusted several times since 1987 as new knowledge has become available.The Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol appointed three Assessment Panels to regularly review research findings and progress. These panels are the Scientific Assessment Panel, the Technological and Economic Assessment Panel and the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel. Each panel covers a designated area with a natural degree of overlap. The main reports of the Panels are published every four years, as required by the Meeting of the Parties. All three reports have an executive summary that is distributed more widely than the entire reports. It has become customary to add a set of questions and answers - mainly for non- expert readers - to these executive summaries. This document contains the questions and answers prepared by the experts of the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel. They refer mainly to the environmental effects of ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change, based on the 2014 report of this Panel, but also on information from previous assessments and from the 2014 report of the Scientific Assessment Panel1. Readers who need further details on any question should consult the full reports for a more complete scientific discussion. All of these reports can be found on the UNEP website: http://ozone.unep.org . 1 Reference: Twenty Questions and Answers about the Ozone Layer 2014 Update, Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2014, United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi.6 1.HOW IS OZONE PRODUCED AND DESTROYED? The ozone molecule (O 3) contains three atoms of oxygen and is mainly formed by the action of UV radiation from the sun on oxygen molecules (diatomic oxygen, O 2) in the upper part of Earth's atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Ozone is also produced locally near Earth's surface (in the troposphere) from the action of UV radiation on some air pollutants. About 90% of all ozone molecules are found in the stratosphere, a region that begins about 10-20 kilometres above Earth's surface and extends up to about 50 kilometres. Most of this ozone is found in the lower stratosphere in what is commonly known as the \"ozone layer.\" The stratospheric ozone layer protects life on Earth by absorbing most of the harmful UV radiation from the Sun. The remaining 10% of ozone is in the troposphere, which is the lowest region of the atmosphere, between Earth's surface and the stratosphere. The concentration of ozone varies from about 12 parts per million in the stratospheric ozone layer to about 20 parts per billion near Earth's surface. Figure 1.1 illustrates the production and destruction of stratospheric ozone. Atomic oxygen (O) is formed when UV radiation in sunlight interacts with oxygen molecules (O 2). Atoms of O react with molecules of O 2to form an ozone molecule (O 3). Ozone is destroyed naturally in the upper stratosphere by the UV radiation from the sun. These reactions are most important in the stratosphere above tropical and middle latitudes, where UV radiation is most intense. For each ozone molecule that is destroyed, an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule are formed. Some of these recombine to produce ozone again. These naturally occurring reactions of destruction and production of ozone are balanced so that the ozone amount in the stratosphere remains constant. Ozone is a very strong oxidising agent and reacts with many chemicals including organic substances. In addition to the processes described above, human activities and naturalprocesses can emit large amounts of gases containing chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and fluorine (F) that eventually reach the stratosphere. When exposed to UV radiation from the Sun, these halogen-containing gases are converted to more reactive gases, such as chlorine monoxide (ClO) and bromine monoxide (BrO). These reactive gases participate in \"catalytic\" reaction cycles that efficiently destroy ozone in the stratosphere (Figure 1.1). The destruction of ozone by halogens involves two separate chemical reactions. The net or overall result is that atomic oxygen (O) and ozone (O 3) are combined, to form two oxygen molecules (O 2). In Figure 1.1, the cycle begins with ClO or Cl. Cl reacts with (and thereby destroys) ozone and forms ClO. This then reacts with O to generate O 2and regenerate Cl. Because Cl or ClO is reformed each time an ozone molecule is destroyed, chlorine is considered to be a catalyst for ozone destruction. Similar reactions occur with bromine derivatives and other compounds such as nitrogen oxides. The relative potency of the different halogens depends largely on the stability of the compounds. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is very stable, so fluorocarbons have no known impact on ozone. The atmospheric lifetimes of the iodine compounds are extremely short and they do not play an important role in the ozone destruction processes. Chlorine-containing compounds from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, are usually \"washed out\" of the atmosphere before they can reach the stratosphere. They can however destroy ozone in the troposphere.7 The total amount of ozone above any point on Earth is measured in Dobson Units (DU). An ozone column amount of 300 DU, which is a typical global average, corresponds to a 3 mm layer of pure ozone. Ozone column amounts vary seasonally and with latitude, and can sometimes reach values nearly twice as large as the global average. During the springtime Antarctic Ozone \"Hole\", ozone amounts of less than 100 DU may occur. Most of the atmospheric column of ozone is in the stratosphere (see Box 1), where the intensity of UV radiation is greater than closerto Earth's surface. At any location, between 5 and 10% of the ozone column is in the troposphere, where it may be harmful to human and ecosystem health. For example, high concentrations of ozone can lead to respiratory problems and decreased crop productivity. In polluted environments, ozone production in photochemical smog can lead to increases from its background levels of ~25 ppb (parts per billion) to in excess of 100 ppb. For this reason, in many large cities, ozone is routinely measured, and health warnings are issued whenever the concentration exceeds 100 ppb. Figure 1.1: Formation and destruction of ozone Destruction of Ozone - The last two reactions are repeated many times.8 Box 1. Troposphere versus Stratosphere The troposphere is the region of the atmosphere extending from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of approximately 15 km, but ranging from less than 10 km in Polar Regions to about 20 km in the tropics. Temperature decreases with altitude in the troposphere typically at a rate of approximately 6\u00b0C/km. This promotes turbulent mixing so that any gases there are uniformly mixed. The upper limit of the troposphere is called the tropopause, which is the altitude at which temperature no longer decreases with altitude. At altitudes above this point, absorption by ozone of incoming sunlight (especially UV radiation), and of outgoing infrared radiation from Earth's surface cause the temperature gradient to stabilise or to show an increase in temperature with increasing altitude. Such temperature gradients inhibit the vertical mixing, resulting in a layered (or \"stratified\") structure. In this region of the atmosphere, gases are no longer uniformly mixed. Peak ozone amounts occur at altitudes near 25 km, and the stratosphere extends to an altitude of about 50 km (Figure 1.2). The maximum altitudes of clouds, of jet aircraft flight paths, and of the highest mountains are all approximately 10 km. Turbulent mixing in the troposphere leads to convective motion, condensation and cloud formation, and precipitation.

The relationship between ozone and climate change is complex as depicted in Figure 2.1 and explained on the next pages. Figure 2.1. Schematic of ozone focused stratospheric chemistry-climate interactions. Links between components of the chemistry-climate system are indicated with arrows. 10 a. Is ozone depletion affected by climate change? Climate change will affect ozone depletion through changes in atmospheric conditions that alter the chemical production and loss of stratospheric ozone. The interactions are complex. Climate change is expected to decrease temperatures and water vapour abundances in the stratosphere. Ozone, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and their substitutes, are greenhouse gases (GHGs) that have a relatively small (\u00b1 13%) contribution to climate change. Several other gases that are involved in the chemistry of ozone depletion are also active greenhouse gases. They include water vapour, methane, and nitrous oxide. Increases in these gases will ultimately lead to increases in stratospheric gases that destroy ozone. Changes in solar output and future volcanic eruptions (the latter through injection into the atmosphere of particulates and gases that form an active surface for ozone depletion) will influence both climate change and ozone depletion. While recent ozone depletion has been dominated by chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere, in the longer term (~100 years) it seems likely that the impact of climate change will dominate, through the effects of changes in atmospheric circulation and chemistry. Increases in GHGs over the first half of the current century may contribute to a colder stratosphere, leading to a decrease inthe rate of destruction of ozone outside Polar Regions. In Polar Regions however, the lower temperatures may lead to some increases in polar stratospheric clouds that can lead to exacerbation of ozone depletion. The temperature changes are also leading to changes in atmospheric circulation. These changes may aid the mixing of long-lived CFCs from the troposphere to the stratosphere that will increase their rate of photochemical destruction. This can lead to more severe ozone depletion in the short term but will contribute to faster ultimate recovery of ozone. Changes in polar ozone can also lead to changes in circulation patterns in the lower atmosphere, which in turn affect surface climate. The effects of climate change on UV radiation are twofold: those that influence total ozone directly, and those that depend on changes in other variables (such as clouds, aerosols or snow cover) that influence solar UV indirectly. This is further complicated by the notion that decreasing the water vapour in the stratosphere will cause cooling of the Earth's surface, competing with the present warming. b. Has stratospheric ozone depletion had an influence on climate change? Stratospheric ozone depletion has an influence on climate change since both ozone and the compounds responsible for its depletion are active greenhouse gases. Halocarbons such as CFCs have contributed to positive direct radiative forcing and associated increases in global average surface temperature. Ozone depletion due to increasing concentrations of ozone depletingsubstances (ODSs) has an indirect cooling effect. Warming due the existence of ODSs and cooling associated with ozone depletion are two distinct climate forcing mechanisms that do not simply offset one another. Bromine-containing gases currently11 contribute much more to cooling than to warming, whereas CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) contribute more to warming than to cooling. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) contribute only to warming. The indirect cooling effect of ODSs is projected to cease upon ozone layer recovery. Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol resulted in the replacement of CFCs with HCFCs, HFCs, and other substances or methods of fulfilling their main uses, e.g. as coolants. Because these replacement chemicals/compounds generally have lowerglobal warming potentials (GWPs), and because total halocarbon emissions have decreased due to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments, their contribution to climate change has been reduced. Ammonia and those hydrocarbons used as halocarbon substitutes are very likely to have a negligible effect on global climate. Substitutes for ODSs in air conditioning, refrigeration, and foam blowing, such as HFCs, PFCs, and other gases such as hydrocarbons, are not expected to have a significant effect on global tropospheric chemistry. c. How is ozone depletion influencing Southern Hemisphere climate? Ozone depletion changes the distribution of atmospheric heat resulting in distinct alterations to Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation and climate factors such as precipitation and temperature. Stratospheric ozone depletion and resultant cooling over Antarctica has caused the tropopause to lift allowing the polar westerly jet stream to shift southwards (Figure 2.2). The speed of both the polar jet and the westerly winds has also increased, keeping most of Antarctica cold as the rest of the world warms. This shift in the westerly's and their increased strength has changed atmospheric and oceanic circulation throughout the Southern Hemisphere by creating a more positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The SAM index describes the difference in sea- level pressure between the latitudes of 40S and 60S. Over the past century, increasing greenhouse gases and then ozone depletion over Antarctica have both pushed the SAM towards a more positive phase and the SAM index is now at its highest level for at least 1000 years. Positive SAM anomalies are characterised by stronger sub polar westerlywinds positioned further south over the continental landmass, colder Antarctic temperatures and low atmospheric pressure over the icecap. As a result, high latitude precipitation has increased and the mid- latitude dry zone has moved south as shown (Figure 2.2). The resultant changes to precipitation and temperature and some of their ecosystem impacts are just emerging. In addition to increased wind across the Southern Ocean and colder temperatures across Antarctica, these include warmer and wetter summers in Southern Africa, SE South America, SE Australia and E New Zealand and warmer drier summers in Patagonia. In southernmost South America these drier conditions have been linked to slower growth of trees, while in New Zealand the wetter summers have led to increased tree growth.12 Figure 2.2 Schematic illustration of Southern Hemisphere climate impacts in the austral summer associated with Antarctic ozone depletion. This ozone depletion has cooled the Antarctic stratosphere, shifting the mid-latitude westerly jet pole ward with associated rainfall impacts (shown by the white arrows). These changes in rainfall have been observed in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America. The wind changes have also strengthened the subtropical rotating ocean currents and overturning circulation in the ocean (shown by the blue arrow). Figure provided by David J. Erickson III and Sharon Robinson. 13 3.WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OZONE AND SOLAR UV RADIATION? There is an inverse relationship between the concentration of ozone and the amount of UV radiation transmitted through the atmosphere since ozone absorbs some of the UV radiation. The main benefit of ozone is that it absorbs UV radiation from sunlight so that the intensity of UV radiation at Earth's surface is dramatically lower than at the top of the atmosphere. If there were no ozone present, the intensities of UV-B radiation at ground level would be increased by orders of magnitude, leading to substantial harmful environmental impacts. Only a small fraction of the radiation emitted by the Sun is in the UV range. This range extends from 100 to 400 nm and is divided into three bands: UV-A (400 - 315 nm), UV-B (315 - 280 nm) and UV-C (280 - 100 nm). As the Sun's radiation passes vertically through the atmosphere, all the UV-C and approximately 90% of the UV-B is absorbed by ozone and oxygen molecules in the stratosphere. UV-A radiation is less affected by the atmosphere. Therefore, the UV radiation reaching Earth's surface is composed mainly of UV-A with a small UV-B component (Figure 3).The amount and variability of the UV-B component depends on the solar elevation angle, which defines the path-length through the atmosphere, and also on the amount of ozone. A decrease in the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere results in increased UV-B radiation at the surface of the Earth. UV- B radiation is much more biologically active than UV-A radiation and can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on living organisms. Changes in the amount of UV-B radiation (for example due to stratospheric ozone depletion) are very important for ecosystems, materials and humans.14 Figure 3: Absorption of UV radiation by ozone. The blue curve shows that ozone absorption increases rapidly at shorter wavelengths so that at wavelengths less than 300 nm, less than 1% of the radiation is transmitted. Figure provided by Dr R McKenzie. 15 4.WHY IS THERE CONCERN ABOUT UV RADIATION? The high photon energies at UV-B wavelengths are capable of breaking molecular bonds in DNA, which is the building block of life. Damage to this molecule can result in multiple health effects, including skin cancers. UV radiation can adversely affect agricultural and aquatic productivity as well as air quality. It can also reduce the effective lifespan of materials such as plastics and paint products. Some UV radiation is however beneficial for human health such as in the production of vitamin D and for killing pests and pathogens. UV-B radiation makes up only a small proportion of the UV radiation reaching Earth's surface, because it is largely absorbed by stratospheric ozone. However, UV-B radiation is the most biologically damaging as the high photon energies are sufficient to break molecular bonds. The longer wavelength UV-A is less damaging, but is implicated in someadverse effects, including skin damage. Ozone has only a minor effect on UV-A radiation. For many, but not all, environmental effects and biological processes, the damaging effect of UV radiation increases as the wavelength decreases (and hence the energy per individual photon increases).

The UV Index (UVI) describes the level of solar UV radiation at the Earth's surface relevant to sunburn in humans (erythema). Information about the intensity of UV radiation is provided to the public in terms of the internationally adopted UVI colour-scale, along with appropriate health warnings, as shown in Table 5. The colours corresponding to the various ranges are standardised throughout the world. The UVI can be measured directly with instruments designed specifically to measure sun burning UV radiation. For clear-sky conditions, the UVI can be calculated approximately from knowledge of the ozone and the solar zenith angle (also known as solarelevation angle; see Question 6 for more detail). However, the UVI at a specific location and time depends strongly on the cloud cover and on the amount of aerosols. Other influential factors include the seasonally varying Sun- Earth separation, the altitude, and surface reflection. When the surface is snow-covered, the UVI can be up to 60% greater than for snow-free surfaces. Several countries provide daily forecasts of the UVI that take predicted changes in ozone and cloud cover into account. Further details about the UVI can be found at www.unep.org/PDF/Solar_Index_Guide.pdf Table 5: The UV Index and related colours as used by the World Health Organization Exposure Category UVI Range Low < 3 Moderate 3 to 5 High 6 to 7 Very High 8 to 10 Extreme >1117 6.WHEN AND WHERE SHOULD THERE BE CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO UV RADIATION? The effects of UV radiation depend on how much is received. Therefore it is important to understand how exposure to UV radiation varies, due to both variation in levels at Earth's surface and to human activities. The main determinants of surface UV radiation are the elevation of the Sun above the horizon - known as the solar zenith angle (sza) (Figure 6.1), and the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. Consequently, the highest UVI values occur in the tropics, where ozone amounts are at their lowest (apart from the Antarctic \"ozone hole\"), and where the sun is directly overhead at noon. UV radiation is also influenced by seasonal changes in Sun-Earth separation (closest in Dec/Jan), altitude, and surface reflection (albedo). The variation in the UVI as a function of the solar zenith angle and the ozone amount is illustrated in Figure 6.2. In addition to this variation in estimated clear- sky UVI, there are a range of modifiers of theUVI at Earth's surface. Clouds and aerosols can reduce levels of UV radiation by more than 50%; and on average they block about 30% of the clear-sky radiation. However, scattering from clouds that are in the direct beam of the sunlight, but which do not obscure it, can lead to significant shorter term enhancements in levels of UV radiation. For aquatic systems, the transmitted UV radiation also depends on the clarity of water, with coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) being an important attenuator. Most organisms that are exposed to UV radiation have their own means of blocking it to reduce the dose received (e.g., melanin in human skin, or flavonoids in some plant species).

The coloured lines represent different ozone concentrations, measured in Dobson Units (DU), Figure provided by Dr R L McKenzie, NIWA. The maximum UVI for any location on the globe is illustrated in the map below (Figure 6.3). The UVI has significantly higher summer maxima in the Southern Hemisphere compared with corresponding latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. In the tropics at sea level the UVI can exceed 16 and a peak terrestrial value of 25 has occurred at high altitudes e.g. Altiplano region of South America (Figure 6.3). Recently a value of 35 has been measured in Chile. Generally, peak UVI values decrease with increasing latitude and in Polar Regions; UVI values tend to be much lower, and are zero during the polar winter night. However, the Antarctic region, which is affected by the Antarctic \"ozone hole\", is a notable exception. Peaks there can exceed an UVI of 16. Outside the protective layer of Earth's atmosphere (altitude > 50 km), the UVI can exceed 300. The higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage, and the less exposure time it takes for harm to occur. For fair-skinned individuals aUVI of more than 10 can cause sunburn from an exposure of about 15 minutes. High levels of UV radiation can have a wide range of environmental impacts. For any particular process, the impact depends on the difference in absorption of the different wavelengths. For example, effects on human skin erythema (sunburn) will be proportional to the dose of erythemally active UV radiation. In humans, high levels of exposure to UV radiation can lead to skin-damage (e.g., sunburn) skin cancer and eye damage (e.g., cataract). However, some exposure to UV radiation is required to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D. UV radiation can also affect other animals, plants, aquatic organisms, and whole ecosystems. It influences air quality through the production of photochemical smog, and the degradation rates of materials such as paints and plastics. These are discussed further in subsequent FAQs.19 Figure 6.3: Average values for the maximum UVI at each point on the globe derived from the total ozone monitoring satellite (TOMS) measurements over several years. Figure provided by Ben Liley, NIWA Lauder (note that the colours used to depict the UVI here are different to those provided in Table 5) 20 7.HOW IS UV RADIATION EXPECTED TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE? Due to the combined effects of ozone recovery, and changes in cloud cover induced by increasing greenhouse gases, relatively modest changes in UV radiation are expected in the future. In the Antarctic region, significant reductions in mean noontime UVI values are expected due to the continuing recovery of ozone, especially during the springtime \"ozone hole\" period. By the end of the 21stcentury, these future reductions in UVI due to projected ozone increases will be comparable with the increases that occurred due to ozone depletion in the past, as shown in the bottom panels of Figure 7. Other changes in UVI induced by climate change effects are also potentially important. For example, projected increases in cloud cover and reductions in surface reflectivity due to ice-melt in the Arctic, and in the margins of the Antarctic continent, are expected to continue to contribute toreductions in UVI (see middle panels of Figure 7). However, there is only low confidence in these estimates of effects. Outside Polar Regions, future changes are likely to be dominated by changes in aerosol extinctions, particularly in densely populated areas. For example, large increases in UVI are projected for parts of Asia, to counterbalance the large reductions in UVI that probably occurred there over the past few decades (see upper panels of Figure 7). Because of uncertainties in both the projected amounts of aerosols, and their optical properties, these aerosol effects are uncertain. For that reason, we do not provide an estimate of the sum of the individual effects. . .21 Figure 7. Calculated percentage changes per year in noontime UVI relative to the \"present\" (i.e., 2010-2020). The left column shows simulated changes since 1955-1965. The right column shows the simulated changes expected from the present to the period 2085-2095. Effects of aerosols, surface reflectivity, cloudiness and total ozone on UVI are shown in each row, with our assessment of the confidence in the UVI projections. Note the different colour-scales for each row. 22 8.HOW IS UV RADIATION BAD FOR MY HEALTH? Exposure to solar UV radiation damages the skin and eyes. These effects can be acute after intense exposure or chronic after long-term exposure. Sunburn is the major immediate (acute) outcome in the skin of over-exposure to sunlight. The dose of solar UV-B radiation required to induce sunburn varies considerably from one individual to another, largely depending on the pigment in their skin. Six categories of skin type are commonly used to describe sensitivity to sunlight (see Table 8). Exposure of the unprotected eye to intense UV- B radiation causes sunburn of the superficial layers of the eye or the inner surface of the eyelids, resulting in photoconjunctivitis, or affecting the cornea, resulting in photokeratitis. This can cause pain and blindness for a few hours to a day or two. Protection of the eye is needed under conditions of high ambient UV radiation or where there are highly reflective surfaces, such as snow or white sand. Sunburn occurs because energy from UV radiation damages DNA and other molecules in the skin or eyes.The inflammatory response that occurs to manage this damage includes increased blood flow to the area and release of chemicals that stimulate nerve fibres, leading to redness and pain, respectively. Damage to the DNA of skin cells can result in their destruction; peeling of the skin may occur if DNA damage is severe and affects a large number of skin cells. Exposure to UV radiation suppresses the generation of cell-mediated immune responses (Box 8). Higher exposure to UV radiation around the time of vaccination may result in a lower immune response, at least in some individuals. UV irradiation can cause immune suppression that allows the reactivation of some viruses. For example sun exposure can trigger the reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus infection and the reappearance of vesicles (cold sores or fever blisters) in the skin (Figure 8.1). Table 8: Skin types commonly used tocategorise sensitivity of the skin following exposure to UV radiation. Skin phototype Sun sensitivity Sunburn/tan I Extremely sensitive Always burns, never tans II Very sensitive Burns readily, tans slowly and with difficulty III Moderately sensitive Can burn after high exposure, tans slowly IV Relatively tolerant Burns rarely, tans easily V Variable Can burn easily, difficult to assess as pigment is present already VI Relatively insensitive Rarely burns23 The major harmful effect of chronic (long-term) exposure of the skin to sunlight, and/or intermittent episodes of sun burning, is the development of skin cancers, including non- melanoma skin cancers and melanoma (Figure 8.2). Repeated DNA damage from exposure to UV radiation results in mutations in specific tumour-related genes, including those required for DNA repair. Immune suppression induced by exposure to UV radiation (Box 8) allows the abnormal tumour cells to develop and form skin cancers. The non-melanoma skin cancers are divided into squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma (Figure 8.2), and are the most common cancers in many countries. Incidence is highest in fair-skinned populations living in sunny climates, and increases with increasing age. The majority of these tumours are found on the face and head - the sites most consistently exposed to the sun. Non- melanoma skin cancers are generally readily treatable and are rarely fatal but both the tumours and the treatment may be disfiguring. The number of new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer occurring each year has increased significantly in many countries over the past 40 years or so, particularly in fair-skinned populations. Melanomas of the skin (Figure 8.2) are much more dangerous than the non-melanoma skin cancers, with a significant risk of death if not treated at an early stage. They arise from the cells that form the pigment (melanin) that determines skin colour. While non-melanoma skin cancers predominantly occur in older adults, melanoma can develop in people of all ages. For example, it is the most commonly reported cancer in women age 17-33 years in Australia. Melanoma occurs mainly in fair- skinned populations, and, while high levels of sun exposure at any age increase the risk ofmelanoma, high dose exposure and/or sunburn in childhood may be particularly important. In people with fair skin, melanoma occurs most frequently on the back in men and on the legs in women. In people with dark skin, melanoma is more common on the soles of the feet than on the sun-exposed areas of the body. The incidence of melanoma has increased in many countries in recent decades, but current figures indicate a levelling-off or even a decrease in younger age groups in countries with strong sun protection programs. Over the long term, sun exposure also causes photoageing of the skin, seen as wrinkling and freckling of the skin and the development of moles (naevi), brown spots (solar lentigines) and crusty lesions of the skin called actinic keratoses. UV radiation in both the UV-A and UV-B wavelengths are responsible, causing mutations in DNA and loss of the elastic fibres in the skin. Some of these changes, particularly actinic keratoses and numerous moles, are associated with an increased risk of skin cancers. Chronic exposure of the eye to UV radiation increases the risk of pterygium (surfer's eye) and cataract, both of which are irreversible. Pterygium is an invasive growth on the surface of the eye that may impair vision and require surgery (sometimes repeatedly). Cataracts are extremely common in older people and are at least partly caused by chronic exposure of the eye to UV radiation. Clouding of the lens of the eye progresses slowly and painlessly, leading to an increasing loss of vision and eventually blindness, if not treated surgically. Immune suppression resulting from chronic exposure to UV radiation may underlie the involvement of certain human papillomavirus types (that typically cause warts) in the formation of squamous cell carcinomas.24 Figure 8.1: Cold sores caused by reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus following exposure to solar UV-B radiation.

Norval (University of Edinburgh, Scotland). Box 8: UV-induced immune suppression When UV radiation reaches the skin, it is absorbed by specific molecules called chromophores. These initiate a cascade of events affecting the immune system that result in a decreased ability to respond to \"foreign\" challenges, such as invading microorganisms or tumour proteins, encountered within a short period of the exposure. The production of a range of immune mediators is altered, and specialised lymphocytes called T regulatory cells are induced. All of these changes lead to long-term suppression of immune responses to the specific challenge. 25 9.HOW WILL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT EXPOSURE OF HUMANS TO UV RADIATION? The effects of climate change on the amount of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface will be small. However warming temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns may affect the amount of time people spend outdoors and their use of sun protection, and thus the dose of UV radiation to which they are exposed. The risk of developing skin cancers, eye diseases and immune suppression depends on the dose of UV radiation reaching the relevant tissues. This in turn depends on the amount of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface and on the sun exposure behaviour of the individual: time spent in the sun and use of sun protection such as clothing, hats, sunscreen and sunglasses. As noted in previous sections, the effects of climate change on the amount of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface will be small. The major uncertainty is whether people will spend more or less time outdoors in the sun, and expose more or less skin to the sun, as temperatures rise, but humidity, storms, floods and droughts also increase. Trends in fashion, holiday locations and leisure activities will alsobe important in determining the amount of exposure to UV radiation that people receive in future years. There is some evidence that skin cancers develop more rapidly when ambient temperatures are higher, but the relevance of this finding to health effects of climate change is unclear at present. Altered levels of immune suppression, due to changes in the received dose of UV radiation may change vulnerability to infectious diseases and allergic diseases that also have changed in geographic and/or seasonal distribution as a result of climate change. At this time, the direction and magnitude of any such effects are highly speculative.26 10. HOW IS UV RADIATION GOOD FOR MY HEALTH? The best known benefit of exposure to solar UV radiation is production of vitamin D in the skin. In most regions of the world, humans obtain most of their vitamin D requirements from sun exposure. Many health benefits have been proposed for vitamin D. Exposure to UV radiation may also have beneficial effects through non-vitamin D pathways. Solar UV radiation can kill viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites in surface waters, making them safer to drink. Vitamin D is the precursor of a hormone that is essential in humans for the maintenance of good health, particularly of the musculoskeletal and immune systems. Although the diet of humans contains some items rich in vitamin D, such as oily fish and eggs, most vitamin D in the majority of people is produced by exposure of the skin to solar UV radiation (Figure 10). Vitamin D is synthesised most effectively when the sun is at its height in the summer months and in the middle of the day; little or none is synthesised in the early morning and late afternoon, or in mid-winter at latitudes higher than about 40 degrees (for example, Boston, USA 42\u00b0N; Madrid, Spain 40\u00b0N; Christchurch, New Zealand 43\u00b0S). Individuals with dark skin usually require more sun exposure than those with fair skin to make the same amount of vitamin D, and the production is less efficient in older people. It is important for many aspects of human health to maintain a sufficient level of vitamin D in the body. An assessment of this can be made by measuring the concentration of a vitamin D metabolite [25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D] in the blood. There is considerable controversy around the optimal blood level of 25(OH)D, although a level of more than 50nmol/L (20ng/ml) is commonly recommended. The active form of vitamin D is required in the body to maintain blood levels of calcium within a narrow range. The bones are a major store of calcium; vitamin D deficiency can result in release of calcium from the bones to maintain blood calcium levels, leading to defects in thebone that result in the diseases of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is controversial evidence currently that vitamin D deficiency may also increase the risk of a range of non-skeletal disorders. These include some internal cancers such as colorectal cancer, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes, infections such as tuberculosis and influenza, and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. While some reports indicate that vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of fractures, and possibly colorectal cancer, it has yet to be confirmed that increased exposure to solar UV-B radiation, affecting vitamin D status, can modulate the risk of these diseases. In addition to the possible protective effect of higher vitamin D status on the development of some autoimmune diseases, there is emerging evidence that sun exposure itself may have beneficial effects through non-vitamin D pathways. In some autoimmune diseases, there is over-activity of certain T lymphocytes in the immune system against specific elements of the body's own tissues. Through the immunosuppression pathways, sun exposure and vitamin D may reduce this response, thus providing protection. UV-B radiation is a potent disinfectant and naturally sterilises surface waters that may contain pathogenic microorganisms. Many people rely on surface waters for their drinking supplies, and the safety of these may depend on the dose of UV-B radiation (see also Question 14).27 Figure 10. Simplified metabolic pathway leading to production of the active form of vitamin D which binds to receptors on target cells, thus initiating a variety of genetic and cellular responses. 28 11. HOW MUCH EXPOSURE TO SOLAR UV RADIATION SHOULD I HAVE? Optimal sun exposure maximizes the beneficial effects and minimizes the adverse effects of exposure to UV radiation. Levels of UV radiation vary according to location (latitude, altitude and environment), season, time of day, cloudiness and levels of air pollution. People vary in their sensitivity to UV radiation, for both the beneficial and adverse effects of sun exposure, through differences in skin colour and a range of other genetically determined factors. There is no \"one-size-fits-all\" recommendation, but some guidance is given below. The intensity of UV-B radiation from the sun is highest at low latitude, in summer and during the hours around noon (about 11 am until 3M). Many news outlets and government websites report the daily UV Index (UVI) and issue alerts when high values are predicted. If you are outside, it is most important to avoid sunburn. The time taken to reach this point depends on many factors, including your ability to tan in response to exposure to the sun. The face is the most common place for skin cancers to develop, so when outside for more than brief casual exposures, wear a hat and protect your eyes. Hats with brims more than 10 cm wide are recommended for head and neck protection, and can reduce exposure of the eyes by up to 50%. The hood of a jacket and headwear with side-flaps can provide protection from UV-B irradiation to the side of the face and eyes. Wrap-around sunglasses are better at protecting the entire eye than conventional sunglasses with open sides (see Figures 11.1 and 11.2). Vitamin D is made most efficiently in the middle of the day, but this is also the time when UV radiation is most intense and there is thegreatest risk of sunburn. Brief casual exposures during the central hours of the day may not require sun protection; however sun protection is recommended when outside for longer periods, including during the middle of the day, if the forecast UVI is 3 or greater. Some textiles are highly effective at blocking the penetration of UV rays, but others are less so. If you can easily see through the fabric when you hold it up to the light, it is likely to be less effective at screening UV radiation. Sunscreens are effective but need to be applied at the stated concentration and re- applied frequently, especially after swimming. Often they are applied too sparingly. It is advisable to use a sunscreen with a SPF (sun protection factor) rating of at least 15 which provides protection against the sunburn caused by UV-B radiation, and which also includes protection against UV-A radiation (graded by up to 5 stars). It is particularly important to protect children from sunburn, episodes of which could lead to increased risk of skin cancer development in adulthood. People with darker skin need higher exposure to UV-B radiation to develop sunburn, and also to make vitamin D, than people with fairer skin.29 . Figure 11.1.

ARE THE REPLACEMENTS FOR OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES SAFE FOR HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT? The replacements for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) are tested for safety to health and the environment before they are approved for use and so far few problems have been found. Originally CFCs were thought to be safe for the environment, so there is always the possibility that safety issues could emerge the longer a product is used, the greater the volume that is produced, the more uses that are found, or with new findings about the environment. For example, when HFCs were proposed as substitutes for CFCs, the global warming potentials of such compounds were only just being conceptualized. Once such properties were recognized, it was realised that these compounds could only be a short-term solution and that they too would need to be replaced. Thus, there is a requirement to avoid complacency and to manage these substances responsibly. The Significant New Alternatives Program (SNAP) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates alternatives for ozone depleting substances prior to their use. Anyone planning to market or produce a substitute in the U.S. must provide notice to EPA of their intent, as well as providing health and safety information, before introducing it. Normally the health and safety information will include information on chemical and physical properties, flammability and basic toxicological information, and more recently, global warming potential. The SNAP program reviews the information in the context of the proposed use and issues one of four decisions: acceptable; acceptable subject to use conditions; acceptable subject to narrowed use limits; and unacceptable. The information on a particular compound is continually updated so that compounds may be proposed for additional uses or additional information may be added to the portfolio for a particular use and this could change the decision originally issued by the SNAP program. The HFCs and HCFCs that are replacements for the CFCs have a smaller effect on the ozone layer. The HFCs and HCFCs are largelydegraded before reaching the stratosphere. HFCs and HCFCs break down relatively rapidly into several products including the persistent substances such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and chlorodifluoroacetic acid. These compounds are washed from the atmosphere by precipitation and reach surface waters, along with other chemicals washed from the soil. In locations where there is little or no outflow and high evaporation (seasonal wetlands and salt lakes), the concentrations of these products are expected to increase over time. The effects of increased concentrations of naturally occurring mineral salts and other materials is likely to be greater and more biologically significant than those of breakdown products of the HFCs and HCFCs. TFA, a final degradation product of some HFCs and HCFCs, is very resistant to breakdown, and amounts deposited in flowing surface water will ultimately accumulate in the oceans. Based on estimates of current and future use of HFCs and HCFCs, additional inputs to the ocean will add only fractionally (less than 0.1%) to amounts already present from natural sources such as undersea vents and volcanic activity (Figure 12).31 Figure 12. Illustration of the formation of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) from HFCs and HCFCs in the lower atmosphere and the movement of the TFA into surface waters and the oceans.

UV-B radiation causes a wide range of responses in terrestrial ecosystems. Animals can move to avoid UV-B radiation but plants cannot. However, most plants (including agricultural and forest species) have mechanisms that provide some shielding from UV radiation. In some cases, increases in UV radiation are detrimental, for example, reducing production. However, some plant species have increased resistance to insect feeders when exposed to UV radiation, with a net result of decreased feeding on agricultural plants and greater productivity. a. How do plants protect themselves from UV-B radiation? Only a small portion of the UV-B radiation striking a plant penetrates into the inner tissues. The outer surface of the plant can be protected by light coloured hairs or waxes that reflect the UV-B radiation (Figure 13.1). Thicker leaves and stems (e.g. in succulents) also reduce the proportion of inner tissues exposed to UV-B radiation. In the majority of plant species tested, UV-B radiation induces the synthesis of compounds that act as sunscreens and prevent UV-B radiation from reaching sensitive biological components within the leaves. These protective screening compounds can be found inside the cells or bound to the cell walls (Figure 13.1). Even where screening of UV radiation is incomplete, plants have several mechanisms for repairing damage to vital biomolecules such as DNA, including one that uses sunlight to drive the repair reactions. This suite of protective mechanisms means that in general plants are able to protect themselves from increases in UV-B radiation especially if the plants are native to high radiation environments such as the tropics or high mountains (Figure 13.2). The present rate of global change is so rapid, however, that evolution may not keep up with it, particularly in high latitudes where temperature and UV-B radiation have increased dramatically over recent decades. InAntarctica and the southern tip of South America, plants adapted to environments with relatively low levels of UV-B radiation have been affected by the increased levels of UV-B radiation due to ozone depletion (see Figure 13.1). Although the negative impact of UV-B radiation on plant productivity is usually relatively small (about 6%), some species are more affected than others. Over time, these differences between species may lead to changes in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in regions like Antarctica where UV-B radiation is likely to remain elevated for many more decades (Figure 13.2). Another group of plants that may be more sensitive to UV-B radiation are agricultural plants that humans have moved from areas of low UV-B to high UV-B radiation e.g. from temperate to tropical regions. This is analogous to light-skinned humans moving to high radiation environments and becoming susceptible to higher rates of sun damage (see Question 8) or light skinned cattle being moved to tropical areas and being affected by UV- induced eye damage. Some varieties of these crops are UV-B-sensitive and produce reduced yields following an increase in UV-B radiation. It is possible to breed and genetically engineer UV-B tolerant crops so that crop losses are reduced. .33 Figure 13.1 Wax on the surface of cabbage plants protects the underlying leaf from high UV radiation (left). If UV radiation penetrates the leaf it can be removed by sunscreen compounds bound to the cell walls, highlighted in orange in this micrograph (right). Photographs Prof. S. Robinson and Dr L. Clarke, University of Wollongong, Australia. 34 Figure 13.2: Impacts of UV-B radiation on terrestrial ecosystems. Ozone depletion has led to higher UV fluxes over Antarctica with negative effects on some species of Antarctic plants, such as the mosses seen growing along this icy stream (RH panel). An example of the chemical structure of protective molecules produced by plants in response to UV radiation is shown in the centre. These compounds include the red pigments seen in lettuces (top left panel), while those shielded from UV are mostly green. Similarly, Antarctic mosses (bottom left) shielded by small stones are green (centre), while the plants around them produce protective red pigments. These compounds can be important components of our foods. (Photograph of lettuce from Prof. N. Paul, University of Lancaster, UK, others Prof. S. Robinson, University of Wollongong, Australia). 35 b. How is UV-B radiation beneficial to agriculture and food production? Some protective molecules produced by plants in response to natural UV-B radiation, are important in our food and medicinal plants. They can enhance the colour and flavour of food and increase its antioxidant activity. Such compounds are increasingly important to the food industry and horticulturalists often seek to enhance production by ensuring plants are exposed to sufficient UV-B radiation. Some of these changes in plant biochemistry induced by UV- B radiation can have further effects in agriculture, for example by influencing the interactions between crop plants and herbivorous insects. Under enhanced UV-B radiation, sunscreen compounds both protect the plant from the UV- B radiation directly and deter insects from eating the plant (herbivory). The change in biochemical composition can make the plant less attractive as food for herbivores (including for insect pests). The negative effect of UV-Bradiation on the food supply of plant-eating insects can be substantial. Some of the reduced consumption is due to direct effects of UV-B radiation on insects and some due to the changes in plant tissues induced by the UV-B radiation. This means that if UV-B radiation is higher, insects generally eat less plant material. In an agricultural context this may mean less insecticide is needed to deter agricultural pests. These effects on palatability also impact the food supply of animals at an ecosystem level. Another example of positive effects of UV radiation in the environment is UV vision which is used extensively by a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates, including birds, fish, insects, spiders, and other taxa, for critical life processes including mate selection and location of food resources. Some invertebrates are specifically able to detect and respond to UV-B radiation under natural conditions. . c. How far does UV penetrate - does it affect soil processes In addition to changing the palatability of plants, UV-induced compounds alter the speed at which leaf litter is broken down in the soil and thus the recycling of nutrients in the soil. Therefore UV radiation has impacts that go beyond individual plants and can affect ecosystem processes. Changes to plant composition, induced by UV-B radiation, have impacts on the animals and microbes (bacteria and fungi) that rely on plant matter for food. Sunscreen compounds and structural alterations, which allow leaves to withstand UV-B radiation while attached to the plant, can make leaves more fibrous and tougher to break down once they form leaf litter. UV-B radiation changes the composition of the microbes in thesoil and this can also influence how easily leaf litter is broken down. When plant litter is directly exposed to sunlight, it is degraded photochemically (photodegradation). The changes that occur at the plant level can influence underground decomposition. Decomposition of dead plant material (leaf litter) is a vital process, since it recycles carbon and nutrients making them available to growing plants. UV radiation affects decomposition indirectly via changes to leaf biochemistry and microbial diversity and directly through photodegradation. Changes to both microbial and photodegradation breakdown processes have important consequences for future carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.36 14. WHAT ARE THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF UV RADIATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND ORGANISMS? UV radiation can affect aquatic ecosystems and the metabolism of aquatic organisms both through direct exposure and via secondary effects from photochemical changes of nutrients and organic matter. Many of these effects interact with the changes induced by climate change. In the open water, the incoming solar radiation is attenuated and thus the part of the ecosystem that is affected is close to the surface. Most aquatic systems are stratified with an upper mixing layer where the photosynthesis occurs. Here the biomass is increasing and nutrients are consumed. In the layers below are organisms and organic matter that are consumed and nutrients are mineralised. This results in an upper sun- exposed, low-nutrient layer and a lower dark layer high in nutrients. The exchange between the layers is limited, depending on the strength of the temperature or salinity difference that separates the layers. As planktonic organisms circulate within the layers, the intensity of UV radiation to which the organisms are exposed will depend on the depth of the upper layer and the UV attenuation. Both these factors are affected by climate change. Increased temperature and increased fresh water inflow from melting glaciers and sea ice reduce the depth of the upper layer and thus the plankton organisms will be exposed to more UV radiation. It also makes the stability of the separation of the layers stronger, reducing the transport of nutrient to the upper layer. On the other hand, climate change will increase the runoff of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from land, reducing the UV intensity in lakes and in coastal waters. In addition, climate change reduces the area covered by sea ice in polar areas, and reduces the thickness of the ice. Still anotherconsequence from increased concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere is that more CO 2will dissolve in water and acidify it. One important consequence is that production of calcified outer scales, which protect the inner parts of some organisms from UV radiation, will be harmed. These functions show that interactions between UV radiation and climate change are numerous and not yet fully understood. Different organisms have different sensitivity for UV radiation, either through inherent differences in basic metabolism or through differences in their UV protection capacity (production of screening pigments or mechanisms to repair lesions). Thus exposure to UV radiation will change the species composition. This might propagate through higher levels in the food chain. Typically smaller organisms will be more susceptible than larger ones. Many protections against UV radiation are not constant but are induced and produced when organisms are exposed. Organisms living under low-UV conditions (for example in coastal areas with high concentration of DOM) are more sensitive than organisms from off-shore that are acclimatised to higher levels of UV radiation. Temperature increases and changes in nutrient concentration as a result of climate change might modify both the repair rate and the production of UV-absorbing compounds. This is because some of them, such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA), contain nitrogen, which commonly is a limiting nutrient in marine waters.37 15. WHAT ARE THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF UV RADIATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON WATER QUALITY? Climate change, involving increases in temperature and the frequency and intensity of precipitation, is altering ice and snow cover as well as the UV transparency and mixing regimes of inland and oceanic waters. These changes are influencing the exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation, altering the structure and function of aquatic food webs, and decreasing the ability of solar UV radiation to disinfect pathogens and parasites of humans and wildlife. Most groups of aquatic organisms are susceptible to the negative sub lethal as well as lethal effects of solar UV radiation. In addition, there is increasing recognition that parasites and pathogens of humans and wildlife are sensitive to damage by solar UV radiation. Thus UV radiation in natural sunlight has the beneficial effect of disinfecting surface waters by killing free-living stages of parasites and pathogens (Figure 15.1). Exposure to sunlight can decrease viral infections in Atlantic salmon by many orders of magnitude, as well as decrease fungal infections in both amphibians and important zooplankton grazers. Thus aquatic food webs are being altered by both direct UV damage and by solar UV disinfection of parasites and pathogens. Climate change is leading to a warmer and wetter world on average, though extreme events and regional variation that result in extreme droughts and floods are major concerns. Increasing concentrations of the tea- coloured dissolved organic matter (DOM), washed in from terrestrial ecosystems, can also decrease the UV transparency of surface waters following rain and runoff events (Fig. 15.2). Heavy precipitation events also wash more parasites and pathogens into surface waters and drinking water supplies. The outbreaks of infectious diseases that often follow extreme precipitation events are likely related to these increases in runoff as well as to decreases in water transparency. Higher concentrations of DOM in many regions of Europe and North America are leading to an increase in the cost of water purification as treatment facilities often have to be upgraded.Both warmer and wetter conditions associated with climate change are increasing the strength of vertical temperature gradients, or \"thermal stratification\" in lakes and oceans. Reductions in winter snow cover, later freeze dates in early winter and earlier ice-out dates in freshwater and marine environments are causing longer periods of exposure to solar UV radiation as well as more intense thermal stratification. The surface temperatures of large lakes and oceans are getting warmer, and deeper waters in lakes are often getting cooler. The wind- mixed warmer surface waters are also often shallower as a result of the increased thermal stratification. In regions where the shallower mixed layer are caused by increases in DOM and subsequent decreases in water transparency, the effectiveness of disinfection by solar UV irradiation is reduced. Good examples include reductions in the viability of human parasites such as Cryptosporidium as well as decreases in potentially lethal fungal pathogens of both amphibians and zooplankton with increasing UV exposure (Figure 15.1). The reductions in light levels at deeper depths will, at the same time, also lead to oxygen depletion and larger and more frequent \"dead zones\". In contrast, in regions where the shallower mixed waters are caused by warming air temperatures, water transparency is increasing (Figure 15.2), natural solar disinfection is more effective, and oxygen depletion is less likely. These changes in thermal stratification, UV exposure, and oxygen depletion, are influencing the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs), the distribution and abundance of fish38 species, and the plankton and other species that comprise the critically important lower levels of the food web.

DOES EXPOSURE TO SOLAR UV RADIATION ALTER THE USEFUL LIFETIME OF BUILDING MATERIALS? Solar UV radiation decreases the useful lifetime of some plastics and wood materials used in building construction. The useful life of wood, plastic and wood- plastic composite products used in the exterior of buildings is determined primarily by degradation caused by exposure to solar UV radiation. The affected products include structural and decorative wood products as well the cladding (siding), exposed plastic pipes, plastic roofing membranes and plastic glazing. Figure 16.1 shows the cross-section of a PVC plastic window frame used in residential buildings. These plastics are easily degraded by UV-B radiation resulting in uneven discoloration, surface release of fillers or 'chalking', reduced impact strength and development of surface cracks. Acceptable lifetimes are possible only because very efficient UV-stabilizers are incorporated as additives. Wood used in building applications undergoes UV-induced degradation of the cellulose, rendering the surface increasingly hydrophilic. This encourages colonization of the surface by fungal species that can break down the wood. (Figure 16.2). Absorbed water can stress and damage the wood during freeze-thaw cycles. Wood used in outdoor applications is either chemically treated or surface coated with polymer-based paints to mitigate this problem. The coatings themselves deteriorate and have to be replaced several times during the service life of the wood. This is also true of the wood- plastic composites where the wood fraction is photolabile. The photodegradation processes in wood and plastic progress faster at higher levels of UV-B radiation and at higher temperatures.Therefore, the 2 - 6\u00b0C increase in surface temperatures suggested by the climate models will shorten their service lives even further. Possible synergistic effects of the combination of UV radiation and higher temperatures are not fully understood for both plastics and wood materials. The effects will be most severe in places with high rainfall and high air pollution, both of which tend to accelerate the degradation. Any increase in UV-B radiation as a result of a decrease in the stratospheric ozone layer will increase the rates of degradation, shortening the service lifetime. However, with both wood and plastics, this can be compensated for by either using higher amounts of UV-stabilizer levels or using better UV-resistant alternatives. Even taking into account the potential for a few degrees increase in ambient temperatures, available high-efficient stabilizers should be able to maintain service lifetimes at the present levels. (Figure 16.3). Dark-coloured plastics exposed to sunlight reach a much higher bulk temperature under present conditions compared to white or light-coloured plastics, but can still be effectively stabilized. There are also classes of plastics, varieties of wood and better surface coatings available that can be substituted for existing materials as well. There is invariably a cost associated with mitigating the effects of increased levels of solar UV radiation and/or increased temperature due to climate change. In such situations the cost of some plastic and wood products in construction will rise.40 Figure 16.1. Cross-section of a rigid PVC window frame used in residential building. PVC is the most-used plastic in building construction where it is used in residential siding, pipes, window frames and gutters. Rigid PVC meant for outdoor use has rutile titanium dioxide mineral powder incorporated in it. This oxide absorbs solar UV radiation and helps reduce the light-induced yellowing, chalking and weakening of the plastic material. Picture supplied by Anthony L. Andrady. Figure 16.2. Unprotected wood surfaces that are damaged by solar UVR can easily undergo biodegradation by wood-rot fungi. The light induced damage renders the surface more hydrophilic making it easier for bacteria and fungi to degrade the material. Coating the wood can often control the deterioration of wood by solar radiation. Adding UV stabilizers to the coating can make it even more effective in protecting the wood. Picture supplied by Anthony L. Andrady. Figure 16.3. The main agencies that promote the environmental degradation of materials used outdoors are shown in the upper part of the figure. The most important of these is solar UV Radiation. The techniques used to mitigate these effects are shown in the lower part of the figure with the two primary strategies of using light- stabilizers and coatings highlighted as they are the most effective in protecting the wood. 41 17. WILL THE USEFUL OUTDOOR SERVICE LIFETIME OF A MATERIAL AT ONE LOCATION BE APPLICABLE FOR ITS USE AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION? Generally, any estimate of the service lifetime of a material used outdoors, determined for one geographical location, will not be the same at a different location. This is because the levels of UV radiation and temperature the major determinants of service lifetime are different at different locations. Damage induced by UV radiation to outdoor materials, such as plastics and paints, is primarily governed by the cumulative dose received over the course of their lifetimes. As previously noted, solar UV radiation at Earth's surface is primarily UV-A with a small proportion of UV-B, and the annual dose of UV radiation depends on location. Thus, latitudes within the tropics, where the noon solar elevation gets close to the zenith throughout the year, receive much higher annual doses of UV radiation than high latitude sites, where winter doses of UV radiation are small compared with summer doses. Generally, the closer the site is to the equator, the greater theannual dose of UV radiation, and therefore the shorter the serviceable lifetime of the material. This may be exacerbated if damage is accelerated at higher temperatures. Figure 17 shows a compilation of UV-A and UV-B data (and their ratios) from a selection of sites where the highest quality UV measurements are available.42 Figure 17. Latitudinal variability in UV-A and UV-B radiation. Altitudes of locations are shown. Although doses of UV radiation are larger in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) than at corresponding latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the difference is much less marked than for the peak irradiances, which can be 40% greater in the SH compared with the NH. Generally, the annual dose decreases with latitude, with stronger latitudinal gradients in the UV-B region than in the UV-A region, even allowing for differences in altitude between these sites, which can account for differences of approximately 5% per 1000m (i.e., 15% more UV at Mauna Loa and 10% more at Boulder). Most of these sites are relatively clean, but aerosol extinctions have a significant effect at some, such as Tokyo. These results imply that UV doses in the latitude greater than 30\u00b0 in each hemisphere generally are significantly less than for sites within the latitude range from 30\u00b0 S to 30\u00b0 N, a range which corresponds to half the area of the globe. 43 18. TO WHAT EXTENT IS UV RADIATION TRANSMITTED THROUGH MATERIALS? Solar UV-B radiation is blocked by glass as well as by most fabric materials but UV-A is transmitted to varying extents. About 5% of the solar radiation reaching Earth's surface is within the UV wavelengths. Protecting ourselves, and objects of value, from the damaging effects of the UV radiation is important. Some materials effectively block the UV radiation and provide such protection. All types of glass very effectively screen out the UV-B radiation, the most damaging spectral region in sunlight. The same is not true of UV- A; different grades of glass transmit UV-A to different degrees. Laminated glass in double- glazed laminated glass windows or used in vehicles as windshields or windows is most effective, allowing less than 2% of the UV-A radiation to pass through. Clear glass or tinted glass windows allow 20-53% of UV-A radiationto pass through depending on the type and thickness. Fabrics are also good filters of UV radiation depending on how tightly woven they are and the textile type. A tighter weave results in less free space through which UV rays can pass. Generally, cotton (grey or bleached) offers more protection than synthetic fibres at the same tightness of weave. Wet fabrics where the interstices are filled with water are less protective. Fabrics can be dyed or made of particle-filled synthetic fibres to obtain even better protection from both UV-A and UV-B radiation.44 19. HOW DOES OZONE DEPLETION AFFECT AIR POLLUTION AND VICE VERSA? Variations in stratospheric ozone and climate change will modify concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere, which play a significant role in the health of both humans and Earth's environment. Globally, outdoor air pollution is estimated to lead to 850,000 premature deaths each year, mostly from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The cost of crop damage in the U.S. from air pollution is estimated to be 6.1 billion dollars annually. In some locations, air pollution is made worse by interactions between UV radiation and changes in climate. These problems are expected to continue and worsen in the future, thus increasing risks to humans directly and to the supply of food. Variations in stratospheric ozone and climate change are important drivers of changes in the production and fate of air pollutants. Solar UV radiation provides the energy for many of the chemical transformations that occur in the atmosphere. Solar UV irradiation changes thechemistry or breaks down a number of important atmospheric gases, e.g., nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and ozone. These processes will be altered by anything that changes the amount of UV radiation such as attenuation by clouds and particulate pollutants in the air, both of which will be affected by changes in climate. Decreased stratospheric ozone and increasing temperature from climate change are expected to lead to greater concentrations of ozone close to the surface of the Earth in polluted regions, resulting in an increased mortality rate that could exceed that resulting from climate-related increases in storms and flooding. The quality of the air in less-polluted areas is expected to improve but will not fully offset the damage in polluted regions, in terms of human disease burden.45 20. WHAT IS GEOENGINEERING? Geoengineering is described as technologies that aim to alter the climate system in order to counter climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set up a panel to investigate geoengineering in 2011 with the results detailed in the latest IPCC report. The technologies can be divided into two groups (Figure 20): Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CDR) that would result in slower, or even reverse, projected increases in future CO 2concentrations by accelerating the natural removal of atmospheric CO 2and increasing the storage of carbon in reservoirs. The main removal methods are: A. Ocean fertilization: Adding nutrients to the ocean which increases oceanic productivity in the surface ocean and transports a fraction of the resulting biogenic carbon downward, B. Alkalinity addition to the ocean: Adding alkalinity from solid minerals to the ocean, which causes more atmospheric CO 2to dissolve in the ocean, C. Accelerated weathering: Increasing the weathering rate of silicate rocks and transporting the dissolved carbonate minerals to the ocean, D. Direct air capture: Capturing atmospheric CO 2chemically, and storing it either underground or in the ocean, E. Biomass energy with carbon capture: Burning biomass at electric power plants with carbon capture, and the captured CO 2 is stored either underground or in the ocean, and F. Afforestation: Capturing CO 2through afforestation and reforestation to be stored in land ecosystems.Solar Radiation Management (SRM) that would counter the warming associated with increasing greenhouse gasses by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed. The main methods are: G. Deployment of space mirrors: Placing reflectors into space to reflect solar radiation, H. Stratospheric aerosol injection: Injecting aerosols in the stratosphere, e.g. sulphur dioxide, I. Marine cloud brightening: Seeding marine clouds to make them more reflective, J. Ocean brightening with microbubbles: Producing microbubbles at the ocean surface to make it more reflective, K. Crop brightening: Growing more reflective crops, and L. Whitening rooftops: Painting roofs and other built structures in light colours. The CDR methods will not influence the surface UV radiation but the SRM methods will, depending on the specific method used. The first three should reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface but the last three will increase the UV radiation received by an object by reflecting radiation to the sides of the object. Stratospheric sulphate aerosols from volcanic eruptions and natural emissions deplete stratospheric ozone. Stratospheric aerosols introduced for SRM are expected to have the same effect and the resulting ozone depletion will increase the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface of the Earth, with potential damage to terrestrial and marine ecosystems and to human health.46 The IPCC evaluation of geoengineering came to the following conclusion: \" CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO 2emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a globaltemperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. \" Figure 21: Overview of some proposed geoengineering methods that have been suggested.

WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL? Without the successful and continued implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments and adjustments, stratospheric ozone would have continued to decline globally, and levels of UV-B radiation would have consequently continued to increase dramatically, leading to severe environmental effects. The objective of the Montreal Protocol is the protection of the ozone layer through control of the global production and consumption of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs). Projections of the future quantities of ODSs expressed as equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) values are shown below (Figure 21.1) for the mid-latitude stratosphere for the scenarios of no Protocol and the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments and adjustments. EESC is a relative measure of the potential for stratospheric ozone depletion that combines the contributions of chlorine and bromine fromsurface observations of concentrations of ODSs in the stratosphere. Without the Protocol, EESC values have been projected to increase significantly in the 21st century (Black curve). Only with the Copenhagen (1992) and subsequent Amendments and Adjustments did projected and measured EESC values show a long-term decrease. Since there is an inverse relationship between the amount of ozone and the amount of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface one can expect the levels of UV radiation on the surface to decline as is illustrated in figure 21.2 using the UVI as indicator.48 Figure 22.1: The observed (solid red line) and predicted (dashed red line) effects of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments. The black line is a projection of the situation without the Montreal Protocol. (Figure provided by Dr P J Aucamp based on the 2014 report of the Scientific Assessment Report) Figure 21.2: The observed (to 2014) and predicted effects of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments. In 2065, the summer UVI would have increased to three times the 1975 values, and the wintertime UVI in 2065 would have been comparable to summertime UVI in 1975. 49 22. ARE THE CONTROL MEASURES IN THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL WORKING? WHAT IS THE WORLD WE AVOIDED? a. Has the phase-out of ODSs changed levels of UV radiation? The Montreal Protocol has been very successful. The Montreal Protocol for the Protection of the Ozone Layer is the most successful environmental international agreement to date. It has been ratified by all of the 197 countries of the UN. All the CFCs have been phased out since January 2010. The phase-out of the HCFCs is on schedule and has been advanced. The detail of the phase-out achieved and the predictions of future halocarbon concentrations in the stratosphere can be found in the Scientific Assessment Panel's 2014 report. Stratospheric ozone is no longer decreasing and is predicted to return to pre-1980 values before 2050 at mid-latitudes and a few years later at high latitudes. Concentrations of the ODSs have been decreasing for over ten years, and are expected to continue to decrease in the future (Figure 22.1 and 22.2).A future scenario in which ODSs were not regulated and production grew at an annual rate of 3% was simulated in a study of the \"world avoided\" by the success of the Montreal Protocol. By 2020, 17% of the globally- averaged column ozone in 1980 would have been destroyed, with depletion increasing to more than 60% by 2060 (Figure 22.2). Decreases in stratospheric ozone due to increasing CFCs would have led to a marked increase in UV radiation, with the UV Index possibly trebling at mid-latitudes by 2065. In view of what is known about the effects of excess UV radiation exposure, this would have had serious environmental consequences. In Polar regions, substantial ozone depletion would have become year-round rather than seasonal, resulting in large increases in surface UV radiation, including during the summer months.50 Figure 22.1: The past and predicted future concentrations of halocarbons in the stratosphere (Figure provided by Dr P J Aucamp based on the 2014 report of the Scientific Assessment Report) Figure 22.2: Prediction of the UVI indicating what could have happened in the absence of a Montreal Protocol (Adapted from Figure 5.11 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2010). 51 b. What effect has the phase-out of ODSs had on the climate? As a result of the phase-out schedules of the Montreal Protocol, the global production and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons has decreased significantly. However, the sustained growth in demand for refrigeration, air-conditioning and insulating foam products in developing countries has led to an increase in the consumption and emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Consequently the use of HCFCs and HFCs as replacements for CFCs and halons has increased. The HCFCs are low-ozone-depletion-potential substitutes for high-ozone-depletion-potential substances, particularly CFCs and halons, and were classified under the Protocol as \"transitional substitutes\" for the time it takes to commercialize new ozone-safe alternatives and replacements. Ultimately, HCFCs will bephased out globally under the Montreal Protocol leaving much of the application demand for refrigeration, air conditioning, heating and thermal-insulating foam production to be met by HFCs, HFOs and other replacement products. The demand for HCFCs and/or HFCs in many applications is expected to increase. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer but, along with CFCs and HCFCs, are greenhouse gases that contribute to the radiative forcing of climate. Thus, the transition away from ozone depleting substances (ODSs) has implications for future climate. HFCs are in the \"basket of gases\" regulated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a global treaty to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by developed countries.
