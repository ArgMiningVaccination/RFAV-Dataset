As Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent, states in the article, \"They [researchers] reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.\" However, after manufacturers halted the major use of thimerosal in vaccines in 1999, the researchers' theory did not prove to be correct. In fact, from 2004 to 2007, the rate of autism in California raised from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children. Doesn't this show skeptic Americans anything? If we actually continued to be cynical about the situation and stopped using thimerosal as a preservative, what would make our vaccines safe to use? Hope?

Your child is young and innocent and you want them to be protected from all illnesses. The doctor asks if you want your child to be vaccinated. You do a search about the risks from getting vaccinated and you learn that it supposedly can cause autism. Even though you know that you want your child to live a healthy life Imagine this, you have had your first child. You want to protect your child at all costs. Your child is young and innocent and you want them to be protected from all illnesses. The doctor asks if you want your child to be vaccinated. You do a search about the risks from getting vaccinated and you learn that it supposedly can cause autism. Even though you know that you want your child to live a healthy life, you don't want to possibly give them autism. The question still remains, do vaccines cause autism? Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder Summary of \"Vaccines Cause Autism\" In the article, \"Vaccines Cause Autism,\" Michael Snyder, an attorney and writer, attempts to convince parents of young children that autism is directly linked to childhood vaccinations. He claims that numerous toxins, including thimerosal, are present in vaccines that are forced into the bloodstream, later causing neurological and brain damage to children. He says that autism has risen by 78 percent over the past decade, and that 1/88 children in the US have an autistic disorder. Snyder believes that most autistic individuals start out completely normal, and that the vaccinations they are given are harming them. He blames the pharmaceutical companies for being too Some parental concerns persist that vaccines may cause Autism. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed throughout the years. There is a major worldwide increasing rate of Autism diagnoses. Theories have centered on measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines being administered. Studies have showed that Childhood Vaccines Lead to Autism, Fact? Or Fiction? \"Today one in every 150 children has been diagnosed on the autism spectrum; 20 years ago that statistic was one in 10,000\" (Mooney, 2009, p. 58). There are many vaccines that are administered to children today that protect them from measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, tetanus, invasive Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) infections, etc. (Miller & Reynolds, 2009, p. 167). Among these and many other diseases children are currently being vaccinated against 14 diseases, and these take place from infancy until the start of kindergarten. These childhood vaccinations are given as early as they can be to make sure the children are protected against any diseases that can occur in their The topic of the article is the connection (or lack of) between childhood vaccines (MMR) and autism. Contrary to popular opinion, vaccines are not linked to autism in any shape or form and there is no scientific evidence to support it. For recurrent generations, there encompasses numerous controversies surrounding vaccinations for children in addition to the unfavorable reactions that may arise. The chief concerns are whether vaccinating causes serious developmental delays such as autism in children. The aim of this composition is to enlighten others that vaccinating children does not bring about autism. By means of scientific exploration along with advanced medical diagnosis in children, researchers currently recognize that the increase in autism claims are not vaccine linked. Science or Pseudoscience? I. Vaccines & Autism Do Vaccines cause Autism? II. Abstract Do vaccines cause autism is a question that has been bouncing around for over twenty years. The increase in the number of diagnosed cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder has increased significantly and due to the impact this has in people's lives Summary of \"Vaccines and Autism\" In the journal of \"Vaccines and Autism\" author Bernard Rimland looks at the possible role of vaccines in autism. Rimland provides crucial data in understanding autism, the possible role of vaccines in autism, and the risks of vaccines in certain children. Rimland states before Vaccination Safety In a country where health and safety are top priority all across the nation, America has recently had an epidemic. Everyone is worried about the safety concerns about their children getting vaccinated. There are many fears of vaccinations amongst our country, despite the fears, vaccinations are quite safe Ever since the invention of vaccines, there has been debates going on between whether or not vaccines cause autisms. In the past couple of decades, there has been a decrease in children receiving vaccines by the autism fright. The dispute between vaccination still continue even to this day even though the claim that vaccines cause autism have been proven by research as false while the benefits of vaccines have outweighed the risks. Vaccines protect small children from life threatening diseases but build their immune system to help in defending Globally, there has been an increase in ASD diagnoses and medical professionals don't know what's causing it. The sudden surge of autism cases have people worried; some even speculate that vaccines are the cause for it. In turn, the mystery spread fears amongst parents and refuse to vaccinate their children. Here is why vaccines don't cause autism and the reason why autism cases seem to be on the rise. In spite of false claims linking thimerosal to autism, several studies show that thimerosal does not have any link to autism and it is rather safe for the body to metabolize. When thimerosal enters the body, it is metabolized to two components, ethylmercury and thiosalicylate. Both ethylmercury and thiosalicylate are readily eliminated from the body and do not build up to harmful levels. Methylmercury, however, is slightly neurotoxic and has the potential to build up for it is not as readily excreted from the body. Methylmercury is readily absorbed into the body through consuming seafood and is found in tiny trace amounts of thimerosal. 4 autism were studied, it was suggested that measles was related to autism. Seven years later they did another study that involved 4000 children and found just the opposite, shots had no connection to causing a person to receive the diagnosis of autism\".

Enders finally licensed his vaccine for measles. Prior to this vaccine the United States alone reported 4 million cases of the measles each year. With more scientific discoveries the measles vaccine today has evolved "}
