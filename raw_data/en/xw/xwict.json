As nature begins to awaken and blossom around us, we must also align ourselves with the bright energy of spring and make a fresh start. Spring Cleansing with Chinese Medicine By living in harmony with our natural environment and adapting as the seasons change, we can channel the qualities of spring to promote longevity and overall well-being. The arrival of spring brings invigorating energy, inspires personal growth, and is the ideal time for cleansing and rejuvenating practices. To achieve optimal health this spring: Support Your Liver Each season in traditional Chinese medicine is associated with one of the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water) and complementary yin and yang organs. Spring rules the Wood Element and is associated with the Liver (yin) and Gallbladder (yang). Wood energy is active and energetic, inspiring us to be creative. The Liver and Gallbladder are responsible for the smooth flow of blood and Qi (the vital energy that flows throughout the body) and the release of emotion. To ensure we can access the energy of spring, we must avoid Qi stagnation and support the Liver. However, environmental toxins, coffee, alcohol, refined sugars, and processed foods can all contribute to poor Liver function and Qi imbalances. Adjusting your diet to align with seasonal changes and starting a cleanse can help renew and revitalize your body from the inside out. Seasonal Diet In traditional Chinese medicine, the color green is associated with spring and the Liver. Activate and nourish your Liver Qi with fresh green and leafy vegetables, sour foods, and whole grains. While we often find ourselves craving hearty meals in winter, incorporating lighter meals and seasonal herbs in spring will help cleanse and detoxify the Liver and support energy flow.

Detox & Cleanse Traditional Chinese medicine presents a philosophy of harmony between humans and nature. If our health and well-being are entwined with the cycles of nature, it follows that we are at our healthiest when we are in deep harmony with seasonal changes. Spring is a time of upward and expansive movement, creative energy, and renewal, and we should engage in activities that boost energy and put our creativity into motion. It is the perfect time to begin a new routine and let go of stimulants, such as coffee or alcohol. Whether your goal is to reduce alcohol, sugar, or coffee consumption, Arogya [Tea Cleanses](https://www.arogya.net/shop/tea-cleanse) can help reset your habits and guide your body back to its natural balance. Guided detoxes and cleanses offer support and invigorate your body and mind during lifestyle changes. |DETOX PROGRAM: Try Arogya's | Encourage Qi Flow & Circulation Anatomically, the Liver is the largest internal organ and is responsible for filtering and cleansing all of the substances that enter our body, as well as managing blood sugar, fat storage, and hormone levels. On an energetic level, the Liver is responsible for regulating the flow of Qi. When our Qi is flowing freely and our Liver functioning well, we journey through life smoothly without emotional imbalance or buildup of toxins and tension. However, in our modern, fast-paced lifestyle, Liver disharmony and stagnation have become quite common. There are several treatments based on the principles of Chinese medicine that aim to increase the functionality of the Liver and circulation throughout the entire body. Acupressure and acupuncture adjust the flow of Qi to restore harmony and lymphatic drainage techniques stimulate both energetic and lymphatic circulation. With these therapies, blocked Qi that may remain from winter is released, energy flows smoothly, and health is restored. Acupressure In traditional Chinese medicine, Qi is the essential life force that flows through the body on channels known as meridians and there are key physical points on the body where Qi can be accessed and manipulated. [Acupressure massages](https://www.arogya.net/massage-body-work#massage-therapy) seek to stimulate these points in order to remove energy blockages and regulate the flow of Qi. Arogya's acupressure treatments can be combined with reflexology and aromatherapy for a session that relaxes and reboots your entire system. Acupuncture An [acupuncture tune-up](https://www.arogya.net/acupuncture) can help harmonize your mind and body, so you can enjoy spring without emotional or physical ailments. Our bodies are designed to maintain proper balance, but we tend to not pay attention to the warning signs until we experience pain or illness. Emphasizing healing of the whole person, acupuncture helps to normalize the circulation of energy in the body by removing blockages and eradicating deficiencies, while also enhancing overall vitality. Regular acupuncture sessions guide the body back toward homeostasis, providing harmony throughout each season of the year. Lymphatic Drainage The lymphatic system is instrumental in protecting us from disease and assists the immune system in removing toxins from the body. [Lymphatic drainage massages](https://www.arogya.net/massage-body-work#lymphatic-drainage) seek to improve energy flow, relieve tension, and stimulate lymphatic function and circulation. Arogya now offers treatments with the [Phyto 5 Biorhythmic Drainer](https://www.phyto5.us/the-biodraineur-by-phyto5), or \"Biodraineur\". The Biodraineur reproduces the gentle movement of a manual lymphatic drainage massage and focuses on moving stagnant energy and boosting the flow of lymph. The Biodraineur comes with cups in various sizes that can be applied to the face, back, or other areas of the body. The massage therapist guides the cups as the machine's pumps alternate between sucking and releasing skin layers. With similar benefits to a traditional cupping treatment, the Biodraineur's cupping function helps eliminate impurities, improve circulation, alleviate pain and inflammation, and encourage the flow of Qi. Decluttering & Feng Shui Spring cleaning is not only about dusting and organizing; a cluttered living space can negatively impact the flow of Qi in your home, leading to stagnant energy and stress. Clearing our indoor spaces of old or forgotten things can help clear our minds and bring peace and clarity. Incorporating feng shui principles into spring cleaning is a way to facilitate mental and emotional cleansing and align ourselves with the joyous spirit of spring. Spring Clean the Feng Shui Way At its core, feng shui explores the connection and flow of energy between the individual and their environment. The goal is to direct and promote energy flow in a way that brings balance, comfort, and harmony into your space and life. Here are a few simple ways to infuse your space with spring's powerful energy: - Let spring inside. On warmer days, open all the windows and let in the fresh air and sunshine. Fresh air flowing through the house can release unwanted, stagnant energy, and basking in natural light allows us to sync with the natural rhythms of nature. - Add houseplants. Decorating with plants is a great way to introduce the wood element to your space and integrate spring's stimulating energy of growth and action. Plants help improve air quality and add life-affirming Qi to your home. - Decorate with jade. With a long history of use in feng shui, [Chinese jade coins](https://www.arogya.net/wellness/chinese-jade-coin)represent health, wealth, and prosperity. Place these charms around your home to attract abundance and good vibrations. CLEANING TIP: Learn how to create your own [natural cleaning products](https://blog.arogya.net/the-cleansing-wonders-of-baking-soda-vinegar/), without harsh chemicals or toxins. The ascending and expansive energies of spring encourage us to embrace new ideas and lifestyle habits and release emotions or items that no longer serve us. There is no better time to start thinking about how you can overcome blockages to grow and expand on a physical, mental, and spiritual level.
