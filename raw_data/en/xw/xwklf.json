Although it consists of complex theories, meanings, and patterns it is essentially about energy flow. We need energy to flow in our bodies to enable all of our systems and organs to work effectively. We need our blood to flow. We need to eat nutritious food and breathe clean air and we need to have toxins in our systems excreted regularly. Otherwise, a more and more toxic environment is created. Working toward proper, optimal energy flow in our bodies is working toward wellness in our bodies. Acupuncture is a very effective way to encourage this flow of energy. Stress, injury, trauma, and negligence are some of the things that stop or hinder the movement or flow. Everyone experiences these to some extent. The longer the imbalances are ignored the more severe the disharmony can become, possibly creating illness, pain, allergies, insomnia, depression, anxiety, digestive disorders, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, IBS, female disorders, auto immune disorders, migraine headaches, TMJ syndrome, learning disabilities, and many more. Acupuncture can work to prevent imbalances from creating illness and pain. It can help bring someone who has pain or is experiencing illness to reverse or manage their situation. When a person has an illness and needs Western Medical attention they are advised to seek out and get that help. Acupuncture may be done as an adjunct to traditional Allopathic Medical care.
