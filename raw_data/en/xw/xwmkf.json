Talk to your child's doctor about how long you might wait before you see results. What are follow-up requirements and options? Follow-up care can vary. Because there are many options with integrative medicine, your child may need few or a lot of follow-up visits. It depends on the treatment plan you and the doctor have made for your child. You will want to make at least one visit to review the plan and how it worked.
