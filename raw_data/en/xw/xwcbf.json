An integrative approach with us might just be what you need for overall wellness. Here's what you should know about integrative therapies for managing symptoms of concussions. What is a Concussion? Caused by physical trauma to either the head or entire body, a concussion is a brain injury that causes the brain to rapidly move within the skull. This sudden movement can cause injury to the brain and its cells. It is also commonly known as a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Concussions can occur as a result of car accidents, falling down, or when playing sports. Some patients may not experience symptoms of a concussion until several days after the injury. Common symptoms of concussions include: - headache that does not subside - dizziness - fatigue - tinnitus - nausea and vomiting - decreased coordination - slurred speech - dazed - loss of consciousness - changes to mood and emotions Treating Concussions There are multiple benefits to undergoing an integrative treatment plan for managing your concussion symptoms. First off, integrative therapies are non-invasive and drug-free approaches that ensure an increase in quality of life. Licensed professionals known as physiatrists use certified processes to diagnose, prevent, and treat traumatic brain injuries. They use personalized plans that are individual from one patient to the next and depend on the severity of your symptoms. What to Expect During an Integrative Concussion Session If you've never had an integrative treatment for a concussion before, you might wonder what to expect during the appointment. A licensed healthcare provider at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking detailed questions about your injury and the symptoms you are currently experiencing. Your initial appointment can last as long as three hours and involve multiple experts to evaluate your symptoms. They may conduct a series of neurological exams to check your cognitive and motor functions, as well as your memory and ability to think. Expect to also have an imaging test, depending on your symptoms. Based on your results, a treatment plan that's individual to you will be created. Rest is a crucial part of any approach as your brain needs time to heal on its own. Regular rehabilitation appointments for several weeks are a normal part of any integrative treatment plan for traumatic brain injuries.
