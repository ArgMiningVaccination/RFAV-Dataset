Kinesiology is the science of energy balancing & is grounded in the science of anatomy & physiology. As used in the complimentary health & natural medicine field Kinesiology is defined as the use of muscle testing to identify imbalances in the body's structural, chemical, emotional & other energy to establish the body's priority healing needs. A fundamental premise of Kinesiology is that the body has an innate healing ability & is doing the best it can to heal itself. Always the answer is somewhere within us. Muscle monitoring is a natural feedback system which receives information via nerve pathways & the meridian system, of the brain & body which give instant access to holistic information held by the entire mind-body system. In a Kinesiology session, muscle monitoring is used to access neural control & thought process in addition to information from the musculoskeletal system. This results in the ability to identify stressors & limiting thought patterns specific to an individual & in this way Kinesiology taps into energies that other modalities do not assess. Connect your inner wisdom to balance your Mind-Body-Spirit Kinesiology aims to assist with: - Structural & biomechanical issues - Muscle bone & joint pain - Sports Injuries - Fears & phobias - Fatigue, tiredness & insomnia As well as: - Nervous disorders & emotional issues - Overcoming past traumas - Building your personal power - Positive realisation of your own unique potential - Overall wellbeing Kinesiology does not treat or diagnose named diseases, nor does it prescribe. Kinesiology is concerned with imbalances in the body's energy. KINESIOLOGY Each Kinesiology balance is unique & honours the persons own healing potential and aims to alleviate stress and energy imbalances. An unlocking muscle test indicates a disturbed energy flow - be it structural, chemical, nutritional, mental, emotional or spiritual. Kinesiology identifies where and why a function is blocked and then facilitates a release that honours the persons own healing process. This session includes 60 minutes of Kinesiology balancing.
