But those chemicals are what keep us germ and grime-free, right? Natural cleaning products might not have the same caustic materials, but that doesn't mean they're any less effective. In fact, many green products are more effective than other products on the market. [Pacesetter Homes](https://www.pacesetterhomestexas.com/) put together a few of the benefits you will enjoy when you make the switch to all-natural cleaning. You'll Keep Your Whole Family Safe Non-natural cleaning products contain toxic chemicals that can cause all types of problems, from triggering asthma attacks to damaging your lungs, throat, nose, and eyes. Breathing in harsh chemicals from standard cleaning products can cause real long-term health problems as well. Additionally, young children are always at risk of getting into cleaning supplies. Green products present a much lower risk. Less Risk of Creating a Dangerous Chemical Reaction Mixing bleach and ammonia creates chloramine gas, which causes potentially toxic fumes. Bleach and ammonia also happen to be common chemicals in cleaning supplies. If you're using natural cleaning products, you won't have to worry so much about accidentally creating a harmful gas while scrubbing your bathtub or cleaning out the kitchen sink. You're Doing Your Part for the Environment Natural cleaning products tend to be eco-friendly. Their packaging is often made sustainably from recycled materials and isn't tested on animals. Additionally, they don't contain the harsh chemicals that can get into the water system. Green cleaners are better for environmental health and the health of your family. Everything You Clean Will Last Longer Standard cleaning products contain harsh ingredients meant to disinfect, clean up gunk, and leave behind a pleasant smell. But those ingredients can often be corrosive and damaging, which wears down surfaces, including floors, countertops, appliances, and children's toys. You Avoid Accidental Stains (or Worse) Staining fabrics or stripping varnish are real concerns when using a mixture of harsh cleaning materials. If you're not using natural cleaning products, your chances of damaging something beyond repair - whether it's your new cloth couch or a family heirloom dining table - are much higher. Your Skin Will Never Feel Healthier Natural cleaners are typically made with ingredients that won't cause skin irritation. No bleach, dyes, perfumes, or synthetic ingredients that can react negatively with your skin. If you or anyone in your family has sensitive skin, natural cleaners can help reduce flare-ups. Wearing gloves when using other cleaning products can help, but not always. You'll Save Money Many people are skeptical of this one. Green cleaning products are less expensive in the long run since they tend to keep surfaces clean longer than their non-natural counterparts. Additionally, you can make natural cleaners at home with just a few basic ingredients! Generally, all you need is baking soda, vinegar, and lemon.
