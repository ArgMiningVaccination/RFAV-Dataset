Ayurveda and other Eastern approaches, used globally for thousands of years, have always honored this connection\u2014through nutrition and lifestyle practices\u2014to treat many physical and mental disorders. Modern medicine is beginning to study and utilize the bidirectional influence of physical and mental processes affecting overall health, deepening the understanding of its role in healing. This presentation introduced the Integrative Psychiatry approach that combines Ayurveda, Eastern principles, and evidence-based practices to complement the widely-used biopsychosocial model. To illustrate this integrative approach in the real world, a young musician shared his experience of treatment for bipolar disorder, demonstrating the power in combining the best of Eastern and Western approaches in supporting long term mind-body health.
