Currently, the Pfizer vaccine is approved by the FDA and all three COVID-19 vaccines are recommended by the FDA: Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty), Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. These three vaccines do not contain live or weakened virus and they do not interact with our body's DNA (genetic material). Also, the vaccines do not contain preservatives, eggs, or latex. The inactive ingredients are oil, sugar, and salt.20,21 PFIZER-BIONTECH AND MODERNA2027.39 Both vaccines are made with messenger RNA (mRNA) instead of weakened or inactivated virus. The mRNA provides our immune system cells with a map or instructions on how to make a \"spike protein.\" This harmless protein is found on the surface of COVID-19 viruses, but it does not cause disease. In short, the vaccine teaches our immune system to make the \"spike protein,\" which in turn triggers the response to produce antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. These vaccines require two shots: the first shot starts to build protection, and the second shot is given 3-4 weeks later provides full immunity.JOHNSON & JOHNSON21 This vaccine uses a harmless modified version of a different virus, also known as a viral vector. A small piece of the genetic instructions with coronavirus genes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is added to the vector. After vaccination, the modified virus enters a person's cells which read and follow the genetic instructions needed to make the spike protein on their own surface. The immune system takes notice of these foreign proteins and makes antibodies against them that will protect you if they are exposed to SARS\u00ad CoV-2 in the future. This vaccine requires one shot. All three vaccines are safe and available for the public.41 You can find a vaccine location anywhere in the U.S. through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's VaccineFinder , a free, online service where users can search for pharmacies and providers that offer vaccination for COVID-19. II Some people have concerns about how quickly the COVID-19 vaccine was developed. Before COVID-19, the fastest vaccine authorized in the United States was for mumps, which took four years. While the COVID-19 EUA timeline has caused vaccine hesitancy, each step has been scientific and ethical. Here are reasons why the COVID-19 were developed and authorized so rapidly. STRONG HEAD START Because COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family, scientists benefited from existing data and years of research into SARS (2002) and MERS (2012). Additionally, using mRNA technology, which has been studied for decades, expedited vaccine development since it does not involve a live virus and is easier to manufacture. GLOBAL COOPERATION After Chinese researchers shared the viral genome sequence with 20 international institutions in January of 2020, researchers, scientists, and governments started vaccine development. At the same time, the World Health Organization combined the work of 300 scientists to assess the virus. Using mRNA technology, scientists were able to start testing within months. During the pandemic, the Chinese government allocated resources for vaccine production. China believes that the COVID-19 vaccine is considered a \"global public good\" and donated the CoronaVAc (produced by Sinovac) and Convidicea (manufactured by Cansino Biologics) to the global market. According to Zheng Zongwei, Director of the Development Center for Medical Science and Technology of the National Health Commission, \"China will continue to do more for global contributions to vaccine supply.\" UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT Developing a vaccine under normal circumstances requires researchers to raise millions of dollars. The United States government passed the CARES Act, which invested $10 billion for research and development. This expedited vaccine development by years. WORKING IN PARALLEL Vaccine development is normally done in a step\u00ad by-step order. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States worked on many of these steps simultaneously. For example, the manufacturing process began before vaccines were proven to work knowing that the product would have been tossed if ineffective. Likewise, instead of waiting for the final vaccine, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed distribution plans well ahead of development. EFFICIENT CLINICAL TRIAL PROCESSES While experts agree that rigorous safety testing, patient enrollment and clinical trial phases were not fast-tracked, approval was accelerated. The United States Food and Drug Administration shortened its approval timeline from 10 months to 3 weeks and offered emergency use authorization. In addition, because of large testing sites and an organized volunteer network, trial participation quickly reached tens of thousands. Phase 2 and 3 of clinical trials were combined (a common practice), which helped to ethically speed the process along. Discussion Q&A Do COVID-19 vaccinations cost money?48 You will not be charged for any of the vaccines. Providers CANNOT: Charge you for the vaccine. Charge you any administration fees, copays, coinsurance, or the balance of the bill after reimbursement from the government. Charge an office visit or other fee to the recipient if the only service provided is a COVID-19 vaccination. Require additional services for a person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; however, additional healthcare services can be provided at the same time and billed as appropriate. However, COVID-19 vaccination providers can: Seek appropriate reimbursement from the recipient's plan or program (private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid) for a vaccine administration fee. However, they cannot charge you for the balance of that reimbursement. Should you receive a booster vaccine? At this time, the CDC and the FDA say those who are fully vaccinated don't need a booster shot. This recommendation could change as more data and information becomes available. Do COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility?24 There is no evidence that any of the vaccines recommended for use by the FDA can affect fertility. According to Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a professor in the pediatrics unit at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and a voting member of the FDA's Vaccine Advisory Committee: \"These authorized vaccines processe d nearby the injection site, which does not affiliate with any abnormal o f hormonal or other biological changes that can impact the fertility for both males and females. Likewise, in the phase 3 vaccine trials, pregnancies occurred equally among vaccinated and unvaccinated females. As a resul there is currently no evidence that the COVID vaccine can cause both female and male fertility issues.\" Do COVID-19 vaccines affect pregnancy?25 Pregnant women are at high risk for severe illness, health complications, and hospitalization from COVID-19. Although the existing data is limited, both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that pregnant women get vaccinated. Do COVID-19 vaccines have long\u00ad term side effects?26 According to the CDC, long-term negative health outcomes are unlikely following any vaccination. However, delayed side effects may occur. This must be weighed against unknown long-term side effects from getting infected with COVID-19. Will the vaccine give you COVID-19? No. According to Dr. Dean A Blumberg, an associate professor at the University of California Davis, and the Chief of Pediatric Infectious D iseases at UC Davis Children's Hospital: \" None of the vaccines being devel oped use the live virus. There is nothing in the vaccine that could cause COVID-19. In regard to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine, the mRNA does not stay around long. The body breaks it down and gets rid of it naturally. .. the vaccines have been scientifically proven to be very safe. No safeguards were sacrificed.\" Can tr aditional Chinese medicine (TCM) h elp reduce COVID-19 symptoms? Traditional Chinese Medicine involves healing practices from 200 BCE. These practices include herbalism, acupuncture, qigong, and taichi.28 Research in China indicates that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially h erbal medicine, helps reduce COVID-19 symptoms. 29, 30, 31, 32As of March 13, 2020, more than 70,000 people in China who used TCM as a complementary therapy were discharged from the hospital.34The combination of western medicine and TCM can help reduce COVID-19 symptoms. Although TCM has become an effective complementary therapy, more research needs to be done to demonstrate higher efficacy and safety on COVID patients. Are the vaccines in China the same vaccines in the United States?19 No. Many of us have family and friends in China. If you discuss vaccination with anyone living in China, keep in mind that there are three types of vaccines available in China.34 Inactivated vaccine An inactivated vaccine consists of a virus that has been lab-grown and then killed so that it cannot reproduce or infect people. When used in a vaccine, this dead virus stimulates the immune system and causes it to start producing antibodies. Attenuated vaccine Attenuated vaccines rely on live viruses that have been scientifically changed to become harmless . This type of vaccine generally produces a stronger and longer-lasting immune response compared to a similar inactivated vaccine. Recombinant protein vaccines This is a three-dose vaccine and contains purified pieces of the virus that scientists purposely select to stimulate immune cells. The vaccine relies on the capacity of one or more antigens to induce immunity against the virus. I "}
