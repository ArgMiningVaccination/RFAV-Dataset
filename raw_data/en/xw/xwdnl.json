Additionally, the CHNA serves as a resource for organizations working in social and human services capacities to address health in Washoe County. The 2018 -2020 CHNA utilizes validated and reliable secondary data sources, results from an online community survey, input from subje ct matter experts, as well as contributions from participants in a Community Workshop. Each source of information provided additional insight into the health needs of Washoe County's residents and the social circumstances that impact health in the region. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111 -148), passed March 2010, added Section 501(r)(3) to the Internal Revenue Code, which requires non -profit hospitals to conduct a community health needs assessment every three years and adopt an implementation strategy (Community Benefit Plan) to meet health needs identified through the CHNA.1 While Renown Health serves a broad area, including nearly 80,000 square miles across northern Nevada, the majority of patients come from Washoe County and adjacent surrounding rural communities. For clarity and focus of this report, the health needs were narrowed in scope to the geopolitical boundary of Washoe County. Similarly, state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments conduct CHNAs in accor dance with the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) standards for accreditation. Additionally, a Fundamental Review of the Washoe County Health District by the Public Health Foundation, recommended a community health needs assessment be conducted and t he District Board of Health provide direction to implement that recommendation.2 The two entities determined there was an opportunity to collaborate to produce one singular document on the health needs and service gaps in Washoe County. The first collabor ative assessment was created in 2014 and released in coordination with the 2015 Truckee Meadows Healthy Communities Conference held at the University of Nevada, Reno on January 8, 2015. This document, the 2018 -2020 Community Health Needs Assessment, is the second collaborative assessment and was produced through funding provided by Renown Health and Washoe County Health District. 1 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub.

Washoe County Public Health: A Fundamental Review. PHF Assessment T eam, Washington, D.C. 2 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, & COMMUNITY SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS Contents, Methodology, & Community Survey Demographics There are 20 main sections within the assessment; including, 18 sections specific to health topics containing secondary data for over 250 health indicators, one section detailing sociodemographic indicators of high needs ZIP codes, a description of community strengths and challenges, and a section of the final prioritized health needs. Secondary Data Secondary data are health indicators systematically gathered for other purposes or surveys. Major secondary data sources used throughout the assessment include the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), and the American Community Survey (ACS) data. These surveys collect data through a variety of means and descriptions of the methodology for major sources of data can be found in the Technical Notes. Secondary data for several of the indicators were provided by the local and state health departments. State and some local health data were provided by the Nevada Office of Public Health Informatics and Epidemiology (OPHIE), a department within the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public and Behavioral Health. Other local health data were provided by several Divisions within the Washoe County Health District. State and local health data include standardized and reportable health-related statistics, which are tracked on an ongoing basis. Only high quality, reliable sources of data were utilized, so secondary data estimates provided are generalizable to Washoe County's overall population. Secondary data sources for each of the tables and figures are located at the end of each corresponding section. Selection of Secondary Data Indicators The initial set of secondary data indicators was developed based on the Nevada Core Health Indicators list. The Nevada Core Health Indicators were developed by a statewide taskforce in 2013 and defines a minimum set of data to be included in local and state health assessments conducted in Nevada. The list of secondary data health indicators were presented to the Washoe County CHNA workgroup and workgroup members were provided the opportunity to add or make changes to the list. The revised indicators were then grouped into 18 topic areas and send to the respective subject matter experts (SMEs) for each of the 18 topic areas. The SMEs were asked to provide input on the indicators to be included and made revisions, substitutions, or additions to any of the indicators within their corresponding topic(s). Presentation of Secondary Data A snapshot of the secondary data indicators, trends, most recent year of data for Washoe County, and any associated Healthy People 2020 target objectives are shown at the beginning of each 3 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, & COMMUNITY SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS section. When identical data were available, the health indicator includes percentages or rates at the local (Washoe County), state (Nevada), and national (United States) levels for comparison purp oses. If a Healthy People 2020 objective aligned with an indicator, those were also illustrated in the figure. When available, trend data were provided to understand changes over a five to ten year period. Primary Data Primary data are data or input collec ted directly from a population of interest. Primary data can be obtained through a variety of means including public forums, focus groups, surveys, interviews and/or panel discussions. For the 2018 -2020 Washoe County Community Health Needs Assessment, prim ary data were obtained via an online community survey. 2018 -2020 Online Community Survey Development Community survey questions were designed to gather additional information not widely available at the county level in order to understand the factors that influence health behaviors. For example, secondary data show the proportion of adults that consume fruits and vegetables or the proportion of high school students that engage in physical activity. The community survey questions were developed to better und erstand what about Washoe County makes it challenging to eat more healthy foods or which barriers could be addressed to increase physical activity levels. Additionally the survey asked respondents to rank major health topics, providing residents an opportu nity to \"vote\" on what they perceive as important. The survey questions were initially drafted by the CHNA author using a combination of standardized questions, brought to the Washoe County CHNA workgroup for revisions and input, and then piloted with a va riety of individuals to test for clarity, length, and overall content. The online survey instrument was translated and back -translated into Spanish and adapted for distribution as a hardcopy as well. The 44 question survey assessed respondents' perceived barriers to engaging in physical activity, eating healthy foods more often, accessing healthcare in Washoe County, and asked respondents what would help to reduce those barriers. Other questions included food insecurity, perceived stress, housing and finan cial challenges, as well as enrollment in government supportive services. A key question asked survey respondents to rate health topics, these ratings were used as a criteria metric to score, ranked and identify the health priorities in Washoe County. 2018-2020 Online Community Survey Dissemination Information regarding the survey's purpose and a link to the surveys (English and Spanish versions) were provided via email to over 30 community partner agencies. These agencies disseminated the survey through a variety of means including sending the links to employees, providing survey links in 4 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, & COMMUNITY SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS organizational and community newsletters/announcements, and posting the survey links to websites and social media. Some organizations permitted hardcopy distribution of t he survey in locations such as clinic waiting rooms, food bank lines, at educational classes, health fairs, and senior centers. The survey was open from April 19 to August 15, 2017 and resulted in 1,438 respondents. Presentation of Primary Data Primary d ata results are included throughout the assessment within associated sections of the report and are always presented after secondary data. In lieu of presenting all community survey results within a single section, the survey results are grouped within ass ociated topic areas. The community survey questions did not include all health -related topics, therefore not every section of the report contains primary data. 2018 -2020 Online Community Survey Demographics The online community survey was not designed to obtain a statistically reliable population sample and data were not weighted for age, race/ethnicity, or any other demographic variable. Results and findings from the online community survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe Co unty residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the 1,438 online community survey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainment relative to Washoe County's general popu lation. Among the 1,269 survey respondents who indicated which age group they were in, they were proportionately similar in age to Washoe County residents overall. Slightly less percentage of survey respondents were aged 65 years and older compared to county popul ation. Age was unknown (left blank) for approximately 11.7% of the 1,438 years or olderFig 1: Comparison of Survey Respondents by Age Group Among Population Over 18 Years of Age Survey Respondents (n=1,269) Washoe County 2017 Population Estimates 5 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, & COMMUNITY SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS Among the 1,270 survey respondents who indicated their race and ethnicity, a higher proportion of were white, non -Hispanic (73.3%) compared to Washoe Coun ty's overall populations (64.6%). Additionally a lower proportion of survey respondents were Hispanic (12.3%) compared to Washoe County overall (24.5%). Race and ethnicity were unknown (left blank) for 11.7% of the 1,438 total survey respondents. Among the 1,274 survey respondents who indicated their educational attainment, a higher proportion had a Bachelor's degree (29.1%) compared to the overall Washoe County population (17.6%).

Among the 1,263 survey respondents who indicated their current employment status, the majority were employed full -time (64.6%), while 11.0% were retired, and 8.0% were employed in one or more part -time positions. Employment status was unknown (left blank) by 12.2% of survey respondents. Among the 1,304 survey respondents who indicated their curr ent health insurance status, the majority were insured through private insurance including an employer 5: Insurance Coverage Among Survey Respondents (n=1,304) 7 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, & COMMUNITY SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS were insured through Medicare, 6.1% were insured through Medicaid, and 4.8% were uninsured. Health insurance status was unknown for 9.3% of survey respondents. Note: *OOS is out of state; **Other NV is other Nevada county It was important to the CHNA Workgroup to include those who were homeless as well as those who were obtaining services in Washoe County, but from other Nevada counties, therefore all survey respondents regardless of ZIP code (or lack of ZIP code) were incl uded. Zip code was unknown for by ZIP Code (n=1,206) 8 CONTENTS, METHODOLOGY, Top 10 ZIP Codes Survey Respondents (n=1,206) 2012-2016 Aggregate Population Est.9 TECHNICAL NOTES Technical Notes The following describes major sources of secondary data utilized throughout the assessment and the methods by which those data are collected. These sources of data are commonly utilized and referenced by public health professionals as well as other entities, on regular basis. Additionally, these data are publically available and most are updated annually. American Community Survey The American Community Survey (ACS) is administered by the United States Census Bureau each year. Approximately one in 38 U.S. households receives an invitation to complete the survey either as a hardcopy or online. Questions are diverse and relate to socioeconomics, demographics, household composition, occupational status, housing status, educational attainment, and more. The resulting data are available from the national to the local levels and are often available at the census tract or census block level. Nevada Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) is a health survey administered via telephone annually in all 50 states, the District of Colombia, and three U.S. territories. The BRFSS is the largest continuously conducted health survey in the world and asks adults questions regarding risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive screening and immunization services. There is a fixed core module, rotating modules which are asked in either even or odd years, emerging modules, and states may elect to include state-specific questions within the BRFSS. Nevada Office of Public Health Informatics and Epidemiology The Nevada Office of Public Health Informatics and Epidemiology (OPHIE) operates under the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health and is largely in charge of investigations, data collection, and the compiling of statistics related to the following areas: Communicable and infectious diseases Sexually transmitted diseases Adult hepatitis Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Nevada Birth Outcomes Monitoring System Nevada Central Cancer registry Syndromic surveillance Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) 10 TECHNICAL NOTES Nevada Youth Risk Behavioral Survey The Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) is administered to middle and high school students on odd years in every state across the nation. The YRBS provides an estimated prevalence of risk behaviors and protective factors among adolescents. The survey is vo luntary and results include self -reported responses to questions related to the following areas: Violence and violent behaviors Physical activity, nutrition, and obesity Substance use Sexual health behaviors Home and family environment Nevada Report Card Nevada Department of Education releases school district data on an annual basis and makes most data elements available at the state, district (county), and school level. Most data are collected from students or as reported by the schools and include topics such a demographics, funding, staff, test scores among others. 11 1.0 GEOGRAPHY & DEMOGRAPHICS Geography & Demographics Nevada is the 7th largest state in size, with an estimated population of 2.8 million as of 2017.3 There are few urban areas across the state, which are separated by large tracts of unoccupied rural and frontier land. Washoe County is home to approximately 15.2% of the state's population, making it the second most populated county in the state. Table 1 : Comparative Population & Geographic Summary , 2017 Location 2017 p rojected population Square land miles Population Density (persons per square mile) % of State Population Washoe County Washoe County is located in the Northwestern corner of the state along the east side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and shares borders with California to the west and Oregon to the north. The county is long and narrow as it takes over five hours to drive the length of the county north to south and only one hour to drive the width - east to west. Washoe County is approximately 6,302 square land miles and contains two incorporated cities, Reno and Sparks, and several smaller towns. Reno is the county seat of Washoe County and the third largest city in Nevada, while Sparks is a smaller city, just east of Reno. Two major highways intersect in the Reno-Sparks area, Interstate 80 running east to west and Highway 395/Interstate 580 running north to south. This intersection is viewed as a hub for commerce, transit of goods, and as a strategic location for storage and shipping of textiles. Although the Reno-Sparks area is largely urbanized, there are unique health issues for residents of the rural and frontier parts of the county, including challenges to accessing various types of services, especially healthcare. Additionally, Washoe County contains services and amenities, not available in other rural counties across Northern Nevada. Therefore, residents of neighboring counties often travel to the Reno-Sparks area to obtain health-related services. 3 Nevada Department of Taxation, Nevada State Demographer (2016).

From 2000 to 2010 the national growth rate was 9.7% however, during the same time period Nevada saw a population increase of 35.1%. Nevada is the only state that experienced a growth rate exceeding 25% over the past three decades and has remained the fastest growing state in the nation for the past five decades.4 Although the rate of growth did slow down during the recession, estimates continue to predict continued growth in the future. Washoe County has become more ethnically diverse, with the largest increase among the Hispanic population (+27.3%) from 2007 to 2017. Another subpopulation experiencing continued growth during this time were among elderly adults; one in five Washoe County residents were 60 years or older in 2017. Issues related to the health of these two growing subpopulations are important to take into consideration for future planning. 4 Mackun, P. & Wilson, S.

Growth was largest among those 30 to 39 years of age and among those 60 years and older. Washoe County experienced a noted increase among Hispanic population (27.3%), the Asian/Pacific Islander population (18.6%) , and the African American population (16.5%). In 2017, white, non -Hispanics accounted for 64.6% of Washoe County's population, Hispanics were an estimated 24.5%, Asi an/Pacific Islanders 6.7%, African Americans 2.5%, and American Indian/Alaska Natives were an estimated 1.7% of the county population. 14 1.0 GEOGRAPHY & DEMOGRAPHICS The proportion of students in Washoe County School District (grade K -12) who were white decreased from the 2011 -2012 school year (48.1%) to the 2015 -2016 school year (45.3%). The proportions of students in Washoe County School District (grade K -12) who were Hispanic increased from the 2011 -2012 school year ( 37.5 %) to the 2015 -2016 school year ( 39.8 %). The proportion of students in Washoe County School District (grade K -12) who were African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, or two or more races combined remained low from the 2011 -2012 school year to the 2015 -2016 school of children Fig 8: Washoe School District Grade K -12 by Race/Ethnicity, 2011 -2012 to 2015 -2016 15 1.0 GEOGRAPHY & DEMOGRAPHICS Predicted Growth Table 3 : Estimated Predicted Population Growth by Select Demographics , Washoe County, 2017 & 2022 Demographic s 2017 2022 % Change Sex % population growth from 2017 to 20 22 for Washoe County overall is 6.0% . Growth is predicted to be largest among those 70 years of age and older . Continued growth among Hispanic population ( 14.4 %), the Asian/Pacific Islander population ( 11.7 %), and the African American population ( 10.7 %) is predicted over the next 5 years . Summary of Geography & Demographics Washoe County 's population faces unique dichotomous challenges due to the geographic nature of the county. The majority of the county's population resides in the Reno -Sparks metropolitan area . Due to rapid population growth , many urban residents face issues related to the limited amount of resources being stretch ed thin. There h ave been shortages of adequate and affordable housing, the schools are overcrowded , and many healthcare facilities are often at or nearing capacity . Conversely , much of the county land is rural in nature and although relatively few people reside in th e rural and frontier areas, they face a different set of challenges . Rural issues include having a lack of choices in services and resources such as grocery stores, health clinics, libraries, and indoor recreation options . Many r ural residents travel long dista nces (over an hour) to reach the nearest hospital or health clinic and full-service grocery store s. Additionally, Washoe County receives residents of surrounding rural counties; therefore examining only the population of Washoe County may underestimate the true utilization of certain services, especially healthcare providers and facilities. 16 1.0 GEOGRAPHY & DEMOGRAPHICS Although population growth has slowed , relative to the population boom of the 1990 's through the late 2000's, continued growth is expected. Notabl e growth of the Hispanic and elderly (60 years and older) populations has occurred and is predicted to continue. Additionally, Washoe County has continued to become increasingly ethnically diverse , as the school -aged children (grades K -12) are no longer ma jority white, non - Hispanic. Service providers across all spectrums should actively ensure they have resources in place to meet the needs of a growing population and are able to communicate effectively with clients of all ages and diverse cultural backgroun ds.

The factors used to measure SES are predictors of health across the lifespan and overall life expectancy. Those with a higher SES are more likely to achieve higher levels of education, find employment in higher paying jobs, and have increased access to healthcare and preventive services. Additionally, research shows those with a higher SES have lower levels of chronic stress as measured by cortisol in the bloodstream.5, 6 Conversely people with a lower SES are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and physical inactivity, and they often live in low-income neighborhoods with fewer resource s. 7 Persons with a lower SES experience higher rates of poor health outcomes such as obesity, stroke, cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes . 8,9 10 The effects of socioeconomic status on quality of life and life expectancy are interrelated and challenging to measure independent of one another.

Persons without a high school diploma or GED equivalent are more likely to have poorer heath and live shorter lives. The relationship between education and quality of life has been demonstrated worldwide; however, the relationship is much more apparent in the United States. Education impacts various health outcomes such as decision - making in regard to healthy choi ces, occupational options, and income. 11,12,13 3rd Grade Proficiency Although higher than the state, l ess than half of 3rd grades students in Washoe County were proficient in mathematics during both the 2015 -2016 (48.9%) and 2016 -2017 (49.7%) school years.

Transiency & Remediation Transie ncy is defined as a student who moves after starting the school year; those who move due to school rezoning changes do not count as transient. Transient students may face challenges including disrupting social supports and friend groups, curriculum gaps or repetition from one school to the next, and inconsistency in environment and educational expectations. Developing a sense of belonging and self -worth are foundational needs, which must be met prior to engaging in higher -level thinking.17 Studies have demon strated a link between higher mobility (transiency) rates and lower test scores.18 The percentage of freshmen s tudents enrolled in remedial courses in an institution of higher education is an indication of the readiness of those students once they have comp leted high school. Remedial courses are designed for students who are not ready for college level course work, remedial credits do not count towards graduation and are not covered by all forms of financial aid. The University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) created stretch courses, a remedial course with additional lecture time. These stretch courses are covered by financial 17 Maslow, A.H. (1970).

Employment A steady and reliable source of income is important to be able to afford the basic amenities such as housing, transportation, and food . However , when unemployment remains high for long periods of time, the entire health and wellness of the community can be negatively impacted due to the increased demand on public services and resources. Following the Great Recession of 2007, there were more people unemployed nationwide for longer periods of time and the consequences of long -term unemployment can be even more devastatin g.21 The unemployment rates during the Recession in Washoe County were among the highest in the nation and although have declined to near pre -Recession rates , there has been an ongoing impact to the community. Prior to the Great Recession, the rate of unemployment in Washoe County during 2006 was (3.8%) lower than Nevada (4.0%) and the United States (4.6%). During the Great Recession the unemployment rate in Washoe County more than tripled over a four year peri od (2006 -2010) . The Washoe County unemployment rate reached a high of 12.9% in 2010, which was lower than the statewide rate (13.0%) and higher than the United States (9.6%).

These events in combination with the gaming sector, have created a larger than average mark et for jobs in the service industries, specifically food and beverage services. In 2016, food preparation and serving - related jobs were the third largest occupational group in Washoe County , defined by the number of persons employed in that profession; how ever, they represented the lowest average wage ($10.99) among all major occupational groups.22 Employees in the service industry typically earn a lower base wage, relying largely on tips for income. Washoe County is also home to one of the largest Federal Trade Zones (FTZ) in the United States. Companies that operate in a FTZ can defer, reduce or eliminate customs duties, entry procedures, and federal excise taxes on foreign products admitted into area for storage, exhibition, assembly, manufacturing and processing.23 Several national and international corporations have massive warehouses for storage and shipping in the Reno -Sparks area, largely due to the pro -business tax structure in Nevada and the geographic location of Reno -Sparks. Many freight, stock, st orage, and warehouse -affiliated jobs (materials movers) pay among the lowest wages, involve semi -automated and repetitive tasks , and require little to no higher education.24 Being employed is important; however having a decent paying job may be more difficu lt to come by. 22 Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation.

Poverty Poverty is one of the strongest predictors of negative health outcomes , which include high infant and maternal mortality rate and a higher prev alence of risk factors for disease such as obesity, depression, high blood pressure, and substance use. Higher rates of poverty are associated with higher prevalence of poor health behaviors and poor health outcomes, thus resulting in premature death. 26,27 Table 9 : Percent of Popula tion at or Below Poverty Level, 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 of poverty in Washoe County decreased from 2012 (18.3%) to 2016 ( 12.2 %).

The survey included 44 questions and analysis for questions related to socioeconomics are provided within this section . Results and findings from the online com munity survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe County residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the online community survey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainme nt relative to the general Washoe County population. For complete survey methodology and participant demographics refer to the Contents, Methodology, & Community Survey Demographics section. Question: \"What is your current employment status? Select all tha t apply.\" The majority of respondents were employed full-time (64.6%), while 11.0% were retired, 8.0% were employed part -time, 6.7% were students, 3.7% were out of work and another 3.2% were disabled or unable Employment Status among Survey Respondents (n=1,263) 41 1.1 SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Question: \"Indicate if your h ousehold has had a hard time paying for any of the following within the past 12 months.\" Among the 1, 245 respondents to th e above question, 53.1 % indicated they did not have difficulties paying for necessities or other amenities; however, 46.9% of responde nts indicated they had difficulties paying for at least one of these services . Over one in five ( 22.7 %) respondents indicated they had difficulties paying for vehicle -related costs, including car payments, vehicle maintenance, or transportation. Credit card payments were the second most commonly indicated financial challenge with 21.1 % indicating their household had difficulties paying within the past 12 months. Housing ( 20.5 %) and medical care/healthcare ( 19.8 %) were the third and fourth most commonly identified financial strain on households, followed by utilities ( 18.7 %). Phone bills ( 15.8 %) and educational loans ( 14.1 %) were among the least frequently identified financial strain, as over one in 10 respondents indicating they had difficulties paying for those over the past 12 months. Childcare costs were the least frequently identified financial challenge with 6.7% of respondents indicating their household had difficulties paying those in the past 12 38: Household had Difficulties Paying in the Past 12 Months (n=1,245) 42 1.1 SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Question: \"Which of the following services have you or someone in your household received benefits from or been enrolled in within the past 12 months?\" Note: SNAP= Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; WIC= Women Infants Children, nutritional assistance; SSI/SSDI = Supple mental Security Income/Social Security Disability Income; TANF = Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; LIHEAP= Low -income Home Energy Assistance Program; Washoe County CAC= Community Assistance Center The majority of respondents (81.2%) indicated no one in their household were enrolled or received benefits from the above programs within the past 12 months. The food assistance programs, SNAP (10.9%) and WIC (4.8%), were among the top services respondents received benefits from/were enrolled in within the past 12 m onths. Summary of Socioeconomic Status Education has been a longstanding focal point in Washoe County, with an emphasis in improving test score s across all subjects and increasing graduation rates. While proficiency scores for science, mathematics, and wr iting have increased, reading proficiency has declined. Additionally, approximately 20% of 11th grade students were not proficient in each of the major subjects during the 2015 -2016 school year . County -wide high school graduation rates have improved; howev er, there are populations of students that have historically continued to see a low rate of graduation. Although trend data for educational attainment were not presented within the document, the proportion of the population without a high school diploma ha s declined over recent years, a positive trend for Washoe County . When split by race and ethnicity there are staggering discrepancies in educational attainment, with nearly 42.1% of Asians having received a Bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 8.0% of American Indian/Alaskan Natives, StartWashoe County CAC% of respondents Fig 39: Percent of Respondents Enrolled in Services in Past 12 Months, by Type (n=1,253) 43 1.1 SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS The Washoe County region appears to be recover ing from the Great Recession of 2007 , as measured by the usual economic indicators, a decline in unemployment rates, an increase in median household incomes , and a reduction of the population living in poverty. Despite broad economic recovery, some of the occupations that employ a larger proportion of workers are the lowest paying wages. Simply having a low unemployment rate does not equate to a healthy community; a ccording to MIT analysts, the living wage in Wash oe County for a single adult with no children is $10.02/hour, while minimum wage is $8.25/hour and t he living wage for one working adult supporting one child is $22.76/hour.28 Additional challenges remains as there are large disparities in income , earnings, and poverty among various racial and ethnic groups in Washoe County, these disparities mirror the trends in educational attainment. According to the Community Health Needs Assessment survey respondents, one in five people reported difficulties paying for vehicle related costs, credit card payments, housing, and medical debt or healthcare within the past 12 months. Simply because a person has a job, does not equate to quality of life , the ability to support basic needs such as housing, food, transportation, financial stability, or ensure equal access to amenities. Unfortunately, many indicate that they no longer qualify for governmental or supplemental assistance because they earn an income just above the cut -off point . This often leaves them and their famil ies in a weaker financial situation although they have employment . Continued improvement in educational outcomes will help to ensure youth in Washoe County will have the option to enroll in higher education or skilled training programs. This can improve c hance s for success in obtaining an adequate paying job or the opportunity to be employed in an occupation of interest. Additionally, supporting economic growth and diversity in the types of high skilled jobs and industries of the future, that encourage emp loyees to engage in continued learning and opportunities to better their career, will help foster economic stability and improve overall health outcomes.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urb an Development states those paying more than 30% of monthly income on housing are cost burdened and the associated housing cost is therefore deemed to be \"unaffordable\".29 In addition to being affordable, housing needs to be of sufficient -quality to minimize the potential impacts of environmental toxins such as lead, which may be present in older paints or water lines, or mold, due to inadequate or outdated flooring and roo fing. In 2015, a summary of research found several additional health factors associated with housing including food security, stress, mental health, asthma, unintended injury, and linkage and connectivity to supportive services.30 According to a recent hou sing study conducted by Truckee Meadows Regional Planning Authority (TMRPA), over the past two decades the cost of single -family detached house has increased by 60%, while household incomes have only increased 17%.31 This outlines the burden of the cost of housing in Washoe County .

Although the overall number of housing units increased, the rate of housing units per 100,000 population decreased from 2007 (44,135 housin g units per 100,000) to 2016 (43,026 housing units per 100,000). This indicates there were fewer houses available per capita. There was a decline in the percent of housing units that were occupied from 2010 to 2011, largely due to the 2007 Great Recessio n and housing market crash.

This includes youth who live in a shelter, hotel/ motel, campground s, cars, or on the stre ets. The CIT Advocates and CIT Liaisons help provide homeless youth with access to transportation to and from school, enrolling in free school meals, and obtaining backpacks and other school supplies , as well as clothing if necessary. CIT removes barriers to school enrollment specifically for those without mandatory documents such as birth certificates, medical records, or proof of guardianship.33 Note: The federal qualifying definition \"homeless children and youths\" chang ed, effective 2016 and youth awaiting foster care placement are no longer included, unless they meet requirement through another defined category. 33 Washoe County School District. Children in Transition, Children in Transition Program, Washoe County, 2012 -2013 through 2016 -2017 51 1.2 HOUSING The number of school -aged (grades k -12) youth enrolled in the CIT program increased from the 2012 - 2013 schoo l year (n=2,885) to the 2016 -2017 school year (n=3,359). Although the 2016 -2017 school year illustrates a decrease in number of students qualified as CIT, the definition changed under McKinney -Vento Act (a primary CIT program funding source) per the Every Student Success Act (ESSA) reauthorization. As of 2016 youth awaiting foster care are no longer defined as a \"homeless child or youth\", therefore do not qualify for CIT programming. The decrease may be a reflection of the change in definition and not a ref lection of the number of homeless youth. Primary Survey Data Related to Housing Primary data were collected via an online community survey from over 1,400 survey participants. The survey included 44 questions and analys es for questions related to housing are provided within this section . Results and findings from the online community survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe County residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the online community survey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainment relative to the general Washoe County population. For complete survey methodology and participant demographics ref er to the Contents, Methodology, & Community Survey Demographics section . Question: \"Which type of place best describes where you currently live?\" The majority (77.8%) of survey respondents indicate they currently lived in a house, townhouse or condo. Apartments were the second most frequently identified type of housing (16.0%). 77.8% (n=1,299) 52 1.2 HOUSING Question: \"Do you consider where you currently live to be an adequate size for the number of people living in your household?\" Among the 1,300 respondents to the above question, the vast majority (91.9%) indicated they perceive their current house to be an adequate size. Of note, not all respondents who indicated their house was not an adequate size thought their house was too sm all. Further d etails regarding the adequacy of the size of the house are provided in the following figure. *Question: \"Explain why your household is not an adequate size.\" *Asked only among the 105 respondents who indicated the place they currently live is NOT an adequate size for the number of people living the household. The majority of respondents who indicated their household was not an adequate size felt the space was too small (63.8%). About one in three respondents explained specifically that people are doubled up, sharing bedrooms or there are not enough bathrooms per people (32.4%), while another 31.4% of respondents indicated only that the house is too small, with no reference to number of people. Not adequate, 8.1% Yes it is adequate, 91.9% Fig 47: Adequate Size for Number 48: Reason Household Not Adequate Size (n=105) 53 1.2 HOUSING Nearly one in 10 respondents (9.5%) indicat ed they did not have enough space for pets or storage for objects. Some survey respondents were homeless/living in a hotel/motel (7.6%), indicating they were in an inadequate living situation. A handful of respondents (3.8%) indicated their living space was too large for the number of people. Question: \"Have you ever been evicted while living in Washoe County?\" The majority of respondents (96.0%) indicated they had never been evicted while living in Washoe County. *Question: \"Explain why you were evic ted.\" *Asked only of the 44 respondents who indicated they had ever been evicted in Washoe County. Among the 44 respondents who had been evicted in Washoe County, 27.3% stated the reason for their eviction was due to inability to pay rent. No, 96.0% Yes, 3.4% Don't know, 0.6% Fig 49: for Eviction (n=44) 54 1.2 HOUSING Approximately 13.6% indicated someone they lived with or they themselves were accused of domestic disturbance or damage to the structure, 13.6% stated the home changed owners and they were asked to leave, and another 13.6% stated there was no cause for th e eviction. Question: \"How many times have you moved in the past 2 years?\" The majority of respondents (65.2%) indicated they had not moved within the past 2 years. While slightly less than one in three indicated they had moved once (23.2%) or two or mo re times (11.6%). *Question: \"Describe why you had to or chose to move 2 or more times in the past 2 years.\" *Asked only of the 151 respondents who indicated they had moved 2+ times in the past 2 years. Only 117 of those respondents identified reasons wh y they moved. *151 survey respondents indicated they had moved 2 or more times in the past 2 years however, only 117 resp onded to the follow up question. Respondents listed different reasons for each move; therefore, answers may fall into one or more categories. **No mention of work or financial -related reasons for moving, often listed as moving into out of state or country. 65.2% 23.2% 11.6% 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0% Moved 0 times Moved 1 time Moved 2 times% of respondents Fig 51: Number of Times Moved in Moved 2+ Times in Past 2 Years (n=117)* 55 1.2 HOUSING Nearly one in four of the 117 respondent s indicated they moved to avoid a rent increase or that they could no longer afford the r ent (24.8%), while nearly another quarter indicated they had to move for a job or school (23.1%). Nearly one in five did not list specific reasons (21.4%), only that they relocated from another state or country or listed \" relocation \" without specific ment ion of financial or employment -related reasons. Relationship changes, roommate changes, family reasons were mentioned by 17.1% of respondents as reasons for moving two or more times. *Question: \"Which of the following are barriers to finding stable housi ng?\" *Asked only of the 151 respondents who indicated they had moved 2+ times in the past 2 years. Only 138 of those respondents identified barriers. The majority of those who had moved 2 or more times in the past 2 years indicated housing cost (74.6%) were a barrier to finding stable housing. Over one in three indicated the security deposit (37.0%) was a ba rrier to finding stable housing . Another one in four indicated they had a lack of or poor credit history (26.1%), while one in five indicated housing was of poor quality (21.7%), there was a lack of right sized housing (20.3%), or they needed down payment assistance (20.3%). 16.7% of que stion respondents indicated employment as a 37.0% of right size housingDown payment assistanceLack of employment% of respondents Fig 53: Top 7 Barriers to Finding Housing (n=138) 56 1.2 HOUSING The housing location or lack of access to public transit w as identified as barrier s by 11.6% of the 138 respondents. Fewer than one in ten indicated unpaid rent/utilities (9.4%), ev iction history (8.0%), criminal history (7.2%), lack of rental history (7.2%), or a lack of or poor references (5.1%) were barriers to obtaining stable housing. Summary of Housing Washoe County faces three major housing challenge s. The first is the unavailability of housing in general. The number of houses per capita decreased each year from 2012 through 2016, creating a shortage of available housing on the market for buyers , as well as a reduction in housing available for rent. Although representati ve of a small subset of houses, a 3rd Quarter (2017) Reno/Sparks Metro Area apartment survey found apartment vacancy was only 2.41% compared to 5.64% during 2011, following the highest unemployment peak of the 2007 Great Recession.34 This demonstrates that the traditional more affordable styles of housing are in high demand as well. A second major challenge is the financial burden and high cost of housing, again both for residents looking to purchase a house as well as those who are renting. Although the percentage of persons paying an unaffordable mortgage declined from a high in 2007 (48.9%) to 2016 (29.3%), the percentage of renters paying an unaffordable monthly rent has remained relatively stable at approximately 50% from 2007 through 2016. Affordable housing is a challenge many people face including those who are gainfully employed, best demonstrated by the disparity in cost of housing relative to wages. From 2012 to 2016, there was a 70% increase in median home value, while the median income only inc reased 19% over the same period. 34 Johnson, Perkins, Griffin. (2017). Apartment Survey: 3rd Quarter 2017 Data, Re Other Barriers to Finding Housing (n=138) 57 1.2 HOUSING The third major challenge related to housing is an increase in the number of homeless persons, largely in the downtown Reno area. Several motels and hotels near the downtown corridor advertise as \"weekly motels\" and are us ed as semi -permanent housing. The homeless Point in Time (PIT) counts do not indicate a massive increase in overall number of homeless individuals; however, the homeless shelters have been reaching capacity more and more frequently and the number of unshel tered persons has more than doubled from 2009 to 2016, indicating more and more persons are in the streets. Although high household values are beneficial for sellers, buyers are finding both availability and affordability a challenge, motivating many to l ook for housing in neighboring counties. Many renters already faced with financial burdens are being displaced as current property owners are finding the market attractive and selling to prospective homeowners. Addressing the housing issue in the Reno -Spar ks metropolitan area needs to incorporate not just housing, but amenities and key infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and other municipal services, as those are already strained and over capacity.

While the rate of adults who are overweight or obese continues to increase , the number of people reliant on federal nutrition support and public assistance in order to obtain fo od has reached an all -time high .36,37,38 This trend has bee n attributed to various factors including economic recovery and the abundance and accessibility of cheap, unhealthy food.39 Those who are unable to afford food are often unable to afford other basic living necessities, such as housing, utilities, or healthcare, and have to make choices on which to forego each month. The 2014 Hunger in America survey of the Food Bank of Northern Nevada clients found 85% of respondents reported they purchase inexpensive , unhealthy food simply because it is more affordable an d accessible than healthy food.40 Seniors, and other populations on fixed income s, are especially vulnerable to financial burdens and food is often a basic need that presents an ongoing challenge. While there are many programs working to address food access and hunger, the need to increase access to healthy food remains. The largest and most predominant federal nutrition programs will be discussed in the section including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the national School Lunch Program. Although the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program is a federally funded supplemental nutrition program, WIC indicators are presented in the Maternal Child Health section of the assessment.

Eligibility requirements for the reduced -price and free meals are based on household income which is reported by househol ds to each school district, although any student at a participating school is able to access school meals offered.41 According to Washoe County School District data, although nearly half of the students in Washoe County School District are eligible for the National School Lunch Program, only 39% of students participated and participation rates have remained stable over the past five years.42 This indicates that while the proportion of students who qualify for FRP lunch is high, less than half of the eligible students utilize the service. Table 14: Percent of Students Eligible for Free & Reduced Lunch Program, 2012 -2013 through 2016 -2017 Location 2012 -2013 2013 of children enrolled in the Washoe County School District from 2012 -2013 school year through 2016 -2017 school year were estimated to be eligible for FRP lunch . A lower proportion of children enrolled in the Washoe County School District were eligible for FRP lunch compared to Nevada overall from 2012 -2013 through 2016 -2017.

In Washoe County, the proportion of total students participating decreases as grade level increases . Participation declines from just over 50% in elementary schools to less than 20% by the time students are in high school. During the 2016 -2017 school year, a lower percentage of Washoe County students participated in the National School Lunch P rogram (39.2%) compared to Nevada (45.8%) and the United States (58.1%). 41 Nevada Department of Agriculture, Child Nutrition Program .

SNAP benefits are not allowed to be redeemed for alcoholic beverages, non -food items, vitamins, medicine, or foods that are to be ea ten in a store (hot foods, prepared foods).43 Nevada SNAP recipients receive SNAP funds at midnight of the first day of each month. Data from June 9, 2017 estimated 224,551 households in Nevada were enrolled in SNAP during March, 2017 and participants recei ved on average $118.48 per person for food expenditures for one month. 44 As of 2017, 41.4% of the 51,382 SNAP participants in Washoe County were children.45 SNAP participation rates in Nevada have remained relatively low, most recent aggregate data from 201 2-2014 show only an estimated 65% of eligible persons were participating, one of the lowest in the nation.46 The proportion of the population in Washoe County enrolled in SNAP increased from 2005 (3.9%) to 2014 (12.9%). The proportion of the population i n Washoe County enrolled in SNAP has remained lower than Nevada from 2005 through 2014.

According to 2015 Mind the Meal Gap data, an estimated 13.7% of Nevadans were food insecu re, while 12.7% of Washoe County residents and 21.6% of children in Washoe County were estimated to be food insecure.48 The Nevada Office of Health Informatics and Epidemiology recently published a report which utilized data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavi or Survey (YRBS) to estimate food insecurity among middle and high school students. The report estimated 16.0% of middle school students and 17.0% of high school students in Washoe County were food insecure.49 Table 16: Percent of Population Estimated to be Food Insecure Location 2013 2014 2015 Washoe County 14.7% 13.4% Food Deserts Having access to affordable healthy food is important to maintain a healthy balanced diet and research has shown lack of access to a supermarket is associated with fewer purchases of healthy foods.50 A food desert is a term used to categorize low -income census tracts which have limited access to supermarkets, grocery stores, or other sources of healthy and affor dable food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has defined food deserts across the nation as low -income neighborhoods with low -access to healthy food. A low -income neighborhood is defined as any census tract where: A) 20% or more of the census tract population is living at the poverty rate or B) the m edian family income is less than or equal to 80% of the state or metropolitan area s median family income . Low -access is defined as a s ignificant number (at least 500 people) or 33% of the census tract population is more than 1 mile (urban) or 10 miles (rural) from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store .51 The USDA -defined food deserts in Washoe County are shown for 2010 and 2015. In 2010, there were nine census tracts in Washoe County that were defined as a food desert , in 2015 this increased to 10 census 47 U.S. Department of Agriculture. Definitions of Food Security.

Question: \" Which of the following are the largest barriers to you eating healthy food more often? Select up to three. One in three respondents indicated they already eat enough healthy foods (36.5%). Healthy food is expensive (35.1%), spoils too quickly (25.8%) and takes too much time to shop for and/or prepare (24.6%) were the top three barriers identified by respondents. Less than 10% of respondents indicated lack of knowledge on food preparation (8.0%), limited access to healthy food (6.9%), not liking the taste of healthy food (7.2%), and lack of ability to identify healthy foods (3.4%) as barriers to eating healthy food Barriers to Eating Healthy Food More Often (n=1,412) 65 1.3 FOOD & HUNGER Food Insecurity A two -item screening tool was utilized to provide a food insecurity estimate among survey respondents. The two-item screening asked respondents to indicate if the two statements were \"never true\", \"sometimes or \"often true\", to either or both of the statements is associated with food insecurity.52 Additional research has found an affirmative answer to either or both of the statements is also associated with poor child health, increased risk for hospitalization, and developmental risk.53 1) \"Within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.\" 2) \"Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn't last and we didn't have money to get more.\" The majority of survey respondents indicated th e above statements were \"never true\" in the past 12 months. Almost one in five survey respondent's indicated the above statements were \"sometimes true\". One in ten (10.0%) survey respondents indicated they worried whether their food would run out before they had money to buy more often in the past 12 months, while another 7.6% indicated the food they bought did not last and they did not have money to get more often in the past 12 months. 52 Pooler, JU., Hoffman, V., Karva, F., Levin, M, & Lewin -Zwedlin g, A.

Among all respondents, 30.7% were estimated to be food insecure, as denoted by answering in the affirmative to either of the screening items. Among those with lower educational attainment ( no college degree, a high school degree , and those with no high school diploma or GED equivalent) approximately 44.4% were estimated to be food insecure, and among those with an associate's degree 44.7% were estimated to be food insecure. Food insecurity was lowest at 16.6% among survey respondents with a high educational attainment (bachelor' s degree, master 's degree , or PhD). Although food insecurity is indicated by an affirmative response to either of the statements, nearly one in four surve y respondents (24.3%) indicated an affirmative response to both statements. Among respondent's with a low educational attainment (no college education, high school graduate, and those without a high school diploma), 37.4% responded in the affirmative to bo th statements, compared to only 10.8% of those with a high educational attainment (bachelor's Affirmative to both% of respondents Fig 58: Food Insecurity among Survey Respondents by Educational Attainment All respondents (n = 1,391) Low Edu; No college degree or lower (n = 572) Medium; Associate's Degree (n = 132) High Edu; Bachelor's or higher (n = 687) 67 1.3 FOOD & HUNGER Figure 59 illustrates survey respondents who answered both the food security questions as well as the following q uestio n: \"During the past week, about how many servings of fruit and vegetables (combined) did you eat each day? Include fresh, frozen or cooked fruits and vegetables. DO NOT COUNT items such as fruit drinks, French fries, or potato chips.\" The number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed in the previous week differed among those who were not food insecure versus those who were food insecure. A higher proportion of respondents who screened positive for food insecurity indicated they ate 0 servings (4.0%) or 1 to 2 servings (42.7%) of fruits and vegetables each day over the past week, compared to those who were not food insecure who reported eating 0 servings ( 0.9%) or 1 to 2 servings (34.0%) of fruits and vegetables each day. Conver sely, a higher proportion of respondents who were not food insecure (40.7%) reported consuming 3 to 4 servings of fruits and vegetables each day within the previous week , compared to respondents that were food insecure (34.7%). Again, a higher proportion of respondents that were not food insecure (24.4%) reporting eating or 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day over the past week , compared to those who were food insecure (18.6% ). Summary of Food & Hunger Nevada has historically had low utili zation of programs such as SNAP, WIC, and the National School Lunch programs; however, in Washoe County SNAP enrollment increased during the Great Recession and has not yet decreased to pre -Recession levels. Meanwhile, FRP lunch eligibility rates remained relatively stable for the past 5 years and enrollment in WIC has decreased. The number of households and individuals that report being food insecure has decreased from 2013 (15.8%) to 2015 (13.7%). It is challenging to determine overall trend in needs for food assistance using indicators for federal nutrition assistance program enrollment, as they vary from program to program. Utilization of these services may be reflective of successful outreach and program enrollment 1 to 2 servings 3 to 4 servings 5 or more servings% of respondents Fig 59: Fruit & Vegetable Consumption by Food Security Status Not Food Insecure (n = 961) Food Insecure (n = 424) 68 1.3 FOOD & HUNGER Even though enrollment in social welfare programs can help reduce financial challenges, efforts aimed at reducing food insecurity should recognize perceived barriers to eating more healthy foods including cost, issues with food spoilage (mainly fruits and vegetables), and the time burden of shopping for and preparing food. Although the economy appears to be recovering per employment trends and other economic growth indicators, there are still many competing financial strains on families in Washoe County . These challenges should be considered when developing opportunities to reduce barriers and improve access to healthy foods. Washoe County has a strong collaborative network of engaged organizations working to reduce food insecurity and increase access to he althy food. Implementation of evidence -based solutions, along with a coordinated delivery of strong and consistent messages to the community will further the success of those working to reduce food insecurity and hunger.

In 2015, the national healthcare expenditures in the United States totaled $3.2 trillion and the per capita expenditure was an estimated $9,990.54 The costs of healthcare have skyrocketed over the past five decades, while the median income has not. Meanwhile, the quality of care and equity of services fall short of expectations, resulting in poorer health outcomes compared to other developed nations.55 Obtaining affordable health insurance is the first challenge in accessing health services in the United States. Additional barriers include the affordability and availability of services, clinic hours and locations, types of health insurance accepted, and having a sufficient number of healthcare providers in the workforce.56 Indicator Trend Most Recent Year HP 2020 Objective Insurance Coverage Children <18 years that are uninsured Decreasing 5.8% (2016) NA Adults 18 -64 years that have health insurance Increasing 86.0% (2016) NA Medicaid enrollment Increasing 19.0% (2016) Could not see doctor due to cost (adults) Decreasing 16.3% (2016) Provider Access Adults that have a personal healthcare provider Decreasing 72.2% (2016) NA Time since last physical (adults) Increasing 64.7% within past year (2016) NA Saw a dentist past year (adolescents) ~ 73.6% (2015) 49.0% Saw a dentist past year (adults) Increasing 65.4% (2016) 49.0% Healthcare Provider Workforce NA Percent of population living in HRSA primary care provider shortage area Increasing 35.4% (2016) NA Percent of population living in HRSA dental shortage area Increasing 35.4% (2016) NA Percent of population living in HRSA mental health provider shortage area STABLE 100.0% (2016) NA Ratio of providers to population (primary, dental, and mental care) ~ 1,360:1 (Primary Care -2014) 1,480:1 (Dentists -2014) 390:1 (Mental Health -2014) NA Physicians by type per 100,000 population ~ ~ NA Full time equivalents at Washoe County Health District Decreasing 3.4 per 10,000 (FY17 -18) NA ~not able to assess for trend ; NA=identical HP 2020 objective not available 54 Department of Health and Human Services .

Healthcare Provider Workforce The rapid population growth in Nevada and Washoe County has resulted in one of the lowest rates of physicians per capita in the nation.58 As the population continues to grow, residents face challenges accessing healthcare in a timely manner and finding providers who are accepting new patients. This is due to the limited number of provider s per 100,000 population. Health Professional Shortage Areas Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are geographic, population, or facility -based designations indicating a health professional shortage in primary care, dental health, or mental health. A geographic shortage encompasses a shortage of providers for an entire population within a geographic area, e.g. a county. A population -based shortage indicates a shortage of providers within a geographic area for a specific population group, such as low income or migrant workers. A facility -based shortage is a shortage within a specific type of facility, for example, state mental hospitals, federally qualified health centers, Indian health facilities, or correctional facilities. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) reviews HPSA applications to determine if they meet eligibility criteria for designation. Once designated, each HPSA receives a score indicating severity of the shortage, the higher the score (16 -25), the more severe the shor tage.59 Table 26: Percent of Population Residing in Health Professional Shortage Area by Type, Washoe County, 2012, 2014, & 2016 Provider Type 2012 2014 2016 Primary care 32.2% 34.2% 35.4% Dental health 32.9% 32.7% 35.4% Mental health ~ 100.0% 100.0% 58 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (2016).

The following tables illustrate further details regarding t he 2017 HPSA designations in Washoe County in conjunction with provider survey data from the Nevada Primary Care Office. Provider surveys are conducted on a period basis to identify primary care and psychiatrist provider practice location, patient care hou rs, and acceptance of Medicaid and/or sliding fee scale payments. These data inform the population to provider ratios for the 2017 HPSAs illustrated in Table 27, Table 28, and Table 29 .

The majority of people who had gone to an emergency room at least once in the past 2 months had only gone 1 time (60.1%); however, one in five respondents had gone twice, and nearly one in ten had gone four or more times in the past 12 months. Question: \"In the past 12 months, which of the following healthcare providers have you needed to see but couldn't? Select all that apply.\" Over half of respondents (55.8%) indicated the y were able to see all the providers they needed to see within the past 12 months. The most frequently identified provider needed, but unable to see within the past year was primary care (23.2%), followed by oral care -- dentist (21.0%), and a specialist (17.9%). 60.1% 22.4% 8.4% 9.1% 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0% 1 time 2 times 3 times 4 or more times% of respondents Fig 68: Number of Times Been to the Emergency Room in 69: Type of Provider Needed but Could Not See, Past 12 Months (n=1,304) 84 1.4 ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE Summary of Access to Healthcare The percentage of children (< 18 years) and adults (18 -64 years) who were uninsured in Washoe County has decreased in recent years, largely due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and resulting Medicaid expansion. In 2016, 19% of Washoe County's population was enrolled in Medicaid, many of whom are served by a few community health clinics. A higher percentage of adults in Washoe County reported having seen a provider in the past year, including dental providers, and fe wer people reported cost as a barrier to receiving healthcare services compared to pre -ACA periods. There are no psychiatrists outside Washoe County in the more rural areas across Northern Nevada, therefore these mental health providers are accessed eithe r through telehealth or long -distance travel, which adds an additional burden to the mental healthcare system in Washoe County. In 2017, Washoe County had a higher rate of licensed providers by specialty (per 100,000 persons) compared to Nevada; however, t here is already an existing deficit of internists, OB -GYN, pediatricians and other specialists is critical, this coupled with an aging healthcare workforce and continued population growth does not bode well. The loss of only a few physicians in any special ty could flip the county negatively. Additionally, the Washoe County Health District's budgeted full -time employee rate declined from FY06 -07 to FY14 -15 and remained at 3.4 FTE per 10,000 residents through FY17 -18. Having access to healthcare begins with a ffordability of basic preventive services such as immunizations, annual physicals, and screening for chronic diseases. However, the continued growth in population, coupled with the increase in proportion of people with health insurance and an ongoing short age of healthcare providers across the spectrum, has magnified challenges in accessing healthcare for all residents regardless of insurance status. Short -term solutions to accessing healthcare include increasing education regarding appropriate pathways for accessing healthcare, which could reduce unnecessary burdens on emergency rooms -- the most expensive entry point. Additionally, creating a continuum of care such as one -stop -shop options for vulnerable populations and frequent utilizers of the healthcare system is another way to maximize efficiency. A cost - effective solution to the overall shortage of providers includes expanding graduate medical education (GME) programs with the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine and regional healthcare provide rs. GME residency programs increase the number of providers available to treat patients during the course of the residency and slightly more than half of individuals stay in the communities where they conduct their residency.61 61 Association of American Medical Colleges.

Natural disasters, occupational hazards, and the built environment (infrastructure) are also considered to be environmental factors which may impact a person's quality of life and overall health.

Additional negative health impacts of poor air q uality include effects on the nervous system, and impacts on learning, memory, and behavior, some cancers, and premature death.62 Criteria Air Quality Pollutants The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to monitor six criteria air pollutants including particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), ozone (O), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and lead (Pb). Image 7 illustrates the locations of air monitoring stations in Washoe County as of 2017. 62 United States Environ mental Protection Agency. (2012). National Air Quality: Status and Trends of Key Air Pollutants . Accessed https://www.epa.gov/air -trends 88 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Image 7: Washoe County Ambient Air Monitoring Sites 2017 89 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Particulate Matter Particulate matter is a mixture of exceptionally small particles and liquid droplets composed of acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. Particles that are 10 micrometers in diameter (PM 10) or smaller (PM 2.5) are of concern because particles that size can pass through the throat, nose and lungs. Once inhaled, these particles affect the heart and lungs and can decrease lung function, aggravate asthma, result in the development of chronic bronchitis, can produce an irregular heartbeat, trigger nonfatal heart attacks, and potentially cause premature death in people with heart or lung disease. People with preexisting heart and lung conditions, children and older adults are the most likely to be affected by exposure to particulate matter, however even healthy people can experience symptoms from exposure to high levels of particulate matter. The EPA categorizes particle pollution into two criteria pollutants: 1. Inhalable coarse particles (PM 10), which are usually found near roadways and dusty industries, these are between 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diameter. 2. Fine particles (PM 2.5), these are typically from fireplace/woodstove or wildfire smoke, or they can form when gases from power plants, industries, and automobi les react in the air. These are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller. PM levels vary between the seasons. \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" and \"Unhealthy AQI\" levels of PM 2.5 happen during calm, cold wintertime inversions and wildfire episodes. PM 10 levels have been increasing, especially during the wintertime inversions and the days after snowstorms. Regulations related to woodstoves, street sanding and sweeping, and industry have all helped decrease particulate pollution in Reno/Sparks. Ozone Motor vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents, as well as natural sources, emit oxides of nitrogen (NO x) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which form ozone. Ground -level ozone is the primary constituent of smog. Sun light and hot weather cause ground -level ozone to form in harmful concentrations. Ground -level ozone affects the respiratory system by reducing the body's ability to take in more oxygen. Symptoms such as chest pains, coughing and throat irritation can occ ur by breathing in ozone. Among individuals with preexisting conditions such as bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma, ingestion of ozone can be extremely dangerous. Ozone levels for Reno/Sparks have been very close to the ambient air quality standards and occa sionally have reached the \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" air quality index level, since the 2008 standard began. Ozone is a primary summertime pollutant of concern for the area and will remain a challenge as future air quality standards strengthen. Nitrogen Dioxide Short -term nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) exposure, ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours, can cause airway inflammation in healthy people and increase respiratory symptoms in people with asthma. Studies show a connection between short -term exposure to elevated NO 2 concentrations and an increase in emergency room and hospital admissions for respiratory issues, especially asthma. The Washoe County Air Quality Management District has been monitoring NO 2 since 2009; however NO 2 has not been a concern in W ashoe County compared to ozone and particulate matter. Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas which can cause harmful health effects by reducing oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues. For a person with heart disease, a single exposure to low levels of CO may cause chest pain and reduce the ability to exercise. Exposure to high levels of CO can result in vision problems, reduced ability to work or lear n, reduced manual dexterity, and difficulty performing complex tasks . At extremely high levels, CO is poisonous and can cause death. Carbon monoxide has not been an ambient air quality problem since the early 1990s in Washoe County. Sulfur Dioxide Short -term exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO 2) has been linked to constricted airway passages in the lungs and exacerbate asthma symptoms. SO 2 and other sulfur oxides react with compounds to create small particles, which can cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis, as well as aggravate heart disease ca using increased hospital admissions and even premature death. 90 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Lead Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring metal, which historically was used in gasoline, water pipes and paint. Pb accumulates in the bones impacting the nervous system, immune system, reproduct ive systems, developmental systems, and impairing kidney function. Pb exposure has been linked to high blood pressure and heart disease in adults and is associates with behavioral problems, learning deficits, and decreased IQ levels in children. National Ambient Air Quality Standards & Air Quality Index The EPA developed standards known as National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), these are the regulatory levels at which air is considered unhealthy. The Air Quality Index (AQI ) is a metric for reporting air quality each day; the AQI was also established by the EPA and accounts for the major air pollutants combined. There have been NAAQS revisions in 2008, 2012, and 2015 which changed the AQI category ranges and number of days p er year in each range. Fig 70 provides a summary of the AQI for the measured criteria air pollutants combined, Fig 71 shows summary of the AQI for the measured criteria air pollutants compared to most current NAAQS, and Fig 72 illustrates the number of NAA QS exceedances occurring each year (2007 -2016) in Washoe County by criteria air pollutant type. *USG: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups; Note: 2008: 8 ppm; 2012: Annual PM 2.5 NAAQS strengthened 15.0 to 12 .0 \u00b5g/m3 ; 2015: 8 -hour O 3 NAAQS strengthened from 0.075 to 0.070 ppm From 2007 through 2016 Washoe County experienced over 200 days of \"good\" air quality annually, with the exception of 2013 (196 \"good\" days). 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Good 272 288 298 269 278 203 196 234 257 235 Moderate 93 70 64 94 85 161 152 124 105 124 USG* - 5 3 2 2 2 13 4 3 7 Unhealthy - 3 - - - - 4 3 - - Very Unhealthy - - - - - - - - - - Hazardous - - - - - - - - - - - 50 100 150 200 250 300 350Days per year Fig 70: Air Quality Index Summary, Washoe County, 2007 -2016 91 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH The number of days categorized as \"moderate\" in Washoe County doubled from 2011 (85 days) to 2012 (161 days), and remained above 100 days since 2012. This due to the changes in the NAAQS and not a reflection of air quality, see following Figure 71 for comparative trend. From 2007 through 2016 there were only three years with measured \"unhealthy\" air quality days in Washoe County, 2008 (three \"unhealthy\" days), 2013 (four \"unhealthy\" days), and 2014 (three \"unhealthy\" days). Unhealthy days are typically due to smoke from wild fires across northern Cal ifornia and Nevada. *USG: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups; Note: NAAQS as of 12/31/2016 were applied across all years With the most recent NAAQS applied across all years, overall the number of days categorized as \"good\" in Washoe County have trended dow n over the 10 year period illustrated by the dotted black line, although the number between 2007 (216 good days) to 2016 (235 good days) increased. With the most recent NAAQS applied across all years, overall the number of days categorized as \"moderate\" i n Washoe County have trended upward over the 10 year period illustrated by the red dashed line, although the number of days between 2007 (138 days) to 2016 (124 days) decreased. These trends are due to relatively worse air quality that occurred during the three -year period 2012 to 2014. Aside from these three years, the other seven years are quite similar with respect to better air quality. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Good 216 226 230 224 220 147 152 176 206 235 Moderate 138 125 131 137 141 207 192 179 147 124 USG* 11 12 4 4 4 12 17 7 12 7 Unhealthy - 3 - - - - 4 3 - - Very Unhealthy - - - - - - - - - - Hazardous - - - - - - - - - - - 50 100 150 200 250Days per year Fig 71: Air Quality Index Summary, Washoe County, 2007 -2016 with NAAQS as of 12/31/2016 Applied Across all Years 92 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Note: There were no exceedances for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, or sulfur dioxide in Washoe County fro m 2007 -2016; therefore data are not shown for those criteria air pollutants. The criteria air pollutant which most frequently exceeded EPA standards between 2007 and 2016 in Washoe County was PM 2.5, followed by ozone, and PM 10. Indoor Radon Radon is a naturally occurring colorless, odorless, and tasteless radioactive gas. Radon is produced when uranium, radium and thorium break down in rocks, soil, and groundwater. Radon is estimated to be the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States responsible for 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Lung cancer due to radon exposure costs an estimated $2 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity every year. People are exposed to radon primarily through cracks and gaps in homes and ot her buildings. The EPA estimates 1 in 15 homes in the United States have high radon levels. The Surgeon General and EPA recommend fixing homes that have an indoor air radon level of 4pCi/l or higher. 63 The only way to know the radon level in a home it to h ave it tested.

Slight ly more than one in five (22%) homes tested for radon in Washoe County have an indoor radon level above the recommended action level of 4 pCi/l or higher. Water Water treated for public utilization is not typically a major concern among developed nations. However, without regular monitoring, sources of pollution or naturally occurring substances may be present in high levels, which when exposed to over a long enough period of time, could result in negative health effects. Waterborne infectious diseases are primarily due to exposures during recreation on lakes or rivers or when a person consumes untreated water. Water Systems in Compliance A public or community water system is any system that provides water for human consumption with at least 15 service con nections or that serves an average of 25 persons for at least 60 days out of the year.64 There are over 100 community water systems in Washoe County and all are expected to maintain compliance with the regulations set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act. W ater systems are regularly tested for water contaminants including microorganisms, disinfectant residuals, disinfectant byproducts, radionuclides, as well as organic and inorganic chemicals. If a water sample test indicates a contaminate is above the EPA m aximum contaminant level (MCL) the sample has to be retested and the contaminate must fall back under the MCL within a set period 64 Environmental Protection Agency. Public Water Systems. Accessed https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/information by Radon Level Ranges, Washoe ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH of time or else the water system is designated as out of compliance. Once a water system is out of compliance the local health authority ensures the water system will distribute guidelines to either boil water from the tap or switch to bottled water depending on the type of contaminate in violation. Truckee Meadows Water Authority (TMWA) oversees the city water supply for the ma jority of the Reno - Sparks population (77%). More than 85% of the drinking water delivered by TMWA originates from Lake Tahoe, which is primarily fed by snow melt and rain throughout the Tahoe basin.

Industrial & Special Waste includes debris generated by Construction & Demolition. From 2010 thr ough 2016 the majority of waste generated in Washoe County was municipal solid waste. The amount of industrial and special waste (in tons) being disposed of in Washoe County increased from 2015 to 2016. 68 United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Recycling In 2016 a combined total of 383,663 tons of MSW and construction and demolition debris was recycled in Washoe Coun ty. Figure 78 shows the percentage of municipal solid waste recycled compare d to total waste recycled. Total waste includes MSW and construction and demolition debris combined. Figure 79 illustrates the percentage, by weight in tons, of material recycled in 2016. The percent of municipal solid waste (MSW) that was recycled in Washoe County increased from 2010 (27.1%) to 2016 (31.7%). However, since reaching a high of 36.6% in 2013, the proportion of MSW waste that has been recycled has decreased. From 2010 to 2016 the overall percent of waste recycled was higher than the proportion of MSW waste recycled. The total waste accounts for debris generated by Construction and Demolition as well as Special Waste. 3,006 3,280 3,034 3,349 3,003 2014 2015 2016Waste generated per person (pounds) Fig 77: Pounds of Municipal Solid Waste Generated per Person, 2014 2015 2016% of waste recycled Fig 78: Percent of MSW & Total Waste Recycled, Washoe County, 2010 -2016 Municipal Solid Waste Total Waste (MSW + C & D) 99 1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH In 2016, slightly over half (51.4%) of waste generated in Washoe County are municipal solid wastes, largely composed of metal (14.2%) and paper (13.1%). The proportion of recycled material in Washoe County classified as debris from Construction and Demolition (48.6%) was largely due to asphalt (26.1% ) and concrete (21.0%) in 2016. Summary of Environmental Health Overall air quality as measured by the NAAQS and annual exceedances has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years (2007 -2016) in Washoe County, with a few higher number of exceedences during the 2012 -2014 time period. Seasonal exceedances are often due to smoke from wildfires in the summer months and strong inversions which are more likely to occur during the winter months. Indoor air quality is often impacted by smoking tobacco produc ts indoors, however naturally occurring radon is a phenomenon Washoe County residents should be aware of and test for in their homes. The majority of community water systems in Washoe County have remained in compliance with the EPA defined MCLs from 2011 -2016. Reported cases of water borne illness, such as cryptosporidiosis and giardia which are cause by drinking untreated water, or eating food contaminated by untreated water, have both declined from 2007 through 2016. The amount of municipal solid waste disposed of or recycled in Washoe County has remained stable from 2010 through 2016, however industrial and special waste has increased. Overall, nearly one third of waste is recycled.

This section contains only injuries a nd deaths resulting from injuries, which were classified as unintentional, or accidental. The Crime & Violent -related Behaviors section contains data related to intentional injuries and fatalities. In 2014, the fourth highest cause of death was unintentio nal injuries, accounting for 59% of all deaths among persons 1 to 44 years of age in the United States. Poisonings, m otor vehicle accidents, and falls account for the majority of unintentional deaths, while motor vehicle accidents and falls attribute to th e largest proportion of non -fatal traumatic injuries. In 2013, injury and violence resulted in a $671 billion cost due to medical expenditur es and work loss related -costs.69 The consequences of injury can have long -lasting impacts. Taking proper safety precautions and being aware of potential hazards at all times can prevent and reduce the burden of unintentional injuries.

F rom 2007 through 2016 , the rates of unintentional deaths in Washoe County have been higher than Nevada and the United States. Since 2006, p oisonings, motor vehicle accidents, and falls were the top three causes of unintended deaths in Washoe County, Nevada, and the United States. Washoe County 's rates of death for the three top causes of unintentional death were also high er than Nevada and the United States. Rates of unintended deaths are higher among males, although the rates among females have been increasing in recent years in Washoe County . Falls, motor vehicle accidents, and other transport accidents were responsible for a large proportion of traumatic injury in Washoe County during 2016. The rate of deaths due to falls increased in recent years and was higher in Washoe County compared to Nevada. Falls are especially frequent among elderly populations and when they ar e not fatal, often result in debilitating injury including pelvic and back fractures and head injuries. As Washoe County 's elderly population continues to experience a higher rate growth , this is a topic to continue to monitor. In 2015, over one in five h igh school students in Washoe County (22.1%) reported having ridden in a car with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and 8.2% reported they had drove when drinking alcohol. Additionally in 2015, a record high of 38% of motor vehicle fatalities in Washo e County involved a driver with blood alcohol content at or above the legal limit (BAC 0.08). Injury and deaths due to people driving under the influence are 100% preventable , there is no excuse for driving while intoxicated . The increasing numbers of unin tentional injury and unintended deaths warrant attention to improve and expand on preventive efforts to reduce fatal and non -fatal injuries.

Carson City, NV. 111 1.7 CRIME & VIOLENT -RELATED BEHAVIORS Crime & Violent -Related Behaviors Exposure to violence and being a victim of crime or violence is detrimental to health, and effects often last beyond the initial threat or incident. Other than direct bodily harm, the lasting health impacts include psychological and behavioral changes such as chronic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and may result in unhealthy coping mechanisms such as increased substance use. Persons exposed to violenc e and violent behaviors are more likely to be a victim of violence and commit violence acts against others in the future.76 Indicator Trend Most Recent Year Violent crime, by type STABLE 514.5 per 100,000 (2016) Property crime, by type Decreasing 2,593.3 per 100,000 (2016) Washoe County School District K -12 bullying STABLE 16% reported incidents substantiated 2016 -2017 Washoe County School District K -12 cyber bullying Increasing 41% of reported incidents substantiated 2016 -2017 Violent Behaviors & Victi ms of Violence (Adolescents) Carried a weapon ~ 19.7% (2015) In a physical fight ~ 22.2% (2015) Electronically bullied ~ 16.8% (2015) Bullied on school property ~ 20.8% (2015) Missed school because feel unsafe at/on their way to and from school ~ 9.0% (2015) Threatened/injured on school property ~ 8.1% (2015) Experienced physical dating violence ~ 10.8% (2015) Experienced sexual dating violence ~ 12.1% (2015) Forced to have sexual intercourse ~ 9.1% (2015) Been physically hurt by an adult ~ 17.7% (2015) Have seen adults in their home be physically violent to one another ~ 16.6% (2015) Death due to homicide/assault STABLE 6.0 per 100,000 (2015) ~ unable to assess for trend 76 Wilkins, N., Tsao, B., Hertz, M., Davis, R., Klevens , J.

Atlanta, Georgia: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oa kland, California: Prevention Institute. 112 1.7 CRIME & VIOLENT -RELATED BEHAVIORS Violent Crime Violent crimes involve force or threats of force and include aggravated assault, robbery, forcible rape, murder, and non -negligent manslaughter. The violent crime rate per 100,000 population in the Reno/Sparks metropolitan statistical area (MSA ) has been higher than the rate in the U.S. every year from 2007 through 2016. From 2010 through 2013 the violent crime rate in the Reno/Sparks MSA was only slightly higher than the U.S. rate, however in 2014 Washoe County's rate began to increase and in 2016 was higher than the United States. Note: Legacy definition of rape (prior to 2013), included forcibly and against will. In 2013 the term forcible was removed an d the revised definition of rape includes \" Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vag ina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. Attempts or assaults to commit rape are also included; however, statutory rape and incest are excluded.\" Aggravated assault crimes have been the largest contributor to the violent crime rate in the Reno/Sparks MSA from 2007 through 2016 and have been increasing since 2014. The rate of robberies per 100,000 population fell from 2007 to 2014, however began to increase in 2014. 517.0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Rate per 100,000 population Fig 88: Violent Crime Rate, Reno/Sparks MSA & the United States, 2007 -2016 Reno/Sparks MSA United States 0.0100.0200.0300.0400.0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Rate per 100,000 population Fig 89: Violent Crime Rate by Type, Reno/Sparks MSA, 2007 - 2016 Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Forcible rape* Robbery Aggravated assault 113 1.7 CRIME & VIOLENT -RELATED BEHAVIORS Due to the change in definition of rape, the rate of forcible rape appears to have increased since 2013; however this may be a reflection of the change in definition and not a true increase of rape - see note under Figure 89. The rate of murder and non -negli gent manslaughter has remained less than 6.0 per 100,000 population from 2007 through 2016. Property Crime Property crimes do not involve force or threat to the victims of crime and include burglary, larceny -theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. 77 As of 2010, the rate of property crime per 100,000 population was lower in the Reno/Sparks MSA compared to the U.S. rates, however in 2016 the Reno/Sparks MSA property crime rate increased (2,593.3 per 100,000) and was higher than the U.S. rates (2,450.7 per 10 0,000). 77 Note: Due to varying collection procedures by local law enforcement agencies, limited data are available for arson and are not i ncluded in the data for 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Rate per 100,000 population Fig 90: Property Crime Rate, Reno/Sparks MSA & the United States, 2007 -2016 Reno/Sparks MSA United States (rates not shown) 114 1.7 CRIME & VIOLENT -RELATED BEHAVIORS Larceny -theft has been the largest contributor to overall property crimes in the Reno/Sparks MSA from 2007 through 2016. The rate of burglary per 100,000 population in the Reno/Sparks MSA decreased from 2007 through 2014, and reached a new low i n 2016. Motor vehicle theft per 100,000 population in the Reno/Sparks MSA decreased from 2007 through 2011, however has increased since then.

Summary of Crime & Violent -Related Behaviors The Reno/Sparks MSA has historically seen higher rates of violent crime and property crimes compared to the United States (2007 -2016). Although rates of crime appeared to have decreased since 2007 and remained relatively stable from 2010 to 2014, the rates of both violent an d property crime increased in 2015. Additionally, most of the select violent -related behaviors reported among high school students in Washoe County were higher than Nevada and United States rates during both 2013 and 2015. The majority of survey responde nts indicated they feel their neighborhood is very or somewhat safe from crime. However, when broken out by ZIP code, the ZIP codes with the highest proportion of residents indicating they felt their neighborhood is somewhat or very unsafe are the same fiv e ZIP codes with the highest Community Needs Index (CNI) scores. Having been a victim or witness of violence results in negative impacts across several aspects of health and carries consequences far beyond the initial incident; reducing a person's exposur e to all forms of violence, both in and outside of the home, play a major part in increasing the health and safety of a community.

Having a work schedule that allows for flexibility to incorporate physical activity (3.2%) was not among the options provided, but listed so frequently in the comments it was given it's own category. Summary of Nutrition & Physical Activity According to the 2013 and 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data , fruit and vegetable consumption reported by Washoe County high school students was relatively similar to the United States. Soda consumption among Washoe C ounty high school students was lower than the United States and reported milk consumption among Washoe County high school students was relatively similar to the United States. In Would Help to Increase Physical Activity Levels (n=1,377) 138 1.8 NUTRITION & PHYSICAL ACTIVITY reported fruit and vegetable consumption among Washoe County adults was slightly higher than adults nationwide. In 2015, less than one -third (27.0%) of Washoe County high school students met the recommended physical activity guidelines for adolescents (physically active for 60 minutes daily). Additionally, less than one - third (28.5%) of adults in Washoe County were reported to have met both the aerobic and strengthening guidelines. In 2015, one in five (20.9%) Washoe County high school students reported watching television for three or more hours each day and one in three (3 3.6%) reported playing videogames or using a computer (not for schoolwork) for three or more hours each day. While these appear high, Washoe County 's rates were lower than the rest of the United States. Analyses of the community survey responses indicate just over one in five respondents (22.5%) were close to consuming the daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetables. The largest reported barriers to eating healthy food more often were \"healthy food is too expensive \" (35.1%), \"spoils too quickly \" (25.8 %), and \"takes too much time to shop and prepare healthy food \" (24.6%). Lack of knowledge on how to prepare healthy food (8.0%), not liking the taste of healthy food (7.2%), having limited access (6.9%), and the lack of ability to identify healthy foods (3 .4%) were among the least frequently cited barriers. Respondents that reported eating a higher number of servings of fruits and vegetables (3 to 5 servings) were less likely to identify any of the above reasons as barriers to healthy eating. The majority of survey respondents indicated they engage in physical activity outdoors (67.3%) or at home (46.6%). The most frequently cited barriers to being more physically active were \"being too busy \" (49.0%), \"too tired \" (38.0%) , or \"bad weather \" including too hot, too cold, and smoke from wild fires (18.9%). Over one in three respondents indicated having less expensive memberships (38.2%), exercise facilities at work (37.7%), and self-motivation or motivation/support from friends (33.2%) would he lp to increase physical activity levels. People can significantly reduce their risk for the most prevalent chronic conditions and seven of the top 10 leading causes of death by eating a healthy diet consisting of nutrient -dense foods from each food group and limiting saturated fats, sugars, and sodium, as well as engaging in regular and adequate physical activity to help maintain a healthy weight .

Perceived self-reported health status is a validated proxy indicator for assessing population health. The categories of self- reported health status range from \"excellent\" to \"poor\". These categories are a predictor of morbidity and mortality and correlate with socioeconomic indicators such as educational attainment and income. 81, 82 Weight status is included within the General Health section since being overweight or obese increases the risk for the majority of the leading causes of death in the United States. Becoming overweight or obese is a result of a variety of factors including diet, exercise, genetic predisposition, and even medication use. However, in 1960, only 13.4% of Americans were obese, compared to 37.9% of adults as of 2013-2014.83 In 2015, two in every three adults and one in every three adolescents in the United States were overweight or obese.84,85 Obesity may be the single largest threat, to not only public health, but the economy as well.86 A study utilizing data from 2000-2005 estimated the annual cost of obesity in the United States was $209.7 billion (2008 dollars).87 Obese individuals spend approximately 36% more on healthcare related costs compared to the general population and spend 21% more than daily smokers and 14% more than heavy drinkers on general health services.88 81 Milunpalo S., Vuori I., Oja P., Pasanen M., & Urponen H.

Weight Status This section provides weight status among various groups, as measured by body mass index (BMI). Body mass index is a calculation of a person's weight in kilograms divided by square height in meters. The resulting number is used to classify and screen for o verweight and obesity. Although BMI is moderately correlated with body fat, it does not measure body fat directly nor does it necessarily determine an individual's health status. 143 1.9 GENERAL HEALTH BMI is however, strongly correlated with a variety of adverse health outcomes that are associated with being overweight or obese.89 Data caveat: The data provided in Table 84, Table 85, and Table 86 illustrate weight classification based on BMI calculated from student's height and weight as measured by school nurses. This source of data collection differs from Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data presented in Table 87 and Table 88. For the YRBS, BMI is calculated from the student's self -reported height and weight.

However, an estimated 70.0% of adults in Washoe County with less than a high school education were classified as either overweight or obese, compared to 58.4% of adults who were college graduates. In 2016, only one in three adults (34.6%) in Washoe County were classified as a healthy weight. While 29.6% of adults with less than a high school educa tion were a healthy weight, 39.5% of college graduates were classified as a healthy weight. Summary of General Health The proportion of adults 18 years and older and adults 65 years in Washoe County that perceive their health status to be fair or poor increased from 2012 to 2016, indicating the perceived quality of life may be declining among Washoe County residents. The trends in weight status among 4th, 7th and 10th graders vary, however the proportion of students classified as a \"healthy weight\" has remained stable (4th graders) or declined (7th and 10th graders) among all three groups. The proportion of adults classified as a \"healthy weight\" also declined, while the percentage of adults classified as overweight or obese increased from 2012 to 2016. The trends in perceived self -reported health status and weight status among youth and adults in Washoe County are concerning. Both of these indicators are associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes and are influenced by a multitude of factors. Perceived health status is an indicator not just of physical health, but also of other forms of health including mental and spiritual. Preventing or reducing obesity by increasing physical activity levels and improving dietary quality should be a top prior ity for everybody.

Some substances, even when taken in small doses, can be immediately intoxicating and may lead to chemical dependency, while others only prove to be harmful when an excessive amount is con sumed. Substances, both legal and illegal, may be ingested to provide relief or reprieve from a range of negative stimuli from daily stress to chronic pain. When substances are used in excess or in a manner other than intended, causing harm to the user or others around them, it is classified as substance misuse or abuse.90 Combined, alcohol misuse, illicit drug use, misuse of medications, and substance use disorders are estimated to cost the United States over $400 billion in workplace productivity, health care expenses, motor vehicle crashes, law enforcement, and criminal justice costs.91, 92 The effects of substance use and misuse often extend beyond the health of the individual user. Additional impacts include increased violence, sexual assault, and loss o f employment, housing, and other financial assets.

Mortality rates for alcohol - related causes of death have increased coun ty-wide and have remained higher than Nevada from 2006 through 2015. The rates of current marijuana use among adolescents and college students have increased from previous years, are higher than rates for the United States, and are expected to continue to increase due to legalization of recreational use in Nevada. Although reported misuse of prescription drugs among adolescents and college students decreased from previous years, the rate of hospitalization for opioid poisonings in Washoe County have increas ed from 2007 through 2015 and have remained higher than Nevada. Continued integration of substance use prevention, screening, and treatment into the traditional health care settings can decrease stigma and the burden on standalone treatment facilities, as well as increase opportunities for reducing poor health outcomes and improving quality of life.

Carson City, NV. 172 1.11 MENTAL HEALTH Mental Health Mental health involves a person's physical, emotional, and psychological well -being, and encompasses how a person copes with stress, how they respond towards unexpected events in their life, and how they engage socially with others. Mental health can impact physical health in various ways; stress and related anxiety for example, can cause stomachaches, headaches, lack of appeti te, trouble sleeping, as well as unexplained increases or decreases in energy levels.105 Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels in the blood stream which increases blood sugar, and inhibits memory and immune system function.106 Additionally, chronic stress an d cumulative stress has been shown to be associated with diagnosable mental illnesses such as depression and other psychiatric disorders.107 Some types of mental illness may not produce symptoms such as fevers, or other visible physical signs, but instead are subjective and measured only by the person experiencing the condition. Any type of mental illness can be challenging to recognize, especi ally for someone not familiar with a person's normal behavior. The comorbidity of substance use disorders and mental illness are collectively referred to as behavioral health. This assessment contains a separate Substance Use section therefore this secti on encompasses only those indicators related to mental health and mental illness. Conditions involving mental impairment, such as developmental or intellectual disabilities, were not included.

Primary Survey Data Related to Mental Health Primary data were collected via an online community survey from over 1,400 survey participants. The survey included 44 questions and analyses for questions related to mental health a re provided within this section. Results and findings from the online community survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe County residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the online community surv ey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainment relative to the general Washoe County population. For complete survey methodology and participant demographics refer to the Contents, Methodology, & C ommunity Survey Demographics section. Stress involves the brain and body's physical responses to a demand such as work, school, life changes, traumatic events, or even exercise. Stress can be chronic stemming from a routine daily occurrence such as rush hour traffic or a poor relationship with co -workers, friends or family , or stress can brought on by a sudden event such as bad news, illness, assault, or natural disasters. Not all types of stress are bad, for example, when faced with a perceived threat, a person's body undergoes physical changes - the pulse quickens delivering more oxygen and blood to the brain and organs and muscles tense up to prepare for action. The body's short -term instinctive responses to stress may be lifesaving 23.0 16.5 19.3 20.3 21.5 19.2 17.1 21.2 20.3 22.5 19.2 17.8 19.4 18.7 19.7 18.2 17.7 18.2 19.1 18.2 10.9 11.3 11.6 11.7 12.1 12.3 12.6 12.6 13.0 13.3 0.010.020.030.0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Rate per 100,000 population Fig 125: Age -adjusted Rate of Death Due to Suicide/Intentional Self Harm, Washoe County, Nevada, & the United States, 2006 - 2015 Washoe County Nevada United States 177 1.11 MENTAL HEALTH and bodily function s quickly return to normal levels after danger has passed. In modern time, humans are not usually faced with fight or flight conditions, but instead are coping with long -term stressors. Long -term or chronic stress results in impaired immune, cardiovascular , and digestive systems causing an inability to sleep, headaches, prolonged high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Stress also drives mental health disorders including depression and anxiety.108,109 Stress can be managed to a certain extent through a variety of healthy coping mechanisms including recognizing stressors and preparing, engaging in physical activity, meditation, goal setting, or connecting with close friends or family. The community sur vey contained a series of four questions to assess for perceived stress. The respondents were asked the frequency they felt each of the following questions on a scale from \"never\", \"almost \"Within the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control important things in your life?\" Question 2: \"Within the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?\" Question 3: \"Within the last month, how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?\" Question 4: \"Within the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?\" Scoring: The first and second questions were sco red in ascending order meaning, \"never\" scored a \"0\" and a \"very often\" response was scored as \"5\". The third and fourth questions were scored in descending order meaning, \"never\" scored a \"5\" and a \"very often \" response was scored as \"0\". The higher the t otal score indicates a higher level of perceived stress. Total scores were calculated for only those participants that responded to all four questions in order to assess a true score. The overall average perceived stress score was a 5.51 among the 1,358 re spondents that answered all four questions. 108 National Institutes of Health. 5 Things You Should Know About Stress. Accessed https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/stress/index.shtml 109 American Institute of Stress. Stress Effects. Accessed https://www.stress.org/stress -effects/ 178 1.11 MENTAL HEALTH The majority of the 1,358 respondents were on the lower end of the perceived stress score spectrum with 40% scoring a total from 0 to 4 (lowest perceived stress) and 41% scoring a total between 5 and 8. Only 2 % of the 1,358 respondents to the four -question scale received a total score between 13 and 16 (highest perceived stress). When the average perceived stress scores were stratified by age group a clear pattern developed. As age increased, the average per ceived stress score decreased. The mean perceived stress score among respondents 18 years and younger was 8.00, and with each increase in age group, perceived stress scores decreased, with a low score of 4.44 among those 65 -74 years of age.

Survey respondents that had a high school degree or less (no high school degree ) had an average perceived stress score of 6.26, compared to respondents with a Master's degree or higher (PhD , medical degree, law degree) with an average perceived stress score of 4.72. There was a clear pattern in perceived stress when stratified by e mployment status. Those who were out of work (8.02) or unable to work (8.00) had the highest scores, followed by those who were students (6.51)or homemakers (6.20). Those with part time (5.40) or full time (5.31) employment had the second to lowest scores , while those who were retired (4.07) had the lowest perceived stress. This pattern is likely associated with age as well, as younger respondents had higher average perceived stress scores, while those in a retirement age bracket 65+ years had the lowest perceived stress scores. 6.26 6.13 6.04 5.14 4.72 02468 High school degree or less college no formal degree (n=291)Associate's degree (n=132)Bachelor's degree (n=368)Master's degree or higher (n=318)Average score Fig 128: Perceived Stress Scores by Educational Attainment (n=1,254) 8.02 8.00 6.51 6.20 5.40 5.31 4.07 0.002.004.006.008.0010.00 Out of Work (n=45)Disabled/ Unable to Work (n=84)Homemaker (n=35)Employed Part Time (n=97)Employed Full Time (n=808)Retired (n=137)Average score Fig 129: Perceived Stress Score by Employment Status (n=1,244) 180 1.11 MENTAL HEALTH Summary of Mental Health In 2015 one in th ree high school students in Washoe County reported they felt sad or hopeless for two or more weeks (during the past year), a rate higher than Nevada and the United States. In 2016, the percentage of adults in Washoe County reporting poor mental health day s was higher than Nevada and has remained relatively stable since 2012. Reportage depression disorders and 14 or more poor mental health days were higher among adult females compared to males in Washoe County. The percent of adults in Washoe County with an y mental illness, a serious mental illness or a major depressive episode in the past year was slightly higher compared to Nevada and the United States, for all three conditions. In 2015, nearly one in three (32.8%) of Washoe County high school students rep orted they had ever lived with someone that was depressed, mentally ill, or suicidal. In both 2013 and 2015 a higher percentage of Washoe County high school students reported considering attempting suicide and attempting suicide in the past year compared t o Nevada and the United States. The mortality rate for suicide and intentional self -harm among adults remained relatively stable in Washoe County. In 2015, the mortality rate was 22.5 deaths per 100,000 population. However, this rate was higher than the o verall state rate. While stressors occur among people of all age groups, perceived stress and rates of depression appear to be more prevalent among younger adults compared to older adults in Washoe County. This may be due to generational differences, or t echnology such as utilization of social media, or even biological and developmental processes. Additionally chronic stress, including social and environmental stressors, contributes to poor health outcomes even among those who may not present with a clinic ally diagnosable mental disorder.

Chlamydia is transmitted through vaginal, anal, and oral sexual intercourse and can be passed to a fetus during childbirth, wh ich can lead to blindness and pneumonia of the infant. If left untreated, chlamydia can result in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Chlamydia is treatable with antibiotics; however continued intercourse with a partner who is also infected and not also treated, may result in repeated infections.110 The rate of reported cases (per 100,000 population) of chlamydia in Washoe County have increased steadily each year from 2009 through 2016 . In 2016, the rate of reported cases of chlamydia in Washoe County (493.0 per 100,000) was lower than Nevada (506.7 per 100,000) and the United States (497.3 per 100,000). 110 Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention.

If left untreated, gonorrhea can result in serious and permanent health issues, including infertility in both men and women. Gonorrhea can spread to the uterus or fallopian tubes causing pelvic inflammatory disease, and can also spread to the blood stream resulting in an infection which can cause a rthritis, tenosynovitis, or dermatitis.111 Although gonorrhea can be treated, antibiotic -resistant strains have been emerging and gonorrhea is now resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, sulfanilamides, and fluoroquinolones, leaving one effective class of ant ibiotics (cephalosporins) available.112 From 2007 through 2013, the rate of reported cases (per 100,000 population) of gonorrhea in Washoe County was lower than the rates reported in Nevada and the United States. The rate of gonorrhea in Washoe County has more than quadrupled since 2011; however, in 2016 was lower (134.0 per 100,000) than Nevada (151.5 per 100,000) and the United States (145.8 per 100,000). 111 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The prima ry and secondary stages of Syphilis are both contagious, while late latent stage (infection for more than one year) and tertiary syphilis are not. Symptoms of the primary stage of syphilis include a single chancre which is usually firm, round, small, and painless, typically lasting 3 -6 weeks. The secondary stage is marked by a rough, red or reddish -brown rash on the trunk and extremities, swollen lymph nodes, fever, and some may experience patchy hair loss. Both the primary and secondary stages of syphilis may be asymptomatic, however if left untreated can progress to the latent and tertiary stages. Latent syphilis can affect the heart, brain, and other organs. All stages of syphilis can be treated; however treatment cannot reverse any damage to tissues or nerves. 113 From 2007 through 2012 the rate of reported cases (per 100,000 population) of primary and secondary syphilis in Washoe County were lower than Nevada and the United States. Washoe County experienced nearly double the rate of reported cases of pr imary and secondary syphilis from 2012 (3.78 per 100,000 population) to 2013 (7.75 per 100,000 population) and rates have remained high. In 2016, the rate of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis in Washoe County (7.39 per 100,000) were lower t han Nevada (15.4 per 100,000) and the United States (8.7 per 100,000). 113 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

HIV is a virus which attacks the body's immune system, specifically CD4 or T -cells, and overtime results in the body being unable to fight off infections and diseases. A CD4 cell count of 200 cells/mm or less meets the diagnostic criteria for AIDS. Once a person has been diagn osed with AIDS, they are more likely to develop rare diseases and cancers, typically referred to as opportunistic infections. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse, sharing of needles (including piercing and tattoo equipment), or equipment used to prepare and inject intravenous drugs. HIV can also be transmitted from mothers to infants during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although there is no vaccine or cure for HIV, there have been new developments such as pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which when taken appropriately may reduce the likelihood of infection after a possible recent exposure (72 hours or less).114 The rate of reported cases of newly diagnosed HIV infection in Was hoe County decreased from 2007 (10.9 per 100,000) to 2016 (9.6 per 100,000). The rate of reported cases of newly diagnosed HIV infection in Washoe County has remained lower than Nevada and the United States from 2007 through 2015. 114 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Teen Birth Rates Pregnant adolescent females (15 to 19 years) are considered to have higher risks for negative health outcomes related to birth, not only impacting their child's l ives, but their own as well. Teen mothers are more likely to end pregnancy in abortion and are less likely to enroll in prenatal care during pregnancy. 115 Additionally, women who give birth during their teen years are less likely to finish high school, earn a GED, and are more likely to live in poverty.116,117 Infants of teen mothers have an increased chance of being born prematurely and having a low weight at birth and therefore an increased risk for infant mortality. 118 Children of teen mothers have 2 -4 times h igher mortality rates, higher rates of hospitalizations, and are less likely to finish high school than children born of non-teenaged mothers.119 As adults, those born to teen mothers are more likely to grow up in poverty, give birth as a teenager, have high er unemployment rates and lower rates of income and as a result, experience more health issues through all stages of life.120,121 Table 130: Teen Birth Rate* among Women 15 -19 years, 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Washoe County 30.6 28.4 29.0 27.4 21.9 Nevada 31.9 28.7 27.4 26.1 22.6 United States 29.4 26.5 24.2 22.3 ~ *Birth rate per 1,000 women; ~ data not available The rate of births among teens aged 15 -19 years in Washoe County decreased from 2012 (30.6 per 1,000) to 2016 (21.9 per 1,000); however remained higher than the United States from 2012 -2015.

Teen birth rates among females ag ed 15 -19 years in Washoe County were lowest among Asian/Pacific Islander and white, non -Hispanic populations from 2012 through 2016. Summary of Sexual Health Although historically low, the rates of reported cases of Chlamydia and gonorrhea in Washoe Count y have increased and in recent years have been nearing the state and national rates. The rates of reported primary and secondary syphilis have also increased dramatically since 2010. In 2015, the percentage of high school students in Washoe County who rep orted they were ever or currently sexually active was relatively similar to the state and nation. Condom use among adolescents in Washoe County was slightly lower in Washoe County than Nevada and the United States. However, the percent of high school stude nts reporting not using any form of birth control during their last sexual intercourse was slightly lower in Washoe County compared to Nevada and the United States. The rate of birth among teenage females in Washoe County decreased from 2012 to 2016, mirro ring national trends. The increased rates of sexually transmitted infections coupled with the low rates of teenage pregnancy may indicate a reduction in the perceived importance of condom use. With the increase in alternative forms of birth control, condo m use as a form of birth control may be decreasing, which allows for spread of sexually transmitted infections. Having fewer sexual partners, wearing condoms, and obtaining regular screening and treatment reduces the risk for sexually transmitted infection s.

Studies have found health at birth is largely influenced by socioeconomic status and not simply genetic traits. Having poor health at birth is associated with a broad range of adverse health effects across the lifespan including, reduction in the child's ability to learn, lower rates of high school graduation, higher rates of hospitalizations, and higher childhood mortality.122 Although teen birth rates are an indicator associated with maternal and child health, teen birth rate data are provided within the Sexual Health Section.

The ACE Study found a graded dose -response relationship between the number of ACEs experienced and poor health outcomes. An Adverse Childhood Experience, or ACE, is an event which contributes to stre ss including psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; violence against mother; or living with household members who abused substances, were mentally ill or suicidal, or ever imprisoned.123 As the number of cumulative ACEs increases, so does the risk for infant death, alcoholism/alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, liver disease, poor work performance, financial stress, risk for intimate partner violence, sexuall y transmitted diseases, smoking, attempted suicide, unintended pregnancies, and poor academic achievement, among others.124 Nevada ACEs The 2015 Nevada High School YRBS included five state -added ACE questions to assess lifetime prevalence of physical abuse by an adult, forced sex, household domestic violence, household mental illness, and household substance abuse. An analysis of 2015 Nevada High School YRBS respondents found a statistically significant (p<0.05) graded relationship between 73% of risk factor s measured by the YRBS as the number of ACEs increased. Statewide, female students, students who qualified for free or reduced lunch, students with parents/other adults in their family serving in the military, students who identified as lesbian, gay, or bi sexual, and students who did not received mostly As or Bs in school had a statistically significant (p<0.001) higher number of ACEs.125 The following figures depict the graded relationship between the numbers of cumulative ACEs and select risk factors as m easured by the 2015 Nevada High School YRBS.

Nearly one in three (32.8%) high school students in Washoe County reported they ever lived with someone who was depressed, mentally ill, or suicidal. One in three (33.8%) high school students in Washoe County reported they had ever lived with someone who was a problem drinker, alcoh olic, or abused street or prescription drugs. Household and family environment impacts and often predicts health outcomes decades in advance; increasing stability and protective factors among all families, but especially those children who may be high -risk, is instrumental to improving the health and quality of life for future generations. KIDS COUNT Rankings The Annie E. Casey Foundation works with all 50 states to increase child advocacy by promoting effective policy and tracking the well -being of children across the nation. Each year since 1990, the Foundation has released the KIDS COUNT data book that highlights state -by-state data and statistics to measure child health. Since 2010, Nevada's rank decreased from 36th to the bottom 40s each year sin ce 2011 and was ranked 47th in 2017. The 2017 KIDS COUNT report measured 16 indicators to determine each state's rank for economic well-being (ranked 40th), education (ranked 49th), health (ranked 45th), family and community (ranked 45th) as it relates to child health.127 Single -parent Households 127 The Annie E. Casey Foundation. 2017 KIDS COUNT Data Book, State trends in 2016% of children Fig 139: Percent of Children Living with One Parent, Washoe County, Nevada, & the United States, 2012 -2016 Washoe County Nevada United States (% not shown) 196 1.13 MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH The percent of children living with one parent in Washoe County decreased from 2012 (36.0%) to 2016 (31.9%). In 2016, the percentage of children living with one parent in Washoe County (31.9%) was lower than Nevad a (37.9%), and the United States (34.7%). Birth Rates An estimated 50% of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, therefore one in every two children conceived are potentially at risk for various complications later in life due to the parents not being prepared mentally, physical, social, or finan cially to care for and raise a child. 128,129 A key prevention strategy to reducing poor birth outcomes is to assess the health of the parents prior to conception. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends preconception maternal heal th screenings include physical screenings, risk screenings, vaccinations, and counseling. Physical screenings may include assessing maternal health factors such as obesity, substance use, and genetic carrier traits which could lead to birth defects, geneti c disorders, and other health complications. Additional screening includes HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to prevent passing those diseases onto the fetus.130 Half of pregnant women in the United States are overweight or obese which can lead to complications including, but not limited to, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and postpartum weight retention. Maternal obesity can result in birth complications including shorter gestation or premature birth, stillbirth, congenital abnormaliti es, and childhood obesity.131 Table 131: Birth Rate among Women 20 -44 years, 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 per 1,000 females aged 20 -44 years The rate of live births among women 20 -44 years in Washoe County have remained relatively stable from 2012 (67.9 per 1,000 females 20 -44 years) to 2016 (67.5 per 1,000 females 20 -44 years).

Women, Infants & Children (WIC) Women, Infants and Children (WIC), is a federally funded grant program available in all 50 states, plus Washington D.C., 34 Indian Tribal Organizations, and all five U.S. territories. The WIC program has been shown to increase pregnancy duration, resulting in fewer prema ture births, decrease infant mortality, increase likelihood of receiving prenatal care, improve diet and related outcomes, and increase breastfeeding duration.136 The WIC program's target population is low -income, nutritionally at -risk pregnant women (throug h pregnancy up to six weeks after birth), breastfeeding women (up to infant's first birthday), non -breastfeeding women (up to six months after birth of an infant), infants (up to 1 year) and children up to their fifth birthday. During Fiscal Year 2016, 7.6 million women, infants, and children participated in WIC programs nationwide.137 WIC provides supplemental nutritious foods, nutrition education and counseling, and screening and referrals to other health, welfare and social services.

Although below healthy People 2020 target objectives, the proportion of infants reported by WIC programs to have ever been breastfed and breastfed at 6 months ha s increased from 2012 to 2016. In 2015, mortality rates among infants (<1 year) and children 1 -4 years were lower in Washoe County than Nevada, the United States, and Healthy People 2020 objectives; however the mortality rate among children aged 5 to 14 years hit a new high of 18.2 per 100,000 population in 2015. Transport (motor vehicle) accidents were the top cause of death among children ages 1 to 14 years in Washoe County from 2006 through 2015. Family planning and education are instrumental to help i ncrease the number of women who are better prepared to start a family at a time that is appropriate for them. This increases the chance of enrolling in prenatal care within the first trimester, and establishing a connection with a provider who should close ly monitor the growth and health of both the mother and the fetus. These factors all help to reduce the likelihood of preterm births and low birth weight infants, which in turn decreases infant death rates. By fostering a healthy and safe environment for t he mother, the baby and the rest of the family, children will have a better chance for success and living a healthy life as they develop.

Carson City, NV. 212 1.14 IMMUNIZATIONS & SCREENINGS Immunizations & Screenings Receiving recommended immunizations and obtaining timely cancer screenings are two preventive mechanisms that reduce disease prevalence and severity. A century ago, people in th e United States were primarily dying due to infectious diseases; this is no longer true, due largely in part to antibiotics and widespread vaccination.142 Having each birth cohort (group of children born during a certain period of time) receiving the proper vaccinations at the proper time is estimated to save 33,000 lives, as well as prevent 14 million cases of disease. In doing so, vaccines are a cost effe ctive prevention measure, estimated to reduce direct health care costs by $9.9 billion and indirect costs by $33.4 billion. This cost saving is attributed to the reduction in loss of life and additional cases of disease.143 Cancer has been the second leadin g cause of death in the United States since 1938.144 Based on data from 2010 -2012, nearly 40% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes.145 Medical technological advancements have improved the ability to screen effecti vely for many types of cancer. These screenings are important for the early detection of potentially life -threatening health conditions. Health costs are reduced, treatments are more successful, and full recovery for certain cancers is more likely when the cancer is caught in an early stage of disease.146 Indicator Trend Most Recent Year HP 2020 Objective Immunizations Children 19 -35 months that received recommended vaccination series Increasing 79.8% (2016) 80.0% Young adults <26 years that received all doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Increasing 11.7% (Females -2016) 0.9% (Males -2016) NA Children 3 to 18 years that received influenza immunization Increasing 22.0% (2015 -2016) 70.0% Adults 18 -64 years that received annual flu shot Increasing 31.1% 2016 70.0% Seniors 65+ years that received annual flu shot Increasing 52.0% (2016) 70.0% Seniors 65+ years that ever received pneumonia vaccination Decreasing 74.8% (2016) 90.0% Screenings Adults 18+ years that had cholesterol checked within past 5 years ~ 77.3% (2015) 82.1% Adults 18+ years that had test for high blood sugar or diabetes within past 3 years Increasing 56.9% (2015) NA 142 Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n.

During the first year of life, infant immunity declines making the infant susceptible to infections, some which cause permanent damage or result in death. Obtain ing the recommended vaccination series at the appropriate ages significantly reduces and in most cases, completely prevents infants from getting these diseases. When the majority of a community is vaccinated, they create what is known as \"herd immunity\" or \"community immunity\". Community immunity helps to protect those who are too young to obtain vaccinations or are unable to receive vaccinations due to medical reasons, by limiting the number of individuals with an active infectious disease.147 Table 138: Pe rcent of Children 19 -35 Months that Received Recommended Vaccination Series*, 2009 -2016 Location 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 of polio; 1 dose of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella); 3 doses of Hib; 3 doses of Hepatitis B; 1 dose of varicella; 4 doses of pneumococcal Note: 2016 data as of 4/2017; 2015 data as of 2/2017 Immun ization rates for the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 vaccination series (see note), among children 19 -35 months in Washoe County increased from 2009 (61.4%) to 2016 (79.8%).

HPV is so common that nearly a ll men and women become infected over the course of their lifetime. Usually HPV resolves without treatment; however in some cases, can cause warts or cancer.148 Table 139: Percent of Young Adults aged 26 years that Received 3 HPV Doses by Sex, Washoe County, 2012 - 2016 Sex 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Females of females aged 26 years in Washoe County that received all 3 doses of HPV vaccine increased from 2012 (3.1%) to 2016 (11.7%). The percentage of females aged 26 years that received all 3 doses of HPV vaccine has been higher than the percentage of males in Washoe County from 2012 through 2016. Influenza Immunization Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory infection that causes illness for up to two weeks ranging from mild to severe, and in some cases may result in hospitalization or death. Children under the age of 5, adults 65 years and older, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals are considered high -risk for serious influenza complications. Obtaining a seasonal flu shot is recommended for all persons 6 months and older, with focus on persons considered to be high -risk, and persons who work with vulnerable high -risk populations.149,150 Table 140: Percent of Child ren 3 to 18 years that Received Influenza Immunization, 2010 -2011 through 2015 - 2016 Location 2010 -2011 2011 -2012 2012 -2013 of children aged 3 to 18 years in Washoe County that received annual influenza immunization increased slightly from 18% in 2010 -2011 to 22% in 2015 -2016, however did not increase above a high of 25% (2012 -2013 and 2013 -2014). Overall, the a nnual influenza immunization rate among children in Washoe County increased, however immunization rates remained below the Healthy People 2020 objective of 70.0%.

From 2012 to 2016, the percentage of adults aged 65+ years in Washoe County that received an annual flu shot was higher than Nevada and lower than the United States. Pneumococc al Vaccination Streptococcus pneumoniae is the bacteria which causes pneumococcus, or pneumococcal illnesses. There are more than 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pneumococcal illnesses include ear infections, sinus infections, meningitis, blood s tream infections (bacteremia) and are the most common cause of infection of the lungs, or pneumonia. Pneumococcal diseases are more common among children under the age of two, with increased risk of serious complications occurring among adults 65 years or older and those who have compromised immune systems. Pneumococcal vaccines (Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23) protect against many types of pneumococcal bacteria. Vaccination is recommended for children at ages 12 to 15 months, 2, 4, and 6 years, adults over 65 years of age, those with compromised immune systems, and cigarette smokers.151 Table 143: Percent of Adults 65+ years that ever Received Pneumococcal Vaccination, 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 2014 2015 for Disease Control and Prevention.

The percentage of adults aged 65+ years in Washoe County that have ever received a vaccination for pneumonia has been higher than Nevada, and the United States each year from 2012 t o 2016. Screenings Cholesterol Screening Lipid disorders such as high blood cholesterol and high triglyceride levels increase the risk for coronary heart disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends lipoprotein profile (lipid screening) for adults over age 20 every 5 years, while the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening and treatment for lipid disorders among adults aged 40 to 75 years.152 Table 144: Per cent of Adults 18+ years that have had Cholesterol Checked within the past 5 years, 2013 & 2015 Location 2013 2015 Washoe County 74.1% 77.3% Nevada 74.0% 74.7% United States 76.4% The percentage of adults aged 18+ years in Washoe County that have had cholesterol checked within the past 5 years increased from 2013 (74.1%) to 2015 (77.3%).

Cancer Screenings The number of new cases of cancer and many deaths due to cancer can be reduced with timely cancer screenings or tests. Tests for cervical and colorectal cancers detect precancerous lesions that can be treated prior to becoming cancerous. Regular and timely screenings for cervical, colorectal, prostate, lung, skin, and breast cancers are designed to catch the disease in an early stage. When caught in early stages some types of cancers may be halted or even fully reversed with treatment. If left undiagnosed and untreated, cancer is able to spread to other areas of the body often resulting in a more complex, expensive, and difficult recovery.154 Cancer screening guidelines are typically ba sed on age, however screenings may be recommended earlier for certain individuals with a family history or other increased risks for specific types of cancers. Screening for Colorectal Cancer The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 through age 75. Recommendations include receiving an annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which identifies blood in stool [Table 146 ] and obtaining a direct visualization screening or obtain ing a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, every 10 years [Table 147 ].155 If an irregular test result occurs, a healthcare provider may recommend alternative intervals for screening or additional follow up procedures.

Screening for Cervical Cancer The USPSTF recommends women be screened for cervical cancer starting at age 21 through age 65. Recommendations include receiving a cervical cytology (pap test) every 3 years or, for women 30 to 65 years, an alternative of every 5 years using high -risk human papillom avirus testing.156 If an irregular test result occurs, a healthcare provider may recommend alternative intervals for screening or additional follow up procedures.

Screening for Breast Cancer The USPSTF recommends mammography screening for breast cancer every 2 years in women age 50 to 74 years. When a woman has a highe r than average risk for breast cancer (parent, sibling or child with breast cancer), they may benefit from starting to screen at age 40.157 If an irregular test result occurs, a healthcare provider may recommend alternative intervals for screening or additio nal follow up procedures. The American Cancer Society recommends women aged 40 to 44 should have the choice to obtain screening if they select to do so. Women 45 to 54 years of age should obtain an annual screen and those 55 years and older can switch to 156 United States Preve ntive Services Task Force. (2017).

Screening for Prostate Cancer The USPSTF current draft for prostate cancer screening recommends clinicians inform patients ages 55 to 69 years of age the potential benefits and harms of prostate -specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. The USPSTF recommendation aligns with the Ameri can Urological Association recommendations, noting that the screening interval should be every 2 years or more.159 This differs from the American Cancer Society recommendations which are, men with an average risk of prostate cancer should obtain PSA screenin gs every 2 years beginning at age 50, and for men with more than one relative with prostate cancer at an early age, screening should be initiated at 40 years.160 Table 151: Percent of Men 40+ years that have had a PSA test within the past 2 years, 2012, 201 4, & 2016 Location 2012 2014 2016 Washoe County 47.7% percent of males aged 40+ years in Washoe County that have had a PSA test within the past 2 years decreased from 2012 (47.7%) to 2016 (41.2%).

The stage of disease is determined for the majority of cancer cases, but not all cases are staged at time of diagnosis. Figure 149 illustrates cases of ca ncer that were NOT staged at time of diagnoses, while Figure 150 shows among cases that were staged at time of diagnosis the proportion that were diagnosed in a late stage of disease. Utilize Figure 154 in conjunction with Figure 155. From 2004 through 2014, the majority of diagnosed cancer cases in Washoe County were staged at time of diagnosis. Lung cancer was most often not staged at time of diagnosis, while breast cancer was most often staged at time of diagnosis over the 10 -year period. *Not all cases of diagnosed cancer were staged at time of diagnosis. Note: Various cancers have different staging mechanisms depending on the type of cancer. Late stage was defined as malignant cancer where the cancer has spread beyond the organ of origin. 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014% of diagnosed cases Fig 154: Percent of Diagnosed Cancer Cases that were Unstaged at time of Diagnosis, Washoe County, 2004 -2014 Cervical Breast Prostate Lung Colorectal 0%20%40%60%80%100% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014% of staged cases Fig 155: Percentage Cancer Cases Staged at Time of Diagnosis Found in the Late Stage of Disease* by Cancer Type, Washoe County, 2004 -2014 Cervical Breast Prostate Lung Colorectal 221 1.14 IMMUNIZATIONS & SCREENINGS From 200 4 through 2014, over seven in ten cases of lung cancer that were staged at time of diagnosis, were diagnosed as late stage of disease. Over half of the cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed and staged, were found in late stage of disease. Prostate cancer cases staged at time of diagnoses were most frequently caught in an early stage of disease, as less than 20% of cases were in an advanced stage of disease at time of diagnosis. Summary of Immunizations & Screenings The percentage of childr en receiving the recommended vaccination series in Washoe County has increased from 2010 through 2016, as have the percentage of females (26 years old) that received all three doses of the HPV vaccine. Annual influenza immunization among children has not i ncreased as much as adults 18 to 64 years in Washoe County. The reported percentage of seniors 65 years and older in Washoe County that received their annual influenza immunization has remained stable from 2012 to 2016, while the percentage that have ever received a pneumonia vaccination has decreased over the same time period. Cholesterol screenings among adults increased from 2013 to 2015, and diabetes (high blood sugar) screenings slightly increased from 2013 to 2016. However, the percentage of adults wh o obtained blood stool tests, pap tests, mammograms, and PSA tests have remained stable or declined over the past few years. Washoe County vaccination rates have improved over the course of the past decade, however remain below Healthy People 2020 target objectives. Additionally, while the percentage of adults who report obtaining preventive screenings has improved from 10 years ago, more recent data indicate there may be a plateau in uptake of those recommended preventive services. As the population ages, impacts to relaxed adherence to cancer screenings may result in an influx of late stage cancer diagnoses, resulting in high -cost and extensive treatments. Continued efforts to provide education on the benefits of timely vaccinations and screening, in comb ination with increased access to primary care providers and low -cost clinics, will be key to maximizing the impact of these preventive measures.

These diseases can cause acute illness, develop into chronic conditions and in some cases result in death. Communicable diseases are closely monitored by hospitals, infection prevention teams, laboratories, and governmental health agencies in order to stop or mitigate potential disease outbreaks. The communicable disease indicators presented in this section include blood borne, airborne, select vaccine -preventable diseases, and foodborne illnesses. Data for sexually transmitted infections are presented in the Sexual Health section, while data for water borne infectious diseases are presented in the Environmental Health section.

As of 2016 an estimated 2.7 to 3.2 million people were living with a chronic HCV infection. Risk factors for HCV include having had a blood transfusion or a solid organ transplant prior to July 1992, intravenous drug use, children born to mothers who were positive for HCV, and chronic hemodialysis patients. An acute HCV infection may resolve without treatment in about 15% to 25% of patients, however for those who remain undiagnosed and untreated, an acute HCV infection can become chronic. 161 There is no vaccine for HCV, however effective treatment regiments be came available late 2013. Note: From May 1, 2002 through December 31, 2012 WCHD conducted enhanced HCV surveillance. As of 2013, HCV surveillance in Washoe County was limited to laboratory test registry and WCHD chart review was discontinued. In 2016 the acute HCV incidence rate in Washoe County was 0.9 per 100,000 population, which was above the Healthy People 2020 objective 0.2 per 100,000 population. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis . An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with TB, and in 2015 was responsible for 1.8 million deaths (worldwide). TB in the United States is not nearly as common as it once was, as the case rate per 100,000 population has dropped from 18.1 in 1970, to 10.3 in 1990, and 1.3 in 2016.162,163 161 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

TB spreads by an infected person coughing, sneezing, speaking or singing, and non - infected people can inhale the respiratory droplets and become infected. Some people develop active TB within weeks of becoming exposed, some may take years to develop the disease, and others may never develop the active form of TB. Symptoms of TB include a severe cough which lasts more than three weeks, chest pain, coughing up blood or sputum (mucous), weakness, fatigue, weight loss, lack of appetite, chills, fever, and/or night sweats. 164 The rate of reported cases of tuberculosis in Washoe County decreased from 2007 (1.7 per 100,000) to 2016 (1.3 per 100,000). From 2007 through 2016 the rates of reported cases of tuberculosis in Washoe County were lower than the national rates, however have remained above the Healthy People 2020 objective (1.0 per 100,000). Pertussis Pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, is a very contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . Whooping cough infection begins with a mild cough and fever, after a few weeks the cough can become severe and l ast for weeks or months. The violent coughing can cause apnea (stopped breathing), vomiting, and exhaustion and is characterized by the \"whoop\" sound of the cough. 165 Pertussis can cause serious respiratory complications in infants and young children, espec ially those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, including pneumonia, convulsions, slowed or stopped breathing, and possibly death. Fully vaccinated people have been known to be susceptible to infection, however the infection is usually less sever e in vaccinated individuals. Being up -to-date on vaccination status is the most effective way to 164 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tuberculosis (TB).

Populations at an increased risk for pneumococcal disease include young children, adults over age 65, adults wit h certain chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, persons with cochlear implants, and those who smoke cigarettes. Symptoms and complications range and are dependent on the part of the body that is infected.168 The rate of reported cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in Washoe County increased from 2007 (9.9 per 100,000) to 2016 (13.8 per 100,000). From 2012 through 2014 there were comparable data available for the United States and Washoe County rates of invasive pneumococcal disease were higher than national rates.

The significant reduction in incidence was associate d with significant increase in vaccination against rotavirus since 2008. Influenza Influenza (flu) is a respiratory disease caused by a variety of influenza viruses. The onset of the flu can be rapid and symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Vomiting and diarrhea occur more in children than adults. Flu symptoms usually last for a few days to less than two weeks however, serious complications of influenza include hospitalizations or death. Elderly adults, children, and persons with certain health conditions are at high risk for serious complications.169 Although not shown in Figure 161 the 2016 number of lab confirmed cases in Washoe County was 669.9 per 100,000 population. 169 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most cases of campylobacteriosis are caused by eating raw or uncooked poultry meats, or result from cross -contamination of other foods from these items. Symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within two to five days of exposure. Illness typically lasts one week, however in immunocompromised individuals Campylobacter may spread to the bloodstream and cause a life -threatening infection. 170 *United States data based on surveillance from 10 sites The rate of reported cases of campylobacteriosis in Washoe County decreased slightly from 2007 (11.9 per 100,000) to 2016 (10.5 per 100,000).

Types of E. coli that can cause disease include ones which produce a toxin known as Shiga toxin E. coli or STEC. Most reported outbreaks of E. coli are due to STEC O157. Symptoms include stomach cramps, diarrhea (usually bloody), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and clog up the body's filtration system (kidneys), which can then result in kidney failure. The major source of infection in humans is due to ingestion of undercooked contaminated beef, unpasteurized raw milk, or coming into contact with the feces of an infected human. 171 *United States data based on surveillance from 10 sites The 2015 spike in STEC O157 in Washoe County was due to a foodborne outbreak and resulted in double the national average for that year. The 2016 rate of reported STEC O157 cases in Washoe County (0.7 per 100,000) was below the national rate (2.84 per 100,000) and higher than the Healthy People 2020 objective (0.6 per 100,000). Salmonellosis Salmonellosis is an infection due caused by the bacterium, Salmonella , and is one of the most common types of food -borne infection. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. These symptoms last about a week and most people recover without needing treatment. Salmonella lives in the intestin al tracts of humans, and animals, including birds and reptiles. Food contamination usually occurs through fecal contact, however proper food handling reduces risk of cross contamination, and cooking meats thoroughly typically kills Salmonella.172 171 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The 2016 rates of reported cases for HCV, tuberculosis, and STEC O157 were above the Healthy People 2020 obj ectives, while rates for campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis were below the Healthy People 2020 objectives. Regular hand washing and obtaining appropriate vaccinations are two major steps which can be taken to reduce the number of cases of many communicab le diseases.

One in two adults in the United States has a chronic disease, while one in three adults have two or more. The key risk factors for most chronic diseases are tobacco use, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity resulting in obesity, and excessive alcohol use.173 In 2010, 86% of healthcare dollars were spent on patients with one or more chronic conditions. The average annual healthcare spending for someone without any chronic conditions in 2010 was $1,177 compared to $4,731 for persons with two chronic conditions, and an average of $15,954 spent on those with five or more chronic conditions. The majority of Medicare (80.0%) enrollees and persons enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare (78.0%) have multiple chronic conditions. 174 By improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol consumption and eliminating t he use of tobacco products, the United States could significantly reduce total healthcare costs and people would experience an increase in length and quality of life.

Arthritis includes more than 100 types of diseases and conditions that are characterized as inflammation of on e or more joints or connective tissues surrounding joints. Some forms of arthritis, such as Lupus or fibromyalgia, may be more widespread impacting the immune system 173 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms of arthritis typically include pain, aching, stiffness, swelling, redness, and reduced range of motion. Risk factors include age, gender, genetic inheritance, being overweight or obese, joint injuries, infections, and occupations involving repetitive movements or prolonged stress on a joint.175 Table 153: Percen t of Adults who have been told they have Arthritis* , 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional The percent age of adults in Washoe County who reported they have been told they have arthritis increased from 2012 (24.0%) to 2016 (25.6%). In 2016, the percentage o f adults in Washoe County who reported being told they have arthritis was higher (25.6%) than Nevada (23.7%) and slightly higher than the United States (25.2%). Asthma Asthma impacts the lungs and is among the most common conditions among children, however adults are also impacted. Asthma is a respiratory disease that causes wheezing, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and coughing. Different people may be triggered by a variety of environmental contaminant such as pollution, smoke, dust mi tes, pet allergens, or mold. When an asthma attack occurs the lungs swell, causing the airways to shrink and may involve all of the previously mentioned symptoms.176 Table 154: Percent of Adults who currently have Asthma , 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 2014 2015 percent age of adults in Washoe County who reported they currently have asthma increased from 2012 (7.8%) to 2016 (8.5%). In 2016, the percentage of adults in Washoe County who reported they currently have asthma, was higher (8.5%) than Nevada (7.9%), however slightly lower than the United States (8.9%). Cancer Cancer is a disease where the cells of the body grow out of contro l, which when left undiagnosed and untreated can spread and impact other organs .177 The causes of cancer differ from type to type, however there are behavioral factors which increase the risk of many cancers. These include being obese, using tobacco 175 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Arthritis.

In 2014, breast, prostate, and lung cancers were the leading types of cancers diagnosed nationwide and in Washoe County .178,179 Breast Cancer Although men and women can both get breast cancer, it is much more common among women. Risk factors for breast cancer include aging, genetic mutations (BRCA1 and BRCA2), first pregnancy after age 30 or never having a full -term pregnancy, having dense breast tissue, taking oral contraceptives, starting menstruation before age 12 , starting menopause after age 55, drinking alcohol, physical inactivity, being overweight or obese, or having a family history of breast cancer.180 The rate of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer in Washoe County has decreased from 1995 (137.4 per 100,000 females) to 2014 (133.5 per 100,000 females), however overall trends during this time period indicate there has been an increase, despite annual fluctuations (black dotted line) . In 2014 , the rate of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer in Washo e County was higher (133.5) than Nevada (125.5) and the United States (123.9).

Pap tests detect precancerous or cancerous cells on the cervix before they become invasive cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is sexually transmitted and the main cause of cervical cancer.181 The rate of newly diagnosed cases of cervical cancer in Washoe County has decreased from 1 995 ( 10.1 per 100,000 females) to 2014 ( 7.4 per 100,000 females ).

However, as smoking rates have decreased, so have the rates of lung cancer. Lung cancer can also be caused by exposure to second hand smoke, asbestos, or radon in the home or at work. A family history of lung cancer is also a risk factor.184 The rate of newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer in Washoe County has decreased from 1 995 ( 74.3 per 100,000 population ) to 2014 ( 54.2 per 100,000 population) .

Without a regular supply of oxygen, brain death occurs, and if emergency care is not obtained quic kly, permanent brain damage, long -term disability, or death may occur. Stroke symptoms include numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs particularly on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficultly understanding speech, tr ouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or a sudden severe headache with no known cause.191 Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, sickle cell disease, unhealthy diet, obesity, excessive alcohol, an d tobacco use. Having a family history of stroke and some genetic disorders may also increase risk for stroke.192 Table 155: Percent of Adults who have been told they have High Cholesterol* , 2013 & 2015 Location 2013 2015 Washoe 40.3% Nevada 38.6% 36.7% United States 38.4% 36.3% * told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional The percentage of adults in Washoe County reporting they have high cholesterol increased between 2013 (36.7%) and 2015 (40.3%).

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of diseases which cause airflow blockage and breathing -related problems , including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and in certain circumstances, asthma . In 2015, chronic lower respiratory diseas e, primarily COPD, was the third leading cause 243 1.16 CHRONIC DISEASES of death nationally and in Washoe County .193,194 Tobacco smoke is the primary risk factor for developing COPD however, exposure to air pollutants, genetic factors and respiratory infections can also contribute to COPD.195 Table 160: Percent of Adults who have been told they have Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)* , 2012 -2016 Location 2012 2013 * told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional The percent age of adults in Washoe County reporting they have COPD remained relatively stable from 2012 (5.9%) to 2016 (5.4%). In 2016, the percentage of adults in Washoe County reporting they have COPD by a healthcare professional, was lower (5.4%) than Nevada (6.9%) and the United States (6.5%). Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal. Most food consumed is turned into glucose (sugar) and stored by our bodies to be used for energy. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, assists glucose in entering into the cells for storage. When a person has diabetes, the pan creas either does not produce enough insulin or the body is unable to use insulin efficiently, which leads to high levels of glucose in the blood stream. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower -extremity amputations.196 There are two types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is not associated with being overweight or obese but instead results from an immune malfunction where the immune system incorrectly identifies and attacks insulin -producing cells in the pancreases. Type 2 is not an autoimmune disease, but instead develops as a result from consuming high sugar foods, thus increasing demand for insulin production, and over time, the system loses the ability to respond to insulin. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes includ e being overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, have high blood pressure, history of heart disease or stroke, being over the age of 45, or 193 United States: Xu, J., Murphy, S.L., Kochanek, K.D. & Arias, E.

Summary of Chronic Disease s The best treatment to reduce the occurrence of chronic dis ease is prevention. People can significantly reduce their risk for the top chronic conditions by eating a healthy diet composed of fruits and vegetables, reducing consumption of animal fats, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in regular adequate ph ysical activity. Additional forms of prevention include not using tobacco products and limiting excessive alcohol consumption. Unfortunately the risk for all chronic diseases increases with age, and as the Baby Boomer generation reaches their 60's and 70' s, the prevalence of chronic disease is expected to continue to rise. Additionally, people are often diagnosed with more than one chronic conditions, which can complicate treatment regimens and often adds a financial burden to patients with multiple specia lty doctors and various medications. By receiving appropriate screenings for pre -markers for chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and pre -cancerous lesions, conditions may be diagnosed in earlier stages. When conditions are caught early , they are more likely to be treated effectively and sometimes even reversed without surgical or pharmaceutical interventions, thus decreasing the burden of high -cost long -term treatments and procedures.

The nation with the longest life expectancy was Japan, with a life expectancy at birth of 83.7 years. Life expectancy in the United States decreased from 78.9 years in 201 4 to 78.8 years in 2015200, the first decline in life expectancy since 1993. In 2015, the death rates across the nation increased for eight of the 10 leading causes of death and only decreased for one, indicating more people died from the leading causes of d eath in 2015 compared to 2014. Rates of death among various racial and ethnic groups were also not equal in 2015, with highest rates of death among black males (1,070.0 per 100,000). The lowest rate was among Hispanic females (438.3 per 100,000).201 The disp arities in health behaviors, health access, and health outcomes which lead to the disparities in mortality, exist both nationwide and in Washoe County.

The third highest cause of death was different among all racial and ethnic groups in Washoe County. Among H ispanics the third highest ranked cause of death was chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Among African Americans it was tied between cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) and transport accidents. Among American Indians/Alaska Natives is was tied between non -transport accidents and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Among Asians the third highest ranked causes of death was intentional self -harm (suicide). Among whites, the third highest ranked cause of death was chronic lower respiratory diseases. The fourth (cerebrovascular disease -stroke) and fifth (non -transport accidents) ranked causes of death were the same for Hispanic and white residents. Cancer -Specific Mortality Malignant neoplasms (cancer) are the second leading cause of death and are responsible for one in every four deaths in the United States. Cancer is a disease where the cells of the body grow out of control, which when left undiagnosed and untreated can spread and impact other organs.202 The causes of cancer differ from type to type , however there are behavioral factors which increase the risk of many cancers. These include being obese, using tobacco products, and excessive alcohol consumption. In 2014, lung and bronchial cancers were the leading cause of cancer -specific deaths in th e United States, followed by colon and rectal cancers, breast cancer (females), and prostate cancer (males).203 202 Centers for Disease Control and P revention.

In 2011, it accounted for 27% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer linked to 80% to 90% of all cases. However, as smoking rates have decreased, so have the rates of lung cancer. Lung cancer can also be caused by exposure to second hand smoke, asbestos, or rad on in the home or at work. An additional risk factor includes having a family history of lung cancer.204 The mortality rate due to lung cancer in Washoe County decreased from 2006 (54.8 per 100,000 population) to 2015 (42.9 per 100,000 population) and was below the Healthy People 2020 Objective (45.5 per 100,000). In 2015 the mortality rate due to lung cancer in Washoe County was relatively similar to (42.9 per 100,000 population) Nevada (42.4 per 100,000 population). As of 2015, the mortality rate due to lung cancer in Washoe County (42.9 per 100,000 population) was higher than the United States (40.5 per 100,000 population). Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the highest cancer -specific death rate among women. Although men and women can both get breast cance r, it is much more common among women. Risk factors for breast cancer include aging, genetic mutations (BRCA1 and BRCA2), first pregnancy after age 30 or never having a full -term pregnancy, having dense breast tissue, taking oral contraceptives, starting m enstruation before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, drinking alcohol, physical inactivity, being overweight/obese, or having a family history of breast cancer.205 204 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer used to be the leading cause of cancer -speci fic deaths among women. However, over the past four decades the number of cervical cancer cases and deaths has declined largely due to women getting regular pap tests. Pap tests find precancerous or cancerous cells on the cervix before they become invasive cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV), is sexually transmitted, and is the main cause of cervical cancer.206 The mortality rate due to cervical cancer among females in Washoe County decreased from 2006 (4.1 per 100,000 females) to 2015 (1.7 per 100,000 females). 206 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Colorectal Cancer Among cancers impacting both men and women, colorectal cancer is the second highest cause of cancer -specific deaths in the United State s. Age is a contributing factor to increased risk for colon and rectal cancers. Other risk factors include family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lack of physical activity, low fruit and vegetable con sumption, diet low in fiber and high in fat, being overweight or obese, alcohol consumption and tobacco use.207 The mortality rate due to colorectal cancer in Washoe County decreased from 2006 (16.8 per 100,000 population) to 2015 (14.9 per 100,000 popula tion) and was slightly above the Healthy People 2020 objective (14.5 per 100,000 population).

Many men die of prostate cancer without ever having experienced any symptoms. Risk factors include age, family history and race, as it is more common among African American men. However , researchers are still working to determine the causes of prostate cancer and whether it can be prevented.208 The mortality rate due to prostate cancer in Washoe County decreased from 2006 (28.8 per 100,000 males) to 2015 (19.7 per 100,000 ma les) and below the Healthy People 2020 objective (21.8 per 100,000 males).

However, as with all cancer, risk increases with age. Therefore, most cases occur among adults. Researchers have not determined all the causes of leukemia, however there are several factors which have been linked including repeated benzene exposure, large doses of ionizing radiation, tobacco smoke, family history, or genetic mutations.209 The mortal ity rate due to leukemia in Washoe County increased from 2006 (4.2 per 100,000 population) to 2015 (6.7 per 100,000 population).

Melanoma is the third most common type of skin cancer, is more dangerous and leads to more deaths, although the rate of death is lower than several other types of cancer. Most cases of skin cancer are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, the radiation from sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. Factors which increase the risk of developing skin cancer include naturally light skin color, exposure to sun, history of sunburn, indoor tanning, having blue or green eyes, blond or red hair, and having certain types and high numbers of moles.210 The mortality rate due to melanoma in Washoe County remained relatively similar from 2006 (3.0 per 100,000 population) to 2015 (3.1 per 100,000 population) and was above the Healthy People 2020 objective (2.4 per 100,000 population). From 2006 through 201 5 the rate of death due to melanoma in Washoe County has remained higher than Nevada, with the exception of 2008 when the melanoma mortality rates were the same (2.7 per 100,000 population). In 2015 the mortality rate due to melanoma in Washoe County was higher (3.1 per 100,000 population) than Nevada (2.8 per 100,000 population). Summary of Mortality In 2015, the age -adjusted mortality rate among residents in Washoe County fell to a low of 768.4 per 100,000 population. The top two causes of death were d ue to disease of the heart and malignant neoplasms (cancer). This is the same for Nevada and the United States. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms (cancer) were also the top two causes of death for all age groups 45 years and older as well as al l racial and ethnic groups. The causes of death for those aged 15 -24 years were assault (homicide) and transport accidents, for those aged 25 -34 years and those aged 35 -44 years the top two causes of death were non -transport accidents and intentional self -harm (suicide). 210 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention nearly half of Americans have at least three of these risk factors.211, 212 Several of these same risk factors also increase the risk of cancer such as excessive alcohol intake, poor diet, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and tob acco intake. Other cancer -related risk factors are radiation, including exposure to sunlight and UV -rays, environmental toxins, and in some cases viruses such as human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) among others.213,214 Mortality S ources Fig 172: Age -Adjusted Mortality Rate for Underlying Causes of Death, all ages, Washoe County, Nevada, & the United States, 2006 - 2015 Nevada and Washoe County: Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Public Health Informatics and Epidemiology.

Carson City, NV. 261 2.0 COMMUNITY NEEDS INDEX Community Needs Index The Community Needs Index (CNI) is a standardized tool used to measure and compare socioeconomic factors and health outcomes at the ZIP code level within a community. To rank the health needs of a community this tool assigns a CNI score from 1 (lowest need) to 5 (highest need) . Truven Health Analytics calculates CNI scores on an annual basis by examining five socioeconomic health indicators: income, culture/language, education level, housing status and medical insurance coverage. Researchers have found when analyzing national CNI data, residents in communities with the highest CNI scores were shown to be twice as likely to be hospitalized for preventable conditions when compared to communities with the lowest CNI scores.1 This emphasizes the importance of accounting for socioeconomic factors when trying to understand health disparities across ZIP codes. For the purpose of this assessment, the five ZIP codes with the highest CNI scores over the past four years (2013-2016) were selected for a deep dive [Table 172]. Hospitalization and mortality rates for select conditions for the highest five CNI ZIP codes were compared to Washoe County overall.

In 2015, the overall crude mortality rate (not adjusted for age), was higher in 89502, 89431, and 89501 compared to Washoe County 's (86.5 per 10,000) overall mortality rate.268 2.0 COMMUNITY NEEDS INDEX In 2015, the mortality rate for heart disease ranged from a low in 89433 (16.8 per 10,000 population) to a high in 89501 (180.2 per 10,000 population) . The mortality rate for cancer (all types combined) was highest in 89501 (138.0 per 10,000 population), while cancer mortality rates in 89502 (16.7) and 89433 (15.8) were slightly lower relative to Washoe County. The mortality rate due to COPD in 2015 was higher in 89501, 89502, 89431, and 89512 compared to Washoe County overall (10.7 per 10,000 population). In 2015, the mortality rate due to unintentional accidents was highest among residents in 89501 (36.6 per 10,000). Mortality rates due to unintentional accidents were also higher in 89502 (6.9), 89431 (6.6), and 89433 (5.4) compared to the Washoe County rate (5.4 per 10,000 population). The infant (< 1 year) death rate was highest among 89512 (20.3 per 1,000 live births), however the infant death rate in 89431 (6.5) was also higher than the infant death rate for Washoe County (5.7 per 1,000 live births ). Primary Su rvey Data Related to Community Needs Primary data were collected via an online community survey from over 1,400 survey participants. The survey included 44 questions and analyses for questions related to perceived community needs are provided within this section. Results and findings from the online community survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe County residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the online community survey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainment relative to the general Washoe County population. For complete survey methodology and participant demographics refer to the Contents, Methodology, & Community Survey Demographics section. Table 177 illustrates community survey respondents' top five highest scoring health topics by ZIP code, relative to the overall rankings of all survey respondents. Survey participants were asked to rate 11 health topics in terms of perceived importance. Environmental health, social determinants, and health access (access to health services) were among the highest scoring health topics across all five of the top CNI ZIP codes.

Preventive health (physical activity, nutrition, overweight/obesity, immunizations, oral health, cancer screenings, and chronic disease management ). Injury prevention (motor vehicle and pedestrian accidents, reckless driving, falls among elderly populations, accidental poisonings and drownings) . Community services (teen youth centers, community centers, services for immigrants, senior centers, affordable child care). Community Needs Index Summary The five ZIP codes in Washoe County with the highest CNI scores have remained the same from 2013 to 2016 and combined, these ZIP codes account for nearly one- third (30.3%) of Washoe County's population. The five high CNI ZIP codes are demographically similar with the exception of 89501, the smallest ZIP code encompassing downtown Reno. The other four high needs ZIP codes (89512, 89502, 89431, and 89433) had a higher proportion of minority populations, primarily Hispanic, relative to the county overall. Again, with the exception of 89501, the other four high needs ZIP codes were slightly younger in terms of median age, relative to Washoe County. The median age among residents in 89501 was 51.7 years, which is nearly 15 years older than the County overall (37.6 years). Median household income in the five high CNI ZIP codes were $10,000 to $32,000 below the Washoe County median income, and the rates of unemployment were higher as well. Educational attainment was also lower in the five highest CNI ZIP codes relative to Washoe County overall. Hospitalization rates for asthma, COPD, and hypertension were higher in all five ZIP codes and hospitalization rates for stroke were higher in four of five ZIP codes compared to Washoe County. The 2015 overall crude (not adjusted for age) mortality rates for three top five CNI ZIP codes (89502, 89431, and 89501) were also higher than Washoe County. Community Needs Index scores are a helpful mechanism for evaluating a wide range of indicators pertaining to socioeconomic status, and help provide a visual cue of where high needs neighborhoods are located. The community survey responses illustrate how perceived needs vary among neighborhoods. CNI scores should be interpreted in conjunction with the existing gaps and assets of each neighborhood in order to provide the most effective models for improving the health and wellbeing o f each neighborhood and community as a whole.

Table 177: Top 5 Ranked Health Topics by Residents of Top 5 CNI ZIP Codes Online Community Survey 271 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Community Strengths & Challenges The previous Washoe County CHNA (2015-2018) included an asset list as a mechanism for community strengths and assets, while this assessment does not. Asset lists are helpful, however persons seeking assistance for a specific need are not likely to utilize this document as a resource, instead there are several local entities that provide a comprehensive list of referral options and community connections. This includes Nevada 211 (dial 2-1-1) or contacting United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra (775-322-8668). There are three major resources used in this section to highlight community strengths and challenges. Results from the online community survey, results from an agency survey, and feedback from a Community Workshop. Each resource provides a different perspective from the community to help create a robust assessment of community strengths and assets, as well as gaps and challenges. The online community survey was widely distributed through supporting partner organizations, resulting in over 1,400 survey respondents and the results indicate which organizations residents perceive to be a resource for seven specific health issues. The online community survey responses show people may benefit from more education on what services are provided by each agency. Additionally the results indicate some organizations may benefit from improved marketing and education regarding the services they provide. A non- referral question from the online community survey was also included and the question asked respondents wha t resource they rely on for information in the event of a disaster or emergency. While the results are not generalizable, they reflect how some community members perceive the available services of the community. The invitation to the Community Workshop and an electronic agency survey was sent to 250 individuals representing 96 different organizations across Washoe County. The invitation to participate in the Community Workshop and the link to the agency survey was distributed to the January 2015 Truckee Meadows Healthy Communities Conference attendees, current Community Health Improvement Plan workgroup members, government entities, City Council members, County Commissioners, UNR and TMCC leadership and faculty, and nonprofit organizations. The intent was to solicit participation from a diverse range of organizations and councils. Attendees at the Community Workshop were provided an update on the purpose, contents and preliminary results of the CHNA, and were asked to vote on focus areas related to 12 major health topics. The electronic agency survey asked respondents to identify the types of services the organization provides to clients and types of populations served by age and subgroup. Additional questions included communicating with and collaborating on current initiatives with other organizations in the region. The information within this section is not intended to promote one agency over another. 272 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Online Community Survey Results Primary data were collected via an online community survey from over 1,400 survey participants in Washoe County. The survey included 44 questions and analyses for those questions related to community resources and assets are provided within this section. Results and findings from the online community survey are not intended to be applied to or descriptive of all Washoe County residents and only represent the survey respondents themselves. Overall, the online community survey respondents were slightly younger, proportionally less Hispanic, and had higher educational attainment relative to the general Washoe County population. For complete survey methodology and participant demographics refer to the Contents, Methodology, & Community Survey Demographics section. The online community survey included a question stating, \"If a friend or family member needed access to care for a health- related issue, where would you refer them for each of the following?\" . The health-related issues included referral for those seeking immunizations, sexual health services, health insurance, experiencing domestic abuse, mental health services, experiencing substance use or addiction, and nutrition counseling. Results for each health-related issue are presented in Figure 186 through Figure 193. 273 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Immunizations: Approximately 49% (n=702) of survey respondents provided an answer to the immunization referral question. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater than 100%. Locations Providing Vaccinations Combined, two in three (64.7%) of the referrals were to a specific agency that directly provides vaccinations. This included the following: Over half (53.7%) of the referral were to the Washoe County Health District. Other specific organizations included Northern Nevada HOPES (4.7%), Community Health Alliance/CHA (3.6%), organizations with fewer than 5 mentions (2.7%) included UNR student clinic, Kids to Seniors Korner, Tribal Health Center, and the UNR (non-student) health center combined. Most of these locations are specific to insurance type, age, or pre-enrollment in other programs to qualify for vaccination at the location. Approximately 8.4% of referrals were to a pharmacy or a specific grocery store. Another 2.3% of referrals mentioned a general health clinic, health HOPES Immunize Nevada CHA 211/Google/Don't know Organizations with <5 mentions Clinic/Health fair Wrong resource Would not recommendFig 186: Referral for Immunizations (n=702) 274 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Primary Care Providers & Hospitals Nearly one in four (18.9%) of referral were for a primary care provider, general practitioner, or doctor. One in ten (10.5%) listed a hospital. The most frequently identified hospital was Renown, however Saint Mary's, Northern Nevada Medical, and the VA were mentioned as well. 211/Google/Do Not Know & Wrong Resource Among the 702 respondents, 2.8% indicated they would call Nevada-211, Google/Use the internet, or stated they did not know where to refer someone for immunizations. 2.3% listed a wrong resource. The wrong resource responses included organizations that do not provide vaccinations, however most of these agencies could refer someone to an appropriate resource. Immunize Nevada Approximately 3.8% of referrals were to Immunize Nevada. Immunize Nevada is a widely recognized coalition working to improve vaccination rates across Nevada. While the organization does not directly provide vaccines to the public, they organize many free and low-cost vaccine clinics in partnerships with a wide variety of other organizations across Nevada, provide a vast amount of information for the public and providers and also conducts trainings, outreach, and is overall an in-depth resource. Would Not Recommend There were survey respondents (0.4%) who stated they would not recommend vaccination or to friends or family seeking access to immunizations. This illustrates the ongoing need for education related to the benefit and purpose of receiving appropriate vaccinations.275 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Sexual Health Services: Approximately 46% (n=663) of survey participants provided an answer to the sexual health services referral question. Examples provided included birth control, sexually transmitted diseases and prenatal care. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater than 100%. Sexual Health or Family Planning Agencies The majority of agencies listed (88.8%) were an organization that provides testing and counseling for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well as birth control options, however not all locations provide prenatal care services. These agencies included Planned Parenthood (45.7%), Washoe County Health District/WCHD (21.4%), Renown/The Pregnancy Center (8.7%), Northern Nevada HOPES/NN HOPES (6.6%), other organizations with fewer than 5 mentions (3.0%), Community Health Alliance/CHA (2.1%) and OB-GYN Associates (1.2%). Another 17.2% of referrals stated \"doctor\" or the term \"OB-GYN\", the term \"depends on insurance\" was also included in this category. The terms \"Free Clinic\"/ER/Police/Urgent Care were listed by 3.6% of respondents, likely as a response to a sexual assault incident or in the event of needing emergency contraception. 211/Google/Don't know Approximately 3.5% of respondents stated they would call 211, Google, or did not know where to refer someone for sexual Center NN HOPES Free clinic/ER/Police/Urgent care 211/Google/Don't know Other organization < 5 mentions CHA OB-GYN AssociatesFig 187: Referral for Sexual Health Services -i.e. birth control, STD screening, prenatal care (n=663) 276 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Obtain Health Insurance: Approximately 38% (n=551) of survey participants provided an answer to the obtain health insurance referral question. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater than 100%. Recommended Specific Health Insurance Provider Nearly half (47.2%) recommended a specific type of health insurance provider. This included the following: Nearly one in five (19.8%) recommended the insurance plan Hometown Health. Hometown Health is offered through Renown to the public for purchase, as well as by several major employers throughout the county. This category also included Senior Care Plus, a Medicare Advantage organization and prescription drug plan for those with a Medicare contract; Hometown Health is the parent company for Senior Care Plus. Another 15.2% stated they would refer a friend to family member to Medicaid or to go to a Welfare Office to sign up for Medicaid. While Access to Healthcare Network (AHN) is not an insurance plan , 7.4% of respondents would refer friends or family to this organization. AHN is a non-profit organization offering members access to a discounted provider network and to participating healthcare providers. Members pay an income-based member ship fee for healthcare access. Members are primarily those whose income places them above the threshold for Medicaid, however are still unable to afford to purchase health insurance through alternative means. Health Plan of Nevada (4.7%) offers insurance for purchase through the ACA exchange and those not Office/Medicaid/SCHIP 211/Google/Don't know CHA or NN HOPES Access to Healthcare Network Check with employer Internet/Online Health Plan of NV Other Organization Insurance broker Get a job/Look out of countryFig 188: Referral to Obtain Health Insurance (n=551) 277 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Source for Access or Seek More Information Approximately 42.8% of respondents would refer a friend of family member to a resource to seek further information, including the following: About one in five would refer to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace Exchange. One in 10 (10.2%) indicated they would call Nevada 211, Google, or they didn't know. \"Google it\" or \"Google\" was reported separate from those who stated \"Internet/Online\" (6.2%). S ince the ACA Exchange is primarily accessed online it was unclear if respondents who listed \"Internet/Online\" were referring to the ACA Exchange or if this term was interchangeable with Google. 3.8% listed some other organization. Many of these were clinics with a sliding-fee scale for services or social service-type resources where assistance with health insurance enrollment may or may not be available. None of these locations offers health insurance directly. Another 3.4% listed an insurance broker as a resource to find an appropriate health insurance plan. Community Health Centers Combined 7.6% stated they would refer friends or family to either Community Health Alliance (n =21) or Northern Nevada HOPES (n=21). Both offer sliding-fee scale and have staff to assist with enrollment in health insurance plans. Employer-based 6.2% of respondents stated they would tell a friend or family to check with their employer or HR. This was not viewed as helpful since most employees are generally made aware of benefit options available to them or are mandated to enroll with a health insurance provider upon hire. Another 2.0% claimed they would tell friends or family to \"get a job\", or \"to look outside of the United States\". This indicates a general frustration with t his service or that the perception is people must be employed to have access to health insurance. Domestic Abuse: Only 34% (n=484) of survey participants provided an answer to the domestic abuse referral question. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater know Wrong resource Shelter, not specified Social Services Doctor/Hospital/ER Crisis Call Center/Hotline Advocacy group, no direct services Other DV/DA Specific Shelter Victim Advocates/Legal Categorical ShelterFig 189: Referral for Domestic Abuse (n=484) 278 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Shelters Specific to Domestic Abuse/Violence Over one in three (36.2%) of the 484 respondents indicated they would refer to the Committee to Aid Abuse Women (CAAW). CAAW was established in 1977, however as of September 2017 (after the close of the online community survey), changed their name to Domestic Violence Resource Center (DVRC). The DVRC provides comprehensive, free services for persons experiencing family violence. Another 11.0% listed Safe Embrace, a women's shelter specific to domestic abuse in the Washoe County area. Safe Embrace also offers free services including shelter, transitional living, counseling and advocacy options. Additionally, 1.2% listed Tahoe SAFE Alliance, an agency in North Lake Tahoe that offers an array of services specific to persons experiencing violence. 4.3% listed \"shelter\", but did no t specify a name or location. Approximately 0.8% (n=4) respondents listed a categorical shelter; these agencies offer an array of services specific to pregnant women, women with children, or women who are intravenous drug users, however these locations and shelters are not specific to domestic violence, have very long wait lists, and many participants are court-ordered primarily for substance use issues. Legal Intervention The second most common referral was for the police or 911 (26.2%). The issue with relying on police authority or a 911 response is that is primarily effective only for the physical abuse phase and does not remove the victim from the situation. Additionally, the perpetrator may lash out at the victim(s) the following episode for having contacted police on previous occasions. Referral Agency Doctor/Hospital/ER (2.7%) may only be available for those with health insurance or those who are seeking direct medical care for physical injuries, crisis call centers/hotlines (2.1%) can provide verbal referrals and advice, however do not physically offer services or shelter, similar to advocacy groups (1.4%). Another 1.0% of the 484 respondents listed victim advocates/defense attorney or lawyer. Again, these may help with connecting a person to resources, but do not provide shelter or other direct services aside from counseling. 211/Google/Do Not Know & Wrong Resource Combined, nearly one in five respondents stated they would have to call Nevada-211, Google/Use the internet, stated they did not know (9.9%) or listed a wrong resource (9.7%). The 211/Google/Do not know responses show people would need to go to another resource to find an appropriate agency. The wrong resource responses included organizations that do not provide resources for domestic violence, however most answers were agencies that could refer someone to an appropriate resource.279 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Mental Health: Only 32% (n=465) of survey participants provided an answer to the mental health referral question. The examples listed under the mental health question included stress reduction, counseling, psychiatrist. There were included to prompt respondents to list only mental health resources and not substance use resources. Substance use is often associated with \"behavioral health\", an umbrella term which includes both mental health and substance use. Referrals for substance use, although often intertwined, were asked in a separate fill- in-the-blank box . Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater than 100%. *General description included generic terms such as \"primary care \"doctor\", \"mental health clinic\", \"counselor\", \" insurance provider list\" and \"psychiatrist\" these reflected the examples provided. Specific Mental Health Organizations & Providers Combined, two in three (64.3%) of the 465 respondents listed a specific agency or a provider name that directly provides some aspect of mental health screening and treatment. This included the following: Renown (15.7%), Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services (NNAMHS) (12.0%), West Hills Hospital (8.6%), Northern Nevada HOPES (7.1%). Organizations with fewer than 5 mentions (11.8%) included Zephyr Wellness, Great Basin Behavioral Health, Life quest, Alliance, Healing Minds, Midtown Mindfulness, Mobile Crisis Unit through the school district, Mojave Mental Health, West Care, the Reno-Sparks Tribal Health Center, True North, Senior Bridges Program, Washoe County Social Services, the VA, Saint Mary's, Quest Counseling, Willow Springs, WestCare and Sierra Counseling and Neurotherapy.

Another 5.8% listed a wrong resource often listing an agency which could provide a referral, but does not provide any direct mental or behavioral health services. Not here/Not available The least often listed resource, \"Not here/Not available\" was cited by 1.9% (n=9) respondents, however was indicative of negative personal experiences trying to seek mental health care. Often these answers cited lack of providers willing to accept new patients, or wait lists longer than 4 or 5 months. Substance Use or Addiction: Only 30% (n=432) of survey participants provided an answer to the substance use or addiction referral question. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater Renown West Hills Hospital NN HOPES Hotline/Rehab Organizations with < 5 mentions Wrong resource Bristlecone Quest Counseling & Crossroads WestCare STEP1/STEP2 JTNN NNAMHS Church/Pastor The Life Change CenterFig 191: Referral for Substance Use or Addiction (n=432) 281 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES General Referrals Combined, 30.3% listed a generic referral type. This included Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics anonymous (NA) (12.3%), a primary care provider or depends on the person's insurance provider (11.3%), and those who stated call a hotline or go to rehab (6.7%). Locations with Inpatient Options Combined just over one in five (21.8%) respondents listed an organization with inpatient options, this included West Hills hospital (10.6%), Bristlecone (4.6%), WestCare a short-term detox Nevada Adult Mental Health Services/NNAMHS (3.0%). These locations are known for providing some form of mental and behavioral health services, however those seeking treatment in these locations may be faced with long waiting lists. Combined 15.0% of the 432 respondents listed an organization which may not have inpatient options, however many of these organizations serve specific populations, a person is usually court-ordered to attend services, or the organization treats only those with specific substance addiction, such as opioids. The 15.0% includes, organization with fewer than 5 mentions each (6.3%), Quest Counseling (outpatient adolescents) and Crossroads (usually court-ordered) with equal number of mentions and combined (3.7%), STEP 1, Inc. (men only, priority intravenous drug users)/STEP2 (pregnant women only) combined (3.5%), and The Life Change Center which is specific for those with opioid addition (1.6%) Other Mentions Renown Behavioral Health program was mentioned by 10.9% of the 432 respondents. Renown's Behavioral Health program provides specialized care for mental health and substance abuse offering counseling and medication treatment. Northern Nevada HOPES/NN HOPES was mentioned by 9.7% of respondents. NN HOPES is home to the only syringe exchange program in northern Nevada, Change Point, which offers harm reduction supplies, counseling, as well as HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) testing. Additionally NN HOPES offers behavioral health counseling including substance use counseling and treatment plans, however there are no inpatient beds. Join Together Northern Nevada/JTNN was mentioned by 3.0% of respondents. JTNN is a coalition offering several programs to prevent substance use, they provide resources including trainings, educational outreach and referrals, but JTNN does not directly treat patients. Church or pastor was listed by 1.9% of respondents. 211/Google/Do Not Know & Wrong Resource Combined nearly one in five (19.0%) respondents stated they would call Nevada 211, Google, or did not know where to go (13.0%) or they listed an organization that does not provide substance use treatment/counseling (6.0%), however many of those listed would be able to refer to an appropriate resource.282 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Nutrition counseling: Only 28% (n=400) of survey participants provided an answer to the nutrition counseling referral question. Note: Respondents often listed more than one referral location and each answer was counted under the respective category, therefore the combined percentage in the figure is greater than 100%. Hospitals/Clinics Combined, just over one in three (35.5%) of the 400 respondents would refer a friend or family to one of the local health systems to obtain nutrition counseling. This includes Renown (19.0%), UNR School of Medicine Clinic (7.8%), Northern Nevada HOPES/NN HOPES (3.3%), Community Health Alliance/CHA (3.0%), and Saint Mary's (2.5%). Specific Provider Combined, one in five (21.8%) of the 400 respondents would refer to a primary care provider (13.3%) or to a nutritionist or dietitian (8.5%). Approximately 5.3% would refer to a different organization, many of these were wellness clinics that offer a range of services. Another 2.8% stated it depends on the insurance type or a person should check their insurance provider list to find an appropriate counselor within the insurance network. 211/Google/Do Not Know, Wrong Resource, & Gyms Combined one in four (25.0%) respondents indicated they would have to call Nevada 211, Google, or did not know where to go (17.5%) or they listed an organization that does not provide nutritional counseling (7.5%), however many of those listed would be able to refer to an appropriate resource. Additionally 2.0% of respondents indicated they would refer someone to the gym. It was unclear if these referrals related to nutritionists or personal trainers who work at the gym or if this was a response for the person to engage in more provider Nutritionist/Dietitian WIC UNR Wrong resource Organizations with < 5 mentions NN HOPES CHA Depends on insurance Saint Mary's GymFig 192: Referral to Obtain Nutrition Counseling (n=400) 283 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Question: \"What is your main source of information in a disaster or emergency, such as a fire, earthquake, or flood? Select one.\" Nearly half (47.6%) of the 1,312 survey respondents indicated they rely on their smartphones for obtaining information during an emergency, while another 23.0% indicated the main source of information is the television. Calling 911, as identified by 2.4% of respondents, is NOT advised during an emergency unless there is an immediate threat to life. Emergency dispatchers experience a spike in 911 calls during widespread emergencies and it is imperative the 911 phone lines be limited to true life-threatening emergencies. Washoe County Code Red (3.7%) is a more appropriate resource. Code Red sends a recorded message for emergency notifications in order to receive notifications sign up here https://public.coderedweb.com/cne/en-US/169EBBD0A3AE . Community Workshop Results The invitation to the Community Workshop was sent to 250 individuals representing 96 different organizations across Washoe County. Over 80 participants, representing 45 agencies were in attendance at the Community Workshop. Each workshop participant was provided five stickers to place under any of the 47 focus areas. Guidance for \"voting\" included considering 1) which focus areas organizations could have a sustainable impact on and 2) would success in those focus areas improve health outcomes among residents of Washoe County. This opportunity for community-lead prioritization of focus areas identifies a more narrow the scope of health needs to be addressed during the next planning cycle.

Seventy people representing 50 agencies responded to the agency survey. In some instances, an agency had multiple respondents on their behalf and the selected responses were different from one another, however each answer selection was only counted once. Some questions were also measured at the agency level and the denominator was 50, while other questions were measured at the individual level, with a denominator of 70. Denominators are identified in parentheses in the title of each figure. Question: \"What type of organization are you representing? Select all that apply.\" The majority of agencies were community-based and/or non-profit agencies (61%) and one in five (20%) COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Question: \"Which of the following areas is the organization currently addressing? Select all that apply.\" Nearly half of the agencies are involved in community organizing or community planning (48%), while 45% provide referrals without direct services to clients, the third most frequently identified area being addressed is emotional, behavioral, or mental health care services (44%). Approximately 36% of agencies each indicated they currently provide medical, dental or vision healthcare services, chronic diseases, nutrition or substance use. While 34% of agencies indicated they address physical activity. Although not pictured in Figure 195, additional topics being addressed included: Food resources (4%) Agencies Currently Addressing (n=50 agencies) 288 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Question: \"Indicate if your organization has existing policies, procedures, or trainings on how to work and communicate with the following groups.\" 1) Persons who speak languages other than English, 2) Persons with physical disabilities, and 3) Persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The majority of people who responded to the agency survey indicated their agency had policies, procedures, or trainings to work and communicate with people who had limited English proficiency (76%), persons with physical disabilities (72%) and persons with intellectual disabilities (66%). Outreach & Collaboration The majority (83%) of agency respondents indicated they felt there were opportunities to inform other entities about the orga nization's current initiatives and they were able to learn what others were doing as well [Figure 199]. Among the agencies surveyed, 99% indicated they have collaborated on a project, funded, or provided in-kind support to other local organizations in the past 12 months. This demonstrates interconnectedness among organizations across the region, among those agencies with representatives who completed the agency survey. Question: \"Do you f eel there are external meetings or events where there is the opportunity to inform others about what the organization is currently working on and learn what others disability (n=67)Fig 198: Policies, Procedures, or Trainings to Work & Communicate with the Following Groups YES NO Don't Know 83% 9% 9% 0%20%40%60%80%100% YES NO Don't KnowFig 199: Opportunity to Inform & Learn from Other Agencies (n =67) 289 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Question: Indicate the number of local organizations your agency has collaborated on a project, funded, or provided in-kind support to other local organizations in the past 12 months. About one in three indicated their agency had partnered with more than 10 (36%) other local organizations. Community Strengths & Challenges Summary According to responses to the community survey, it is important to continue to improve outreach and marketing to describe the types of services different organizations provide. A limitation of the data is that over half of the total survey respondents (1,438) skipped the referral questions, however the lack of input may be an indication of need for education on local resources [Table 179]. The question which asked community survey respondents to identify the source of information they rely on the most in the event of an emergency or disaster show that the internet and television continue to be the predominant forms of communication. It is important to design webpages and messaging that is compatible with cells phones, as sometimes websites may look and work well on a computer, but then fail in the mobile environment. Keeping up with evolving technology in the era of social media is and will continue to remain a challenge. Changing the names of organizations may be necessary or even unavoidable, however great lengths should be undertaken to make those changes known throughout the community. One scenario is demonstrated by the numerous community survey respondents who identified Community Health Alliance (CHA) by the previous name, HAWC. This will likely be a challenge for Domestic Violence Resource Center (formerly CAAW). Recognizing the importance of names and branding, emphasizing any changes and conducting a Google search to identify inaccuracies will help to reduce future client confusion. 4% 16% 9% 36% 7% 0%20%40% 1 to 2 3 to 6 7 to 10 10 + Don't KnowFig 200: Number of Local Organizations Collaborated with Past 12 Months (n=67) 290 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES Table 179: Su mmary of Community Online Survey Referral Responses Health Referral Topic % total (n=1,438) that provided a referral Strengths Challenges % 211/ Google/ Don't know % Wrong Referral Vaccination/ Immunizations 49% 64.7% referrals to agency that administers vaccinations Agencies identified prioritize low -income populations; assumes people have access to a medical provider 2.8% 2.3% Sexual health services 46% 88.8% listed sexual health or family planning agencies One category was more geared towards birth control and sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, while the other category included more locations that provide prenatal and OB - GYN services in addition to birth control and STD testing 3.5% None Health insurance 38% 47.2% recommended a specific typ e of health insurance provider; 15.2% would refer to Medicaid 42.8% of respondents would refer a friend of family member to a resource to seek further information; Respondents clearly frustrated with the issue 10.2% None Domestic abuse 34% 48.4% listed a shelter for victims of domestic abuse Number one agency listed, CAAW, now known as the Domestic Violence Resource Center -name changes confusing for the general public; high proportion of respondents (26.2%) would call the police or utilize 911 9.9% 9.7% Mental health 32% 64.3% identified a facility that does offer mental health services shortage of mental health providers and many facilities have long waiting lists 11.6% 5.8% Substance use/Addiction 30% 21.8% respondents listed an organization with inpat ient options 30.3% listed generic service - Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous; shortage of substance use treatment options 32.0% 6.0% An additional strength of local agencies is that many serve all clients regardless of age, or other categorical demographics, however many organization may benefit from having staff specialized to work with and communicate with different subgroups. The subgroups of concern include adults over 50 years of age, as Baby Boomers continue to age growth is expected at a higher rate than the general population, this is compounded by the increased utilization and complexity of health services as a person ages. Persons who speak languages other than English, most notably Hispanic populations, again a subgroup estimated to experience population growth at a higher rate than the overall population. Although decreasing in recent years, increased awareness and outreach to low-income populations is essential, as they disproportionately experience poor health outcomes. According to agency survey data, local agency strengths include the ability to refer to other agencies. As 45% of agencies that participated in the agency survey stated they provide referrals, additionally many of the \"wrong resource\" agencies identified across all referral types through the online community survey were agencies that could refer someone to an appropriate location. It is important for agencies to implement an evaluation process in order to asses if referrals are appropriate or effective. For example, providing contact information for a specific person or connecting a client right there via phone, is often more productive than 291 3.0 COMMUNITY STRENGTHS & CHALLENGES handing out a brochure or verbally rattling off alternative agencies when making a referral. Agencies may also consider formalizing a referral relationship through a memorandum of understanding or determining regular intervals to verify the services are available and if the referral relationship is still appropriate. Another strength of local agencies is interconnectedness. Among the 50 agencies that responded to the agency survey, 99% stated they had collaborated with another local entity within the past 12 months and nearly one in three stated they collaborated with 10 or more other agencies. Expanding into new partnerships is key for stretching resources and can be helpful to ensure duplicative projects are minimized.

Prioritization of needs provides a means for understanding and organizing the large amount of secondary data (county, state and national level statistics/numbers) and primary data (online community survey) contained within the assessment. Although the health topics rank differently when looking at only primary or only secondary data, the overall rank, which includes both, identifies which areas of need community members may be more inclined to support and ultimately where efforts will have the best capacity to influence. It is important to consider both the secondary data indicators and the primary data input (community's perception of importa nt health topics) for prioritization. Future programs and initiatives based on only the secondary data rankings may not be endorsed by the community and could result in an ineffective expenditure of resources. Alternatively, creating programming based solely on the primary data, would ignore reliable and accurate data provided through the secondary data sources. Image 9: Identifying Opportunities for Positive Impacts An objective approach was developed to score, rank, and prioritize the health topics. Five criteria, magnitude, severity, trend, benchmark, and community perception, were utilized to score the health topics. The overall score and rank combines secondary and primary data for 12 major health topics, the results are shown in Figure 201. Secondary data priorities What the secondary data show are \"high needs\" Primary data priorities What the community perceives to be important Best chance for positive impact HERE 293 4.0 SCORING, RANKING, & PRIORITIZATION Although ranks appear to be straightforward, there are considerations for interpretation. The range of scores is relatively small, with only a 2.48 point spread between the highest and the lowest rank and as little as 0.02 separating multiple categories. Additionally, health behaviors and health outcomes are influenced by dynamic and complex factors not captured within a single health topic. Mental health (#2), for example, coincides with substance use (#7). Substance use serves as a coping mechanism among many people with mental illness, which can in turn exacerbate mental health issues and both factors may be influenced by having access to healthcare (#1). Any approach to address health needs should be aware of and recognize the relationships between human nature, behavioral changes, and the systemic factors that influence health & Rank 294 4.0 SCORING, RANKING, & PRIORITIZATION Methodology for Scoring & Ranking Health Topics Scores were calculated for each of the 250+ secondary data indicators using the criteria in Table 180. 1.Magnitude: The percent, rate, or number of measured population impacted by each indicator. 2.Severity: Severity or duration of indicator; acute, short-term or long-term/permanent impact. 3.Trend: Improvement, no improvement, or worsening over time. 4.Benchmark: Washoe County percentage or rate relative to Nevada, United States, or Healthy People 2020 objective. 5.Community Perception: Perceived importance as determined by the score resulting from the online community survey respondents .

For example, a few health topics were not included in the overall ranking due to a lack of reliable secondary data. Additionally, some health topics were grouped differently across the variety of input mechanisms depending on the type of audience and form of input. Table 181 summarizes the health topic rankings across the different data sources. 295 4.0 SCORING, RANKING, & PRIORITIZATION Table 181: Health Topic Ranking by Mechanism Health Topic Overall Rank Secondary Data Rank Primary Data Rank (Online Community Survey ) Access to Health 1 6 1 Mental Health 2 1 5 Social Determinants 3 8 3 Crime & Violent -Related Behaviors 4 5 4 Physical Activity, Nutrition, & Weight 5 2 6 (Listed as Preventive Health Behaviors) Chronic Disease/Screenings 6 3 6 (Listed as Preventive Health Behaviors) Substance Use 7 4 7 (tied) Injury Prevention 8 7 7 (tied) Maternal & Child Health 9 9 GE (Grouped with Sexual Health) Sexual Health 10 10 10 Environmental Health 11 12 2 Infectious Disease & Immunizations 12 11 6 Community Services NR NR 9 Built Environment NR NR 11 NR=Not ranked due to lack of data ; GE=Grouped elsewhere, not ranked indepen dently Score & Rank According to Secondary Data Only The secondary data score and rank [Figure 202] were calculated by the combined scores from Criteria #1 through Criteria #4. 5.38 5.34 5.27 5.11 4.88 4.57 3.92 3.26 0.002.004.006.00Fig 202: Secondary Data Score & Rank 296 4.0 SCORING, RANKING, & PRIORITIZATION Score & Rank According to Primary Data Only Criteria #5, the Community Perception Score, was calculated from the online community survey question that asked respondents to rate 11 major health topics on a scale from \"1 -Not a priority\" to \"5 - Essential\". Three to six examples associated with each of the 11 health topics were provided so su rvey respondents would have a general concept and shared understanding of the terms \"preventive health behaviors\" or \"access to health services\". For example, Access to Health Services was one of the 11 health topics and examples were \"more primary care doctors\", \"affordable health insurance\", your insurance\" [Image 9]. It was not feasible to ask survey respondents to indicate a priority level for all examples provided for each health topic.

While it provides an objective way to measure needs, the scores and ranks could differ based on any number of changes. These changes include the grouping of health topics, the online community survey development and administration, and the individual indicators (secondary data) that were included in the assessment. The ranking helps to summarize the health topics in an organized manner by simplifying the large amount of data included in the assessment. It is important to recognize the limitations of the methods employed to score and rank this data and most importantly to acknowledge that health behaviors and outcomes are influenced by a dynamic, complex range of factors . 298 CONCLUSION Conclusion It is challenging to determine when a community has reached the status of \"healthy\". A metric to consider might be the Healthy People objectives; however, Washoe County falls short of achieving the majority of those measures. Additionally, there are tools such as Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings for in-state comparisons and other websites that compare peer counties across state lines, which allow for quantifiable success relative to the nation. However, the United States remains among one of the least healthy developed countries as measured by life expectancy and premature mortality.3 Focusing on continued outreach, support, and partnership at the individual and agency- levels will enhance opportunities for innovative approaches to improving health outcomes. Achieving a healthy community is not a one-time success, it involves ongoing and cross-sector collaboration, as there will always be areas to improve upon to directly or indirectly affect the health of the community. Moving forward, the CHNA will serve as guiding document for the goals and objectives of the Community Health Improvement Plan and Renown Health's Community Benefits plan. These two documents will outline the next steps taken over the coming three years to address the community health needs identified and will rely heavily on a collaborative approach to make a collective, broad impact on the health of our community. 3 United Health Foundation.
