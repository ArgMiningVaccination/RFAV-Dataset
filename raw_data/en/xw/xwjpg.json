Of these, Ayurveda is the most ancient medical system with a time tested impressive record of safety and efficacy. These systems were well known to Indian population and their acceptability in population is already there as they form the part of house hold remedy, life style and dietetic management of the society. Majority of the world's population in developing countries still relies on herbal medicines to meet their health needs. They are often used to provide first-line and basic health service to people living in remote and poor areas. Even in areas where modern medicine is available, the interest on traditional practices has been increasing rapidly in recent years because of many reasons. Contribution of traditional practices, in particular of Ayurveda in global health care cannot be ignored by any science for its qualitative strength and clues provided in the field of therapeutics. India enjoys the largest traditional health care, which is fully functional with a network of qualified registered practitioners, research institutions and licensed pharmacies. Ayurveda can play a major preventive, curative, and promotive role in community health. The effectiveness of Ayurveda in different disease conditions need to be shown to the community, for which, we need to proceed in a systematic manner. Study design is an important issue. Ill-designed studies are unlikely to add any value either to science or to Ayurveda. A comprehensive custom to explore evidences on effectiveness in Ayurveda is the need of hour to generate databases regarding the usefulness of Ayurveda approaches in global healthcare. Well-established, randomized controlled clinical trials are undisputed gold standards and can provide highest level of evidence for efficacy facilitating acceptance of medical practices. These conventional concepts of clinical research design may be difficult to apply when using practices of traditional medicine. Methods such as randomization and use of a placebo etc. may not always be possible in Ayurveda clinical trials as they may involve many technical problems. In addition; prevention, diagnosis, treatment etc. in Ayurveda are based on specific needs of an individual patient. Hence, approaches like Whole Body Systems, MOST, STROBE, Case Reports etc. possibly may benefit Ayurveda studies. Initiatives are to be made to enrich AYUSH professionals with these methodologies. Case reports significantly can contribute and disseminate Ayurveda potentialities to the global community. They have an advantage of being adaptable to the clinical needs of the patient and the therapeutic approach of the practitioner. It is observed that, many Ayurveda physicians have success stories for clinical conditions, where no satisfactory answers are available in contemporary field. Dissemination of such success practices is a way of sharing knowledge that will help in shaping the health care system. Case Reports help practitioners to share their experiences with peers, researchers, students and other interested. Ayurveda currently need more and more evidence based success stories. A suitable platform is needed to communicate all such experiences. Considering this acute need; All India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi is creating an unique platform Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports How to cite: Abhimanyu K. AyuCaRe - A New Journal for Ayurveda Case Reports. J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):1-2.Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports2 Abhimanyu K: Editorial (AyuCaRe) for all stakeholders of AYUSH to share their experiences. AYUCaRe invites Case Reports and provides opportunities for students, researchers and faculty of AYUSH and allied medical sciences to share their experiences. This initiative is expected to play a pivotal role in researches, further generating evidence base for the claims and principles of Ayurveda practices in a systematic way. I take this opportunity to invite all the stakeholders of Ayurveda to use this platform and share Case Reports in the benefit of traditional practices. At AIIA, we are committed to put Ancient wisdom of Ayurveda in Evidence Based Practice. Prof Abhimanyu Kumar Editor-in-Chief Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports (AyuCaRe) Institute of Ayurveda, Sarita Vihar, Gautam Puri, Mathura Road, New Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):1-2 3 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):3I am very glad to see the first issue of the case study focused Ayurveda journal by All India Institute of Ayurveda in India. India has a rich heritage in traditional systems of medicine which include Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Yoga, Naturopathy, Homeopathy and others. Traditional herbal medicines an important part of most traditional systems of medicine including Ayurveda. Many people in developing countries still rely on herbal medicines to meet their health needs, particularly in rural and remote areas. Even in areas where modern medicine is available, the interest in herbal medicines has been increasing rapidly in recent years because of their potential contributions to health and well-being, because lifestyle-related diseases are becoming more common across the world. Traditional herbal medicines are believed to have much to offer in the health promotion, disease prevention and management, particularly for lifestyle-related diseases, through their holistic approach.

J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):3.Research in Traditional Systems of Medicine The WHO Traditional Medicine strategy 2014-2023, promotes safe and effective use of traditional medicines and has one important strategic objective, that is to build and strengthen the knowledge base on traditional medicines through research. This need for an improved knowledge base was reinforced at the regional consultation on traditional medicine for the WHO South-East Asia region in 2015. This journal is, therefore, important to build and strengthen evidence-based knowledge in Ayurveda through case studies and their documentation in this region. I strongly believe that this journal can provide a platform to discuss, share and exchange experiences and knowledge among eminent experts and researchers. This will contribute to promoting evidence-based practices in traditional systems of medicine. Dr Sung Chol, Kim Regional Advisor in Traditional Medicine (TRM) Department of Health Systems Development (HSD) World Health Organization Regional Office for South-East Asia (WHO-SEARO)Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports4 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):4-5I am delighted to learn that All India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi is launching a quarterly journal of Ayurveda Case Reports (AyuCaRe). I wish this new journal a grand success. The success of any such periodical publication depends on the quality of its contents and its uninterrupted production with realistic peer reviewing and growth of its readership among the educators, researchers and practitioners of Ayurveda. Inspite of some progress in the area of research by way of MD, Ph.D theses and few institutional research project mode researches; the rate of quality publication from AYUSH sector has remained disappointing. Some recently launched journals such as J-AIM, AYU, ASL and AAM have shown steady growth but have not succeeded to earn any impact factor. Traditional Chinese medicine and Yoga have shown better performance than Ayurveda, which is really a matter of concern. The reason for this slow turnover of publications is due to lack of quality research in this sector besides lack of core competency and lack of skill for research writing. The third important factor is the dearth of good journals in this field willing to consider Ayurvedic research submissions. I am really happy to notice the initiatives of AIIA to launch a new journal. Rapid publication needs rapid growth of quality research yielding publishable data. It is hoped that Central Council for Researches in Ayurvedic Sciences will pool its resources and expertise to promote Ayurvedic research both in fundamental and applied aspects specially clinical researches through appropriate scientific research methodology. I have been closely How to cite: Singh RH. All India Institute of Ayurveda Launching Quarterly Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports. J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):4-5.involved in teaching, research and practice of Ayurveda for over 50 years. My experiences suggest that one of the main barriers in AYUSH research is non-availability of appropriate research methodology which may test Ayurveda as it is in true sense. Most of the present day researchers conduct small scratchy researches ignoring the Ayurvedic approach and principles using hurriedly borrowed conventional methodology resulting in baseless data throwing no light on Ayurveda. As a matter of fact, Ayurveda research is facing a serious methodology crisis. It cannot be overemphasized that Ayurveda has greater strength in its unique principles, concepts and approaches, not so much in its medications. But the entire R&D effort is devoted in drug development through conventional methods with little outcome. The methodology of clinical drug research too is standing on the crossroads seeking right directions in the changing scenario. The double blind placebo controlled clinical trials which were considered the gold standards of drug testing during mid-20 th century are no more considered gold standards as they are full of fallacies and flaws specially when applied to Ayurvedic research. The reverse pharmacology approach with pragmatic clinical trials and careful and critical clinical case studies are now considered as more authentic methods of clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a drug or a procedure. In view of this trend, it is in fitness of things that, AIIA is launching a quarterly journal of Ayurveda Case Reports (AyuCaRe). But this enterprise will be purposeful only if clinicians keep good records and carry case reporting in a duly critical and intensive manner and not in a casual way. Each case report should be peer-reviewed by three reviewers without Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports GUEST EDITORIAL All India Institute of Ayurveda Launching Quarterly Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports 5 Singh RH: Quarterly Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):4-5any conflict of interest. Clinical case reports need more rigorous scrutiny than the reports of controlled clinical trials. Many Indian journals who claim that they are peer reviewed, treat the peer reviewing process as a formality and as an academic ritual serving no purpose. There is also an acute shortage of willing and competent reviewers. The important issues like conflict of interest and authenticity of investigational data are often ignored. Most journals are starving of publishable submissions and there is not much choice of selection of papers for running the life-line of a journal. Most of the journals appear quarterly and there is hardly a good monthly journal in AYUSH sector. Hence there is a simultaneous need of fast track promotion and enhancement of good research in Ayurveda on one hand and similar activism on quality publication. Research and publication have to go hand in hand. The educational institutions need to be vitalized to produce talented and skilled postgraduates who may have work-culture and scientific temper with willingness and passion to opt research and teaching as a career.The role of good practitioners in the professional field, public or private, is equally important. Our practitioners could conduct good clinical research in practice settings and could submit good clinical research reports for publication in AIIA Journal. All India Institute of Ayurveda should organize periodical workshops and training program for postgraduate students and faculty members to learn the skill of writing Ayurveda research papers and proposals. This is absolutely essential because the main reason why Ayurvedic academia is trailing behind is the poor performance on research and publication frontiers. AIIA being the apex institution of higher studies in Ayurveda, its mandatory responsibility is to play activism. There is need of Action Now, no more tomorrows. Prof Ram Harsh Singh Distinguished Professor, Department of Kayachikitsa, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India Email: rh_singh2001@yahoo.com 6 Journal of Ayurveda Case S, Anup BT Department of Panchakarma, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, infarction, aseptic necrosis and ischemic bone necrosis is cellular death of bone components due to interruption of blood supply, because of which the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses.[1-3] If AVN affects the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction of the articular surfaces. It primarily affects epiphysis of long bones such as the femur and also involves shoulder, knee and hip joints etc. Other common sites include the humerus, shoulders, knees, ankles and the jaw.[4] Many people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, the affected joint may hurt under stress. ABSTRACT Avascular necrosis of hip joint has emerged as one of the most disabling conditions of present era of Orthopedics. It poses a challenge in front of the medical fraternity due to non-availability of accurate management for this condition. Surgery offers hip joint replacement that is not so commonly available and expensive too. Ayurveda can provide a suitable answer through appropriate Panchakarma modalities useful in Asthi dhatu kshaya. A diagnosed case of Avascular necrosis with complaints of pain at bilateral hip joint and restricted movements approached the out-patient division of the hospital and was managed by Udwartana, Virechana and Tikta ksheera vasti by following classical principles of Ayurveda. Significant improvement was noticed after the treatment. Pain was reduced significantly and the patient was able to walk and climb stairs at the end of the treatment. Results obtained were encouraging and restricted disease progression was observed.Keywords: Asthikshaya, Avascular necrosis, Case report, RT, Karishma S, Anup Avascular Necrosis through Panchakarma. J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):6-12 .Pain can be mild or severe, localized and develops gradually. Pain may be limited to groin, thigh or buttock if AVN affects hip. Pain location tends to be most specific in anterior hip and lower pelvis. Can be acute in onset (acute infarct phenomenon), which can mimic an acute injury. Range of motion will be reduced affecting the gait. No satisfactory therapy is available in conventional system of medicine, while the available procedures are not affordable by all. Prognosis of all such approaches are not convincing. [5] This condition can be correlated to like Bhedo asthi parvanam (breaking type of pain in bones and joints), Sandhi shula (joint pain), Mamsakshaya (muscular wasting), Balakshaya (weakness), Aswapna santataruk (disturbed sleep due to continuous pain) and Sandhi shaithilyam (afflicted joints) with Shiryanti iva cha asthini durbalani (destruction of bony tissue causing generalized Journal of Ayurveda Case ReportsAdil et al.: Ayurvedic Management of Avascular Necrosis 1(1) vata rogini (other etc.[6] Wide range of treatment modalities have been mentioned in Ayurveda that are effective in such manifestations. Case report: A 35 years male patient visited Department of Panchakarma, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar with chief complaints of pain at bilateral hip joints with restricted movements, difficulty in walking, unable to stand-up from sitting position and difficulty in forward bending since four months. Patient noticed a jerk on sudden lifting of weight of about 40-45 kg followed by pain at both hip joints and left gluteal region four months back. Pain aggravated on next day, restricting movements of hip joint without radiating to any parts. A brief warm-up of five minutes was providing mild relief, but the improvement was time limited. No history of tingling sensation or numbness of lower limbs was reported. Initially patient was managed with homeopathic medicines with which mild relief in pain was noticed. But, restricted movements were persisting with increased morning stiffness. Patient had a history of facial palsy about one and a half years back for which he was prescribed with corticosteroids and got significant relief. The Shareera prakriti of the patient was Kaphavataja, had Krura koshtha (on the basis of bowel habits), Madhyama bala (optimum physical strength) with good Satva (psychological strength). He had mild Agnimandya (decreased digestion and appetite) and habit of occasional drinking alcohol. Dosha dushya lakshana: Predominant Dosha in the disease is Vata in association with Pitta and Kapha. Since, there was a history of sudden jerk that may be responsible for local inflammation, vitiating Pitta. Besides, Avarana of Kapha and Meda over Vata may also be considered to play an important role in the manifestation of symptoms like stiffness and restricted movements of hip joint in the patient. Assessment Criteria: Pain, stiffness and difficulty in walking (Table 1), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and improvement in the movements of flexion, extension and abduction were assessed at various stages of treatment.Table 1: Grading of pain and other symptoms Pain No Pain 0 Mild pain with no difficulty in walking 1 Moderate pain with slight difficulty in walking 2 Severe pain with severe difficulty in walking 3 Visual Analogue ScaleNo Pain (0) 0 Mild (1-3) 1 Moderate (4-6) 2 Severe (7-10) 3 StiffnessNo Stiffness 0 Stiffness of mild grade, need no intervention 1 Stiffness relieved by topical medicaments 2 Stiffness relieved by oral medication 3 Stiffness not responded by medicine 4 Difficulty in walkingNo pain, normal movements 0 Mild pain with mild restriction of movements Moderate pain with restriction of movement 2 Severe pain with restricting movements 3 Complete restriction of movements 4 Investigations: MRI of Hip joint was conducted before and after the treatment. MRI Findings were suggestive of AVN of bilateral femur with minimal joint effusion (AVN Stage II). The lesions involved from 9 to 4 O clock on sagittal images. No evident sub-chondral collapse or secondary degenerative osteoarthritis was found. Management of the condition: The patient was admitted in the Panchakarma IPD and treatment was planned considering involved Dosha and Dushya. Tikta ksheera vasti was planned for eight days that was preceded by Rukshana therapy comprising of Udwartana (dry powdered massage), followed by Virechana karma Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):6-12(Table 2). Udwartana was done for five days with mixture of 200 g of Yava churna and 50 g of Triphala churna that was made warm and rubbed firmly over the bilateral hip region for 25 to 30 minutes for five days. Internally, patient was advised to take Siddha jala [water processed one part of drug and Pachana for five days. Table 2: Plan of treatment Procedure Duration Drugs used Ruksha udwartana5 days Agni; Snehapana with Go-ghrita was planned that was given to the patient before 6.30 AM and continued till the appearance of Samyak snigdha lakshana. It took five days to observe these features. Dose of Go-ghrita was increased daily observing the digestive capacity of the patient. Go-ghrita was administered at a dose of 30 ml, 70 ml, 110 ml, 140 ml and 170 ml on 1 st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th day respectively. This was followed by Abhyanga and Swedana (sudation in a steam chamber) for three days. Patient was advised to take diet like Mudgayusha and fruit juice like orange or pomegranate twice a day for three days. At the end of this, drugs for Virechana were administered and Madhyama shuddhi was obtained. After completion of Sansarjana krama (specific diet regimen after Shodhana) for Madhyama shuddhi (for five days), patient was advised a gap of three days that was followed by Tikta ksheera vasti made-up of 50 ml of Madhu (honey), 5 g of Saindhava lavana (rock salt), 100 ml of Go-ghrita (ghee), 25 g of Kalka (paste) prepared out of powders of Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia Miers.) and (roots of Ricinus communis Linn.). The plan of Vasti is presented at Table 3. Observations and Results: Mild improvement was reported in pain, stiffness and range of movements after Udwartana with a feeling of lightness in the affected area. During Snehapana for Virechana, it took around 6-8 hours to feel hunger by the patient on 1 st Table 3: Plan of Vasti Day Dose (ml)Time of administrationTime of Vasti pratyagamanaObservations Complications if any 1500 11 AM 15 min Feeling of lightness in body, Two bowel evacuations None2500 11.15 AM 20 min A bowel evacuation, Lightness present in body, Mild relief in pain and stiffness 3600 11 AM 10 min A bowel evacuation, No other specific observations 4600 11.30 AM 15 min A bowel evacuation, Improvement in range of hip joint movements5600 10.30 AM 20 min 6600 10.45 AM 15 min 7600 11 AM 20 min A bowel evacuation with feeling of lightness in body, Significant relief in pain and stiffness 8500 11 AM 30 min A bowel evacuation with significant relief in pain, stiffness and improvement in hip joint movementsAdil et al.: Ayurvedic Management of Avascular Necrosis 1(1) of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):6-12and 2nd day of Snehepana, while it was increased to 10 hours on 3rd and 4th day and 13 hours on the 5th day. Unctuousness in stools, downward movement of flatus and greasiness of skin were observed from 4th day onwards. An average retention time of Vasti was around 18 minutes. No untoward effects were noticed during Vasti regimen (Table 9). Mild relief was reported in pain, stiffness and range of movements after Udwartana with a feeling of lightness in the affected area. After Virechana, marked improvement was observed in pain, stiffness, improvement in range of movements at hip joint region. After completion of Vasti, there was further improvement in the movements due to decreased pain and stiffness. Pain, stiffness and difficulty in walking responded with Virechana and Tikta ksheera vasti (Table 4). Patient was able to walk and climb stairs without any external support. Body weight was reduced from 90 kg to 83 kg after classical procedures of Udwartana, Virechana and Vasti. Observations of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) came down from 4 to 1 by the end of treatment. Improvement was also found in the range of movements of hip joint (Table 5). Discussion: Prakriti of the patient was Kaphavataja and weight was 90 kg. Main symptoms present were pain, stiffness and decreased range of movements that is an indication of Vata as the main Dosha leading to Asthikshaya. Considering Vata as main dosha, Vasti was planned in the management. Since Asthi was the main involved Dhatu; Tikta used considering its properties.[8] Milk in Vasti Linn.) used in the formulation may help in rebuilding the bone tissue. [9] AVN of hip joint develops basically due to obstruction of small blood vessels supplying to femoral head leading to gradual development of necrosis due to reduced vascular supply. Thus, Rakta vaha sroto rodha becomes prime cause leading to Asthi dhatu kshaya in the hip joint. To counter this Rakta dushti; Virechana was planned before proceeding to Vasti. [10] Virechana also helps in Dhatu vishodhana.[11]Patient suffered from facial palsy about one and a half years ago and there was a history of steroid drug intake for the same, for six months, until recovery. Patients having a history of oral steroid usage are more prone to develop AVN. [12] Glucocorticoid-induced AVN causes significant morbidity and accounts for around 10% of all cases of total hip replacement in the United States. [13] The prevalence of gluco-corticoid induced AVN is between 3% and 38%, depending on the underlying diseases, gluco-corticoid dosage and route of administration. [14] Patient had a history of having alcohol occasionally, which is also one of the causes making more proneness for developing AVN. [15] Virechana was selected as a therapy to be used here for Shodhana to produce detoxifying effects since there was a history of steroid and alcohol intake. Virechana also provides stability to Dhatu countering dhatu sthairya, [16] that is needed especially in conditions like AVN. Besides this, there are chances for better absorption of Vastidravya after Shodhana, thus chances of better results. In this trial, Nimbaamritadi eranda taila was used for Virechana. [17] The purpose was to perform Snigdha virechana considering Vata predominant nature of disease and involvement of Asthi dhatu that have Ruksha and kharaguna. Besides, Eranda taila is said to act on Vatadosha and when it is processed along with Tikta rasa dravyas like Nimba and as Rakta prasadaka too. Before Virechana; Udwartana was planned for external Rukshana as the patient was of Kapha vataja prakriti with body weight of 90 kg. Rukshana would be the procedure of choice to remove any Avarana caused by Kapha and Meda before commencing with the main treatment for better action and bio availability of subsequent therapies. About 200 g of Yavachurna and 50 g of Triphala churna were used in Udwartana. Reduction in stiffness, weight loss and lightness in body were observed after completion of this process. But, severity of pain was persisting during walking and on attempt to climb stairs. Reduction of stiffness could be due to the Rukshaguna of Yava cause neutralization of Kapha, required Lekhana effect. in Once the Avascular 2017; action of Virechana and Vasti is expected on Vayu. This could also be the reason for loss of weight and the relative lightness in patient. Internal Deepana, Pachana with Dhanyaka and Shatapushpa also lead to increased appetite and proper bowel evacuation on daily basis. Most of the subjective and objective parameters showed marked improvement after the Virechana karma. Eighteen Virechana vegas with Shleshma pravritti in last two vegas indicating optimum procedure (Samyak shuddhi) of Virechana. No weakness was reported by patient on the day of Virechana or subsequent days of Samsarjana krama. Considerable improvement in pain and stiffness in hip joints probably owing to Vata shamaka and Ama nirharana properties of Eranda taila. virechana was planned to counteract the Ruksha effect created by Vataprakopa. Tikta drugs present in it like Nimba, Amrita, Tikta ksheera vasti was administered. Improvement in range of hip joint movements owes to the significant reduction in stiffness and pain produced after Virechana. Marked improvement was observed in abduction, flexion and extension of hip joint. Honey is the first component of Vasti, the base in which the emulsion for other ingredients are prepared. It is also said to possess Asthi sandhaniya properties that helps in rebuilding damaged Asthi. [21] Vasti with Tikta kshaya roga. Guduchi is said to be an excellent Rasayana drug, known to prevent ageing and degeneration of the tissues, especially Asthi is grouped under Asthi sandhaniya also has a role in enhancing Rakta dhatu,[8] thus may have a role in providing nourishment to hip joint by re-channelizing blood vessels supplying to it. Erandamoola is the other Dravya used in Vasti kwatha, which is said to have Vata shamaka properties, thus producing significant relief in pain. It is also said to help as Ama dosha nirharana that is responsible for production of stiffness and thus bringing about a considerable improvement in the range of movements at hip joint.

Two tablets of Abha guggulu (each 500 mg) twice a day with 60 ml Rasna saptaka kwatha, a blend of Guduchi churna (2 g) and Godanti bhasma (250 mg) were advised. Patient was advised to consume warm water and easily digestible food items. Exposure to cold air, maintaining one particular posture for a longer duration, frequent jerky movements and lifting weights were asked to be avoided. Patient was advised to re-visit the hospital after a month to re-evaluate the features. No further deterioration in the symptoms was noticed after a month. Pain was present in hip joints but only during walking and climbing stairs. Range of movements like flexion, extension and abduction at hip joints were restricted but showed no significant deterioration as compared to the observations made just after completion of therapies. MRI scans of the hip joint after the follow up period showed no further deterioration in the gradation (Grade II) of Avascular necrosis, which suggests that the disease progression was stopped. He was advised to revisit hospital after one month for next treatment regimen. Conclusion: AVN is an orthopedic condition that poses a challenge in front of whole medical fraternity owing to the impeding of routine activities produced. The adopted therapy in the current case provided marked relief from pain, tenderness, general debility and improvement in the gait. The grade of AVN did not worsen and was maintained. This was a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of Udwartana, Virechana and Vasti in the management of AVN and the results produced were encouraging enough not only on the subjective and objective scales but also provided a check in disease progression. It is advisable to conduct this particular study on a larger number of samples for a greater span of time to draw more concrete conclusions. More awareness among general public should be created towards management of AVN using Ayurveda to promote earlier diagnosis that might lead to better prognosis.

In Ayurveda, infected wounds can be compared with Dusta vrana. Besides other modalities of treatment; leech application has been emphasized in the management of such manifestations. A male patient of 45 years age having Vata kaphaja prakriti visited OPD of Shalya tantra with complaints of severe pain, swelling with ulceration over the dorsum of right foot and intermittent fever with history of unknown insect bite for the past two weeks. Local examination revealed an ulcer covered with necrotic tissue with progressive inflammatory changes. Based upon the history and clinical findings; the case was diagnosed as Dusta vrana due to Kita dansha. Leech application was done by following classical guidelines of Ayurveda. Simultaneously, cleaning of wound with Panchavalkala Kwatha and dressing with powder of Katupila ( Securinega leucopyrus) mixed with Tila Taila (sesame oil) was done daily. Changes in size, shape, floor, and margin of the ulcer were recorded at regular interval. Pain, discharge were completely subsided after three consecutive sittings of leech application. The ulcer was completely healed within two months with minimal scar formation. Leech application along with local application of Katupila has significant role in controlling inflammation and promoting healing of infected wounds without any adverse effect.

J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):13-17. 13 On accidental exposure, Kitas (insects) emit poisonous substances into the blood through saliva and cause formation of Vrana (ulcer) and Sopha (inflammation) at the site of bite. If appropriate interventions are not taken at right time; other generalized reactions like Toda (burning (pyrexia) etc. will manifest. [2]Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports14 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):13-17Mahanta VD al.: Management of infected wound through Jalaukaavacharana 1(1) 2017:13-17Insect bite and sting cases are commonly seen in rural clinical practice. Venom is composed of proteins and other substances, which is responsible in developing allergic reactions of various stages depending upon the nature of the venom as well as patient's resistance power. Initially burning pain and redness appears followed by gradual localized swelling. There may be presence of visible sting or a small puncture at the site of bite. The bites may cause manifestations like acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) or toxic pustuloderma, anaphylactic reaction etc. [3] In routine; rest to the affected part, application of ice packs, compression and elevation of the affected part etc. are advised to reduce inflammation and pain. In addition, other medications like anti-allergic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics etc are also recommended to combat symptoms. Exclusive description of wound and its management can be observed in the texts of Ayurveda. Specifically, Rakta mokshana (blood-letting) through Jalauka (Leech) is emphasized in the management of Savisaja vrana (poisonous wound). [1] Various clinical studies have reported rapid, effective and long-lasting potential of leech application in managing painful conditions. [4] Case report: A 45 years old male auto driver of Vata kaphaja prakriti visited OPD of Shalya tantra, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar with complaints of severe pain, swelling with ulceration over the dorsum of right foot and intermittent fever for the past two weeks. History revealed an unknown insect bite during sleep. Burning pain was noticed immediately after the bite that was increased gradually. On 2 nd day, affected foot was swollen with symptoms of cellulitis. Patient had taken antibiotics, analgesics and anti-allergic drugs for ten days from a private hospital. He did not get relief and the severity of pain, size of ulcerative lesion was increased. Routine laboratory investigations were normal except slight variation on percentage of neutrophil and lymphocyte count. On local examination, a progressive ulcer at dorsum of left foot just above the meta-tarso-phallangeal joint, about 5x7 cm in size, with irregular, inflamed margins was found. Floor was covered with necrotic tissue with foul smell and purulent discharge (Figure 1). On palpation, local temperature was raised and the surrounding area was tender (+++). Distal neurovascular status was normal. Radiological examination of foot revealed no bony abnormality. Based upon the signs and symptoms; case was diagnosed as Dushta vrana due to insect bite and planned for Jalaukaavacharana (leech application). Before application of Jalauka, necrotic tissue was removed surgically and surrounding skin of the ulcer was cleaned with Panchavalkala kwatha [decoction of Buch-Ham.)]. Jalaukas were applied over the floor and at the border of the ulcer (Figure 2). Jalaukaavacharana was started with four Jalauka on first day and three Jalauka on 3 rd and 5th day of admission (Figure 3-4). This was followed by cleaning of the area with Panchavalkala kwatha and dressing with Muell) and Tila regularly till complete healing. All the Jalaukas used on 1 st day were died after 15 minutes of blood-letting, while Jalaukas used on 3rd and 5th day were died after an hour. Fig 1: Wound covered with necrotic tissue with inflamed margins (On the day of admission) Observations: Swelling and pain were reduced remarkably on 5th day of leech application. On 15th day of regular dressing; necrotic tissue disappeared completely and wound became clean with exposed tendons (Figure 5). After 30 days, healthy granulation tissue was observed and exposed tendons were covered with healthy granulation tissue (Figure 6). Gradually, 15 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):13-17Mahanta VD et Jalaukaavacharana 1(1) 2017:13-17the ulcer size was reduced with remarkable wound contraction. After 45 days, the wound became small and wound was healed completely by the end of two months (Figure 7-10) without any internal medication.

The group of Tikshna Kita produces severe cutaneous reactions in form of Sopha (inflammatory lesions), Granthi (swellings), Pidakas (vesicles) and other (burning pain), Angamarda (bodyache), Murchchha (anaphylactic reactions) by virtue of their Ushna (hot), Tikshna (sharp), Shukshma (penetrating into minute channels of the body), Vyavayi (rapidly permeating into the whole body), Avipaki (disturbing the tissue metabolism) etc. characters. [5] Sopha at the local site. Being dry in nature, it causes pain by vitiating the Vata. Shukshma guna probably takes the poisons to the deeper tissues and by spreading it causes cellulites.16 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):13-17Mahanta VD al.: Jalaukaavacharana 1(1) 2017:13-17In modern dermatology, these reactions are found when body comes in contact with offended arthropods that produce injury to the skin in a variety of mechanisms. [6] Mites are also considered as aetiological factors in the manifestation of dermatological reactions. Contact may cause erythematous papules, pruritus and formation of vesicles etc. [7] Raktamokshana is being practiced in India since long in the management of Dusta vrana (infected wounds), Granthi (cystic lesions), Arbuda (Neo Plasm) is of Raktamokshana that counters vitiated Rakta and Pitta. After piercing the skin, leech sucks the blood and injects number of biological substances into the blood stream. A medium size leech sucks 5-15ml of blood in one sitting. [8] In this study, approximately 7-8 cm size leeches were used and they consumed 10-15 ml of blood in each sitting. As, leeches sucked vitiated Rakta dosa (blood with toxins and unwanted metabolites) from the site of ulcer; reduction in pain and inflammatory signs were noticed. Patient was reported reduction in pain suggesting poisonous substances might have been removed through the blood by leeches. The inborn quality of Jalauka i.e. Shita (cold) and Madhura (sweet) are opposite to Pitta dosa and these leech possesses activity of wound healing. Hirudin is capable to increase surface perfusion due to its anti-coagulation effect. Presence of Histamine, a vasodilator constituent improves blood circulation by dilating capillary bed in that area and might help in flushing out of the unwanted substances from the ulcer. Thus, possibly cellulites was controlled. Other substances like hyaluronidase, bdellins, eglins possesses anti-inflammatory and anti- biotic properties. All these in combination, possibly played a great role in controlling inflammation and helped in wound healing. [10-12] Panchavalkala kashaya helps in wound healing by the virtue of its Kashaya rasa (astringent taste), [13] that brings back the Vrana to Shudhha avastha (clean stage) besides checking excessive discharge. [14] Paste of Katupila with Tila taila is traditionally in use for dressing wounds and its wound healing efficacy is reported. [15] Snigdha guna of Tila taila helps in facilitating the process of overall wound healing. It is observed that the progressive phase of ulcer was managed successfully by three sittings of Jalaukavacharana and regular dressing with paste of Katupila and Tila taila. No other medicines were used during the course of treatment. Conclusion: Jalaukavacharana along with local application of paste of Katupila mixed with Tila taila is an effective and safe treatment modality for the management of Dusta vrana caused by insect bite. This modality may even be beneficial in other types of infective and non-healing ulcers. However, such usefulness needs to be evaluated through well-defined clinical trials.

[1,2] It is primarily a disease of women, with a sex ratio of approximately 7:1 and can also occur in children.[2] In an epidemiological study conducted in India, prevalence of >20% was recorded.[3] Incidence rate of HT is 0.54% in India. The cause of HT is thought to be a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. It is characterized clinically by gradual thyroid failure, ABSTRACT Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) is the most common auto-immune thyroid disease and the commonest cause of hypothyroidism. In conventional medicine, treatment of choice for HT is replacement of thyroid hormone. A case of HT was managed at the OPD level by following Ayurveda principles and found to be effective. A treatment protocol was designed based on the signs and symptoms and assigned in this patient. Snehapana followed by Vamana and Virechana and at the end Shamana was done with Varunadi kwatha bhavita shilajatu for a period of three months with two months follow up. The treatment protocol was found to be effective in symptomatic and biochemical profiles of the patient. Patients of HT should be able to have a choice against the lifelong hormone therapy. This can be achieved by adequate evaluation of the individual action of the therapies adapted here and replicating the same in a much larger group.Keywords: Case report, Hypothyroidism, Thyroiditis How to BJ, Ayurveda.

[5] The treatment of choice for HT is replacement of thyroid hormone. The drug of choice is individually tailored and titrated levothyroxine sodium administered orally.

Moreover, it Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports 19 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; the parameters in HT with modern medicine. Currently, hypothyroid patients are opting for Ayurvedic management due to dissatisfaction in modern regime. A case of HT was managed through treatment protocol based on the clinical features and managed by following Ayurveda guidelines. Case report: A 48 year old male patient, painter by profession, who was apparently well fourteen years back, developed progressive fatigue and drowsiness initially. Then after two years (2005), he gradually developed mild neck swelling that became diffuse, painless and slowly increased in size. These symptoms were followed by sleeplessness, weight loss and palpitation. He was diagnosed as Hyperthyroidism and was put on Tab. Methimazole 20 mg/day (anti-thyroid medication) for two years (2007 - 2009). Then he was on irregular follow up for one year. In 2011, he developed new complaints like constipation, nocturnal itching associated with mild eruptions, cold intolerance, depression, hoarseness of voice, dry hair and skin. Blood investigations at this stage revealed Hypothyroidism. Radio iodine uptake and Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were advised in 2011 to rule out malignancy. Radio iodine study detected enlarged thyroids with high uptake, no cold area and retrosternal extension suggestive of multi nodular goiter (MND) and Thyrotoxicosis. Aspirate of FNAC showed occasional groups of follicular cells and few collection of lymphocytes and histocytes in a background of blood and colloid, suggestive of Thyroiditis and he was administered Tab. Levothyroxine. He was kept on varying doses of drug (50 mg - 100 mg) based on his hormone level. But he didn't get much relief from any of the above symptoms. As, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels were not coming into physiological range, he stopped the medication against medical advice four months before his first visit to OPD of Govt. Ayurveda College, Thiruvananthapuram in July 2012. Symptoms like severe sleeplessness due to nocturnal itching, weight loss, excessive appetite, constipation and cold intolerance were the chief complaints during his visit to the OPD. On examination there was mild swelling of thyroid gland, dryness of skin and palpitation.Patient was provisionally diagnosed avrita Kapha) with Pittaanubandha (associated Pitta) based on the presenting complaints like Sheeta asahishnuta (cold Swara graha (hoarseness of voice), encompassing of metabolic pathways by vitiated body humors. Symptoms like Galapaka (inflammation of thyroid gland), Atyagni (excessive appetite) can be attributed to Pittanubandhatwa. The treatment was started with internal and external Rookshana (desiccating) therapy. The treatment protocol assigned for this patient was Rookshana and Snehapana (internal administration of medicated ghee) followed by Vamana (therapeutic emesis) and Virechana (therapeutic kwatha bhavita shilajatu gutika. Treatment schedule followed is enlisted at Table 1. Observations: Clinical features, Serum Thyroid fuction test (TFT) Tg Antibody titre and Thyroid gland sonography were assessed before and after the treatment [Table 2]. Patient reported increased appetite and normal bowel movements after Deepana and Pachana. But, mild constipation and dryness of skin was observed during Udwartana. By Achapana, complaints like itching, constipation, sleeplessness and dryness of skin were alleviated. Itching was completely subsided after Vamana and palpitations after Virechana. Enhanced complexion was also noticed after Virechana. After administration of Shamana drug; relief in depressive symptoms were observed. Blood parameters were improved approaching towards normal value after Shamana chikitsa. Both thyroid lobes were normal in size, hypoechoic and showed coarsened parenchymal echotexture with increased vascularity before trial. But after the trial, normal size of the lobes was maintained with changed texture to hyperechoic, showing a good prognosis. After two months follow up, TSH level came down to 10.3 mIU/L and with in the next month, it became 6 mIU/L. No recurrence of previous symptoms were observed till date. The treatment made a pleasing improvement in his quality of life. 20 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 18-22Table No 1: Treatment Schedule Treatment Drug of Choice Duration Deepana and Pachana (correction of digestion and metabolism)Guduchyadi kwatha (90 ml) and Panchakola choorna (5 g) in Butter milk (200 ml)8 days powder massage)Kola kulathadi choorna 3 days Snehapana Tiktaka ghrita[8] (started with a dose of 50 ml and increased to 250 ml)7 days Swedana (Fomentation)Abyanga water)Three monthsTable 2: Effect on TFT & Thyroid Antibody parameters Parameters Normal ValuesBefore TrialAfter Trial TSH (mIU/ mL) 0.4 - 4.2 46 16 T3 (ng/dl) 80 - 200 110 119 T4 (\u00b5g/dl) 4.6 - 10.5 7.3 7.2 Anti TPO Anti Tg (U/ML) <60 Thyroiditis, impairing cellular metabolism. Use of immuno-modulatory, anti-inflammatory drugs and other molecules that clears the nutrition pathway through correction of digestion and metabolism will help in breaking the pathology. On analysis of signs and symptoms, the patient was found to have Vata kapha pradhaana sannipatika doshadushti (vitiation of all three body humors). An apt drug in this condition should cause Sroto shodhana (removes blocks in metabolic pathways) kapha pitta and Anulomana Vata. Patient was responding positively to Deepana and Pachana (corrects digestion and metabolism through augmenting the digestive fire), Rookshana (desiccating), Ushna (hot), and Vamana treatment procedures. Thus, the patient was treated on the line of mitigation of Kapha and pacifying Vata ( vata of Pitta too; Pitta hara drugs and therapies were also included in the protocol. Agni deepana (kindle digestive fire) was done initially to correct the digestion and metabolism. So, Guduchyadi kashaya [11] and Panchakola choorna [12] in Takra was advised in the initial stage to achieve Ama pachana, Agni deepana and to subside vitiated Kapha and Pitta. Rookshana was induced by internally and Udwartana with Kola of Shodhana. Both Vamana and 21 Ayurveda Case Reports, in eliminating vitiated eliminating doing seven Bhavana in Varunadi Kwatha. Both the drugs have Katu vipaka and Ushna virya in general. They also vata prashamaka. Thus these qualities of drug intensely suit the disease condition. Micro-level Dosha correction will be ensured by the Varunadi kwatha bhavita shilajatu and the reach of the drug up to Medo dathu level explains the rationale behind the success of the treatment protocol.[14,15] Moreover the drug Shilajatu opted here is a Rasayana with multifaceted action. Conclusion: The treatment protocol containing Rookshana, shilajatu is followed in this case of HT. This protocol is found to be effective in clinical, biochemical and sonological aspects. Though no drugs were given during the follow- up period, symptomatic relief was maintained. Patients of HT should be able to have a choice against the lifelong hormone therapy. This can be achieved by adequate evaluation of the individual action of the therapies adapted here and replicating the same in a much larger group.

There is now enough evidence to say that this was the mother of all other systems of medicine. ABSTRACT Ayurveda serves best in many disease conditions where conventional system face several limitations. Ankylosing spondylitis is one such condition, whose effective management is becoming a challenge. It is a systemic auto-immune rheumatic disease, which shows a strong association with genetic factor HLA-B27. Early stages of disease show inflammation of spine and other symmetrical small joints and other soft tissues, whereas chronic stage presents with axial deformity and pain. NSAIDs and steroids are generally prescribed in conventional systems, but are not a complete remedy. The signs and symptoms of this disorder are not mentioned in Ayurveda, but, based upon the clinical picture, treatment can be planned. A male 24 years patient diagnosed with axial and peripheral Ankylosing spondylitis having HLA-B27 positive case was managed with Panchakarma procedures followed by suitable Ayurvedic medicines. After completion of the treatment, pain in the sacro-illiac region, morning stiffness of joints were significantly reduced with reduced ESR and CRP. As the signs and symptoms of this disease are not mentioned in Ayurveda classics; specific treatment protocol and formulations cannot be given. Selection of drugs may differ from case to case. The treatment plan followed in this study may be adopted in future cases changing the selection of drugs based upon the necessity to obtain good results.Keywords: 2017;1(1):23-27.But in-spite of the greatness of this science, Ayurveda has to satisfy itself in the seat of alternative medicine, although it was the chief system of medicine till the emergence of modern allopathic medicine. But credit should be definitely given to allopathic system of medicine because it has made the life of human being more comfortable with the help of various researches and advancement in treatment modalities. But in certain disease conditions like auto immune diseases; allopathic system of medicine has still not found any successful remedies. Ankylosing spondylitis is one such Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports24 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept rheumatic that shows a strong association with genetic factor HLA-B27.[1] In early stages of disease, there is inflammation of spine with symmetrical small joints and other soft tissues. Chronic stage is characterized by marked axial immobility or permanent deformity and pain. It usually starts in late teens and early twenties and can lead to progressive bony fusion of sacro-iliac joints and the vertebral column. Extra-articular manifestations may also manifest in a few patients. [2] In allopathic system of medicine, NSAIDs and steroids are generally prescribed along with physiotherapy. But still it remains as a symptomatic approach. If Ayurvedic approaches are intervened appropriately, further progression of the disease can be prevented. In this attempt, a case of Ankylosing spondylitis has been successfully managed with Ayurvedic treatment approaches. Case report: A 24 year-old male patient visited the OPD with complains of early morning stiffness with asymmetrical inflammation of left knee, right ankle and inter-phalangeal joints of hands since one year. He was diagnosed with axial and peripheral Ankylosing spondylitis having HLA-B27 positive. Pulse was 84/min, regular; Blood Pressure - 120/80 mm of Hg, Temperature - 99.6 0F, Respiratory rate - 18/min. Respiratory, Cardiovascular and Central nervous system did not show any specific abnormality. Per abdomen examination was normal. Tenderness was present over bilateral sacroiliac joints. Morning stiffness of joints with oedema over left knee and right ankle joint was present. Achilles tendinitis was present in right leg causing pain in lower part of leg. Hemoglobin levels were below 9.5% for past one year whereas ESR was 100mm and CRP level 76 mg/l. Past treatment history: The patient was under the supervision of a rheumatologist for eight months, where combinations of different drugs have been prescribed (Table 1). No improvement was observed with these medicines, subsequently all these medicines were withdrawn. The patient was advised to continue Voveran (Diclofenac sodium) tablet as an analgesic agent to relieve pain. Patient lost 16 kg weight within the six months time and developed other symptoms like hyperacidity and loss of appetite. Table 1: Conventional drugs prescribed to the patient 1Tab. Saaz DS (Sulphasalazine) 1000 mg twice a day 2Tab. (Methotraxate) 15 mg once a week 3Tab. Etoshine 120 mg twice a day 4Tab. Medrol (Methyl predenisolone) 8 mg once / day 5Tab. Voveran SR (Diclofenac Sodium) 75 mg twice / day (Folic acid) 5mg once a day 7Tab. Ultracet (Tramadol Hydrochloride 37.5 mg & Acetaminophen 325 mg) twice a day The above drugs were used for three months by the patient under the supervision of the rheumatologist. As the response was very minimal, the prescription was changed and the below drugs were prescribed. 1Inj. Depo-medrol (Methyl predenisolone Acetate) 120 mg once daily 2Inj. (Methotrexate) 15 mg once a week 3Tab. Myospaz (Chlorezoxazone 250 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg) twice a day 4Tab. Lefunomide 10mg once a day Ayurveda perspective: Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be mirrored with any particular disease condition directly that is elaborated in Ayurveda classics. It can be compared to some extent with Ama vata, or Gambhira vatarakta, or Asthi-majjagata vata. [3-5] Taking this into consideration, the patient was evaluated according to Ayurvedic perspective. Prakriti of the patient was Vata pitta. Agnimandya was noticed in the patient and presented with Ama lakshanas in Mala and Jihva. Though, Vata and Pitta were dominating doshas in this manifestation; involvement of Kapha dosha was also Rakta, Mamsa, Asthi, Majja dhatus. Considering Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; procedures were planned that were followed by internal medications for 45 days (Table 2). Besides these procedures; Kaishora guggulu (500 mg thrice), Sanshamani vati (250 mg twice), Punarnavadi kwatha (15 ml twice) and a blend of Amalaki, Musta, Guduchi powders (1 g each with warm water) were administered during the first two weeks of the management. This was followed by Kaishora guggulu (500 mg thrice), Sanshamani vati (250 mg kashayam (15 ml twice), powder of Ashwattha twak (1 g twice with honey) and Lepa guti for external application over swollen, inflamed parts. Table 2: Ayurvedic treatment plan Panchakarma days Jalaukacharana At right ankle and left knee joint3 daysObservations: All the allopathic medicines were gradually withdrawn by 21st day of commencement of Ayurvedic treatment. After withdrawing NSAIDs; both pain and swelling were aggravated, but they were tolerable. After completion of Panchakarma therapy, sacro-illiac joint pain was completely reduced, while morning stiffness was reduced significantly. Mild swelling was observed over left knee and right ankle joints especially in the morning hours, which was reduced with physiotherapy. After one month of follow up, only mild tolerable swelling over right ankle was complained. This swelling was further reduced with continuous physiotherapy. Hematological profile of the patient was significantly improved. Good improvement in heamoglobin percentage was seen. ESR and CRP were also reduced suggesting reduction in inflammation (Table 3). Patient gained 8 kg weight within two months after completion of the treatment. By the end of treatment, no need of conventional analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs was needed by the patient. Discussion: Patient was analysed by following Ayurvedic principles. On examination; it was observed that patient had symptoms of Ama, so Ampachana was suggested with Amrutottaram kashayam [6] that is generally used in vitiation of Tridoshas and is also indicated in Jwara. Ama pachana is a crucial step that is done before Snehapana followed by Virechana. Considering severity of the disease and Samata of Mala, as well as dominancy of planned. Snehapana with Indukantam ghritam [7] was planned, as it plays an important role in Rasa pradoshaja diseases. Virechana was given Pitta Kapha. Trivrit helps in eliminating Pitta followed by Kapha and is also well tolerated by the patient. After Virechana, patient was given Karma vasti with alternate with Sahacharadi taila [9] that acts very well on lower part of the body. Mustadi yapana vasti[10] was given considering Madhyama bala of the patient as well as its efficacy on Vaata dosha. Mustadi yapana is good shaali pinda sweda[11] and Upanaha sweda[12] relief of pain and swelling, Sarvanga sweda with Nirgundi and Shigru was also given for relief of pain and removing Stambha. Internal medicine such as Kaishora guggulu [13] and Sanshamani vati[14] were selected considering their 26 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; its role in Asthi majja gata jwara 12.7 RBC (million 3.8 4.84 ESR 106 76 32 CRP c. Shothahara property. Rasna erandadi kashayam[17] added to the list of medicines in further stages of treatment, as it pacifies pain due to Vata mainly in lower limbs and back. It also reduces Shotha due to Vata. Ashwattha churna[18] was vitiated Vata and Rakta. Jalaukacharana[19] (Leech therapy) was done over right knee and left ankle to reduce the pain and inflammation occurring due to Achilles tendinitis. Lepa guti[20] was added in follow up treatment to control Vedana and Shopha (analgesic and anti-inflammatory) action locally. Physiotherapy with stretching exercises were advised to relieve stiffness of muscles as well as joints. Conclusion: Concept of pill for every ill is becoming an outdated concept in the Modern era. The present patient was examined and treated following to Ayurvedic principles. For auto immune diseases, such as Ankylosing spondilitis, where there is no satisfactory proven treatment in conventional medical systems; Ayurveda can be used effectively. Though single case report cannot prove treatment for all such auto immune manifestations; well designed clinical trials may be planned in order to validate actual potency of treatment patterns and principles applied in this case.Source of support: Nil.

Musculoskeletal problems are common in diabetics but are not so well- known as compared to other complications of the disease. Frozen Shoulder, one such musculoskeletal problem, is estimated to affect diabetic patients five times more as compared to non-diabetics, resulting in pain and limited range of movement and is compared to Apabahuka in Ayurveda. Conventional treatment modalities like analgesics, NSAIDs, steroids and surgery etc have certain limitations. Hence, alternatives are being searched from other systems of medicines. A 64 years old female patient, presented with pain and restricted movements of left shoulder joint; was treated with Udvartana followed by local Swedana with Jambeera pinda and Panchatikta panchaprasritika vasti for five five days. After completion of therapy, pain was subsided and satisfactory improvement was found in the shoulder joint movements. Panchakarma in the form of Basti regimen and external therapies is surely a result oriented therapy in the management of Diabetes and such complications like Frozen shoulder. Panchakarma in the form of external therapies and Vasti regimen is a result oriented therapy in the management of Frozen Shoulder and also effective in Diabetes.Keywords: Apabahuka, Case report, Diabetes, Frozen shoulder, Panchakarma, Udvartana, Vasti to cite this article: Sangeeta RT, Adil R, Anup BT. Management of Frozen Shoulder in Diabetics through Panchakarma. J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):28-33.Introduction: Diabetes has emerged as one of the most common non-communicable diseases globally and it is threatening to be the most challenging health problem of this century. Complications from diabetes, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy etc are resulting in increasing disability, reduced life expectancy and enormous health cost for every society. Among them muscle cramps, muscle infarction, neuropathic joints, carpel tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, dupuytren's contracture and adhesive capsulitis are commonly seen. Among these, Adhesive Capsulitis of Shoulder also known as Frozen Shoulder is the most common manifestation, that affects diabetic patients five times more as compared to non-diabetics. [1] Hence, high blood sugar is a big risk factor for the development of Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports 29 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):28-33Sangeeta et al.: Ayurvedic Management of Frozen Shoulder 1(1) 2017: 28-33frozen shoulder. Studies reported increased prevalence of frozen shoulder in diabetic patients (26.25%), comparatively more in non dominant shoulders of females with type II DM. [2] Primary pathology in frozen shoulder is within the glenohumeral joint capsule which becomes adherent to the humerus head, resulting in pain and limited range of movements. Pain mostly worsens at night and there is progressive loss of passive range of movement (PROM) and active range of movement (AROM). It predominantly occurs unilaterally but both shoulders may get affected in about 10-20% of cases. [3] Other Risk factors include female sex, older age, shoulder trauma, surgery, parkinsons disease,[4] increased body mass index, cardiovascular and thyroid disorders etc.[5-9] Clinically, frozen shoulder develops in three symptom-related phases; first one is freezing or painful phase characterized by insidious onset of pain, which gradually increases in intensity with gradual PROM & AROM. It lasts for few weeks to nine months followed by frozen or adhesive phase of about four to nine months and finally thawing or recovery phase in which resolution starts with the gradual returning of shoulder joint to almost normalcy in six to twenty four or more months. Sign and symptoms of frozen shoulder have resemblance with Apabahuka described in Ayurveda, which is a condition of deranged Vata and Kapha. [10] Hence Vata kapha pacifying management was planned in the present case study. Though it is a self limiting condition, but recovery process is quite slow, which hampers daily routine of patients leading to frustration at times. Modern science uses treatment options like Analgesics, Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs, Steroids, Physiotherapy & Surgery etc in the management which are not satisfactory and are known to develop adverse effects too. Hence, alternatives are being searched from other systems of medicines. In this attempt, a patient presenting with symptoms of frozen shoulder was managed with Ayurveda principles. Case report: A 64 years aged female patient, visited OPD of Panchakarma, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar with complaints of pain, stiffness and restricted movements at left shoulder joint since 8 months. The pain was dull initially, gradually increased in severity, specially exacerbating at night (around 2 or 3 am). Pain usually was aggravating with movements of shoulder and was being relieved after intake of analgesics or with hot fomentation. Gradually the condition was worsened and the majority of shoulder joint movements were restricted. Routine activities including combing hair, bathing etc badly affected. Patient had regular bowel and bladder habits. Appetite was slightly reduced and sleep was altered due to shoulder pain and stiffness. Detailed examination following Ashta vidha and Dasha vidha pareeksha was done. [11-12] The patient was a known diabetic, hypertensive and was on anti-hypertensive drugs (Amlodipine 5 mg + Atenolol 50 mg once daily, Losartan 50 mg twice daily), hypoglycemic drugs (Glimepiride twice daily) and analgesics (Tramadol SOS). Besides medicines, patient also attended physiotherapy sessions for six months. Blood pressure (138/86 mm of Hg), pulse (80/min) and respiratory rate (22/min) were within the physiological limits. Respiratory system examination revealed bilateral adequate air entry with no added sounds. Cardio vascular system revealed normal audible S1, S2. Abdomen was soft with no tenderness, no organomegaly or no lump. All the movements at left shoulder joint were limited both actively and passively. Investigations: Routine haematological, urine and biochemical investigations were carried out to exclude other pathology and to know the underlying cause, which were within normal limits except blood sugar level i.e. fasting & post prandial blood sugar levels were 232 mg/dl and 189 mg/dl respectively. Radiograph of left shoulder joint (AP view) showed normal study. Treatment protocol: After (Madhyama), [13] local Udvartana was done for five days, which was followed by Jambeera Pinda Sweda along with Panchatikta 30 Journal Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):28-33Sangeeta 28-33panchaprasritika vasti for the next five days.[14] Patient was advised to take lukewarm water during the procedure. Total duration of the study was 10 days. No oral drugs were administered during this study period, while conventional anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic drugs taking earlier were continued. Brief details of drugs used in the treatment are mentioned at Table 1. Table 1: Treatment Protocol Procedure Ingredients Duration Udvartana Yava choorna (powder of Hordeum vulgare Linn.) - 100 - Fifth DayJambeera pinda Jambeera (Citrus Linn.) - 5 Linn.) ml of Go-ghritaSixth to Tenth Day Assessment criteria: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Stiffness, Range of movements using Goniometer and Blood sugar were assessed before and after treatment (Fig 1 and Table 2). Figure 1: Visual Analogue Scale Table 2: Gradation of Stiffness Stiffness 0 No Stiffness 1 Stiffness; no medication 2 Stiffness, relieved by external application 3 Stiffness, relieved by oral medication 4 Stiffness, not responded by medicineObservations and Results: Satisfactory improvement in overall functional status after ten days treatment was observed. No analgesics were needed by the patient during the treatment period and one month of follow up. No untoward effects were noticed during the whole procedure. Pain and stiffness were relieved completely by the end of treatment (Table 3) with significant improvement in the range of shoulder movements (Figure 1 and Table 4). FBS and PPBS came down to 168 mg/dl and 93 mg/dl from 232 mg/dl and 189 mg/ dl respectively. No aggravation in pain or stiffness was reported by the patient during follow up period of about one month after completion of therapy.

But, excess sugar in the blood stream seems to cause other problems also like musculoskeletal complications, out of which Frozen Shoulder is most common. Glucose molecules can adhere to collagen and make it sticky. Collagen is a major building block in the ligaments that holds the bones together in a joint. In Diabetics, this adhesion due to extra sugar molecules in blood stream can contribute to abnormal deposits of collagen in the cartilage and tendons of the shoulder, which causes stiffness of the affected shoulder and restricts its movements. [15] In addition, poor perfusion leads to abnormal collagen repair and degenerative changes. The theory is that platelet derived growth factor is released from abnormal or ischemic blood vessels, which will then act as a stimulus to local myofibroblast proliferation. [16] The pathology of frozen shoulder includes a chronic inflammatory response with fibroblastic proliferation, which may be immuno-modulated. Characteristically, pain precedes stiffness in frozen shoulder, which suggests an evolution from inflammation to fibrosis. These clinical and macroscopic features support the pathological findings of both inflammation and fibrosis. [17] That is why Udvartana was planned to reduce inflammation followed by Jambeera pinda sweda to act on fibrosis and Ushna guna. Moreover, Swedana enhances local microcirculation, by increasing the blood circulation rate of peripheral arterioles, delivering higher level of oxygen and nutrients to the injured cells. Prameha has been mentioned as Santarpanottha vyadhi and Virukshana kriya, Udvartana has been indicated So due to Rukshana kriya, excess Kleda in Pramehi may get absorbed due to opposite Guna. This may also cause reduction in viscosity due to increased sugar molecules attached to collagen. Thus, this could be helpful in reducing pain, stiffness and improving the range of shoulder movements. Apabahuka is having Vata kapha dosha dominancy, [20] after Kleda by Udvartana; dominancy of Vata dosha remains to be dealt with. Besides this, chronicity of the disease also leads to Vata prakopa up to some extent, for which Jambeera pinda sweda was applied, which is supposed to pacify due to its Amla, Lavana, Snigdha and Ushna guna. Though Vasti is not a choice of treatment for Prameha; Before Treatment After Treatment Flexion at Left Shoulder Joint Extension at Left Shoulder Joint Abduction at Left Shoulder Joint Figure 1: Improvement of the shoulder movements before and after therapy32 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; 1(1):28-33Sangeeta special mention Prameha.[22] The Rasa panchaka of the kapha dosha involved in the Samprapti of Apabahuka. Besides this, Tikta rasa is supposed to have direct effect on Asthi Pharmacological properties Diuretic, Immuno-stimulant and Anti-oxidative effects (Table 5). Hence, the hypoglycemic effect found after Vasti regimen in the biochemical reports and the analgesic effect may be attributed to these properties of drugs. Table 5: Pharmacological properties of ingredients of a self limiting disease, Ayurvedic treatment modalities can shorten the recovery time. Rukshana kriya like Udvartana followed by Jambeera pinda sweda can be helpful in reducing pain, stiffness and improving the range of shoulder movement in frozen shoulder. Panchatikta panchaprasritika vasti is effective in reducing the blood sugar level and improving the quality of life of diabetics. Thus, Udvartana followed by Jambeera pinda sweda along with Panchatikta panchaprasritika vasti is found effective in the management of frozen shoulder associated with diabetes. To further establish this treatment protocol in frozen shoulder, a study involving larger sample size is needed.

The prevalence of hypothyroidism in India is around 11%. [1] Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough Thyroxine (T4) and Tri-iodothyronine (T3). ABSTRACT Changed life style of current scenario has provoked several disharmonies in the biological system. Hypothyroidism is one such manifestation, which is believed to be a common health issue in India. The pathogenesis of Hypothyroidism according to Ayurveda is basically due to the abnormal functioning of Agni, which in turn affects Dhatwagni, eventually brings out pathological sequence and ultimately the disease condition develops. This condition can be managed by Ayurveda principles. A diagnosed case of Hypothyroidism presenting with puffiness of face and eyelids, weakness, lethargy, fatigue, prolonged intermenstrual period, dry and coarse skin, was managed with Triphaladya guggulu (1000 mg twice a day) and Punarnavadi kashaya (50 ml twice a day) for a period of 45 days. Thyroxine (100 mcg) that was being used by the patient since one year was withdrawn one week before starting the treatment. Serum TSH levels were reduced from 93.250 \u00b5IU/ml to 53.701 the end of treatment. Triphaladya guggulu and Punarnavadi kashaya are beneficial countering signs and symptoms and bringing down the TSH levels. As the observations were drawn from a single case; can be revalidated through well designed clinical trials. Keywords Case report, Hormone replacement therapy, Hypothyroidism, Punarnavadi kashaya, Triphladya guggulu of Hypothyroidism. J AyuCaRe 2017;1(1):34-39.Iodine deficiency and auto-immunity are the main causes of Hypothyroidism, out of which auto-immunity is common in the areas of iodine replete. There is no promising cure in contemporary systems for Hypothyroidism. The only available treatment is lifelong use of synthetic thyroxine that invites complications in the long run. Concept of Agni (digestive fire) and Ama (unwanted by product of improper digestion) are the central dogma of Ayurvedic therapeutics in general and in particular in the management of auto-immune pathologies. Agni, when becomes Manda (weak), is unable to metabolize Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports 35 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 2017; accumulation of intermediate metabolic by- products in the body at different levels. Such unwanted by-products (sometimes may act as free radicals) becomes toxic and may initiate pathologies of auto- immunity. As most body cells have receptors for thyroid hormones; T3 and T4 exert their effects throughout the body.[2] These hormones stimulate diverse metabolic activities in most tissues, leading to an increase in basal metabolic rate. Without thyroid hormones, almost all the chemical reactions of the body would become sluggish. These hormones can be considered as a part of Kayagni on which the entire metabolic activities depends.[3] Hence, impaired metabolism can be compared with vitiation of Agni according to Ayurveda. Thus, principles that correct the functioning of Agni will be beneficial in treating various pathologies. Following these guidelines, a case of Hypothyroidism was managed. Case report: A 30 years old female suffering with Hypothyroidism attended Panchakarma OPD, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar with the complaints of puffiness of face and eyelids, weakness, lethargy, fatigue, prolonged inter menstrual period, dry and coarse skin since one year with elevated levels of Serum TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). She was under Hormone replacement therapy (Tab Thyroxine 100 mcg OD) since one year. No positive family history was noticed. The Prakriti was found to be Vata pitta. Despite of continuous consumption of Thyroxine for one year; she could not get satisfactory relief in the signs and symptoms and approached Ayurveda for better management. As malfunctioning of Agni is considered in the pathogenesis; Triphaladya guggulu (1000 mg twice a day) along with Punarnavadi kashaya (50 ml twice a day) were chosen in the current case and were administered for a period of 45 days. [4-5] Composition formulation of these two formulations has been placed at Table 1-2. Triphaladya guggulu was Kanchanara twak kwatha until it attained a sticky consistency, followed by addition of powders of Trikatu and Triphala along with quantity sufficient honey for making pills of 500 mg size. It was administered in a dose of two pills (1000 mg) twice a day with luke warm water after meal for a period of 45 days. Table 1: Composition of Triphaladya guggulu Drug Botanical Name Part used Quantity 1 10 Parts Madhu Honey - Q.S Table 2: Composition of Punarnavadi kashaya Drug Botanical Name Part used of kashaya; patients were advised to add 400 ml potable water to 25 g of coarse powder of the ingredients and reduce to 50 ml and consume on empty stomach twice daily for a period of 45 days. Along with the oral medication, Pathya and Apathya ahara and Vihara (wholesome and unwholesome diet and lifestyle) were also advised to the patient. She was asked to consume luke warm water in place of normal / cold water during the treatment period. In addition, was advised to avoid consuming diet that is difficult to digest; consuming diet before complete digestion of earlier diet; frequent and excessive intake of curd and day sleep. Thyroxine (100 mcg) that was being used by the patient was withdrawn one week before starting the treatment. Tests for thyroid profiles were conducted and the patient was assessed on subjective parameters before starting the treatment and after 45 days of treatment. Assessment criteria: Improvement was assessed on the basis of percentage relief observed in the presenting complaints. Grading criterion being followed in the institute was adopted to assess the effectiveness of the therapy. [6] (Table 3). Table 3: Grading criteria a) Puffiness Absent 0 Occasional 1 Peri-orbital edema in the morning, relieved later 2 Persistent 3 b) WeaknessAble to exercise without difficulty 0 Able to do mild exercise 1 Able to do only mild work 2 Able to do mild work with difficulty 3 Not able to do even mild work 4 Unable to do even day to day routine work 5 c) Lethargy Doing work satisfactorily with proper vigor in time0 Doing work without desire but in time 1 Doing work without desire, unsatisfactorily, with lot of mental pressure & not in time2Not starting any work in his/her own responsibility, doing little work very slow3 Does not have any initiation & not want to work even after pressure4 d) Fatigue Normal 0 Patient likes to stand in comparison to walk 1 Patient likes sit in comparison to stand 2 Patient likes to lie down in comparison with sitting3 Patient likes to sleep in comparison with lying down4 e) Muscle ache No 0 Relieved by rest 1 Not relieved by rest.

Discussion: Thyroid hormones stimulate diverse metabolic activities in most tissues, leading to an increase in basal metabolic rate, may be playing the role of Kayagni, which possess its Amshas (components) and influence all over the body.[7] A role of the gut bacteria is to assist in converting inactive T4 into the active form of thyroid hormone T3. About 20% of T4 is converted to T3 in the gastrointestinal tract, in the form of T3 sulfate (T3S) and tri-iodoacetic acid (T3AC). The conversion of T3S and T3AC into active T3 requires an enzyme called Intestinal sulfatase. This intestinal sulfatase is released from healthy gut bacteria. Intestinal dysbiosis, an imbalance between pathogenic and beneficial bacteria in the gut, significantly reduces the conversion of T3S and T3AC toT3.[8] All of these connections make it clear that one can't have a healthy thyroid without a healthy gut and vice versa. Fixing the gut is the foremost step to achieve a healthy thyroid.

Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa Linn.) owing to its Shothahara property is an excellent remedy for treating generalized oedematous condition and its roots are reputed to be diuretic and laxative. [9-10] Devadaru is Kapha vata shamaka Agni deepana property.[13] the Gandamala. Acharya Sushruta has indicated Guggulu in Shotha[14] that is one of the most commonly observed clinical manifestation in cases of hypothyroidism. It acts on Medo vaha srotas and does Lekhana karma (desiccation), thus might be helpful in managing obesity which is a common presentation of hypothyroidism. It also possess anti-inflammatory property.[15] Animal studies have reported a ketosteroid isolated from oleoresin of Guggulu showed a strong thyroid stimulatory action.[16] It is also found to have anti- oxidant effect because of Gugglusterone that counters digestive functions) is the causative factor as well as one of the consequences of Hypothyroidism. It leads to the formation of Ama, which initiates auto-immune responses in the body. Trikatu through its Deepana properties,[19] help in maintaining Agni, thus preventing further formation of Ama. Triphala supports healthy digestion and absorption. [20] It is a powerful antioxidant, protect cells from the damage of free radicals.[20] Constipation, a symptom in Hypothyroidism, can impair hormone clearance and can elevate oestrogen levels, which in turn raises thyroid binding globulin levels and decrease the levels of thyroid hormones in the body.[8] Triphala can prove to be beneficial in avoiding constipation, thus help in maintaining physiological levels of thyroid hormones. Vitamin-C is an active component of Devadaru and Amalaki.[21-22] Studies have shown that natural antioxidants such as vitamin-C can reverse thyroid damage by optimizing functions of thyroid.[23] Thyroid gland need Vitamin-C to keep it healthy.[24] Effect of therapy on Thyroid profile also validates the role of Agni and vitamin-C (Table 5). 38 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports, July-Sept 34-39Table 5: Effect of therapy on Thyroid to the malfunctioning of Agni and Ama; and the ingredients of trial drugs helps in repairing them; Samata (association with Ama) and Strotorodha (obstruction in channels) might have got cleared that pacified symptoms of Hypothyroidism by maintaining physiological thyroid profiles. Improved Agni might have helped in optimizing the function of thyroid gland thus yielding positive results not only in the subjective parameters, but also on the objective parameters of Hypothyroidism. Conclusion: This was a single case study that validated the efficacy of Triphaladya guggulu and Punarnavadi kashaya in the management of Hypothyroidism. Though Thyroxine was discontinued, the symptoms were under control with the current trail drugs. As the observations are encouraging, there is a need to evaluate actual impact of the trial drugs in larger number of patients and draw more concrete conclusions. Awareness regarding Ayurveda is to be drawn among the masses so that a maximum number of sufferers can utilize the services and have the benefit of an enhanced quality of life.
