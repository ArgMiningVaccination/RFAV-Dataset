Ledtke, MD Infectious Disease Consultants Munson Medical CenterVaccines Among the most important public health interventions in history WHO estimates that vaccines prevent about 2-3 million deaths each year Historically vaccines have dramatically reduced the incidence of infections and made a substantial contribution to the increase in life expectancy from ~47 to about 80 in developed nations within the past century Vaccination -Our World in DataImmunization coverage (who.int) Vaccines: Science, health, longevity, and wealth | PNASVaccines | Background Innate versus adaptive immunity Innate immunity is composed of structures and cells which are already present (physical and chemical barriers, phagocytes, plasma proteins, neutrophils) Innate immunity is faster to respond, less specific, less potent No memory component Evolutionarily old, present in both vertebrates and non vertebrates Visible with local inflammatory response to cut or scrape Difference between Innate and Adaptive Immunity (microbiologyinfo.com)Vaccines | Background Innate versus adaptive immunity Adaptive immunity is composed mainly of B and T lymphocytes Slower , more specific, more potent Significant memory component Evolutionarily new, present only in vertebrates Not appreciable typically because if it works, nothing happens Difference between Innate and Adaptive Immunity (microbiologyinfo.com)Vaccines | Background Vaccines work by priming the body's adaptive immune response to respond to a foreign invader with the speed of innate immunity The goal is to develop pre -formed B -cells, T -cells and antibodies which can respond quickly when activated This requires exposure of the innate immune system to a foreign protein (antigen)Vaccines | Types of Vaccines Live, attenuated vaccines Weakened living organisms, good immune response, possibility of active infection (examples: MMR, varicella, some types of influenza) Inactivated or killed vaccines Inactivated or killed organisms (examples: Hepatitis A and inactivated Polio) Viral vector vaccines A separate virus (like adenovirus) is used as a vessel to get the antigenic protein into the body and presented to the immune system (examples: Ebola, HIV (previous trials) and certain COVID -19 vaccines ) COVID -19 Clinical Resources | COVID -19 Resource Center -American College of Chest Physicians (chestnet.org)Vaccines | Types of Vaccines Protein subunit vaccines Contain only parts of the virus or bacteria (typically antibody targets) and not the whole organism, safe, less immunogenic (examples: Hepatitis B, acellular pertussis) Conjugate vaccines Antigen combines with a polysaccharide to improve immunity and recognize this polysaccharide coating down the road (examples: HiBand Pneumococcal conjugate) Toxoid vaccines Presenting a weakened version of the toxin (toxoid) rather than the organism itself (examples: diphtheria and tetanus in TDaP ) COVID -19 Clinical Resources | COVID -19 Resource Center -American College of Chest Physicians (chestnet.org)Vaccines | Background Multiple different ways to expose the immune system to antigenic protein Most vaccines require production and processing of an antigenic protein outside of the body and in such a format that it will be taken up by antigen presenting cells and recognized by the cellular immune response A new type of vaccine called a nucleic acid vaccine uses fragments of mRNA to produce an adaptive immune response by inducing the host cells to produce copies of the target antigen COVID -19 Clinical Resources | COVID -19 Resource Center -American College of Chest Physicians (chestnet.org)Vaccines | Background How mRNA vaccines work Utilize the host cells own protein producing mechanism (ribosomes within the cell cytoplasm) to make an antigenic protein representing a specific pathogen (COVID - 19 spike protein) This is presented to APCs on the cell surface as a foreign protein and spike protein specific antibodies are produced How do mRNA vaccines work? | Covid -19 vaccination explained (naturalsciences.ch)Vaccines | Background How mRNA vaccines work Multiple benefits to this platform including: mRNA is very unstable and degrades quickly in the body (via ribonuclease or RNases) Does not enter nucleus hence does not in any way alter host genome Side effects are quite minimal How do mRNA vaccines work? | Covid -19 vaccination explained (naturalsciences.ch) mRNA Messenger RNA has been studied for decades as medical therapy The idea of teaching the body to make a specific protein was an intriguing notion (EPO, insulin etc.) Major difficulties with mRNA frailty as well as a vessel for cell delivery has stymied scientists for years Example: mRNA is a negatively charged macromolecule and needs to cross an anionic cell membrane to be effective Vaccines Development and Approval Process Typical vaccine development timeline takes 5 -10 years and sometimes longer Assess whether the vaccine is safe and effective in clinical trials Complete regulatory approval process Manufacture sufficient quantity of vaccine doses for widespread distribution Before the COVID -19 outbreak, the fastest a vaccine went through this process was MMR in 4 years (1963 to 1967 Dr. Maurice Hilleman) Vaccine Research & Development -Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (jhu.edu)Vaccines | Traditional Approval Process Typical vaccine development timeline takes 5 -10 years and sometimes longer The review process assesses whether the vaccine is safe and effective in clinical trials Preclinical trials for vaccine candidates initially in animal models assessing safety and efficacy (1 -10 years) Phase 1 Trials typically in small amounts of healthy volunteers assessing short -term safety and immune responses, often with variable dosages (1 -10 years) Phase 2 Trials involve larger number of study subjects and a more diverse population, may include a target population. Safety and immune response are assessed (2 -3 years) Phase 3 Trials involve tens of thousands of study subjects in a placebo versus control randomized prospective fashion, also assesses longer term safety in a larger population (2 -4 years) Vaccine Research & Development -Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (jhu.edu)Vaccines | Expedited Development & Approval So how was it that a brand -new vaccine was developed and approved in less than a year? COVID -19 identified as a new illness in China on December 31, 2019 Identified for the first time on US soil in a non traveler on January 18, 2020 COVID -19 genome sequenced January 31, 2020 US Department of Health and Human Services started a program called Operation Warp Speed in an attempt to expedite a COVID -19 vaccine on March 30, 2020 First COVID -19 vaccine is approved for emergency use in the US on December 10, 2020 (Pfizer/BioNTech), December 17 for Moderna Mass vaccination of US citizens begins December 14, 2020Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalYears of previous research on related viruses Enormous funding allowing pharmaceutical companies to run multiple trials in parallel Regulators moving much faster than normal The lightning -fast quest for COVID vaccines \u2014and what it means for other diseases (nature.com)Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalResearchers have been paying attention to related coronaviruses (SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012) and vaccines development had begun on both of these pathogens before their outbreaks dissipated For example, researchers already knew the spike protein was the ideal target and what form of the spike protein produced the best immune response Intense research over the 20 -25 years before the COVID -19 pandemic involved nucleic acid vaccines with major breakthroughs in the 10 years prior Much of this was on cancer vaccines but also for HIV, malaria and Ebola If the COVID -19 pandemic had occurred 5 years earlier, these platforms would not have been ready The lightning -fast quest for COVID vaccines \u2014and what it means for other diseases (nature.com)Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalEnormous funding allowing pharmaceutical companies to run multiple trials in parallel Typical vaccine development is a major financial risk for a pharmaceutical company as they could pour millions into development for an ineffective vaccine For COVID -19 the financial risk was taken on by public funding and private philanthropists Companies could now gamble on starting large -scale testing and manufacturing of vaccine candidates that might not work out Much of this was motivated by the enormous financial devastation which was being brought on by the pandemic OWS saw public investment of 10 billion, the largest government stimulus package to the pharmaceutical industry in US history The lightning -fast quest for COVID vaccines \u2014and what it means for other diseases (nature.com)Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalRegulators moving much faster than normal There has been no relaxation of the stringent criteria for vaccine approval Early vaccine candidates approved under emergency use, which requires close follow -up monitoring for side effects and efficacy The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, a global program setup in 2012 was crucial for sharing information, reaching consensus on issues such as end -points for vaccine trials, and standardizing the monitoring of side effects during roll out COVID vaccines: the world's medical regulators need access to open data (nature.com) The lightning -fast quest for COVID vaccines \u2014and what it means for other diseases (nature.com)Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalOther factors Remember that Phase 3 trials are looking at efficacy in tens of thousands of patients prospectively to determine risk of disease Because the incidence of COVID -19 was so high worldwide, robust data on efficacy could be assessed rapidly even in relatively small cohorts due to the sheer ubiquity of the virus The lightning -fast quest for COVID vaccines \u2014and what it means for other diseases (nature.com)Vaccines | Expedited Development & ApprovalNon mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines | J & J Now over 50 vaccines being used worldwide, most of which are not nucleic acid vaccines Johnson and Johnson COVID -19 vaccine was approved by the FDA under emergency use in February of 2021 Adenovirus vector vaccine, the third vaccine achieving EUA in the US Requires fewer injections that mRNA vaccines and is easier to store and transport Benefitted from previous research on Adenovirus vectors as well as OWS funding Covid -19 Vaccine Tracker: Latest Updates -The New York Times (nytimes.com)Non mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines | Astrazeneca Astrazeneca produced a viral vector COVID -19 vaccine which showed good efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials in November of 2020 and received emergency use from the WHO in February 2021. This company also benefitted from years of previous research on their vector (a chimpanzee adenovirus) as well as funding from OWS Did not require deep freeze like mRNA so able to transport easier and distribute to undeveloped nations Never applied for US FDA approval as well -established vaccines were being widely distributed in the US by the time this application would have been submitted Covid -19 Vaccine Tracker: Latest Updates -The New York COVID -19 Vaccines | Novavax Novavax , produced by a US based company and achieving FDA approval for use in adults in July 2022, the fourth COVID -19 vaccine to be approved This is a protein subunit vaccine utilizing harvested spike proteins assembled onto a lipid nanoparticle Relatively new technology which the company calls a \"recombinant nanoparticle vaccine\" Fairly low uptake due to delayed approval Covid -19 Vaccine Tracker: Latest Updates -The New York Times (nytimes.com) Vaccine E fficacy | Pfizer -BioNtech / Moderna Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have very similar data Initial Phase 3 clinical data showed 95% efficacy for disease prevention against ancestral strain We know now that this wanes with time and requires booster doses Against new variants the exact efficacy is unknown particularly for the Omicron specific booster (bivalent) Available data shows 4 -fold higher level of neutralizing antibodies in those with an Omicron specific booster compared to those without CDC is conducting long -term studies of the bivalent booster to determine real -world effectiveness including to more recent strains of Omicron subvariants Comparing the COVID -19 Vaccines: How Are They Different?
