To that end, we have established four divisions: (1) Division of Genomic Medicine, (2) Division of Human Immunology, (3) Division of Disease Systems Biology, and (4) Division of Cancer Immunology. These groups work together to promote state-of-the-art research. We apply multi-omics analyses across the hierarchy of genome, gene expressions, proteins, lipids, cells, tissues, and individuals by utilizing computational methods of data analysis, combining statistics and AI technology. We also have established a platform that will allow us to better understand the results obtained in experimental animals and apply them to human immunology research, and to elucidate mechanisms of human pathology using experimental systems such as cell and animal models. Further, we are utilizing these infrastructures to develop next generation research.
