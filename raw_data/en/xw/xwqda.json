Acupuncture is commonly referred through the court systems for DWI because it decreases cravings for alcohol and drugs, reduces withdrawal systems, relieves tension and anxiety which occurs when trying to stop using alcohol and drugs, and helps with relaxation. These treatments can clear the mind, increase energy and help gain a sense of well-being. Please note: Acupuncture is not a substitute for traditional treatments through your primary care provider, but rather best used in conjunction with 12-step programs and primary care.

Guided Imagery Guided imagery, sometimes called \"guided meditation,\" \"visualization,\" \"mental rehearsal,\" or \"guided self-hypnosis,\" is a gentle but powerful technique that focuses the mind and imagination in proactive, positive ways that calm the body. Studies show that mindful-based programs may provide viable and effective interventions targeting high stress levels, anxiety, sleep quality, and autonomic balance. Healing Warriors Program uses Belleruth Naparstek's AM, ACSW, Guided Imagery, which is currently used in over 80 VAMC's and Veteran centers, at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital and U.S. military bases, hospitals and installations around the world.
