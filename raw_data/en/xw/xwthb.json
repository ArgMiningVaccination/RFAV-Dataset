{"title": "Medical Assistance", "author": "U S Mission Austria", "url": "https://at.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/", "hostname": "usembassy.gov", "description": null, "sitename": "U.S. Embassy in Austria", "date": "2023-07-27", "cleaned_text": "of a medical emergency in Austria, dial 144 for ambulance service. The Europe-wide emergency number is 112. The German word for hospital is \"Krankenhaus.\" Medical care in Austria: Austria has world-class health care. Most doctors and nurses speak English, especially in hospital emergency rooms. Support staff may only speak German, especially in rural areas. Scroll down for a list of English-speaking private doctors. IMPORTANT MEDICAL AND INSURANCE TOP POINTS: - NEVER TRAVEL ABROAD WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE AND REQUIRED MEDICATIONS! - MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS DO NOT PROVIDE COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES! - Most private U.S. health insurance policies provide limited or no coverage outside of the United States. - Austrian hospitals and medical providers do NOT accept U.S. insurance policies - patients must pay up-front, out-of-pocket. - Consider purchasing medical evacuation insurance (medevac); a chartered air ambulance from Europe to the United States can cost up to $100,000 and is rarely covered by insurance. - Bring at least one extra week's supply of prescription medication. Before you travel, consider your insurance needs and confirm what your insurance plan will and will not cover. Every year, Consular Section Vienna receives reports of U.S. citizens who were hospitalized (or died) in Austria without medical or travel insurance, leaving them or their loved ones saddled with debt. What the U.S. Embassy can and cannot do The U.S. government does not provide medical care or insurance for U.S. citizens overseas. U.S. Embassies and Consulates do not pay medical bills or unexpected cost, do not negotiate bills or payment plans on behalf of patients, do not provide medical evacuation transportation, and do not provide translation services. We cannot intervene in the decisions of Austrian hospitals or doctors regarding medical treatment, release, or clearance to travel. U.S. Embassy Vienna can assist you by providing a list of medical providers or other resources, explaining options, and providing consular services such as issuing emergency U.S. passports. In the unfortunate case involving the [death of a U.S. citizen in Austria](https://at.usembassy.gov/death-of-a-u-s-citizen/), we can assist in issuing a Consular Report of Death Abroad, refer family to funeral homes and provide guidance in repatriating body or cremated remains to the United States. Austrian medical billing and health insurance In general, medical care in Austria is significantly cheaper than in the United States. U.S. citizens who are legal residents of Austria and hold a valid \"E-card\" (Austrian national healthcare program) qualify for free or greatly reduced medical care and prescription drugs. U.S. visitors may face significant and unexpected up-front, out-of-pocket costs. Except in very rare circumstances, Austrian hospitals and medical providers do not accept U.S. insurance policies. Patients or their family are expected to pay the provider directly at the time of treatment by cash, credit cards or wire transfer. In the case of a hospitalization, patients may be required to pay a deposit upfront, which can be 500 Euros or more depending on the circumstances. Upon discharge, patients must settle any outstanding bills. Save all your receipts and ask for English translations of important documents including diagnosis and bills. Upon return to the United States, you must file reimbursement claims directly with your U.S. health insurance provider. For more information on insurance providers overseas, please visit the [State Department travel website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). Financial difficulties: Austrian hospitals will never withhold life-saving or urgent medical treatment due to lack of finances. If you are having financial difficulties, we recommend first reaching out to family and friends for assistance. Consider getting funds wired via Western Union or similar service. Most hospitals and doctors accept credit cards. If you have a credit card, contact the issuing bank and request a credit line increase. Many credit cards offer travel insurance as a card holder benefit - if you paid for your trip to Austria by credit card, contact the issuing bank to determine if you qualify for any benefits. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist in negotiating bills or payment plans. \"Fit to Fly\" - traveling after hospitalization: After hospitalization, Austrian doctors will determine whether a patient is well enough to travel on a long commercial flight back to the United States without medical assistance. Airlines may require you to present a \"Fit to Fly\" letter issued by the treating physician. U.S. Embassy Vienna cannot intervene if medical providers determine a patient is too ill to fly on commercial aircraft. Medical evacuation: If a patient is deemed too ill to travel by commercial airline, the treating physician may require the patient to return via an air ambulance. A medical air evacuation (medevac) is a chartered jet with on-board medical equipment and personnel. An air ambulance flight from Europe to the United States can cost up to $100,000 and is rarely covered by typical US health or travel insurance policies. Bringing and finding medication: For more information on bringing medication to Austria, visit the Austrian health ministry website: [Bringing medication to Austria](https://www.sozialministerium.at/en/Topics/Health/Information-for-travellers/Bringing-medication-to-Austria.html). Common over-the-counter medications can be purchased at an \"Apotheke\" (pharmacies). Apotheken can be identified by a green cross. The International Pharmacy in downtown Vienna across from the Imperial Hotel has English speaking pharmacists but can only dispense Rx medication with an Austrian doctor's prescription: [https://www.internationale-apotheke.at/en](https://www.internationale-apotheke.at/en). Obtaining prescription medication in Austria can be challenging. Patients generally require an Austrian doctor's prescription. Many drugs that are legal in the United States are illegal in Austria. It is also generally illegal to mail prescription medication from the United States to Austria. If you run out of required medication and cannot obtain a refill in Austria, we strongly urge you to cut your trip short and return to the United States. English-Speaking Doctors Here follows a list of English-speaking doctors practicing in Austria who are known to the Embassy. The listing is not intended as all-inclusive or as an exclusive list of recommended medical practitioners. The list is intended solely to provide interested U.S. citizens with a convenient form of information and/or a quick reference in emergency situations. The order of listing has no significance. In case of emergency, the ambulance service can be reached in Austria calling 144. The Europe wide emergency number is 112. If a doctor's services are required, please look in the Austrian telephone directory [www.herold.at](http://www.herold.at/) under \"\u00c4rzte.\" Larger towns have a hospital listed under \"Krankenhaus.\" The emergency doctor service (nights and weekends) is141. Although the doctors and medical groups listed below have been selected with care, the Embassy cannot assume responsibility for their professional ability and integrity and has no control over the professional fees they charge. Private medical practitioners in Austria establish their own fees. Furthermore, they will not settle fee claims directly with U.S. insurance companies. Therefore, the U.S. citizen patient will be expected to pay his bill at the time of treatment/consultation. The patient may thereafter present his paid bill to his U.S. insurance carrier, if any, for reimbursement. Medicare is not valid for medical expenses in Austria. [Air Ambulance/Med-Evac](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html)- The US State Department's list of air ambulance services for U.S. citizens needing medical flights from abroad to the USA. Health Conditions Public Health Conditions in Austria are excellent. The level of community sanitation in Vienna and other cities in Austria meets or exceeds that of most large U.S. cities. Disease incidence and type are similar to that seen in the major cities of Western Europe and the United States. At the present time, air pollution is not a major health problem in Vienna. Water in Austria is pure and safe to drink. All milk sold in Austria is pasteurized. Tick Borne Encephalitis (ETB) In certain parts of Austria and Central Europe, there is a danger of contracting encephalitis from viruses carried by several common tick species. While not all ticks carry the TBE virus, those that do are frequently found in wooded, low lying areas, such as the Wiener Wald. An excellent vaccine against TBE has been developed in Austria and is highly effective. It is strongly recommended for all persons who live in and around Vienna and expect to enjoy outdoor activities, such as walking and jogging, in infested areas.
