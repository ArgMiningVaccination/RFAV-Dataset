You can't expect young people to mimic their parents, if only because in our society there are too many other models competing for attention. This Encounter looks at various ways members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Melbourne are teaching the meaning of Judaism - and a dynamic, living faith - to a new generation. What does Orthodox Judaism have to say to young people in our society? How can these insights be communicated effectively? What do young people need to know about their religious tradition?", "sitename": "ABC Radio National", "date": "2001-06-09", "cleaned_text": "Generation Yurkowicz My name is Rabbi Shimshon Yurkowicz from Chabad House, Malvern. I'm an emissary from the Lubavitcher Rebbe and I've been in Malvern for the last fourteen years. Coffey He wears a distinctive black outfit and is strictly observant of religious laws. Rabbi Yurkowicz is a Lubavitcher, like Joseph Gutnick of football fame. They're energetic and evangelical, their total commitment incorporates middle class lifestyle, and their numbers are growing within Jewish communities. Among Melbourne's Jews, the ultra-orthodox, mostly Lubavitch, account for 30 per cent of the community. Yurkowicz When we started I probably knew 3 or 4 people ..we've actually created and I use the example, when you bring a little bit of light all the darkness is dispelled. We came and brought a product, genuine what Judaism is, an opportunity to pray, an opportunity to learn, an opportunity growth. People have come, people have learned. Coffey Instead of three or four people in the neighbourhood, Rabbi Yurkowicz now knows hundreds, people attracted to Chabad House by the rigor and authority of this kind of observant Judaism. Of course not all of them, not even the majority, have adopted the same level of rigorousness observed by Rabbi Yurkowicz, but it is clear on Saturdays, just from the surrounding streets, that the Law and the texts it is derived from, have crept back in to the lives of many people who had once put them aside or, more likely, had never really known them. FX Children at Bat Mitzvah class Yurkowicz Not everybody will be religious, not everybody will be a scholar, people are different and as a result of that their needs are different. We are sitting now in a childcare centre which we start with children when they are very young and we give them the love, the feeling, the genuine commitment and feeling that Judaism is beautiful and alive and well. We have lots of other programs, we have Talmud Torah, we have various after-school classes, we have post bar and bat mitzvah classes, we have adult education in the evening and we have one-to-ones during the day also - for anybody who wants to take out some time to learn they give us a call and we organise for someone to learn with them. It happens in various offices and businesses where a couple of people get together and they take an hour off - lunch and learn - so all these things create that opportunity for people at different levels at different times and at different expressions for them to grow in Judaism. Coffey Rabbi Yurkowicz has nine children of his own, ranging in age from 17 years to just a month or so, so his interest is not only in educational enterprise for the local community but in the education of his own children. Like all parents he is faced with the challenge of handing on identity, values, beliefs, faith. Even though the Yurkowicz family is consciously different and set apart from aspects of our society, there is nothing inevitable about the identity or faith of its children. Education must be a means by which they are apprenticed to Jewish life, inculcated with Jewishness. Yurkowicz There's no question that I pray to God that my children - that they should grow up committed to the same ideals and beliefs. Within the Jewish experience, there are lots of things we do together as families so therefore they are actually experiencing -it's not just I am telling you to do this, I'm telling you to do that and when the child does something the parents don't want, uh go to the rabbi, he'll tell you why, or you know the Bible says so. But if they actually see that it means a lot to me and I am living by, or I am trying to, hopefully that will give them the strength that they should have the same commitment and the ideology. The challenges today are very different from what they were 50 or 60 years ago and as a result of it we have to put more effort in to it. Coffey For 70 per cent of Melbourne's Jewish children, Jewish day schools are where they learn about Jewish identity and the religion at its heart - not always as a supplement to their learning at home. As every immigrant community knows, home steadily loses its capacity to teach tradition as it becomes removed from the immigrant generation. Other places of learning, other kinds of learning become important. You can see this in the way religiosity and religious education have been changing in the Jewish community. FX Lamdeni class Liberow I am Motte Liberow. We have come to learn of the great need to offer something to the children, especially the children from the Israeli families. Even though they might not be observant or as committed as others, they find it very important to maintain that identity and we are here to help them because we feel that the main reason why people may not be 100 per cent affiliated to a community or not practice the customs and traditions of the Torah, is mainly because of ignorance and as a result of ignorance they sometimes don't feel comfortable. If you bring it on a silver platter and you make it accessible to them, you make it easy, you make it exciting, you make it fun, they take it up very much. FX Lamdeni class Coffey Motte Liberow's independent organisation, Lamdeni, runs after school classes for children at state schools, many of them from recently arrived immigrant families. Liberow The philosophy that guides us is the philosophy of the Torah, Orthodox Judaism as inspired by the vision and the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He always used to say that you don't push away darkness with a stick. You push it away by lighting a candle so we are here in the business of lighting little candles. Coffey It's a business that requires a kind of imaginative vigilance. Liberow The main challenge that the teachers face when they pass on that lesson is to come up every single time with hands on activities, fun games, excursions, anything that might get the child interested, involved, excited and enjoy. FX Lamdeni class Liberow As we say it is right on the dollar, in the American dollar where it says \"In God We Trust\". When we want to teach our children ideals and morals that are absolute, we must found them and base them on morals which come from heaven, morals that are not made by men and cannot be changed by humans. Everything is guided and directed by God's will as described in the Torah. FX Men at prayer at Yeshiva Yurkowicz The challenge in today's day and age is when we have so many competing interests how to be able to develop a yearning by the child that will cause a commitment when they grow up. One of the methods that we incorporate, that we try to incorporate, is that the teachers should be a living example. Learning is not just for the sake of knowledge or intellect but rather it is living, being a living example and giving over that message that I really believe in what I am saying and that I have the commitment and the joy and the enthusiasm. We are talking about God, we're talking about a purpose in life and a meaning in life. Coffey And to communicate that you need teachers who model Jewish religious identity. FX Sound of Bat Mitzvah class at Chabad House. Coffey At Rabbi Yurkowicz's Chabad House, Elke Goldberg teaches girls preparing for their Bat Mitzvah, the rite of passage ceremony at the age of twelve. Goldberg It's really just religious enrichment classes to make them aware of their responsibilities and heritage as a Jewish woman. We spend some time looking at the Jewish life cycle so the girls see how Judaism views the different um the cycle of a person's life (don't cry sweetie). We also look at the Jewish year. It's giving them in a sense an awareness of Jewish practice, Jewish traditions and the meaning behind them. It also gives them Jewish history starting with Biblical history like where they are coming from and you know what it is all about because otherwise it is pretty meaningless. If it is just a ritual or just another excuse for a party, it is just another excuse for a party, that is not what it is all about. Coffey Sometimes Elke brings the girls home so that they can see how comprehensively her orthodox life is lived. For them it is an encounter with the law, the halacha. The girls meet her baby daughter and her 22 month old son who already knows, through ritual, that God is connected to everyday experience. Goldberg He's like a sponge and whatever you give him he'll give back to you. You know we're trying and we're very pleased thank God with his progress .. because you see he knows himself like, I would give him any piece of food and at his age most people are not even particular with it and hopefully you know with my next I will have that time to give. Anything you give him or if he wants something he will start saying the blessing because he knows that that way he is going to get it. FX Elke says grace with her son.. Goldberg So how will I translate it? Blessed are you Lord O God, king of the universe, that everything was created through his word. It's like you are not taking for granted that the food belongs to you .. you know that it came from God and you are thanking him. Before you even take it you are acknowledging that you know you are taking it came from someone. Coffey Elke's students, many of them, will say this blessing for the first time at the age of twelve. They will learn to frame at least their lessons with prayers like the morning prayer. They will go away from the Bat Mitzvah classes with rituals to define a Jewish religious identity. Coffey The girls who come to you would come, I imagine, from various backgrounds, and many of them not observant. Goldberg Mostly not from very observant homes. I think most people do want to know, a lot of people who don't much, it is not something they are happy about, they want more religious literacy, they want to know things and sometimes people don't know things and they want their children to have more than they do. They can't answer their children themselves so they send them to people they think they might be able to. I think most people really are looking for more. Coffey Even the way you present yourself must be a kind of a challenge to some girls. They grow up in a world where young women wear makeup and dress in a very contemporary style. Goldberg I do wear makeup. Coffey You do when you meet them? Do you wear long dresses always? Goldberg I do wear, my skirts always cover my knee. That's fine in that my skirts always cover my knee [speaks in Yiddish] I will always dress modestly, that is I will always have sleeves, I will always be wearing a skirt, I will always cover my knee, always cover my hair but I wear a wig it's not an unusual thing, people within the community know that there is that segment of the community who dress that way so it is not something that is completely foreign to them even though they don't dress that way themselves, they know that there are people who do. Coffey It is a truism to say it but it is her observance of Jewish religious law that makes Elke different. FX Sound of choir from Temple Beth Israel Coffey For the fifteen to twenty per cent of Melbourne's Jewish community who call themselves progressive, religious law warrants a different kind of relationship. Rabbi Aviva Bass, at Melbourne's Temple Beth Israel, embodies it: the orthodox don't ordain women! Rabbi Bass comes from a Progressive category called Reconstructionist. Bass I would say that it doesn't appeal to me. I just have different values from orthodoxy .. they're are coming from a completely different premise about halacha, about what Jewish law is. For them the written and oral Torah,what they would consider the oral tradition, are not to be questioned, and they are all of divine origin. Reconstructionists don't come with that premise. Reconstructionist Jews see halacha as evolving, an evolving process in which humans have been involved and actually specifically men until very, very recently, exclusively men have been involved, and that has always been an evolving process whereas orthodox tend to see it really given as is. . Coffey This has implications for the progressives' approach to religious education - take post Bar and Bat Mitzvah teenagers. Bass This is an issue in most synagogues that trying to retain the kids post bar and bat mitzvah .. to retain their energy and enthusiasm, it's often very difficult. For us we try to involve them in both social and education programs. I think you are aware of the Dee and Emm group that we run here, the deep and meaningful group. For us it is very important that people be able to blossom at their own levels, and come at the educational experience from own value system, from their own societal environment and so on and that really informs how they are going to look at the text. Coffey Laurance Splitter who doubles as the teenage discussion group leader, and cantor, is known for his involvement with the Philosophy for Children movement. Splitter It is well known that many young people don't feel particularly close to Jewish life and the synagogue and so on, so I didn't see much point in saying now we're going to sit down and do specifically Jewish things because I don't think they would be interested, or at least not at the beginning. The very fact that it is a bunch of Jewish people sitting around in a sense makes it a Jewish activity and it is more important for me or from my point of view that I get these kids thinking about issues that matter to them. Coffey Topics like drugs, for example, cloning, these are on the D and M agenda. Splitter We've also talked about war, we've talked a little about the Middle East, which of course is terribly troubling to many of us. I've tried in all these situations to get them to understand the need for something like empathy you know, to put yourself in the other person's position and I remember one person in our groups saying - it struck me very, very strongly - look, she would really like to be able to put herself in the position of a Palestinian parent who watched her son killed, you know, by Israel soldiers and she knows that if she could put herself in that position she would feel really bad and probably hate full towards, you know, the Israelis, but she can't so she doesn't .. and we had a big discussion about that idea that you can't put yourself in certain peoples' positions and to me of course being able to - well to do that, that notion of empathy is terribly important in any kind of ethical discussion. It was in many ways a Jewish topic; it was always a topic that generalizes because there is war and conflict going on all the time all over the place and we talked about the second world war and so on and so forth, but at the same time it enables us to practice and become familiar with one of those tools of thinking and of enquiry, namely empathy. By and large our kids will be subject to and exposed to all kinds of different subjects.. you can keep them wrapped up in cotton wool. some of our communities do that .. for most of our kids that is not realistic .. will be exposed to things that are not very nice ... My approach is to say what we need to do is to inoculate .. so they can respond to different pressures ... Judaism has tremendous amount to offer ... parents have minds of their own .. not clones .. so they may not be precisely the people the parents want them to be ... still want them .. far more important to give them right just don't work for them. Coffey Nevertheless, says Rabbi Bass, Progressive Jews are also bound to honour the command to study Torah. And it's a command not just for the specialists, but for individuals. Bass It's not only justifiable it is actually what we consider a mitzvah,a commandment to pass on Jewish knowledge .. it's called Talmud Torah .. Torah study .. all parents need to be open .. not only that we educators need to do that for the entire community. People actually get indoctrinated by whatever their surrounds .. we'd rather .. but one of those values in progressive Judaism is to make those decisions based on informed choices so we give them the info to be able to make those choice .. so that is a progressive value as well, the value of choice. Coffey So in other words you're saying that there is no reason why religious values should be particularly suspect .. on the other hand a kind of freedom ... Bass Yes .. we're all influenced by our environmental factors ... important to surround people of all ages with values we agree with ..We seek to educate people of all ages .. family education programming .. only through this, actually teaching parents as well .. everyone is on the same page. FX Music bridge Coffey One of the features of the new interest in Jewish religious identity is the rise of Torah study. In orthodox and ultra-orthodox circles, both, there is a burgeoning of study groups, a hunger for helpful literature and tapes. Torah study seems necessary in a new kind of way. Pinchuk Moshe Pinchuk. I was brought out here from Israel to provide a program for the children of the community here who have been to Israel after high school. They've learnt a year there, Jewish Studies, and when they come back here they just want to continue further their Jewish Studies. An institute has been opened here which is called Yeshivat or Mizrachi. The word Yeshiva means basically a place where one sits and learns Jewish studies. Coffey Moshe Pinchuk belongs to the Mizrachi religious Zionist movement to which traditionally Melbourne's communal leaders have aligned themselves. Pinchuk The people we have coming in to this institute come from very, very different backgrounds. We have many students who aren't practicing Jews at all, they are either tentatively interested in becoming practicing or they are interested in Judaism as a culture, as their past, to know where they are coming from or perhaps even to know why they are not practicing. On the other hand you have people who indeed are practicing Jews and there is a whole gradient of levels, what do you mean practicing, what level, how strict, how pedantic, and they are either interested in gaining more knowledge of the practice and then they would be treating this institute as a how to manual, what am I supposed to do, but I would say that is a vast minority and in fact most of the lectures here aren't how to perform this or that command but it is more what is the legal structure of the various commands, what is the meaning of different texts, so legally it is geared towards filling up these legal boxes with I guess what you would call some heart meaning. Coffey Those legal boxes might be given, in Rabbi Bass' terms, but nevertheless they are open to scrutiny, and to reality. Pinchuk I mean Halacha has always been dynamic. If you want any legal system to be able to develop and cope with reality as it changes that system has to have built in with it some type of mechanisms that allow it to develop with it. In Judaism, probably any religion, this very statement is extremely problematic because any religion would believe that its laws are divine laws and how can they change, and if it is eternal then reality should defer to the laws rather than the opposite. But in practice it doesn't work in any religion and that is a fascinating subject in itself: what mechanisms does Judaism have to allow it to cope with reality as it changes. The Reforms and the conservative they also are coping with this problem of reality changing, but rather than trying to justify it within the framework of halacha, they say OK so these laws are defunct, we'll just erase them, take different ones. That's a luxury that we can't allow ourselves. Coffey The alternative is to explore the dynamism of the law. That's what has been happening in orthodox circles in Melbourne within the context of preparing girls for their Bat Mitzvah. Religious education becomes a place to explore the texts to discover new possibilities within the Law. Karp OK. My name is Adina Karp. I've been married three years, my name was formerly Bankia. I guess I'd probably be described as Orthodox but as to what group, that kind of thing, I guess I'll keep the title nice and neutral. Coffey Adina Karp has been active in this kind of exploration. Karp I guess what Orthodox women of certain groups have done is reinvestigate what is enshrined in tradition and what is enshrined in law. What we are challenged with now is to separate out what we have done just because we have always done it from the things we have done because they are law. Ten years ago a little bit after my Bat Mitzvah, it would have been a nice little speech at home in front of a bunch of parents; it may have involved some learning but it was relatively uncommon; nice little party. Coffey You wouldn't have read from the Torah? Karp No, it wasn't done in Melbourne at that time, gosh no! What I've actually started doing with several girls and it has happened over the last couple of years is, for about a year or a couple of months leading up to their Bat Mitzvahs, I learn with mother and daughter. The uniqueness of having a motherdaughter scenario is that traditionally Judaism was something that was passed on from parent to child, it's only when people got far more involved in the workforce that removed them from the home that education had to be relegated to teachers as opposed to parents. And I guess what ideally as educators we try to do is to reintroduce the concept of parent as teacher, as well. Coffey Adina prepared Elly Tamir for her Bat Mitzvah. Karp What I did with Elly for about 12 months before her Bat Mitzvah was I learnt with her and her mother and then after that she chose that one of the ways she would celebrate her Bat Mitzvah was by reading from the Torah in a women's only prayer group and I prepared her for that, taught her the cantillation, the singing, the script which is very different from standard modern printed Hebrew. We went through all of the laws and rituals about that and she chose to put on what was in the end a magnificent morning. A woman reading from the Torah, singing, praying in that context, if it is a women's only service, at least according to Jewish law, it is permitted for her to take on that active public role, because then there is no compromise with the laws of modesty etc. Her mother, her two grandmothers standing with her, her cousins all surrounding her, was an extremely bonding experience as I am sure you may have observed, her greatgrandmother got up and offered her a prayer to welcome her into Jewish spiritual adulthood, which is something which is always quite laden with emotion. I think she was rather empowered by the experience and what I would hope and pray is that that experience is not a 'farewell to Judaism' ceremony as it may be unfortunately for some but it is an impetus to get further involved and to become excited and to keep searching for ways to separate out what is truly law and what is Coffey Did you get any sleep last night? Tamir I woke up twice. I was really like excited with my learning. It was pretty hard because I had to learn all the notes, all the singing notes. I was going to give up but I didn't 'cause like .. yeh .. it was a little bit hard. Coffey Why did you decide to do it in the first place because it is not a usual sort of thing? Tamir I thought it would be like really special for me to do it for me to like become a woman and it is more like Jewish, like more exciting for me than reading like a speech in shul. In my particular reading it spoke about the high priest of the Jewish people there was a high priest in the holy temple for Jewish people .. and it's about him and what he has to wear and who he has to marry and all the laws about him and that is mainly what I read. Coffey And you carried the Torah. What did that feel like? Tamir Pretty heavy. Just feel like I was holding Jewishness, holding the whole nation like. It just felt really amazing for me. Karp There are certain Rabbis who I work closely with who are delighted by the work that I have done. With much amusement they have seen girls, young girls, stand up at synagogues or at family functions and dazzle a partially literate group of parents in concepts and areas that the parents have never got to. Grandmother I'm just very proud of my children and family and I can't stop crying and I'm very grateful. I'm proud to be here. Coffey One of those Rabbis is Moshe Pinchuk. His own background speaks of the importance Torah study, the sacred texts, have assumed in constructing religious identity. Pinchuk Those guys out there you might have seen, those are Hesder boys, that is those are boys from Israel who were brought out here from Israel basically to help me run the Yeshivah. Hesder is really a way of combining your obligatory army service with Jewish studies. I guess this is an important concept there's a thing called havruta. At university there is a lecture, you go to the lecture, you prepare for it, you do your homework, your whatever and that's it but basically each person is learning on his own. In the yeshiva, that is in these Jewish centres, it is pretty much the reverse. The focus is not on selflearning but on learning in pairs. There are two people more or less on the same level who are battling with the text or with whatever they have to learn and they would spend the majority of the day doing this. You might have a class, a lecture, once every two or three days and all the other days, for 14 hours a day, you would simply be learning together the texts with your friend rather than with a teacher. Coffey Who chooses the friend? Pinchuk That's a fine art. Of course you have to be compatible. It is not easy to find a good havruta. The guys just pick and choose among themselves by trial and error. Sometimes you would have a gifted overseer who will say you and you will get along, give it a try, and that shortens the process. But at the end of the day it is really their own choice. It isn't simple to find a good havruta but when you do it is marvelous. Coffey Did you have a good one? Pinchuk I had one good one. I had one good one which I remember and for those two years we learned together that was the best learning I ever did. Coffey Tell me about the learning I can hear them on the other side of the door - so what are they actually doing, do they have a piece of text in front of them? Pinchuk Yes, well what they are doing now is preparing for a lecture which I am going to be giving at 12.30. This is what they would be studying.. I tell them to learn from here to here. What you have here is the text in the middle is the major text, the text on the sides are various commentaries on the centre and this is what they are dong now, they are grappling with it themselves, hopefully they are having a hard time and then in lecture we will try to work things out together. Yeshiva student It's more he is going to tell me because actually for myself if I wanted to learn this issue I wouldn't know where to start and where to continue and where to look for all the answers but we have here the Rabbi who learned everything already and he prepared for us all the sources so yes, we learn them and then at the end he gives all the conclusion and we talk about it and everyone says what he has got to say and after our lesson we can tell you exactly the response Coffey Can you tell me about the piece of text that they are looking at now? What is it about? Where is it from? Pinchuk What we are going to be doing today is known as leveret marriage. That is if a woman is married and her husband dies, then this women can't just marry anybody else but she has to marry a remaining brother, if one exists. Basically the question we are trying to figure out today is what is the point of this. We are commanded that this woman has to marry the brother. What for? What is the goal? What is the meaning of this? Coffey Do you go on then to ask the question, what does it mean for us now? Pinchuk Not directly. Certainly not with the class now. I mean the class now is supposedly at the highest level. Learning with these Hesder boys who already have 3 or 4 years of serious study under their belts and they are coming from a very different atmosphere, religious atmosphere, than the people here, completely different. So with them we are just learning the texts or the subject for the sake of the subject and I don't pretend to try to make it relevant to here now because they are interested in the subject for its own worth. Yeshiva student Basically you go in chronological order, you sit and read from the Bible and afterwards what was written by the sages, the wise men of old, in the Talmud and you go through it and process it and you try to figure out .. the way I personally, the way I perceive it is trying to figure out, trying to connect with what they said, trying to figure out first of all what you have to say about the matter and if what you have to say about the matter is different from what they said about it, then try to understand why - our outlook today is definitely different than the outlook then - and try to bring to life what they said then and try to bring it to life to our society now and our environment now and try to sort of re-live the Bible, re-live the Commandments in our own unique way. Coffey Do they seem very foreign to you, as if they occupy a very distant planet? Yeshiva student Sometimes it feels like that, yes, but first of all I grew up in it, I grew in to it, so things that appear very foreign don't appear foreign to me because that is the way I perceive things sometimes, but sometimes, yes, if you take two steps back and try to look at it you think yeh .. what's going on, sometimes you have that feeling. But you try, you really do try to connect to it and try to understand it. And that's part of the beauty of our learning today. Also the way the Talmud is written out: it's written out like a dialogue, so basically when I am sitting and learning the Talmud today which is written out as a dialogue I'm basically connecting to the dialogue of the Torah, to the dialogue of the Jewish people throughout thousands of years and it gives you a great feeling of power, great strength, to know that what I am speaking about today in my little beys medrash, in my little place of study, is something that people have been speaking about all over, throughout the generations, throughout the world, in various different places, gives you a great feeling of power and strength and connection. Pinchuk I can't easily define what it does in my everyday life, it could be because it is so deeply imbued that it is hard for me to see what it is without it. I can say though that the experience of study is a very fascinating experience not only from the intellectual side - it's basically, when you try to translate this in to what it is in today's world, it is really legal studies, legal slash philosophy of law studies, so intellectually it is very, very fascinating but in a certain sense you kind of get a glimpse of what I call God laboratory, that you are brought in to his laboratory to see now what he wants from you, not how he leads the world and all those questions but what does he want from you as a Jew. He has all these different commandments and you are able to get deep into them and understand at least the internal rationale that there is to it. And in general you are much more comfortable when things begin to make sense than when you just like have this list of commands and go do them. I mean most people do their religious duties not because they have sat down and learnt and know what to do but they simply mimic their parents. Their father, whatever, gets up in the morning and goes to the synagogue so the son does and whatever. And the learning of the texts is really an act of devotion. I would very strongly compare it to prayer. I mean a lot of times I have told the people here that prayer is a monologue where you speak and hopefully God is listening whereas study is a monologue where God is speaking and you are listening to him. And it's interesting that a lot of times there is study and davening and prayer together so you get this dialogue, you are speaking and God is speaking back to you. So that is really the context in which study in general should be understood. I would say the ideal study is simply an act of devotion it is a way of meeting God. Coffey At the end of this study, says Rabbi Pinchuk, these young men will have so heightened an awareness and understanding and commitment to their Jewish lifestyle that they will be able to keep it even while working in professional careers. It will be easier for them to be committed to that lifestyle. In a way that explains its increasing popularity. Coffey You mentioned before that young people mimic their parents .. but that is not the case always these days in a place like Melbourne, in a place like Australia. So does that mean that this form of study is assuming a different kind of importance? Pinchuk Yes absolutely. There is a person in America, Haym Sulaveitchik, and he actually had a brilliant article in 1994 which touches on this point he calls this 'rupture and reconstruction'. He basically makes the point that you made that before the Holocaust people were very much mimetic. The entire religious activities were simply you learnt from your parents and learning was this act of devotion. And very often he shows you know there was a kind of a gap an unconscious gap between what you studied and what you did. So it could be that what you did not even square with what you learnt about but it doesn't matter because you go by what your parents did. Ever since the Holocaust this traditional or mimetic way of study has been on the decline and people are turning more and more to the texts to derive their ritual, what to do. This has caused a lot of problems because now the child comes home and he sees his father is doing A and he says wait a minute here it says B and that causes a lot of problems. But the whole religious mood or atmosphere changes if you are getting it from a book. Coffey How does the religious atmosphere change? Can you talk a little about that? Pinchuk In a nutshell I'd say that it moves from the heart to the mind, in the sense that if you are mimicking your parents, you don't think about it, you do it and that is the end of the story. When you are learning it from the texts then you are much more pedantic about it. By definition if you are taking a legal text, if you want to emulate it, then every single tiny point, every fine point, is an issue and if you deviate from that fine point then you have missed the whole command. Coffey How do you guard against that with these young people who you are forming in a sense through this school? Pinchuk I'm not sure that it is something negative - it's a different kind of religion, it is a more a legal way of life this religion than traditional. Coffey No, I wondered whether you thought it might be important to guard against formalism since you mentioned, you spoke of a religion of the heart as opposed to a religion of the intellect. A religion of the heart has a kind of intrinsic dynamism to it whereas perhaps a religion of the intellect might run the risk of not having that. Pinchuk Absolutely, I mean it is very different. I would almost say it's the difference between the relationship of a father and a son and a master and a slave. We seek our connection, closeness to this God not through a hug or a hand on the shoulder but through the yoke of his commands. Coffey Moshe Kahn has definitely chosen the yoke. At fifteen he moved from London to a Yeshiva in Israel. Now, from a base at Melbourne's Yeshiva College, he runs camps and after-school activities for children. Kahn The Jewish day starts right away first thing when we wake up in the morning we say the Moheh Ani, which is a Hebrew prayer thanking God for giving us, restoring our life again in the morning. Then we wash our hands, that is from the impurity of when we were sleeping, so we wash our hands and come back in to this world. Following that I personally, and this is not necessarily something that everybody does, I go and have a class with a few other people in which we learn for an hour straight, we are learning hasidith, basically philosophy about different desires we have and how to overcome them and how to work connecting our mind and body, working together. That's what I studied this morning - it is not something that everybody does. Following that I go to Mikvah which is a pool of water where we immerse ourself. Again this is not something which everybody does or which you have to do. This is something personal which I do. And then we have prayer which basically takes another 45 minutes and then I start my day and work. Coffey So the prayer which takes 45 minutes, that is said in a group isn't it? Kahn That's said in a minyan which means we need at least ten people. You could say it individually but it is better to do it in a group of ten. It has got different stages in it. The first stage is thanking God, showing God how much we appreciate him, similar to for example if someone were to be going to a king. First of all you would thank him and be grateful to him. Then the second stage is we ask God for our requests and what we need and then it goes back to acknowledging all the good in the world and appreciating it. Coffey Something of this giving over to God is the children's experience at Rabbi Kahn's camps. Very day is a Jewish day and Shabbat is something special. Kahn All the programs which happen all have the same goal, trying to give them over to be proud of who they are and to experience Judaism as what it is, instead of them thinking that Judaism is something which holds them back. Shabbat, what happens is again they would keep all the laws in the sense of what a religious Jew would do on Shabbat. We have a lot of singing, prayers, dancing. It is just a beautiful, happy atmosphere and they don't get a chance sort of to even think about putting on the TV or putting on the microwave. It is a full Shabbat of dancing and singing. We have a Friday night dinner, a Friday night dinner which starts around 6, never ends before 2 or 3 in the morning, the kids just don't want to leave. I would say it's a Shabbat where it is just total happiness for them and happiness not necessarily in the way which they would normally experiencing it like going out somewhere. It's them being happy about what is going on around them without them having to look elsewhere for happiness, it's them (having) happiness inside them. It gives you meaning in life, not you are just living a life out there for your own pleasure, but to understand that there is other people in the world, there is a purpose in the world, we all have a purpose, we all have a task, a job, and when you understand that, it helps you in your marriage, it helps you in bringing up children, in living in today's society where there are so many obstacles, just gives you something to stand up for. God is the one running everything and everything we do then is given back over to him. To be honest at 15 I wasn't, I didn't decide that this was what I wanted to do in life. My parents sent me to this Yeshiva and this is what I brought up to doing. Coffey You weren't unhappy? Kahn I wasn't unhappy. I mean I was happy to go to Israel, it was a new experience, it was exciting and . I wouldn't say I was unhappy but I wouldn't say that was my life ambition, my life goal, you know. It happened sort of later on in life. Coffey You grew into it or it grew upon you in a way? Kahn You would hope it was more something that you actually understand and more that you want than just sort of doing it out of habit. I think eventually you just get to understanding, you get more mature and you think you know, you look outside in the world and maybe you try and experiencing one or two of those things and you say it is not for me, you see it is not real happiness, and you begin to see what is important, what is real value, what you should value in life. Coffey This has been \"Generation\", an Encounter featuring Rabbi Shimshon Yurkowicz, Rabbi Motte Liberow, Elke Goldberg, Moshe Pinchuk, Adina Karp and Elly Tamir, and Rabbi Moshe Kahn. Tapes are available from ABC Radio Tapes, Box 9994 GPO Sydney 2001 and so are transcripts. You can also down load transcripts from the ABC's website: .

How do religious traditions transmit themselves to the next generation? You can't expect young people to mimic their parents, if only because in our society there are too many other models competing for attention. This Encounter looks at various ways members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Melbourne are teaching the meaning of Judaism - and a dynamic, living faith - to a new generation. What does Orthodox Judaism have to say to young people in our society? How can these insights be communicated effectively? What do young people need to know about "}
