The award was presented to Dr. Cheston at Central Maryland Radiation Oncology (CMRO) by Robert R. Neall, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health, in recognition of her long-term and outstanding work in creating and sustaining a joint UM SOM/Johns Hopkins program in radiation oncology at Howard County General Hospital. J Adam Puche, PhD, Professor, Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology, received the Student Council Award for Best Pre-Clinical Faculty from the University of Maryland School of Medicine Class of 2018, presented at Congratulations to the following who have received honors! New Faculty J Heather Ames, MD, PhD, joined the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology as an Assistant Professor in May 2018. Dr. Ames was previously with Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she completed her R25 Research Fellowship with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Dr. Ames expertise is in the evalu-ation of glioblastoma tumor heterogeneity, particularly as it applies to white matter invasion and unique patterns of differentiation. J Meredith McHugh, PhD, MSW , joined the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology as an Assistant Professor in May 2018. Dr. McHugh received her PhD in Psychology from Griffith University, Australia in 2010. Later that year she moved to Baltimore where she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program (NIDA-IRP). During her time at NIDA-IRP Dr. McHugh identified several neural circuits and large-scale brain networks involved in relapse to drug use following treatment. Dr McHugh returned to Australia in 2015 to pursue a Masters in Social Work. In her current appointment Dr. McHugh will support and develop an ongoing research program addressing the prevention and management of Opioid Use Disorders. J Fuwen Zhou, BM, MM, Dr. rer. nat. , joined the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology as an Assistant Professor in May 2018. Dr. Zhou received his Dr. rer.nat. in Cell Biology from the University of Rostock, Germany and was a postdoctoral fellow and research associate at the University of Tennessee. Dr. Zhou studies basal ganglia, cortex and olfactory immunohistological, and stereotaxic techniques to investigate the neuroelectrophysiology of different neuronal types in different brain regions, and the pathophysiology of these neurons in neurological disorders.
