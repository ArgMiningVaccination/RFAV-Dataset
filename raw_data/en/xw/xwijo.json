Theexperience of symptoms following vaccination can lead to needle fear, long-term negative attitudes and non-compliant behaviours, which undermine the public health impact of vaccination. This review presents current knowledge on the potential causes of reactogenicity, and how host characteristics, vaccine administration and composition factors can in fluence the development and perception of reactogenicity. The intent is to provide an overview of reactogenicity after vaccination to help the vaccine community, including healthcare professionals, in maintaining con dence in vaccines by promoting vaccination, setting expectations for vaccinees about what might occur after vaccination and reducing anxiety by managing the vaccination setting. npj Vaccines (2019) 4:39 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-019-0132-6 REACTOGENICITY AFTER VACCINATION Reactogenicity refers to a subset of reactions that occur soon after vaccination, and are a physical manifestation of the in flammatory response to vaccination. In clinical trials, information on expected signs and symptoms after vaccination is actively sought (or 'solicited '). These symptoms may include pain, redness, swelling or induration for injected vaccines, and systemic symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, headache, or rash. The broader term 'safety 'prole refers to all adverse events (AEs) that could potentially be caused/ triggered or worsened at any time after vaccination, and includes AEs, such as anaphylactic reactions, diseases diagnosed after vaccination and autoimmune events. Thousands of vaccines are administered every day and the vast majority induce few symptoms in the recipient. Those symptoms that do occur early after vaccination are usually mild and self- limiting and rarely have serious medical consequences. Never- theless, understanding the range of symptoms that vaccination might cause is important for the person receiving the vaccine, for caregivers/decision-makers deciding to accept vaccination for others, and for the healthcare professionals who recommends and administers vaccines. Reactogenicity can contribute to a person 's willingness to be vaccinated. If a vaccine is perceived as too reactogenic, the subject may refuse further doses, or thehealthcare professional may elect not to recommend it, leading to incomplete protection of the individual and low vaccine coverage in the population. Maintaining high vaccine coverage is critical to the success of vaccination programs. The majority of vaccines available today are administered parenterally via injection. Knowledge about the symptoms that can occur after vaccination can be used by healthcare profes- sionals to prepare patients on what to expect after vaccination, potentially leading to improved compliance and higher accep- tance of subsequent doses. This review presents current knowl- edge on what potentially causes reactogenicity, and how host characteristics, vaccine composition and vaccine administration techniques in fluence the development and perception of reactogenicity. We summarise current recommendations for painmitigation at the time of vaccination, including the bene ts and risks of using antipyretics to prevent symptoms. EVALUATION OF VACCINE REACTOGENICITY AND SAFETY The current attitude regarding the bene ts versus the risks of vaccination puts a large emphasis on safety, because vaccines areusually given to healthy populations who may receive no immediate health bene t, particularly when the incidence of the target infectious disease is low. Vaccine reactogenicity and safetyis assessed at all points of the vaccine development process, frompreclinical toxicology studies using cell cultures and animal models, to rigorous assessment in clinical studies and post- licensure pharmacovigilance. 1Following licensure, safety remains of prime concern; ongoing surveillance evaluates vaccine safety in large populations under real-world settings. Fundamental to this process is the contribution of the Brighton Collaboration, anetwork whose aim is to establish clear case de nitions for individual events following vaccination, and to thereby ensure high-quality data collection and reporting consistency.2,3 Pre-clinical evaluation investigating injection-site reactions and the toxicological pro le of vaccines is a prerequisite to the initiation of clinical trials in which safety and ef cacy are established. However, while preclinical studies are critical to identify signals that would prevent their use in humans, evaluation in the early phase of clinical development is needed to con rm the safety pro le of the vaccine in humans. Systematic collection of safety data in clinical trials follows guidelines set out by competent regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and World HealthOrganization (WHO). Authorities also advise on the size of the safety database needed to provide reasonable assurance that the reactogenicity and safety pro le of the vaccine is acceptable. In clinical trials, reactogenicity is measured by collecting sets of injection site and systemic signs and symptoms that are solicited from study participants over a speci ed time after vaccination. The types of symptoms collected and the period for which they are Received: 11 February 2019 Accepted: 2 August 2019 1GSK, Wavre, Belgium and2GSK, Siena, Italy Correspondence: Caroline Herv\u00e9 (caroline.c.herve@gsk.com)www.nature.com/npjvaccines Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentcollected depend on the vaccine being investigated and the objectives of individual studies. Reactions that are solicited (in which participants are actively questioned about the occurrence of each symptom) are usually reported at higher frequencies thanthe same symptoms when participants are asked to report themspontaneously (unsolicited symptoms). While some signs can be objectively measured (body tempera- ture, redness, swelling, heart rate), other symptoms are non-speci c and subjective, and are perceived differently depending on a range of factors occurring at the time. These factors can include mood, presence of other medical conditions or symptoms, climate, individual perceptions of pain, etc. Effects of symptomson an individual 's physical functioning and quality of life, reduced work ef ciency or use of healthcare resources or medications are also dif cult to assess quantitatively. Furthermore, many illnesses and general conditions cause the same signs and symptoms (forexample, fever, headache, fatigue), making it challenging to determine what is, and what is not caused by vaccination. A double-blind study conducted in 581 twin pairs in Finlandillustrated this problem. 4One twin received measles-mumps- rubella vaccine (MMR) followed by placebo injection 3 weeks later, while the second twin received the injections in the reverse order. The study showed that during the time of peak incidence of fever,88% of low-grade fever, 24% of moderate fever and 7% of highfever episodes were not caused by the vaccine. These observa- tions highlight the importance of an appropriate control group (such as placebo) in clinical trials in order to be able to untanglewhich proportion of signs or symptoms might be caused by vaccination. After authorization, vaccine safety is monitored through pharmacovigilance activities conducted by the manufacturer,regulatory authorities and independent researchers, such as review of spontaneous reports of AEs received from healthcare professionals, lay persons and regulatory agencies world-wide.Investigation of speci c AEs of interest may continue in targeted safety studies conducted post-licensure. When needed, the prescribing information is updated to re flect the latest safety data. WHAT CAUSES REACTOGENICITY? Vaccines contain antigens that induce an immune response capable of providing speci c protection from disease. Individual vaccine antigens induce innate immune responses that may differ qualitatively or quantitatively according to the vaccine composi- tion, but that induce a good adaptive immune response. Afterentering the body, vaccine antigens are recognised as potentialpathogens by (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors(TLR) 5that are found on local or peripheral circulating immune cells (e.g. monocytes and macrophages) and on resident stromal cells.5,6The transcription of many target genes is induced in these cells, resulting in the synthesis and release of pyrogenic cytokines(i.e. interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF- ], and prostaglandin-E2) in the bloodstream, that mimics the response to natural infection. Once stimulated, the immunesystem sets off a complex series of innate immune events that caninclude phagocytosis, release of in flammatory mediators including chemokines and cytokines, activation of complement, and cellular recruitment. These phenomena are crucial for triggering strongantigen-speci c acquired immune responses necessary for protec- tion against disease. These same in flammatory events may also lead to the development of signs and symptoms of injection-site inflammation (pain, redness and swelling) in the vaccinated individual (Fig. 1). Mediators and products of in flammation in the circulation can affect other body systems to cause systemic side- effects (such as fever, fatigue, and headache). Balancing thebene cial versus the detrimental effects of these in flammatoryevents is necessary to keep reactogenicity at clinically acceptable levels. The following section provides a review on the current understanding of the mechanisms related to reactogenicity witha focus on vaccines given via the intramuscular route. Effects ofthe route of immunization on reactogenicity are discussed later in this review. What causes injection-site symptoms? General concept . All vaccines share the capacity to activate PRRs that will lead to the production of different mediators. PRRs are expressed by immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages,mast cells and dendritic cells, and resident stromal cells, such askeratinocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Resident cells, in particular macrophages and mast cells, are key target cells that initiate the response within minutes of vaccination, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, effectors of the vasoactive amines and Vasodilators and the chemokine gradient promote cell recruit- ment from blood, but also lead to the development of redness and swelling (Fig. 1). Blood-borne neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes adhere to the vessel walls and accumulate at the siteof injury via extravasation. These immune cells may contribute toperipheral nociceptive sensitisation by releasing soluble factors, such as cytokines, prostaglandins or ATP, and interacting directly with nociceptors (sensory neurons that respond to potentiallydamaging stimuli) to cause pain if the pain threshold is reached. Pain sensation is transmitted through fast-conducting myelinated neurons (the fast neural pathway) (Fig. 2). 8 Vaccine-speci c immune pro le at the injection site . Adjuvants are immunostimulants that enhance the immune response to the antigen, and usually increase reactogenicity compared to inacti- vated vaccines or puri ed antigens without adjuvant.9,10Alumi- nium salts were the rst adjuvant ever licensed for use in human vaccines. Examples of newer adjuvants in use today include virosomes, oil-in-water emulsions (such as MF59, which containssqualene and is used in seasonal and pandemic in fluenza vaccines), immunostimulants, such as MPL (3- A), CpG 1018 (a CpG-containing oligonucleotide sequence used in a hepatitis B vaccine) and proprietarycombinations of immunostimulants referred to as AdjuvantSystems. The composition and actions of new adjuvants has been recently reviewed. 11-13 Not all vaccines require the addition of adjuvants (self-adjuvanted). Most of the studies describing loca l innate immune responses in pre- clinical models involved adjuvanted vaccines, but it is assumed that all types of vaccines trigger a similar response, with kinetics andamplitude in fluenced by the nature of vaccine components (live/non- live/type of adjuvant) and the site of administration. After injection of vaccines containing an Adjuvant System, chemokines and cytokines are readily detected in mouse muscleas early as 3 h post-injection. 14-16Most cytokines and chemokines in muscle injected with adjuvanted vaccine decrease rapidly within 24 h after delivery, and reach baseline after 72 h. The expression of pro-in flammatory molecules is not only restricted to muscle. Lymph nodes that drain adjuvanted vaccine-injectedmuscle show higher cytokine and chemokine expression com- pared with lymph nodes that drain muscle that received phosphate-buffered saline or aluminium salt,17or protein antigen alone. emulsion with squalene and alpha-tocopherol [Vitamin E] mixed in the oil phase), the cytokine response in draining lymph nodes is detected a few hours afterinjection, similarly to injected muscle, suggesting that AS03 maydrain into the node and act directly, along with antigen-loaded cells that arrive from injected muscle. 17C. Herv\u00e9 et al. 2 npj Vaccines (2019) 39 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development1234567890():,;In terms of innate cells, neutrophils and monocytes are the rst cells to in ltrate antigen-exposed tissues. In mice, they are recruited to muscle as early as 3 -6 h after injection of either MF5916or AS01 (QS-21, Quillaja Molina: licensed by GSK from Antigenics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc., a Delaware, USA corporation, and MPLin a liposome-based formulation),17while other immune cells, including dendritic cells, eosinophils, natural killer cells and lymphocytes are recruited later,15-17which likely leads to cross- talk between cells to orchestrate innate immune responses.Neutrophils and monocytes return to steady-state levels in adjuvant-injected muscle after 5 -7 days.15,17Collectively, these data show that local in flammation in the muscle and draining lymph node after immunisation is a transient physiological eventcoinciding with the duration of solicited injection-site symptoms described in clinical trials after vaccination. What causes systemic symptoms after intramuscular or subcutaneous vaccination? General concept . The mediators and products of in flammation at a localised site in the body may spill into the circulation and canaffect other body systems causing systemic side-effects. These systemic pyrogenic factors, along with PAMPs, DAMPs and adhering monocytes, trigger cross-talk between the immuneresponse and the central nervous system via receptors on the vagus nerve, at the blood-brain barrier and perhaps within circumventricular organs. 18,19Within the brain, the coupled induction of the inducible enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 andmicrosomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 by these signal molecules results in elevated intracerebral levels of prostaglandin E2, thecritical terminal mediator of raised body temperature and other systemic symptoms, such as headache, myalgia and chills (or'sickness syndrome '). 20-22Intracerebral prostaglandin as peripheral vasoconstriction, metabolic heat production, shivering ( 'chills ') or warmth-seeking behaviour, thereby causing a rise in body temperature. Vaccine systemic immune pro le and link to reactogenicity . The main step in the development of systemic symptoms after vaccination is thought to be the presence of in flammatory markers in the bloodstream, which signal at the blood-brainbarrier level and induce in fluenza-like symptoms. Several publications have reported the nature and kinetics of inflammatory mediators induced by vaccines and their potential association with reactogenicity symptoms. In healthy adults that received the hepatitis B virus surface Antigen (HBsAg) combined with different Adjuvant Systems (AS01, AS03, alumi-nium salts), all Adjuvant Systems induced transient systemic innate responses, including IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), mostly peaking at 24 h post administration and subsiding tobaseline within 1 to 3 days. 23A follow-up study showed that some of these in flammatory markers were more associated with systemic than injection-site reactogenicity ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01777295).24The study could not identify speci c markers that could be directly correlated with, or predict symptoms. Similar increases in circulating cytokines within hours and days after vaccination were reported for the adjuvanted humanpapillomavirus and in fluenza vaccines.25-27In one study looking Fig. 1 Summary of expected biological mechanisms underlying the development of reactogenicity symptoms. Vaccine antigens and immune enhancers (as adjuvants) injected into the muscle are recognised by the body as potential pathogens and/or danger signals. This recognitionleads to the stimulation of local cells, followed by the recruitment of blood immune cells to the local site and the production of differentsoluble factors including vasodilators and cytokines, which may trigger the development of signs and symptoms of local in flammation (pain, redness and swelling). The passage of some of those factors in the bloodstream, as well as the production of other systemic factors by immune blood cells or distant organs (e.g. liver), may contribute to the development of general symptoms (fever, myalgia, headache etc) in the vaccinee. CRP C-reactive proteinC. Herv\u00e9 et al. 3 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 39 at the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine (H1N1/AS03), a higher number of a speci c B cell subset at baseline prior to vaccination was proposed as a biomarker correlating with speci c AEs, although a causal relationship with these cells and speci c symptoms and/or in flammatory markers induced by the vaccine remains to be demonstrated.26 Adjuvanted vaccine formulations are not the only formulations to induce transient systemic in flammation. Several publications describe the early systemic immune response induced in humansafter the administration of non-adjuvanted vaccines (reviewed inLim et al., 28). All of the clinical studies consistently described a slight and short-lived increase in in flammatory mediators in blood following vaccination, in particular, an increase in CRP and IL-6.The level and kinetics of the in flammatory markers depended on the type of vaccine used and the population studied.28 A mild and transient increase in circulating IL-6 and TNF- , with peak responses 1 day post vaccination was shown in pregnantwomen vaccinated with non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated seasonal in fluenza vaccine.29An increase in a speci c set of immune genes was also observed 1 day post vaccination insubjects that received a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine.30At this time point, the genes belonging to TLR and interferon (IFN)- signalling pathways were differentially expressed in subjects with systemic AEs as compared to subjects without AEs, although thedifferences in gene expression were not statistically different. An association was also found between speci c systemic symptoms (myalgia, headache) and stem cell factors and CD100 (cluster of differentiation 100) pathways known to play a regulatory role in central nervous system functions as well as immune responses,thus reinforcing the probable involvement of immune-to-brainsignalling 30in the development of systemic reactogenicity. Finally, an association between several systemic cytokines and chemo- kines, and fever, myalgia, chills and headache was reported 1 dayafter injection in subjects who had received a recombinantvesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine. 31 Summary It is a common belief that an injection-site reaction to a vaccine is a predictive sign of a desirable vaccine response ( 'no pain, no gain ' concept). However limited data either support or disprove thisconcept. 32In the hepatitis B study comparing different adju- vants,23the magnitude of in flammatory responses paralleled the magnitude of adaptive immune responses and the overallincidence of reactogenicity symptoms. The more potent adjuvants (AS01 and AS03) were capable of activating an early IFN-signalling pathway, which was con rmed in the blood of subjects the day after receiving H1N1/AS03. 26However, despite parallel Fig. 2 Hypothesised link between the innate immune response induced by vaccination and reactogenicity. Upon vaccination, in flammation is triggered by innate immune activation of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize and bindantigens (green circle in skeletal muscle) and potential immune enhancers (purple circle in skeletal muscle) present in the vaccine formulation.Resident immune cells, mast cells, monocytes and macrophages are activated within minutes of injection and release soluble factors(proin flammatory cytokines, chemokines, effectors of the complement cascade) and vasodilators, that allow cell recruitment from blood but also lead to the development of redness and swelling symptoms. These newly recruited immune cells, mainly composed of blood-bornneutrophils, monocytes and T lymphocytes, also contribute to pain sensation by releasing soluble factors, such as cytokines, prostaglandins or ATP , that can directly interact with local sensory receptors called nociceptors and cause pain through the fast neural route if the threshold is reached. Once produced, cytokines act both locally in autocrine and paracrine manners, and may act systemically at distant organs, leading tothe production of C-reactive protein and other acute phase proteins by the liver. Several immune-to-brain signaling pathways may propagatean in flammatory response to the central nervous system after peripheral activation of the innate immune system (slow humoral route), leading to the development of fever and sickness behavioursC. Herv\u00e9 et al. 4 npj Vaccines (2019) 39 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentassociations of reactogenicity and adaptive responses with early innate responses, no predictive association was demonstrated between reactogenicity and the adaptive response, which suggests that the 'no pain, no gain 'concept may not be valid, at least at the individual level.32 Vaccines, irrespective of their composition, induce some level of inflammation at the injection site within the rst hours after their administration which is likely to contribute to causing pain, redness and swelling symptoms. Release of pyrogenic factors into the systemic circulation is thought to stimulate a cascade ofimmune and nervous system cross-talk that can lead to systemic 'influenza-like 'symptoms including raised body temperature. There is growing evidence of general associations between systemic in flammatory mediators and systemic symptoms after vaccination. However, no single biomarker of systemic reacto-genicity has been identi ed, but rather a composite of biomarkers; in particular, IL-6, CRP, and for highly immunogenic products, the IFN-signalling pathway, appear to be linked to systemic reacto- genicity. To date, it is unknown whether the speci c molecular pathways that cause symptoms are independent from pathwaysinvolved in the generation of antigen-speci c response. This knowledge is required for the design of less reactogenic vaccines, or targeted strategies aimed at reducing the severity of symptoms. The discovery of potential biomarkers of reactogenicity is being actively pursued through collaborations within academy andindustry such as the BIOVACSAFE consortium. 33 FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REACTOGENICITY Extrinsic and intrinsic factors can impact the reactogenicity pro le, tolerability and immunogenicity of vaccines in a given individual (Fig. 3). They include host characteristics, such as age, gender,race/ethnicity, body mass, general health and pre-existing immunity, and vaccine administration and composition factors, such as route and site of administration, injection technique, type of antigen, vaccine formulation, and type of adjuvant. The sectionsbelow provide some speci c examples of the concepts being discussed. Host characteristics that can in fluence reactogenicity Age. Physiological functions of the immune and nervous systems evolve throughout life. These changes have implications for defence against infectious diseases at different ages, and can alsoinfluence susceptibility to adverse reactions to vaccination. While infants and toddlers tend to exhibit fewer injection-site reactions after vaccination than adults, they are more prone to experience fever episodes due to vaccination or other co-incidentalinfections. 4 Reporting rates of AEs following immunisation increase during childhood and adolescence as the immune system matures. Reporting rates of AEs reduce during adult life, possibly due tohigher tolerance to pain and illness symptoms gained with life experience and/or the waning of innate immune defence mechanisms. The latter is supported by the observation thatolder people display lower systemic levels of IL-6, IL-10 and CRPafter vaccination, 34which could contribute to their tendency to report fewer systemic AEs, in particular fever. Gender . Compared to men, women tend to experience higher incidences of injection site, but not systemic symptoms after vaccination,35-38and may experience higher rates of immediate hypersensitivity reactions.39Possible explanations could be related to genetic or hormonal differences.36For example, anatomical differences in skin thickness, blood flow and nervous Fig. 3 Summary of vaccination and host factors that can in fluence reactogenicity. As a general concept, all the conditions that can in fluence the immune, the endocrine or the hormonal systems of the host (intrinsic factors), all the conditions that can increase tissue stress(administration factors) and the components that activate innate immunity contained in the vaccines (vaccine factors) could theoreticallyimpact the incidence and severity of local and general symptoms induced after vaccinationC. Herv\u00e9 et al. 5 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 39 system structure between men and women may favour the development of injection-site in flammation in women.40Further, sex hormones have been shown to in fluence immune responses and cytokine levels, with androgens and high doses of oestrogensbeing immunosuppressive.41,42 Ethnicity . Little is known about whether ethnicity in fluences vaccine reactogenicity because comparisons are confounded bythe effect of cultural in fluences on the interpretation of symptoms and the propensity to report them. Differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine levels and genetic polymorphisms between ethnic groups have been observed.43-45However, the interpretation and comparison of such studies are complicated bythe multitude of circumstances, life-events, and socio-cultural aspects that in fluence how symptoms are perceived and reported.46 Psychological/physical stressors and circadian cycles . Stress in various forms and circadian cycles are known to in fluence the immune system47and in particular the in flammatory response. Subjects experiencing acute or chronic stressors are characterised by high levels of circulating pro-in flammatory cytokines.48During cycle, pro-in flammatory hormones and are synchronised to facilitate the initiation of adaptive immuneresponses in lymph nodes during nocturnal sleep, while during daytime activity, anti-in flammatory signals, hormones and cyto- kines appear to support immediate effector functions.49Conse- quently, it has been suggested that the timing of vaccine or drug delivery and the level of stress could in fluence immunogenicity and tolerability of the intervention.49-51However, to date, no studies have clearly assessed the impact of those factors on thedevelopment of vaccine-solicited AEs. Overweight/obesity . Obesity has been demonstrated to be associated with low-level chronic in flammation.52However, studies suggest that increases in reactogenicity in the overweight population are most likely due to vaccine administration technique and not to body mass itself.53-55In a study of overweight/obese participants and in normal weight controls,the frequency of injection-site and systemic reactions after trivalent in fluenza vaccine was statistically similar between groups.53Other studies have suggested that infants and young children with higher body mass are more likely to have injection- site reactions from acellular pertussis vaccines, possibly due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration.54A correlation was identi ed between body mass index and reactogenicity using the New Zealand meningococcal serogroup B vaccine.55However, this association was no longer present when the results were controlled for vaccinator, suggesting individual injection techni-ques were responsible for this observation. Pre-existing immunity (pre-existing before vaccination and vaccine- induced) . With few exceptions,56natural immunity has not been found to affect the overall safety pro le of vaccines targeting the said pathogen. Efforts to correlate pre-vaccination antibody titres with the incidence of injection-site or systemic reactions followingvaccination have not identi ed consistent associations.57-59 Some vaccines cause increased injection-site and general reactions after repeated doses. For example, injection-site and systemic symptoms increase with successive doses of whole-celland acellular pertussis-containing vaccines.60Varicella-containing vaccines (monovalent and MMRV) cause increased rates of injection-site reactions in those children receiving the varicella antigen for the secondtime.61Five -six-year-old children receiving MMRV were more likely to have injection-site reactions including pain, redness, and swelling if they had previously received a dose of MMRV asopposed to MMR.56The underlying mechanisms are not fullyunderstood and may be related to pre-existing immunity induced by priming to antigen or another vaccine component, mediated by T cells which can be quickly recruited to the site of inflammation, or to local innate immune memory responses, or to the age of the vaccinee at booster dose administration. Forsome vaccines, such as hepatitis A vaccine, adverse reactions become less frequent after additional doses.62,63 Periodic booster doses with tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines are recommended in adults, as well as annual in fluenza vaccination and 5-yearly pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccina- tion. In with vaccines, increased symptoms after re-vaccination has not beenconsistently observed, although increased reactogenicity com-pared to the rst dose seemed to occur if the interval between doses was below 5 years. 59Reactogenicity can increase with the number of tetanus vaccines administered (either alone orcombined with diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis compo- nents), which can be reduced by decreasing the dose of toxoid administered to adults.64Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after repeated immunization with tetanus toxoid. Theseare thought to be caused by antigen-antibody complex forma- tions as a result of vaccination.65Influenza vaccines are administered annually to various populations but the impact ofrepeated annual vaccination on reactogenicity is poorly de ned. Three studies showed no differences in injection-site or systemic symptoms in adults and children who had received up to ve previous in fluenza vaccinations,66-68whereas one study showed an increased rate in local reactions after repeated seasonal influenza vaccination in children.69 Few studies have estimated the risk of recurrence of speci c AEs after re-vaccination (reviewed by Zafack et al.70). In children who experienced extensive limb swelling after vaccination with acellular pertussis vaccines, up to 78% experienced extensive limb swelling at the next dose.70In preterm infants who experienced apnoea after the rst vaccine dose, only 18% had a recurrence rated as severe as the initial episode. Overall, the risk of a recurrence of AEs at the next dose in people who have had AEs after vaccination appears to be low.70 Vaccine characteristics that can in fluence reactogenicity Route, site and method of vaccine administration . Administering vaccine into a different route to that recommended can adversely affect reactogenicity. For injected vaccines, the depth of the injection has a strong in fluence on reactogenicity, with deep injections (intramuscular) usually associated with fewer injection-site symptoms than subcutaneous or intradermal injections,71-73 probably because skeletal muscle has fewer pain bres compared with skin and subcutaneous tissue. A clinical trial of MMR andvaricella vaccines showed substantially higher rates of solicitedinjection-site reactions in the groups that received subcutaneous injection. 74Despite good evidence of the better tolerability of intramuscular injection, sub-cutaneous rather than the intra-muscular injection is preferred in some countries.71Skin inflammatory reactions following intradermal vaccination against influenza are likely to be immunologically mediated since they have been less frequently observed in immunocompromisedsubjects receiving the intradermal vaccine.75Orally administered vaccines are usually very well tolerated, but are occasionally followed by gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting ordiarrhoea. The intranasal route is attractive for prevention of mucosal infections,76but currently, only one vaccine (live-attenuated influenza vaccine) is available for use by the intranasal route. Potential side-effects of intra-nasal in fluenza vaccine include nasal congestion, wheezing, headache, vomiting, muscle aches, fever, sore throat and cough.77C. Herv\u00e9 et al. 6 npj Vaccines (2019) 39 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine DevelopmentOther vaccine administration routes under investigation include non-invasive approaches, such as plant-based oral vaccines,78and transdermal methods, such as microneedle patches.79AEs speci c to these administration routes, such as skin irritation in the case ofmicroneedle devices or AEs following plant-based oral vaccines,are yet to be quanti ed. The reactogenicity pro le of a vaccine can vary signi cantly between individual vaccine administrators. 54,55Injection site symptoms are minimised when the needle is inserted at 90\u00b0 tothe skin using a needle size of appropriate length to ensure administration into the correct tissue. Additionally, acute injection- site pain is decreased when a rapid injection is performed,80 because slow injection causes prolonged tissue distension anddamage from lateral movement of the needle, further exacerbated by muscle contraction and movement in response to the administration.81 Sterile abscesses (caused by irritation and not infection) can rarely occur after vaccination, and are possibly a result of a hypersensitivity reaction to a vaccine component.82 Vaccine composition . Vaccines are composed of whole patho- or combined with other excipients and remnants of themanufacturing process. All of these ingredients, as well as thevolume of liquid to be injected, can potentially cause symptoms on injection. Injection of volumes larger than 0.8 ml is reported to cause more pain than when the volume injected is smaller. 83 Live-attenuated vaccines contain whole pathogens that are designed to replicate within the body inducing mild infection, potentially inducing mild disease symptoms.84Fever and rash may occur after measles vaccine, peaking 5 -12 days after vaccination which coincides with the peak in viral replication. Live-attenuated vaccines contain an array of antigens and innate immune triggers which usually makes them immunogenic, but potentially morereactogenic than combinations of puri ed antigens. Killed vaccines also contain whole organisms that have been killed through chemical or physical means, and are usually also highly immunogenic and potentially reactogenic.84Subunit vaccines containing one or several puri ed components are usually less reactogenic than whole-cell vaccines (killed or live- attenuated) but may also be less immunogenic, thus requiring the addition of an adjuvant to restore the immune triggers.Adjuvanted vaccines have been linked to higher rates of injection-site pain and systemic symptoms, such as myalgia or headache than unadjuvanted controls, but unsolicited AEs, febrileseizures, potential immune-mediated diseases and new onset ofchronic diseases occur at similar rates. 9 Physical and chemical properties of the vaccine formulation, such as pH, viscosity and charge of the vaccine substance canimpact reactogenicity.85For example, in some studies but not all, pain on injection of MMR-II (Merck & Co.), and pain in the days following MMR-II injection, is signi cantly higher than for Priorix (GSK) even though they contain the same antigens.80,86-88Both vaccines were well tolerated and if a difference exists, it could be due to differences in pH between the two formulations.80 Osmolarity does not appear to greatly in fluence reactogenicity.89 Antigen and adjuvant dose and type . Increasing the antigen dose may induce stronger immune responses but may also cause higher levels of reactogenicity.90Because of the immune- enhancing effects of adjuvants, their addition to a vaccine canlower the dose of antigen needed to induce similar or enhanced immune responses compared to higher amounts of antigen administered alone. While the amount of antigen may decrease,the addition of adjuvant in these vaccines generally increases reactogenicity as compared to unadjuvanted vaccine containing the full antigen dose. 91As observed for non-adjuvanted vaccines, the majority of reactions after vaccination with adjuvantedvaccines are of short duration, and consistent with kinetics of the in flammatory response described in animal studies.9,15,92,93 The different adjuvants that are included in vaccines differ in their mode of action and ability to stimulate the immune system,and consequently, their contribution to reactogenicity symptomsmay vary. There are only few studies comparing different adjuvants in humans. A recent study comparing the response to HBsAg formulated in different Adjuvant Systems showed that thelevel of reactogenicity was associated with the ability of AdjuvantSystems to stimulate an innate response and to promote higher HBs-speci c responses. 94In this study, the highest local reacto- genicity occurred in the group that received AS01.94AS01 is included in the recently licensed recombinant herpes zostervaccine zoster in older adults,95pain at the injection site was commonly reported in up to 88.4% of vaccinees, depending on age, versus upto 14.4% of placebo recipients.95The reactogenicity pro le was characterised by mild to moderate reactions generally of short duration (median duration of pain was 2.0 days in adults96), and was consistent with the pro le of other AS01-adjuvanted vaccines and the kinetics of the in flammatory response induced by RZV in animal studies.15 Combinations and co-administration . Combining different anti- gens in the same vaccine or co-administration of vaccinesprovides signi cant advantages in ensuring optimal vaccine coverage and compliance. Co-administration of vaccines can result in higher reactogenicity overall, although this is not ageneral rule. For example, post-marketing studies showed that the risk of fever and convulsions was higher when MMRV was used for therst dose, compared with MMR +varicella co-administered separately. 97,98 SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT Pain and distress at the time of vaccination are important clinical issues for individuals of all ages undergoing injection. Notaddressing pain at the time of vaccination can engender vaccine hesitancy and may impact on future health-seeking behaviour and healthcare decisions. There are numerous interventions that canhelp reduce both the immediate and delayed side-effects that may result from vaccination, should they occur. In 2015, WHO published recommendations for pain mitigation at the time ofvaccination, aiming at decreasing anxiety in the vaccine recipientand reminding healthcare professionals about good injection practices including the use of appropriate needle length and selection of appropriate anatomical location for injection (Fig. 4). 99 Topical anaesthetics used in children before injection can also reduce immediate pain and needle distress. WHO does notrecommend the routine use of topical anaesthetics because of their high cost, lack of availability in many settings and the prolonged onset of action. Routine use of topical anaesthetics isrecommended for 0- to 12-year-old children in Canada in view ofevidence of reduced distress in young children when they are used, and to reduce long-term development of needle fears and future non-compliant behaviours. 100Novel active distraction techniques that use virtual reality can be used effectively toreduce pain and anxiety in paediatric patients undergoing vaccination. 101 Redness and mild swelling are not usually associated with signi cant discomfort and usually require no treatment or can be managed with local application of ice. Pain in the days followinginjection, and systemic symptoms, such as headache, fever, and myalgia can cause substantial discomfort that may be mitigated by the administration of paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin oranti-in flammatories such as ibuprofen.C. Herv\u00e9 et al. 7 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 39 Can prophylactic medications prevent symptoms? A meta-analysis of 13 randomised controlled concluded that while prophylactic antipyretics signi cantly reduced injection-site and systemic symptoms after vaccination, their use was associatedwith reduced antibody responses to most vaccine antigens. 102A reduction in the response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines was the most consistently observed impact, although childrenwho had received prophylactic antipyretics still achieved seropro-tective levels of antibodies to all of the administered antigens. 102 Another recent review concluded that the timing of antipyreticadministration was key, because no effect on the antibodyresponse was seen when antipyretics were given as a treatment for symptoms (rather than for prevention of symptoms) after vaccination (Table 1). 103Thus, the use of ibuprofen and paracetamol in children to treat symptoms arising aftervaccination appears to be effective, without impacting the immune response to vaccination. Of few studies conducted in adults, neither low-dose aspirin, nor prophylactic paracetamol impacted the response to in fluenza vaccines.104,105However, one study showed that prophylactic (but not therapeutic) paracetamol signi cantly reduced the adult immune response to a hepatitis B vaccine.106Nevertheless, antibody levels in each group in this study were high, and all subjects had seroprotective antibody levels after the second dose. Because of the need to balance reactogenicity with the potential effect of prophylactic paracetamol on immunogenicity,there are only few vaccines for which prophylactic administrationof paracetamol to prevent symptoms is currently actively recommended, usually in situations when different pyrogenic vaccines are co-administered, which results in an additive effectTable 1.

Herv\u00e9 et al. 8 npj Vaccines (2019) 39 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmenton the incidence of fever. Currently this includes 4-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine with routine vaccines.107,108 These recommendations were made based on clinical trial data showing that co-administration increased the risk of fever ininfants by a factor considered to be clinically signi cant, which could be reduced by administering paracetamol at, or soon aftervaccination. THE ROLE OF THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL Healthcare professionals are at the frontline of vaccine provision, often responsible for recommending and administering vaccines, and for managing those seeking medical advice for symptomsafter vaccination. Healthcare professionals involved in vaccinedelivery are in an ideal position to promote the bene ts of vaccination, particularly in settings where the fear of side-effectsplays a role in in fluencing decisions to vaccinate, 109,110setting expectations for vaccinees about what might occur post vaccina- tion, and reducing anxiety by managing the vaccination setting.111 Correct immunisation procedures including appropriate needlelength and site of administration can impact reactogenicity,potentially reducing pain on injection and the occurrence of other delayed symptoms. Reporting AEs, should they occur, even if they are already in the prescribing information, is an importantmechanism by which healthcare professionals contribute to thecontinuous monitoring of vaccine safety. CONCLUSION \u2014MAINTAINING CONFIDENCE IN VACCINES Reactogenicity symptoms are an outworking of the expected immune response that occurs in response to vaccination. However, the experience of symptoms is in fluenced by a multitude of factors, many of which can be alleviated byeducating vaccine recipients, providing an appropriate environ-ment for vaccination, and using good injection methods.Healthcare professionals play an integral role in these endeavours. While we know that a certain level of in flammation is needed to trigger an effective adaptive immune response, we do not yet know how to quantify that level, or predict how this translates intoreactogenicity. New technologies including systems biology areproviding new insights into the early immune response tovaccination. 33This, and potential identi cation of biomarkers linked to reactogenicity, will allow further understanding of the links between immunogenicity and reactogenicity. In the futurethis may allow development of less reactogenic vaccines, or evenidenti cation of which individuals are likely to experience more severe symptoms after vaccination.
