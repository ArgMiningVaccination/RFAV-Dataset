It is time to get your influenza \"flu\" vaccine for the season if you have not already done so. Individuals over the age of six months are eligible for vaccination. Vaccination is an important public health measure to help prevent influenza. September and October are prime time to be vaccinated, but you can get vaccinated later in the season as well. It is a one -time dose annually. For children under the age of eight years old who have NEVER received an influenza vaccine in the past, it is a two -dose series then just once annually moving forward. It is safe to receive the influenza and covid vaccines at the same time, but they should be administered in different sites to better monitor for reactions. The influenza vaccine protects against the four most likely strains of the virus that research predicts will be most common for the upcoming season. Why get a flu vaccine? Decreases the likelihood of developing influenza. Decreases the severity of illness for those that develop influenza. Decreases the risk of influenza associated hospitalizations. It helps to protect you AND those around you, especially those who are at higher risk including infants, young children, elderly, immunocompromised, and those with chronic health conditions. There is also a nasal mist and a high dose vaccine for people over the age of 65 years. Egg free vaccines are available for individuals with egg allergies. A person CAN 'T get influenza from the vaccine, this is a common misconception. The nasal mist is the only vaccine that contains live virus and is only recommended for those between the ages of 2 -49 years. If a person is pregnant or immunocompromised, they should not receive the nasal mist. Common side effects after receiving the vaccine include soreness/redness/swelling at the site where the vaccine was administered, headache, body aches, fatigue, and low -grade fever. Life threatening allergic reactions are extremely rare. After two years of mild influenza cases in the U.S. due to Covid -19 and increased precautions, we are expected to see increased influenza numbers this season. The Southern Hemisphere 's winter often foreshadows what is to be expected in the Northern Hemisphere. Countries such as Australia had a significant increase in influenza numbers compared to recent years and these infections started earlier than usual. Australia reported having its worst influenza season in five years, which serves as a potential indicator for the U.S. Don 't wait, get your influenza vaccine! Call any of the GCH Clinics, if you have any questions or concerns or want to schedule your appointment. Lindy Nordstrom, ARNP The ABCDE 's of SKIN CANCER Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the skin. Skin cancer can invade deeper layers of the skin or may spread to other areas of the body and cause damage. The ABCDE Rule of Skin Cancer is a tool that individuals can use to help differentiate between a problem skin growth and a normal everyday skin spot (mole, freckle, or birthmark). Every skin cancer is different in appearance and presentation, the ABCDE rule of skin cancer can be helpful in determining whether it has features of skin cancer which need further evaluation by a healthcare provider. A for Asymmetry - normal moles, spots or freckles are typically symmetrical. If you draw a line through the center, you would have two symmetrical halves. Skin cancer spots often will not look the same on both sides. B for Border - moles, spots or freckles are typically round. Spots with blurry or irregular edges can be a sign of skin cancer. C for Color - normal moles, spots or freckles are usually one color. A skin spot with more than one color is considered suspicious. D for Diameter - if the skin growth is larger than a pencil eraser (about \u00bc inch), it may be abnormal. E for Evolution - if the skin growth 's appearance is evolving with changes of size, shape, color, appearance, or texture, then it is considered suspicious. A non-healing skin spot that causes bleeding or pain is considered suspicious. In contrast, birthmarks may not change significantly over time. If you notice any skin spots that are worrisome, especially if the spot changes rapidly or bleeds easily, see your health care provider.

While at times it can be challenging, a few key principles can help. Children learn by modeling or watching everyone around them, especially parents. When you use manners and good coping strategies you teach your children to do the same. Point out when people are using manners or sharing. Teach your children how to calm down when upset, just like we must do when we are upset. Teach your children to say how they feel instead of making hurtful or critical statements. The best way to improve behavior is to give children lots of attention when they are doing something you like and remove your attention when they are doing something you do not like. When children are getting positive attention from you, they do not need to act out to get the attention. Playing with your children for just 5 minutes will go a long way, especially right after getting home from work. Another way to give attention for good behavior is gently touch them on their back or shoulder in a loving way. It is recommended you give children 50 to 100 brief loving touches every day. You can decrease bad behaviors by ignoring them, but this only works if you are giving your children lots of attention for their good behaviors. Another strategy is time outs. The goal of a time out is to briefly remove the child from a difficult situation to teach them self -calm. Use very short word statements to send your children to time -out. There is no need to have a big talk with your children after using a time out. Keep things simple and consistent. Rewards are an effective way to help children learn concepts or accomplish tasks. They can be as simple as choosing a movie or spending quality time with you. Every child is different, but being consistent, loving, and present with your child will go a long way. Cody Silker, DO Bringing The Best Out in Your Child It's wintertime once again! And whether you 're looking forward to the season ahead or not, there are plenty of preparations to help you stay healthy this time of year. SummaCare offers seven tips to help you stay healthy this winter and into the warmer weather months ahead. Get Up to Date on Vaccinations Do your part to protect yourself and loved ones during this season of respiratory infections. Flu season peaks in January, so if you haven 't already done so, be sure to get your flu shot. Everyone six months and older should receive the flu shot. Summa Health and other health experts warn it 's especially important this year due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and a potentially difficult flu season. Adding the COVID -19 vaccine to your list is vital. As more and more people move indoors and safety precautions wane, it 's the best way to protect yourself against the virus and help stop the spread. It 's now available for anyone 5 years and older. For adults 65 and older, or anyone with a chronic health condition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommend the pneumonia vaccine. Practice Proper Hygiene With viruses such as the common cold, RSV, influenza and COVID -19 circulating this winter, it 's important to be vigilant about proper hygiene. Protect yourself and reduce the spread of these viruses by: Washing your hands regularly with soap and warm water Sanitizing surfaces frequently Avoiding the sharing of cups and utensils Wearing a mask in crowded, indoor areas Keeping a 6 -foot distance from others Staying home if you 're not feeling well Protect Your Heart Studies show when temperatures drop, the rates of heart attacks, stroke and other heart - related conditions go up, according to the American Heart Association. Cold weather makes your heart work harder to keep your body warm. Take these steps this winter to protect your heart: Make nutritious choices. Continue to eat a heart -healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats and excess sugar. Exercise. Shorter days and colder weather can translate to less frequent exercise. Be sure you're still getting at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly. If you must exercise outdoors, don 't overexert yourself and move indoors on the most frigid days. Drink in moderation. Don 't let the season of celebrations cause you to drink more alcohol. Men should have no more than two drinks a day and women no more than one a day. 7 TIPS FOR STAYING HEALTHY THIS WINTER Protect Your Heart, Continued Reduce stress. It's a busy and stressful time of year. Be sure to take time for meditation, breathing exercises or practicing other stress -relieving activities. Be Mindful of Driving Conditions While you can 't control the weather, you can decide to stay home and avoid driving. Each year, more than 150,000 car crashes occur due to snowy, slippery roads, according to the Federal Highway Administration. If you must go out, make sure roads are in good condition. Go slow and be especially careful on bridges and overpasses. Keep an ice scraper in your car to clean all windows before getting behind the wheel. Wear Shoes with Good Traction With icy, slippery conditions, falling is unfortunately a common wintertime injury. When heading outside, make sure your shoes or boots have a sole with good traction and a low heel to help prevent slips and falls. Watch where you 're walking and tread carefully to avoid icy patches. Stay Hydrated Getting hot and sweaty in the summertime is a trigger to drink water, but it 's just as important to stay hydrated when it 's cold, too. Staying hydrated keeps you energized, helps protect your skin from dry, cold winter air and keeps your body working in tip -top shape. A good goal is to drink about eight glasses or more of water each day. Mix it up with herbal teas, fruit-infused water or 100% juice. Even broth -based soups count toward your fluid intake. Get Vitamin D More time spent indoors and less sunlight on your skin can lead to a Vitamin D deficiency. Getting adequate amounts of Vitamin D is crucial for bone health. Good sources of vitamin D include fortified cereals and low -fat dairy, such as yogurt and cheese, fish and eggs. If diet alone isn 't enough, consider a Vitamin D supplement.

Meanwhile, blanch the broccoli by throwing the florets into boiling water for 1\u00bd to 2 minutes, until bright green and still slightly crisp. Immediately drain the broccoli and plunge it into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove it from the ice water and set it aside. 3.

Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow it to thicken, about 3 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Let the mixture cook until it thickens. Season with the salt and pepper, then taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. 5. Add half the cooked rice to the bottom of a 3 -quart baking dish, then lay on half the broccoli.

Toss the mixture together to coat the breadcrumbs in butter, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs all over the top. 7. Cover with foil and bake the casserole for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for 15 minutes or until golden brown on top.

When you have a chronic condition, like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc., it is not uncommon for your doctor to prescribe a medication or two to help treat your condition. If you have multiple chronic conditions, these different medications can add up quickly! Taking your medications as prescribed by your doctor helps you manage your chronic conditions and keeps you feeling well. If you find yourself forgetting your medications often, try setting an alarm on your phone or placing your medications somewhere you will notice them more easily. Finding a way to keep your medications organized can also help ease your medication burden. Here are a few ways to help with organizing your medications: Weekly Medication Planners - Medication planners are a relatively cheap tool you can use to keep your medications organized. There are a variety of medication planners available including daily, twice daily, three times a day, and four times a day options. Pick a medication planner that best aligns with your needs. Pharmacy Medication Packaging - Many of our local pharmacies in Guthrie Center, Panora and Stuart offer medication packaging services for a small fee. Your pharmacy could fill your medications weekly or monthly to help make organizing your medications even easier. Reach out to your pharmacy for more details if this interests you. Medication Synchronization Programs - These programs help decrease the number of trips you have to take to the pharmacy each month. By working with your local pharmacy, the pharmacist or pharmacy technician will align all your medication refills to be picked up on the same day. This helps reduce the time you spend requesting refills and helps ensure you don 't run out of your medications by accident! With the holidays quickly approaching, many people will be traveling to visit their loved ones. While you are preparing for these trips, make sure you are packing all your medications too! Plan ahead and call in any medication refills ahead of time so that you aren 't short of any medications while out of town or during any of the upcoming holidays when pharmacies are closed.
