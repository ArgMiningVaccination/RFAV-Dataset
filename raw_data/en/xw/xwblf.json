Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States 3. Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA 4. Monash University, Melbourne, Australia vaccination rates in the USA recently exceeding 45% of the population, it is important to understand the impact that vaccination is having on influenza transmission. Here we used a Bayesian modeling approach, combined with a simple dynamical model of influenza transmission, to estimate this impact. The combined framework synthesized evidence from a range of data sources relating to influenza transmission and vaccination in the USA. We found that, for seasonal epidemics, the number of infections averted ranged from 9.6 million in the 2006/07 season (95% C.I. 8.7 - 10.9 mil.) to 37.2 million (95% C.I. 34.07 - 39.6 mil.) in the 2012/13 season. Expressed in relative terms, the proportion averted ranged from 20.8% (95% C.I. 16.8 - 24.3%) of potential season to 47.5% (95% C.I. 43.7 - 50.8%) in percent was only 1.04% (95% C.I. 0.15 - 3.2%) for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, owing to the late timing of the vaccination program in relation to the pandemic in the Northern hemisphere. In the future, further vaccination coverage, as well as improved influenza vaccines (especially those offering better protection in the elderly) could have an even stronger effect on annual influenza epidemics. 2 Influenza presents a significant public health challenge (1,2). In temperate regions, seasonal epidemics occur every year during the winter months and cause widespread morbidity and mortality (2). Less frequently, pandemics are sparked by the emergence of novel influenza viruses of zoonotic origin that can spread efficiently between people (3,4). Vaccination is the mainstay of public health interventions to control influenza (5). However, some of the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and the immunocompromised (6,7), tend to fail to raise a protective immune response to influenza vaccination (8,9). Yet, the impact of vaccination exceeds the 'direct' protection of those receiving it: by reducing opportunities for transmission, a vaccination programme can also engender 'indirect protection', the effect by which vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are protected as a result of reduced opportunities to acquire infection from those who have been immunized (10). There is a range of empirical evidence for substantial indirect protection arising from influenza vaccination (11-14). Recent studies in different country settings have used combined mathematical and statistical modeling frameworks to show how such indirect protection could be efficiently promoted by expanding coverage to include school-aged children, important transmitters of influenza (15-17). In recognition of these potential benefits, influenza vaccination policy in the UK has recently been expanded to include this age group. The USA offers an example of a country currently at moderate vaccination coverage across all age groups. Since 2010, annual influenza vaccination has been recommended for all individuals aged 6 months and above (18,19). An estimated 45% of the population was vaccinated during the 2012/2013 season (20). It would be of great value to understand the impact of vaccination at such levels: in particular, how much influenza is being averted annually, due to both direct and indirect effects of vaccination. 3 Two recent studies undertook detailed analyses of various data sources to assess the direct effects of vaccination on influenza-associated hospitalizations and medically-attended illness (21) as well as on mortality (22) in the USA. Here, we built on this work by incorporating the indirect effects of vaccination on influenza transmission. We used national data from 2005 onwards on vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, and laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. Using a mathematical model of influenza transmission, we estimated, for each season, the 'counterfactual' epidemic that may have occurred in the absence of vaccination; from this we estimated the infections averted, owing to both direct and indirect effects of large-scale vaccination uptake. METHODS Data sources Incidence: Influenza-associated hospitalizations The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts active surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with influenza, for both children and adults, in sixty counties over ten states across the USA with a catchment population of approximately 22 million people. We used monthly data for each influenza season from 2005 onwards, for four different age-groups: (6 months - 4 years, 5 - 19 years, 20 - 64 years and 65+ years old), and spatially aggregated these data over the USA (Fig 1). As indicated on the lower row of Fig.1, this period includes the H1N1 pandemic, which began in April 2009 and, after two distinct epidemic 'waves', subsided in early 2010. For the purpose of this analysis we concentrated on the second ('Fall') wave, as this was the wave during which vaccination was deployed. 4 To estimate the overall incidence of influenza from FluSurv-NET hospitalizations, it is necessary to estimate what proportion of influenza, from each age-group, becomes hospitalized for influenza; what proportion do so at a hospital participating in the FluSurv-NET network; and finally what proportion of these hospitalized cases test positive in virological testing for influenza. For these parameters we borrowed from previous work (23,24), which estimated (for example) that during the 2009 pandemic, there were 406 symptomatic cases aged 20 - 64 years for every hospitalized case in this age group being reported through the FluSurv-NET system. We used different multipliers for pandemic and seasonal epidemics, as illustrated in Fig.S1 in the appendix. As described below, these factors lend themselves readily to incorporation in a simple probabilistic model for case ascertainment through this surveillance system. Vaccine uptake Estimates of monthly national vaccine coverage, in each of the four age groups, were taken from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for seasons from 2005 to 2011 and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. Fig.1 shows the dynamics of vaccination coverage in relation to that of the epidemic, for each of the seasons concerned in this study. We employed a model structure that keeps track of this changing vaccination coverage during the course of an epidemic. Vaccine effectiveness Field studies typically measure vaccine effectiveness (VE) by recruiting outpatients with medically-attended acute respiratory illness, for virological testing for influenza, and ascertaining vaccination history. Vaccine effectiveness is then expressed as an odds-ratio for being vaccinated in confirmed infection with influenza vs. test-negative controls (e.g.(25)). Ref (21) presents estimates of VE for different seasons from 2005/06 to 2010/11, 5 synthesized from the relevant literature for each of these seasons, which we also used for the present study. For the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, we used updated vaccine effectiveness data reported in ref.(26) and ref.(8), respectively. We fitted a beta distribution to this data, fitting the shape and scale parameters to capture the point estimates and uncertainty in VE. The resulting distributions, used as inputs to the model, are shown in Fig.S2. Transmission model structure We simulated each season separately, treating each as an independent epidemic wave with its own initial conditions and parameters to be fitted. For each season we used a deterministic, compartmental model whose structure is summarized in Fig.2. In this framework we assumed conservatively that a vaccine reduces susceptibility but - in the event of acquiring infection - does not reduce infectiousness. The 'direct' effect of vaccination thus arises from the factor c diminishing susceptibility in the bottom row of Fig.2 (that is, assuming a 'leaky' vaccine (27)). In turn, by reducing the numbers of infected cases, this has the effect of reducing the force of infection , thus giving rise to the 'indirect' effect of vaccination. We also allowed for a delay between vaccination and the development of vaccine-induced immunity in an individual: on average, a delay of 2 weeks (represented by w in Fig.2). The model is spatially aggregated over the USA, but stratified into four age-classes, consistent with FluSurv-NET data (6 months - 4 years, 5 - 19 years, 20 - 64 years and 65+ years old). To parameterize 'mixing' between the age groups we used data from diary-based contact studies from countries in Western Europe (28), assuming that - for relatively broad age strata being employed here - similar contact patterns also apply in the USA. 6 We also made the following simplifying assumptions: All infected cases have the same per-contact infection rate (to be estimated), that does not vary by age. In addition, for simplicity, we did not distinguish different components of the influenza vaccine, that is between influenza A/H1, A/H3 and influenza B. Finally, owing to a lack of data on the relative transmission potential of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, we did not aim to distinguish these states in the model: instead, the transmission rates inferred from this model effectively represented an average across these states. Governing equations for the model are provided in the appendix. Parameter inference The set of model inputs are denoted by the vector , comprised of the following (also, for reference, listed in table 1): (i) The transmission rate per contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual in the absence of vaccination, . (ii) The reduction in susceptibility ci due to vaccination, in age group i. In the model this represents a reduction in the probability of infection per unit time of contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual. (iii) The initial susceptibility Si(0) in the age group i, prior to the epidemic and in the absence of any vaccination. It is important to account for any existing immunity in the different age groups (for example, through past infection or vaccination): neglecting to do so erroneously attributes all immune protection to the vaccination program alone, thus overestimating the impact of vaccination. Here, we assumed that prior immunity is completely protective from infection. (iv) The rate of recovery , assumed to be the same for all age groups 7 (v) The probability pi that a symptomatic case in age-group i is reported through FluSurv-NET. For a given set of parameters and data D we have, for the posterior distribution ! in a Bayesian framework, !\"$\" &((|\"), (**) where $(\") is the 'joint prior distribution' (here assuming independent priors), representing the information available on \" independently of the model, and &((|\") is the classical likelihood of the data given the parameters \". The objective of the analysis is to sample from the posterior distribution !. We next describe individually each of these components in equation (**). Prior distribution, q() For the probabilities pi, we interpreted these as the inverse of the hospitalization-to-case 'multipliers' developed in ref.((24)) for seasonal influenza, and ref.((23)) for the 2009 pandemic. To incorporate uncertainty in the multipliers, we assumed pi to follow a beta-distribution, inferred from the point and uncertainty estimates for the multipliers. The raw multipliers correspond hospitalizations to symptomatic cases. To adjust these additionally to account for asymptomatic cases (since the transmission model averages across symptomatic and asymptomatic cases), we increased the multipliers by a factor k, reflecting the assumption that 67% of infections are symptomatic (incorporating a 95% credible interval of 58 - 75% (29)). Further details, and resulting distributions for the probabilities pi are shown in fig.S1 in the appendix. For remaining parameters, we took uniform (uninformative) priors. 8 Likelihood, L(D | ) For a given parameter vectorq, we evaluated the likelihood as: LD|()=PrReported FluSurv-Net age-class i, month t|()i,t\u00d7PrReported VE in age-class i|()i (i) where i represents a product over the age-groups i . For the first term of this expression, we used a simple 'observation' model for how incidence maps to hospitalizations. Suppose parameter set yields a simulated epidemic with ni(t) incident cases in month t and age-class i (aggregated over vaccination status). Resulting FluSurv-NET notifications thus follow a binomial distribution: Pr(Reported FluSurv-NET incidence in age-class i, month t | ) ~ Bin(ni(t), pi) (ii) where pi is as defined above, and the first term on the right-hand side of equation (i) is obtained through a product of these probabilities over i and t. Next, as noted above, ci is the reduction in the probability of infection per unit time of contact between a vaccinated susceptible individual and an infectious individual. As such, ci is not strictly equivalent to field estimates of vaccine efficacy (VE); whereas ci relates to each infectious contact, VE is taken over the course of the whole epidemic. For a simulated epidemic, therefore, we take the ratio of attack rates amongst vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to find a simulated vaccine efficacy. The choice of ci is then guided by agreement between this and the measured VE. This is the role of the second likelihood term in equation (i) above. 9 In particular, we assumed that vaccination each year is random with respect to prior immunity, and thus does not depend on Si(0). Suppose that the simulated epidemic has an attack rate ARi(0) amongst the unvaccinated in age group i, and likewise for AR i (1) amongst the vaccinated, irrespective of prior immunity. Then the 'simulated' vaccine effectiveness in age group i was calculated as VSi = 1 - ARi(1)/ARi(0), (iii) reflecting how VE is measured in practice, with the notation VS emphasising that this is a simulated vaccine efficacy. Thus to calculate the associated likelihood, if fi is the probability distribution for age group i in Fig.S2, we evaluated: Pr(Reported VE in age-class i | ) = fi(VSi). Sampling from the posterior distribution We sampled from the posterior distribution (equ.(**)) using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (Metropolis-Hastings) procedure (30), From the resulting series of values for outcomes of interest (including cases averted by vaccination), we extracted the median and upper and lower 2.5% percentiles. Further details on the implementation of the MCMC procedure are given in the appendix. RESULTS Fig.3 shows the separate data fits to the trajectories of each epidemic from the 2005-06 influenza season to the 2012-13 season under the 'best-fitting' parameter set for each 10 season (i.e. arising from the mode of the posterior distribution), illustrating that the model mostly captures the transmission dynamics in each of the age groups (see also table S1 for log-likelihoods corresponding to these parameter sets). Fig.4 shows the underlying estimates for the fundamental parameters in the model. The effective reproduction number (both in the presence and absence of vaccination) is calculated by constructing the next-generation matrix for this model (31), with further details given in the appendix. Despite 2009/10 being a pandemic wave, the model fits indicate some existing immunity in those aged 5 yrs and above, which may have arisen in part from the initial 'spring' wave of the pandemic that occurred in April 2009. However, this epidemic is also unique in the over-65s being estimated to have the lowest susceptibility of any age group. Indeed, this is in agreement with evidence for the existence of protective, prior immunity in this age-group, thought to arise from past exposure to related viruses circulating before 1957 (32,33). As described in the appendix, the reproduction number is determined by infectiousness () and the infectious period () as well as by susceptibility. Thus, although the pandemic virus shows the highest population susceptibility, its reproduction number in the absence of vaccination is sometimes exceeded by viruses in other seasons. Fig.S4 additionally shows comparisons between prior (data) and posterior (simulated) estimates for vaccine efficacy, for each season and age group. Fig.5A shows the absolute numbers of infections averted in each season, resulting from these parameters. For comparison, the figure also summarizes findings for the direct effects of vaccination (grey curve), estimated as described in the appendix. The difference between the two curves can roughly be regarded as representing the cases averted due to indirect effects alone. In non-pandemic years, numbers averted vary from a minimum of 9.6 million (95% C.I. 8.7 - 10.9mil) in the 2006/07 season, to million (95% C.I. 34.1 - 39.6mil) in the 2012/13 season. The 09/10 pandemic is a special case in these terms, owing to the early timing of the fall wave with respect to the initiation of vaccination uptake (Fig.1). As a result, it accounts for fewer infections averted (0.97 mil, 95% C.I. 0.14 - 2.94 mil) than in any 11 of the other epidemic seasons. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination has averted a total of 135.2 million infections (95% C.I. 130.0 - 140.7 mil.) in the USA from 2005 to 2013. Although we have not explicitly distinguished symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in the model, under the assumptions described above, roughly two-thirds of these numbers averted would be symptomatic cases. Tables S2 and S3 in the appendix show impact stratified by age group, illustrating (for example) that in general, the youngest (6mo - 4yr) and oldest (65+ yrs) tend to show the greatest percent reductions in attack rate. Fig.4 illustrates the extent to which seasons can vary in their underlying epidemiological parameters, in ways that shape the impact of a vaccination programme: for example, a weak vaccination programme applied to a large epidemic (arising, for instance, from high susceptibility) may still result in many cases averted, owing to the size of the epidemic. As context, Fig.S3 (see appendix) shows the size of each season as measured by the cumulative cases reported through FluSurv-NET. To adjust for these differences between seasons, Fig.5B plots the estimated fraction of cases averted: that is, the percentage reduction of the final attack rate, by vaccination. Overall, during seasonal epidemic years, results suggest that vaccination has prevented roughly between 30 - 45% of cases per season. Once again, due to the timing of the pandemic wave, the fraction averted in 2009/10 is a special case. DISCUSSION Vaccination programmes act in the context of complex interactions between a variety of factors including susceptibility in the human population; intrinsic viral transmissibility; and the effectiveness and coverage of the vaccine itself. In this work we have aimed to combine these factors in a parsimonious modeling framework, synthesizing different sources of evidence to capture the effect of the vaccination in the USA over the past eight years. Our analysis shows how, given sufficient coverage, a vaccination program can affect influenza 12 transmission. In particular, capturing both direct and indirect effects of vaccination, we estimate that annual vaccination in the USA has averted 99 million cases between 2005 and 2013. It is notable that such impact is possible with the use of influenza vaccines having a moderate level of coverage, and a measured VE of typically 60% or less (34), which would appear moderate, particularly in the context of other vaccines such as for measles (35,36). However, an important point is that, in comparison with these diseases, the effective reproduction number of influenza is relatively low, even in the absence of vaccination: our estimates for this quantity (Fig.4) are consistent with the range of 1 - 2 typically found in the literature (37,38). On the population level, therefore, sufficiently wide deployment of a vaccine with even moderate VE has the potential to substantially impact the transmission of influenza. This phenomenon is especially apparent in Fig.5, where indirect effects (the difference between the two curves) account for a substantial proportion of cases averted, indeed greater than direct effects alone (grey curve). Such effects notwithstanding, increased coverage - as well as the development of vaccines with improved effectiveness (especially in the elderly) - will substantially promote the public health impact of influenza vaccination. Indeed future immunization - enhanced in these ways - may even succeed in interrupting transmission altogether (bringing Re below 1). Our results also illustrate the factors, other than vaccination rates, that can strongly influence the size of seasonal epidemics. Two examples are the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons, which were comparable in their vaccination coverage and transmission potential (Ra in Fig.4). However, the 2012/2013 season was notably large in its magnitude (39), and 2011/2012 the converse (40) (see also Fig.1). Our results suggest that, rather than vaccination impact, a major difference between these two epidemics was the amount of existing immunity in the population (Fig.4B). Notably, the 2010/11 season was preceded by two years of virus circulation without vaccine-altering antigenic change in either influenza H1 13 or H3 (see table S4). Together with ongoing vaccination coverage in these years, the population immunity thus accumulated could account for the low susceptibility in the 2010/2011 season. One implication for vaccine impact is that epidemics with higher levels of existing immunity in the population would tend to show a lower impact attributable to vaccination. More broadly, comparing across epidemic seasons, these results illustrate that - although increasing vaccination rates may be expected to diminish the sizes of influenza epidemics over time - in practice the natural variability in other factors (existing immunity, virus infectiousness, etc) can play an equally strong role. Even in such changing circumstances, our results suggest that vaccination has nonetheless had a substantial effect on transmission in the USA between 2005 and 2013. As with any analysis of retrospective surveillance data, there are some limitations to note. First, to describe contact patterns between different age groups, we chose to approximate conditions in the USA with contact patterns in the UK, for which data exist. Nonetheless, while it would be valuable to validate this assumption once data are available for the USA, we do not expect qualitative features of the mixing matrix (including individuals mixing preferentially with those in their own age groups, and the most mixing occurring between school-age children) to differ substantially between the USA and the UK. In the absence of controlled studies of influenza transmission in the population, individual-based simulations (which offer explicit demographic and population mixing scenarios (41)) may offer helpful comparisons with the findings in this study. Second, as the parameter inputs to the model, we used 'multipliers' to relate influenza hospitalizations to cases in the community. Our work illustrates how multipliers naturally play a central role in capturing the relationship between reported data and the underlying epidemic process. However, estimated through dedicated studies combining household telephone surveys and audits of hospitalization records, these multipliers are so far only available from a handful of studies (23,24). Epidemics may vary from year to year in various 14 ways including their severity in different age groups, for example with the 2012/13 season being particularly severe in the elderly (39). While Fig 4B suggests that this arose from elevated susceptibility in this season and age group, it could equally arise from a change in hospitalization rates. Accordingly, repeated studies to estimate multipliers across several seasons will allow a systematic assessment of how these hospitalization rates vary through time. Moreover, while our work focuses on hospitalization data, a valuable extension for future work would be to also capture milder forms of influenza-related illness, potentially incorporating broader sources of data, such as virology and syndromic surveillance. Such estimations could be especially helpful for addressing the economic implications of influenza vaccination. Third, for simplicity, we aggregated H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A, as well as influenza B, in this analysis. With most influenza epidemics being typically dominated by either one or the other subtype, we may expect this assumption to have only a limited effect as long as each seasonal epidemic is treated separately - as we have done here. Nonetheless, a more detailed model resolving these antigenic variants would benefit from more finely-resolved data resolving type and subtype, particularly for hospitalization multipliers (discussed above), and VE data (at present only disaggregated from 2010/11 season onwards). Fourth, the dynamical model entailed several simplifying assumptions that could be relaxed with improved data in future work. For example, we did not attempt to distinguish symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in the model, with the transmission parameter + essentially representing an average across these states. To address this simplification would require better data, not only on the proportion of infections becoming symptomatic, but also on the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic infections. Such data would also permit a better understanding of the extent to which vaccination reduces not just symptomatic illness (as addressed by current VE studies), but also infection. For simplicity, our approach assumes both effects to be the same. Moreover, we assumed some underlying parameters 15 to be fixed regardless of age: future work would benefit in particular from a better quantification of how the mean infectious period (gamma) and the infectious dose per contact (informing beta), tend to vary between children and adults. Also, to avoid overfitting the model, we assumed a simplified effect of vaccination, in which we assume that it reduces susceptibility alone by a factor c. This is likely to be conservative, as there may additionally be some vaccine effect on infectiousness. With currently available data, it is difficult to separate these effects empirically: to do so, there is a need for better correlates of transmission potential, from influenza infection (42). Additionally, we have not considered the potential effects of climatic and other seasonal factors (43-45) in shaping seasonal influenza epidemics: future work could explore the potential influence of these factors on the vaccination impact addressed here. Another limitation might arise from changing sources of vaccine coverage estimates from the NHIS for the 2005/06 through 2010/11 influenza seasons to the BRFSS for the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons (46). BRFSS is a telephone survey while the NHIS is a probability sample of households, and they therefore use different weighting procedures to reflect the different survey designs. In conclusion, vaccination in the USA has had a significant impact on morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. In assessing the impact of vaccination, transmission models offer a helpful tool with which to bring together diverse sources of data and to systematically disentangle the various factors involved in shaping an epidemic. Our results illustrate how a vaccination programme can, in addition to directly mitigating morbidity and mortality, also reduce transmission: in so doing, vaccination can offer a powerful tool for controlling influenza.

Schematic illustration of the model structure, for a single influenza season (epidemic wave). For clarity in illustrating the overall structure, the model is shown here without age stratification (see governing equations in the appendix for the incorporation of age-classes). Here, S is the number of individuals susceptible to infection; I is the number infected and infectious; and R is the number who are recovered and immune. Individuals are vaccinated at a per-capita rate r(t), which varies from month to month and is inferred from the data on vaccination coverage. is the 'force of infection': in the presence of age structure, it additionally incorporates a matrix representing 'mixing' between the different age groups (see appendix for details). Once vaccinated, we assume that individuals take on average 2 weeks to develop vaccine-induced immunity. Thus, in this diagram, the top row represents those who are unvaccinated, while the middle row represents those who have received vaccination but are not yet immune. Upon acquiring vaccine-derived immunity at a per-capita rate w, these individuals subsequently enter the bottom row. Only those in this latter state have the benefits of vaccine-induced immunity, susceptibility diminished by a factor c. Figure 3.
