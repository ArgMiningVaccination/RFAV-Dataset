Globally, this chronic disease causes about 5% of all deaths each year. Absence of urgent action will further increase the DM deaths by more than 50% in the next ten years as alarmed by World Health Organization. Similarly in Malaysia, DM is a growing concern with its marked increase in prevalence rate. The prevalence of DM among adults 30 years old and above in Malaysia was elevated for nearly three-fold within 15 years from 8.3% in 1996 to 20.8% in 2011 [ [2](#B2)]. Over 60% of the world's population affected by DM, where most of the incidence was from Asia, the world's most populous region [ [1](#B1), [3](#B3), [4](#B4)]. It is foreseen that the number of individuals with DM in each Asian country will escalate substantially in coming decades. Malaysia ranked ninth among Asian countries, with high DM estimates (11.6% of comparative prevalence); and this figure is projected to reach 13.8% in year 2030 [ [4](#B4)]. [5](#B5)]. In view of this, the potential vascular complications in diabetic patients should be evaluated early and treated at an early stage. Besides the classical genetic, lifestyle and treatment-related factors may interact with one another, producing a complex combination of side effects which ultimately dictate patients' health condition. Focus has long been directed towards the impact of single dietary components in nutritional epidemiology, such a \"reductionist\" approach can reveal the pivotal role of individual nutrients in the occurrence of disease including CVD. [6](#B6)]. The effectiveness of MNT in the management of DM has been well established and previous reviews have provided comprehensive recommendations for MNT in the management of DM [ [7](#B7)]. In accordance with the recommendations of the MNT Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes [ [8](#B8)], energy requirement of a diabetic should be sufficient to attain and maintain a reasonable body weight for adult. Protein recommendations would be lower for individuals with evidence of nephropathy [ [6](#B6)]. Besides, the relationship between diet and DM has been focused on macronutrient content, proper micronutrient intake should also be achieved for optimal health. Moreover, vitamin and mineral intake should meet the established requirements for health. [6](#B6), [8](#B8)]. Moreover, the use of traditional remedies could interact with the prescribed drugs. To date, there is lack of clinical evidences on the dietary supplementation, as well as the use of traditional medicine among T2DM patients of the multi-ethnic groups in Malaysia whose social and cultural backgrounds are different. Materials and Methods Sample selection and data collection Ethical approvals Anthropometric measurements [9](#B9)]. Nutrient intakes and dietary assessment [10](#B10)]. The album consists of actual standard portion size photographs of individual foods which were useful in assisting subjects to estimate amounts eaten as fractions or multiples of the illustrated reference portions. Furthermore, measurement visuals including drawings were also used by the subjects to facilitate quantification of the foods and beverages reported. [11](#B11)], China Food Composition 2002 [ [12](#B12)], ASEAN Food Composition Tables [ [13](#B13)] and The Concise New Zealand Food Composition Tables [ [14](#B14)] were sought for total EI and nutrient contents. [8](#B8)] for dietary adequacy assessment. [8](#B8)], the macronutrient contribution to the total EI should be in the ranges of 50-60% and 20-30% for carbohydrate and fat respectively, and 0.8-1.0 g/kg (T2DM patients < 60 years old) and 1.0-1.25 g/kg (T2DM patients 60 years old) for adequate protein intake, depending on individualization based on treatment goals, physiologic parameters, and medication usage [ [6](#B6), [8](#B8)]. [15](#B15)]. The ratio between reported total EI and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was used to examine the possibility of under-reporting of energy. Basal metabolic rate was calculated using the equation established [ [16](#B16)] due to its relevance to the local context. An EI/BMR ratio below 1.2 was considered as inadequate for the maintenance of body weight to identify low energy reporters [ [17](#B17)]. Dietary supplement and traditional remedy intake Statistical analyses Results Patient characteristics [Table 1](#T1)). Socio-demographic backgrounds [Table 1](#T1)demonstrates the socio-demographic characteristics of the study subjects. Overall, the mean age of the subjects at the time of enrolment was 55.7 \u00b1 9.2 years old with the range of duration being from 30 to 78 years, and majority of them fell in the groups of middle age and elderly (50-69.9 years). The average duration of T2DM of subjects was approximately 10 years, and the subjects with CVD were tended to have longer duration of T2DM (p = 0.021). The proportion of male and female was 47.9% and 52.1%, respectively. There was a significant difference between men and women in the prevalence of CVD, with the disease affected more men than women (p = 0.005). In terms of ethnicity, approximately half of the subjects were Malays, followed by Indians and Chinese. This statistically significant racial distribution reflected the country's racial distribution with Malays being the largest group in Malaysia. Majority of the subjects were married, had retired from work, of low educational status, and had completed non-tertiary education, respectively. Anthropometric measurements [Table 1](#T1)). Dietary intakes [Table 2](#T2). On the whole, the mean total EI of the subjects was 1674 \u00b1 694 kcal per day, and the subjects with CVD were known to consume higher calories (p = 0.001) than the non-CVD subjects. Likewise, the mean carbohydrate (p = 0.003), protein (p = 0.020) and fat intake (p = 0.006) of the T2DM patients with CVD were significantly higher than the non-CVD counterparts. The mean intakes of cholesterol, fibre, minerals and all vitamins were comparable between CVD and non-CVD groups. Distinct differences in the EI were seen among all patients with and without CVD, in which the intake of energy by CVD patients was found to be higher than the non-CVD group by about 264 kcal. The mean carbohydrate intake of the patients was approximately 230.2 g, which contributed to 55.6% of the total EI. T2DM patients with CVD had a significant higher mean carbohydrate intake than the non-CVD counterparts (p = 0.003). The mean protein intake of subjects was 65.8 g (15.7% of total EI), and the CVD patients had higher protein intake than the non-CVD patients (p = 0.02). Mean fat intake was estimated to be about 54.3 g (28.6% of total EI) for the entire studied population while a 9.8 g difference was noted between CVD and non-CVD patients. Adequacy of dietary intake [Table 3](#T3). The results showed that 14.7% and 18.2% of the subjects aged < 60 and 60 years old, respectively, were found to achieve the energy requirements. The majority of the subjects had inadequate EI (65.3% for subjects < 60 years old and 40.5% for subjects 60 years old). On the contrary, 20.0% of the subjects < 60 years old and 41.3% of the subjects 60 years old had excess EI. Similarly, protein intakes of the subjects for all age groups were mostly inadequate. Only 20.1% (< 60 years old) and 13.4% ( 60 years old) of the subjects achieved the recommended protein intake, whilst 31.4% and 20.6% of the subjects had exceed the acceptable range of protein intakes. The percentage of calories from proteins was not different among the CVD and non-CVD patients. The patients with and without CVD of all age groups had achieved similar carbohydrate intake. Dietary supplement and traditional remedy intakes [Table 4](#T4)details the use of dietary supplements and traditional remedies among the T2DM patients with and without CVD. The results showed that 52.4% of subjects used dietary supplements (either herbal or non-herbal), and 12.1% of them took single traditional remedy or in various combinations. Of the dietary supplements, vitamins were the most frequently taken (39.0%), in which 20.4%, 6.7%, 10.2%, 4.5%, 3.8% the vitamin B1, B6, B12, vitamin B complex, multivitamin, vitamin C, folic acid and other vitamins, respectively. This was followed by trace elements, whereby almost 10.9% of them took supplementation of minerals (i.e. calcium, iron and magnesium) and calcium (7.7%) was the most popular. Other than that, 16.6% of the subjects consumed various natural products, such as herbal supplements, evening primrose oil, gingko biloba, bamboo salt, shake, fish oil, cod liver oil, flax seed oil, grape seed oil, plant extracts (e.g. cranberry and blueberry extracts), bee pollen, apple cider, chlorophyl, spirulina, and pearl powder. The other 7.0% of the subjects have taken coenzyme Q10, glucosamine, chondroitin, protein, fibre, alpha-lipid, lecithin, beta-carotene, transfer glutathione accelerator, and stem cell enhancer. However, the intakes of traditional remedies and dietary supplements were not significantly different between the CVD and non-CVD subjects. Discussion [6](#B6), [18](#B18)]. The distribution of calories for the macronutrients among subjects was inconsistent with the recommendations of the Malaysian Dietitians' Association for a healthy diet for T2DM [ [8](#B8)]. Majority of the studied subjects failed to achieve the recommendation for total EI, with high percentage of subjects reported intake less than requirement, yet most of them were either overweight or obese. A comparison with an earlier local study by Moy and Abdul Rahman revealed the similar trend where the mean EI of the study achieved only about 72% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) [ [19](#B19)]. The discrepancy between the inadequate EI and obesity status among the subjects could be due to the limitations of the 24-hour dietary recall method of dietary intake assessment, such as underestimation either from the participants or the interviewer; subjects did not give a true picture of their daily intake or social desirability response bias; and daily variation of subjects' diet. It is also likely that the subjects are on strict diet control, amounted to altered portions and type of foods consumed. As most subjects in this study are overweight and obese, total caloric intake must be appropriate to weight management goal, particularly among the CVD patients with higher total EI noticed. [20](#B20)]. Rather, the aim of the study was to present the overall energy and nutrient intakes of all samples obtained. Indeed, actual EI and hence nutrient intakes are likely to be under-estimated as pointed out by a past study [ [20](#B20)]. Deliberate fabrication, failure to remember food items or whole eating events, lack of knowledge of the composition of mixed dishes and inability to estimate portion size accurately have all been considered as potential contributors to the under-reporting problem. In some cases, age, sex and BMI, as well as other demographic and psychological factors, such as embarrassment may also be the factors associated with low-energy reporting. [20](#B20)] that patients with T2DM tend to have a lower carbohydrate intake than that of the general population. This trend is not unusual because patients were battling with hyperglycaemia, and the low-carbohydrate options that are readily available from the food supply offer an approach to glucose management. Of the three macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein and fat), carbohydrate intake may have the greatest influence on blood glucose, although the overall balance of micro- and macronutrients has implications for diabetic complications. This is because carbohydrate is the major insulin secretagogue, it is thus believed that providing a consistent carbohydrate intake spaced throughout the day helps diabetics maintain appropriate blood glucose levels and maximizes the effectiveness of drug therapy. [21](#B21)], as can be reviewed that restriction of protein positively affect urine albumin excretion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with incipient or manifest nephropathy [ [22](#B22)]. Therefore, the subjects with diabetic nephropathy have been recommended to be on low protein diets, and individuals with DM are also generally often advised to limit protein intake to protect their renal functions although there is conconsiderably insufficient clinical evidence and has created some doubt about the practical effectiveness of protein restriction in diabetic nephropathy prevention [ [21](#B21), [23](#B23)]. These have possibly resulting in the phenomenon that the protein intakes of the subjects in this study were mostly inadequate. Despite the speculation that excessive protein intake may be linked with the development of diabetic nephropathy, the current evidence suggests this is not a risk at intakes recommended by MNT Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes [ [8](#B8)]. [24](#B24)]. A diet high in dietary fat may increase calories, thereby increasing the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance, and worsening glucose control [ [25](#B25)]. These may explain the significant association of dietary total fat with higher CVD prevalence in this research. Additionally, high-fat diets increase postprandial lipemia and chylomicron remnants, both of which are associated with increased risk of CAD [ [26](#B26)]. Interestingly, it is pleased to see from the present findings that the average dietary cholesterol intake by a very high proportion of subjects was below the recommended levels. In fact, individuals do not need to consume sources of dietary cholesterol because the body makes more than enough for physiological and structural functions [ [27](#B27)], as such, cholesterol intake in the diet often targeted to be restricted [ [8](#B8)]. [6](#B6), [8](#B8), [28](#B28)]. Although there is no significant difference seen between CVD and fibre intake of the subjects studied, it has long been known that cardiovascular events are linked with fibre intakes as evident by abundant published investigations [ [29](#B29), [30](#B30), [31](#B31), [32](#B32), [33](#B33)]. It appeared through a variety of mechanisms, such as improving blood lipid profiles [ [34](#B34), [35](#B35)], lowering blood pressure [ [35](#B35), [36](#B36), [37](#B37)], insulin sensitivity [ [35](#B35), [38](#B38), [39](#B39)] and fibrinolytic activity [ [40](#B40)]. These findings prompted worries to the subjects in the present study because the fibre intake of majority of them (89.4%) was below the recommended levels, and only about 10% of the remaining subjects achieved the recommended fibre intake. This may explain the insignificant difference of fibre intakes between CVD and non-CVD groups of subjects, as nearly all of the subjects had inadequate fibre intake. What is of great concern is that a diet adequate in fibre-containing foods usually has lower calories, fat, and refined sugar, and is also usually rich in micronutrients and phytochemicals that have additional health benefits. A fibre-rich meal is digested slower in the gastrointestinal tract, thus promoting satiety. These salubrious features of a high-fibre diet promote the treatment and prevention of overweight, obesity, T2DM and CVD [ [35](#B35)]. Nevertheless, the recommended intake of 20-30 g/day is not usually met because of low intake of fruits, vegetables, whole and high-fibre grain products, and legumes, which explain the inadequate fibre intake phenomenon among subjects in the current study. Palatability, limited food choices, and gastrointestinal side effects might be some of the potential barriers to achieving such high-fibre intakes [ [18](#B18)]. [41](#B41)]. This is further supported by the data in this study that about one third of the subjects diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy (33.1%) were prescribed vitamin B1, B6, B12 tablets. Subjects are very likely to incorporate dietary supplements and traditional remedies into their treatment plans, may be in an attempt to improve their health and to prevent further illness. Nonetheless, reported dietary supplements and traditional remedies use for the treatment of T2DM and CVD in the present research were relatively uncommon. The analysis suggests that the subjects in this study do not seem to be using dietary supplements and traditional remedies specifically for their neurological disorders, such as peripheral neuropathy, is deficiency of B vitamins. Therefore, vitamin B1, B6, B12 tablets are frequently used for preventing and treating peripheral neuropathy [ [41](#B41)]. This is further supported by the data in this study that about one third of the subjects diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy (33.1%) were prescribed vitamin B1, B6, B12 tablets. Subjects are very likely to incorporate dietary supplements and traditional remedies into their treatment plans, may be in an attempt to improve their health and to prevent further illness. Nonetheless, reported dietary supplements and traditional remedies use for the treatment of T2DM and CVD in the present research were relatively uncommon. The analysis suggests that the subjects in this study do not seem to be using dietary supplements and traditional remedies specifically for their T2DM and CVD only; in reality, more towards holistic approach to general health care. [22](#B22)]. These include supplements containing various dietary fibres, n-3 fatty acids, minerals, trace elements and some herbs. In the past few years, a number of controlled clinical studies have reported the effects of nutritional supplements on CVD risk [ [42](#B42), [43](#B43), [44](#B44)]. These studies have been conducted on post-MI subjects or subjects at high risk for CVD, although some studied healthy subjects. The clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of antioxidant supplements on CVD morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the lack of efficacy was demonstrated consistently for different doses of various antioxidants in diverse population groups [ [45](#B45), [46](#B46), [47](#B47), [48](#B48)]. In agreement with these studies, the present data also does not justify the association between CVD and the routine use of nutritional supplements. In truth, the principal benefits of nutritional approaches to the treatment and prevention of DM are derived from the appropriate intake of usual foods. Because dietary supplements and traditional remedies have not been a component of any traditional dietary pattern, it is believed that longer term evaluation in formal clinical trials is required before offering firm recommendations. [24](#B24)] has not been updated for over 15 years and this may affect the accuracy of the estimation of nutrient intakes. [49](#B49)]. So the food databases from other countries such as Singapore, China, and USA as described were particularly useful in providing information on dietary fibre as well as dietary cholesterol. "}
