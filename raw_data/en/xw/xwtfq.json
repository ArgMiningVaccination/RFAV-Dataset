Whether it's the invention of vital infrastructure such as [cable suspension bridges](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/south-america/peru/inca-grass-rope-bridge-qeswachaka-unesco/) or sport for fun like [lacrosse](https://worldlacrosse.sport/about-world-lacrosse/origin-history/), so much of what exists in modern culture today is a direct result of what was created before newcomers occupied these lands. And the world's health ecosystem, ranging from preventative measures to administration of medicine is no different, owing much of its practices and innovations to those ancestral peoples and healers. Here are seven inventions used every day in medicine and public health that we owe to Native Americans. And in most cases, couldn't live without today: 1. Syringes In 1853 a Scottish doctor named Alexander Wood was credited for the creation of the first hypodermic syringe, but a [much earlier tool](https://books.google.com/books?id=FlBUDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=syringe+bird+bone+native+american&source=bl&ots=AkirAUDoJe&sig=ACfU3U2vwqJPaJBtfwCs11Z_Gc0YRhCjaA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjX88_dltjlAhXNslkKHUUWBDcQ6AEwGnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=syringe%20bird%20bone%20native%20american&f=false) existed. Before colonization, Indigenous peoples had created a method using a sharpened hollowed-out bird bone connected to an animal bladder that could hold and inject fluids into the body. These earliest syringes were used to do everything from [inject medicine to irrigate wounds](https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/10-native-inventions-and-innovations-that-changed-the-world-M0ZwDx1Ku0mQvn4Jn0KP4Q). There are also cases in which these tools were even used to clean ears and serve as enemas. 2. Pain Relievers Native American healers led the way in pain relief. For example, willow bark (the bark of a tree) is widely known to have been ingested as an anti-inflammatory and pain reliever. In fact, it contains a chemical called [salicin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/salicin), which is a confirmed anti-inflammatory that when consumed generates salicylic acid - the active ingredient in modern-day aspirin tablets. In addition to many ingestible pain relievers, topical ointments were also frequently used for wounds, cuts and bruises. Two well-documented pain relievers include [capsaicin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/capsaicin) (a chemical still referenced today that is derived from peppers) and jimson weed as a topical analgesic. 3. Oral Birth Control Oral birth control was introduced to the United States in the 1960's as a means of preventing pregnancy. But something with a similar purpose existed in indigenous cultures long before. Plant-based practices such as ingesting herbs [dogbane](http://www.nativetech.org/plantgath/dogbane.htm) and [stoneseed](https://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/natural-birth-control-zmaz70mjzkin) were used for at least two centuries earlier than western pharmaceuticals to prevent unwanted pregnancy. And while they are not as effective as current oral contraception, there are studies suggesting stoneseed in particular has contraceptive properties. 4. Sun Screen North American Indians have medicinal purposes for more than 2,500 plant species - and that is just what's currently known between existing practices. But, for hundreds of years many Native cultures had a common skin application that involved mixing ground plants with water to create [products that protected skin from the sun](https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/suppositories-yeah-a-native-made-it-more-indigenous-inventions-PBRMxaIqIU2ZO0-A92i2YQ). Sunflower oil, wallflower and sap from aloe plants have all been recorded for their use in protecting the skin from the sun. There are also noted instances of using animal fat and oils from fish as sunscreen. 5. Baby Bottles It wouldn't be considered sanitary - or safe - by today's standards, but long before settlers made their way to American lands, the Iroquois, Seneca and others created bottles to aid in feeding infants. The invention consisted of the insides of a bear and a bird's quill. After cleaning, drying and oiling [bear intestines](https://books.google.com/books?id=yhnXMPR8I9oC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=baby+bottles+seneca+bear+intestine&source=bl&ots=0zkJYxsDnp&sig=ACfU3U3kgwk2XKr69nfY2bRmlBfebRYK1w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7l-Sa6tPlAhUBc98KHSblDvIQ6AEwF3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=baby%20bottles%20seneca%20bear%20intestine&f=false), a hollowed quill would be attached as a teat, allowing concoctions of pounded nuts, meat and water to be suckled by infants for nutrition. 6. Mouth Wash & Oral Hygiene Although tribes across the continent used various plants and methods for cleaning teeth, it is rumored that people on the American continent had more effective dental practices than the Europeans who arrived. In particular areas, mouthwash was known to be made from a plant called [goldthread](https://wildadirondacks.org/adirondack-wildflowers-goldthread-coptis-trifolia.html) to clean out the mouth. It was also used by many Native cultures as [pain relief for teething infants](https://absolutehistory.com/anthropology-and-history/cultures/amazing-native-american-inventions/41/) or a tooth infection by rubbing it directly onto the gums. 7. Suppositories Hemorrhoids are nothing new. Nor is the pain and discomfort associated with having hemorrhoids. But before modern-day solutions and dietary changes, Indigenous peoples throughout the Americas created suppositories from [dogwood trees](https://www.rxlist.com/american_dogwood/supplements.htm). Dogwood is still used today (although not often) externally for wounds. But hundreds of years ago small plugs were fashioned by moistening, compressing and inserting the dogwood to treat hemorrhoids. It's easy to go about our day-to-day lives without thinking about the role that public health and medicine play in keeping us safe and healthy. But it's even easier to take those things for granted without recognizing the brilliant innovations and inventors that got us where we are today. In some instances, we have sanitized, improved upon and perfected our modern-day practices. But in other instances, we are not much further than our ancestors were. Those healers who knew how to use the land and its resources to produce effective methods and substances for ailments. As technology moves us ever forward, let's not forget that as we grow into the future, we are still rooted in history. "}
