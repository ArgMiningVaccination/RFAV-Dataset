Ayurveda and Meditation: The prime philosophy of Ayurveda lies in maintaining a healthy relationship between the mind, body & spirit without reaching extremes in any cases thus connecting with the spiritual part of oneself. A healthy mind leads to a healthy body. That is why medical practitioners always recommend their patients to develop a positive attitude towards any type of treatment before commencing it.

Meditation serves its intention of mentoring the mind, thus freeing it from all worldly worries and to attain the sole purpose of a long life. - Meditation and Mental Wellness: 'Face is the index of mind' is a well known adage. According to Ayurveda 'Body is the index of mind'. Even a physically fit person can soon fall prey for diseases if his mind is deemed with worries!!! Meditation plays a main role in strengthening one's mind by greatly reducing mental stress, anxiety, fear, depression and by inducing positive thoughts, self esteem, self control and empathy. [It deeply relaxes the mind & the body by developing positive energy due to the changes in the brain wave patterns.](http://www.ayushveda.com/meditation/meditation-work.htm) - Meditation and Self-Realization: Meditation helps an individual to lead a disciplined life focusing on [Self-realization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-realization), which is one of the greatest treasures to be acquired by every human being and is often difficult to pursue.
