Learn more about treating and preventing coughs.", "sitename": "Medical News Today", "date": "2020-01-01", "cleaned_text": "A number of home remedies, such as honey and saltwater, may help a cough go away naturally. If home remedies do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available. [Allergies](/articles/264419), [infections](/articles/196271), and [acid reflux](/articles/146619) are just a few possible causes of a [cough](/articles/220349). Some natural remedies may help relieve a cough. This article reviews natural remedies that may help treat a cough. It is important to remember that the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements) People who want to try natural remedies to treat their cough should consider researching sources and brands. Additionally, some herbs and supplements can interfere with medications, which may result in unwanted side effects. It is best to consult a doctor before taking supplements. People use a range of natural remedies to treat a persistent cough. While they may help some people, it is important to note that some of the following remedies have limited evidence to support their use. This means a person may or may not find that the remedies work for them. 1. Honey According to research, [honey](/articles/264667) may relieve a cough. In a [2021 review](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/57) of studies, researchers looked at the effect of using honey to treat coughs in [upper respiratory infections](/articles/323886). The researchers found that honey was superior to usual care, both in suppressing the cough and in helping prevent the need for antibiotics. In [another study](https://journals.lww.com/ebp/Citation/2021/03000/Is_honey_better_than_dextromethorphan_at.34.aspx), researchers compared honey with dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant. The researchers found that both honey and dextromethorphan worked to suppress coughs. They noted that honey scored slightly higher in one trial and on par with dextromethorphan in another. A person can use this remedy by swallowing a spoonful of honey or adding it to a hot drink, such as an herbal tea. 2. Ginger [Ginger](/articles/265990.php) may ease a dry or asthmatic cough, as it has [anti-inflammatory](/articles/320233) properties. It may also relieve [nausea](/articles/269511) and [pain](/articles/145750). Only a few older studies have looked at ginger's effect on coughs. A study from [2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1479972315583043) examined 10 different natural products used in traditional Asian medicines, including ginger. The researchers found that ginger and other remedies, including honey, have played a continued role in traditional medicine. While a long history of use can have valuable implications for a treatment's effectiveness, the researchers noted that their study may provide future researchers with a place to start when examining natural solutions to coughs. People often add ginger to dishes or drink it in tea. However, in some cases, ginger tea can cause [stomach upset](/articles/163484.php) or [heartburn](/articles/9151.php). 3. Hot fluids While current research is lacking, an older study from [2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19145994/) [cough](/articles/220349), [runny nose](/articles/325248), and [sneezing](/articles/321305). However, people with additional cold or [flu](/articles/15107.php) symptoms may benefit from warming up their beverages. The same study reports that hot beverages alleviate even more symptoms, including a [sore throat](/articles/311449), [chills](/articles/chills), and [fatigue](/articles/248002.php). The symptom relief was immediate and remained for a continued period after finishing the hot beverage. Hot beverages that may be comforting include: - clear [broths](/articles/323903) - herbal teas - decaffeinated [black tea](/articles/292160) [warm water](/articles/319673) - warm fruit juices 4. Steam A [wet cough](/articles/327442), which is one that produces mucus or phlegm, may improve with steam. To try this method, a person should take a hot shower or bath and allow the bathroom to fill with steam. They should stay in this steam for a few minutes until symptoms subside. They can drink a glass of water afterward to cool down and prevent [dehydration](/articles/153363.php). Alternatively, people can make a steam bowl. A person can do this by: - filling a large bowl with hot water - adding herbs or essential oils, such as eucalyptus or rosemary, which may help relieve congestion - leaning over the bowl and placing a towel over the head, which traps the steam so the person can breathe it in - breathing in the steam for about [10-15 minutes](https://www.nhsfife.org/media/35666/steam-inhalation-leaflet.pdf) A person may find steaming helpful when done one to two times per day. While many believe steam will help with cough and other symptoms, not all evidence supports this. For example, a [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483632/) 5. Marshmallow root [Marshmallow root](/articles/324860) is an herb with a long history of use as a treatment for coughs and [sore throats](/articles/311449). The herb can ease irritation resulting from coughing because of its high mucilage content. Mucilage is a thick, gluey substance that coats the throat. One older, [small study](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88934) found that an herbal cough syrup containing marshmallow root, along with [thyme](/articles/266016) and ivy, effectively relieved coughs resulting from common colds and respiratory tract infections. After 12 days of taking the syrup, 90% of the participants rated its effectiveness as good or very good. In a [2020 in vitro study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090173/) They found that the root extract has [antioxidative](/articles/301506) and anti-inflammatory properties and provided similar relief to diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Marshmallow root is also available as a dried herb or a bagged tea. A person should add hot water to either and then drink it immediately or allow it to cool first. The longer the marshmallow root steeps in the water, the more mucilage will be in the drink. Side effects can include stomach upset, but it may be possible to counter this by drinking extra fluids. Marshmallow root is available for purchase in health stores or online. 6. Saltwater gargle People have used [saltwater gargles](/articles/325238) for a long time to help alleviate sore throat and symptoms associated with the [common cold](/articles/166606). It may help loosen mucus and alleviate some pain. However, it likely will not help reduce viral load. In a [2021 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99866-w) [COVID-19](/articles/covid-19). They found that several commercial brands helped with reducing viral load, but a lab-made saltwater solution did not effectively kill the virus. A person can make a saltwater gargle by: - stirring [1/2 teaspoon](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sore-throat/)of salt into a cup of warm water until it dissolves - allowing the solution to cool slightly before using it to gargle - letting the mixture sit at the back of the throat for a few moments before spitting it out - doing this several times each day until the cough improves Young children and people with [high blood pressure](/articles/159283) should avoid using saltwater gargles 7. Bromelain [Bromelain](/articles/323783) is an enzyme that comes from [pineapples](/articles/276903). It is most plentiful in the core of the fruit. It has [anti-inflammatory properties](https://autoimmunediseases.imedpub.com/role-of-bromelain-as-herbal-antiinflammatory-compound-using-in-vitro-and-in-vivo-model-of-colitis.php?aid=21395) and may also have mucolytic properties, which means it can break down mucus and remove it from the body. Some people drink pineapple juice daily to reduce mucus in the throat and suppress coughing. However, there may not be enough bromelain in the juice to relieve symptoms. Bromelain supplements are available and may be more effective at relieving coughs. However, it is best for a person to speak with a doctor before trying any new supplements. Bromelain [is a potential](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(14)00520-5/fulltext) allergen, and the substance may also cause side effects and interact with medications. People who take [blood thinners](/articles/327165) or specific [antibiotics](/articles/10278.php) should not take bromelain. 8. Thyme [Thyme](/articles/266016) has both culinary and medicinal uses and is a commonly used remedy for a cough, sore throat, [bronchitis](/articles/8888.php), and [digestive issues](/articles/list-of-digestive-disorders). In a [2015 meta-analysis](https://www.karger.com/article/fulltext/442111) of several studies, researchers noted that strong evidence suggests that using thyme preparations helped alleviate people's cough symptoms. However, they noted that additional studies are needed to demonstrate its overall effectiveness. A more recent study in [2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2021.1960493) showed that people using a combination of thyme and ivy drops showed improvement in bronchitis symptoms, cough, and overall quality of life. They also noted that people experienced few side effects using the drops. To treat coughs using thyme, a person can look for a cough syrup that contains this herb. 9. Dietary changes for acid reflux [Acid reflux](/articles/146619.php) is a common cause of a cough. Avoiding foods that can trigger acid reflux is one of the best ways to manage this condition and reduce the cough that accompanies it. Every individual may have different reflux triggers that they need to avoid. People who are unsure of what causes their reflux can begin by eliminating the most common triggers from their diet and monitoring their symptoms. The foods and beverages that [most commonly trigger](https://www.asge.org/docs/default-source/about-asge/newsroom/doc-gerd_infographic_final.pdf) acid reflux include: [alcohol](/articles/305062) [caffeine](/articles/285194) [chocolate](/articles/270272) fried and fatty foods [garlic](/articles/265853)and [onions](/articles/276714.php) [mint](/articles/275944.php) - spices and spicy foods [tomatoes](/articles/273031)and tomato-based products 10. Slippery elm Native Americans [traditionally](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204705/) [slippery elm](/articles/slippery-elm) bark to treat coughing and digestive issues. Slippery elm is similar to marshmallow root as it contains a high level of mucilage, which helps to soothe a sore throat and cough. A person can make slippery elm tea by adding 1 teaspoon of the dried herb to a cup of hot water and allowing it to steep for at least 10 minutes before drinking. It is important to note that slippery elm may interfere with the absorption of medications, so a person should talk with a doctor before making a tea or using another supplement. Slippery elm is available in powder and capsule form in health stores and online. 11. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) [NAC](/articles/327219) is a supplement that comes from the amino acid L-cysteine. Taking a daily dose may lessen the frequency and severity of a wet cough by reducing mucus in the airways. A meta-analysis of [13 studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26324807) Chronic bronchitis is a prolonged [inflammation](/articles/248423.php) of the airways that causes mucus buildup, a cough, and other symptoms. The researchers suggest a daily dose of 600 milligrams (mg) of NAC for people without airway obstruction and up to 1,200 mg where there is an obstruction. NAC can have severe side effects, including [hives](/articles/157260.php), [swelling](/articles/swelling), [fever](/articles/168266.php), and [difficulty breathing](/articles/324429). Anyone considering this approach should speak with a doctor first. 12. Probiotics [Probiotics](/articles/264721) do not directly relieve a cough, but they may boost the immune system by balancing the bacteria in the gut. A healthy immune system can help to fight off infections that may be causing the cough. One type of probiotic, a bacteria called [Lactobacillus](/articles/324194), provides a modest benefit in helping prevent the common cold, according to an older study published in [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3560336/) Another meta-analysis published in [2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4979858/) Supplements containing Lactobacillus and other probiotics are available at health and drug stores. Some foods are also naturally rich in [probiotics](/articles/264721), including: However, the number and diversity of probiotic units in foods can vary greatly. It may be best to take probiotic supplements in addition to eating probiotic-rich foods. It is not always possible to avoid getting a cold or other [respiratory tract infection](/articles/323886) that can lead to a cough, but avoiding contact with people who are sick, regular handwashing, and staying hydrated can help reduce the risk. When dealing with a cold or other respiratory tract infection, a person may want more immediate relief. While some of the above remedies, such as honey or steam, may help more immediately, others do not work as quickly. Some additional steps a person may find helpful for reducing their cough include: - drinking warm fluids, such as broth or tea - avoiding dairy products - avoiding [alcohol](/articles/305062) - breathing in moist air from shower steam or a [humidifier](/articles/322228) A person may also find some relief with over-the-counter medications, such as those containing dextromethorphan, or cough drops. These can help suppress a cough. A person should speak with a doctor if the following [symptoms](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/warning-signs-of-lung-disease/cough/learn-about-cough) accompany a cough: [dehydration](/articles/153363) [fever](/articles/168266)over 102\u00b0F - fever that lasts for more than 3 days [weakness](/articles/asthenia-weakness) - a cough that lasts for a long time or is recurrent People should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department if a cough brings up blood or causes breathing difficulties. Below are some commonly asked questions about home remedies for coughs: What is the fastest way to cure a cough? There is no cure for a cough. However, prescription medications and natural remedies such as honey, ginger, and hot fluids may help treat it. What helps a cough at night? To relieve a [nighttime cough](/articles/319498-2), try using a humidifier, drinking hot tea with honey, and gargling warm salt water before bed. Several natural remedies may help relieve a person's cough directly or indirectly. Though many have at least some scientific backing, they may not work for everyone. Also, natural remedies do not guarantee safety for everyone. People taking medications or living with certain health conditions should consider talking with a qualified healthcare professional before trying any new supplements or home remedies. "}
