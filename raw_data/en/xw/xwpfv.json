Nucala is a monoclonal antibody that stops IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. In people with asthma, eosinophils - a type of white blood cell - cause inflammation in the lungs, making it difcult to breathe and increasing the risk of asthma attacks. The 2015 European and US regulatory approvals of Nucala - the rst-in-class approved targeted biologic therapy for people with eosinophilic-drive n severe asthma - consolidates GSK's leading global position in respiratory medicine.

A clear element of the Group's strategy is to deal with the decline in sales of Seretide/Advair which has for the best part of the last decade been the biggest source of profits to the Group. This is a considerable challenge. However with the investments that have been made in new Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products we are now seeing an effective transition in the Group's portfolio. It is also important for the Group to secure the sales benefits and cost synergies resulting from the recent Novartis transaction, which was successfully completed in 2015. The Board is closely monitoring the integration of the new businesses acquired in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare and it is clear that management has made substantial progress. For 2015, the Group has declared an ordinary dividend of 80 pence per share and a special dividend of 20 pence. The current level of annual dividend of 80 pence exceeds the cash flows from our businesses. However, the Board has said it expects to maintain that level of payment for 2016 and 2017, which are important years of change. During this period, the long-term impact on cash flow of the decline in Seretide/Advair should become clearer but so should the benefit to cash generation of the growth of recently launched products, the expansion of our Vaccines and Consumer businesses and reduced restructuring expenditure. Good progress has been made in the development of the company's operating model and R&D pipeline. Both of these are important for the long-term health of the company and the Board is encouraged by the level of innovation in the company's pipeline, with novel assets in development across six core therapy areas. A priority for the Board is to manage succession of executive management. After what will have been nearly 10 years as CEO, Sir Andrew has indicated to the Board his intention to retire from the company in early 2017. The Board has agreed that he will retire on 31 March 2017. This will be the culmination of 32 years of service and leadership to GSK and the industry. We will thank Andrew more formally for his tremendous dedication and contribution next year. In the meantime, the Board will now start a formal search for a successor and will consider internal and external candidates for the role.2015 highlights 80p + 20p 80p ordinary dividend and a special dividend of 20p \" The Gr oup has made good progress in delivering the strategy and outlook set out to shareholders in May 2015.\" I am pleased to report that the Group has demonstrated strength in multiple areas of governance. A review of the work overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee is on page 88. The Remuneration Committee has operated in accordance with the binding Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders in 2014. The Remuneration report can be found on page 102. We have been pleased to welcome two new independent Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Vindi Banga and Dr Jesse Goodman, as our Senior Independent Director Designate and a Scientific and Medical Expert respectively. I am pleased with the contributions they have made already to the Board's deliberations. Sir Christopher Gent retired from the Board as Chairman in May 2015 after over 10 years at the helm of GSK. He stood down at the same time as Tom de Swaan and Jing Ulrich. Long-serving Non-Executive Directors: Dr Stephanie Burns, Sir Deryck Maughan and Dr Daniel Podolsky will retire as planned at the 2016 AGM in May after completing over nine years service. Hans Wijers has also decided not to seek re-election at our AGM this year. We have greatly appreciated all their dedication, experience, the wealth of knowledge and insights they brought to Board deliberations over their years of service on the Board. In closing, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Sir Andrew and his executive team for their commitment and performance in 2015. Philip Hampton Chairman GSK Annual Report 2015 7 Strategic reportStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationCEO's statement \" The pr ogress we have made in 2015, strongly positions the Group to deliver the medium- term outlook we set out to investors in May last year and to return to core earnings growth in 2016.\" Over the last two years we have launched a number of new pharmaceutical and vaccine products and in 2015 sales from this group reached \u00a32 billion. This performance was driven by continued excellent uptake of our HIV launches ( Tivicay and Triumeq ), growing momentum in portfolio ( Relvar/Breo, Anoro and Incruse ) and significant acquired meningitis vaccines Bexsero and Menveo . New product sales are now more than offsetting the declines in Seretide/Advair ; sales of which are now around 30% below their peak in 2013. 2015 also saw a very strong performance from our Consumer Healthcare business with sales up 44% (+6% pro-forma) driven by a number of key brands including Sensodyne and allergy treatment Flonase which we switched from prescription status to over-the-counter in the US. Strong R&D innovation Our R&D organisation continued to deliver significant innovation for the Group in 2015. A key milestone was the approval in the US and Europe of Nucala , our first biologic treatment for severe asthma. We also successfully gained approval for our malaria vaccine, the first vaccine against a parasite. Since 2008, the Group has received approvals for 15 new molecular entities (NMEs). In November 2015, we profiled around 40 new potential medicines and vaccines, 80% of which we believe could be first-in-class. Over the next two years we expect to see significant development milestones for a number of these assets including filings for our vaccine for shingles, Shingrix , sirukumab, for rheumatoid arthritis, and our triple combination therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, we expect continued progress in our mid and late stage pipeline in core therapy areas of respiratory, immuno-inflammation, HIV, vaccines and oncology. Restructuring and modernising our businessWe are ahead of schedule on our integration and restructuring programmes and in 2015 realised \u00a31 billion of incremental annual cost savings. We are well on track to deliver \u00a33 billion of savings by the end of 2017. a We are modernising our business and making significant changes to our commercial model. We have already changed how we compensate our sales representatives and from the beginning of January 2016 stopped paying external doctors to speak about our products. These are industry firsts. At the same time, we are investing significantly in our own medical expertise and developing new digital capabilities to improve our interactions with physicians. Outlook The progress we have made in 2015, strongly positions the Group to deliver the medium-term outlook we set out to investors in May last year and to return to core earnings growth in 2016. Finally, and this year more than ever, I would like to thank all of our employees for their extraordinary energy, passion and tenacity. Sir Andrew Witty Chief Executive Officer2015 highlights \u00a323.9bn 2015 Group turnover (up 6% CER/+1% CER pro-forma) \u00a32.0bn New product sales (up >100%) \u00a31.0bn 2015 incremental annual cost savings from integration and restructuring 2015 marked further progress against our strategy of creating a balanced Group of three world leading business in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, with a clear aim to deliver growth and improving returns to shareholders. In the year, we completed our major 3-part transaction with Novartis and made good progress to integrate new businesses in Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines and restructure our Pharmaceuticals business. At the same time, sales of our new products have dramatically accelerated. Trading performance Group sales rose 6% (+1% pro-forma) to \u00a323.9 billion, despite trading conditions remaining challenging in a number of markets. Core earnings per share was 75.7 pence, (-15% CER), ahead of our guidance for the year. Total earnings per share were 174.3 pence, a rise of more than 100%, reflecting the significant gains from the transaction. Footnote a \u00a3 1.6bn savings achieved as at 31 December 2015 with a further \u00a31.4bn to come over the next two years8 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationThe global healthcare marketplace is experiencing signicant change as an uneven economic recovery, far-reaching global trends and an evolving commercial environment, particularly on pricing, transform the sector.Our global marketplace The global healthcare market The global economy remained fragile in 2015, with overall growth falling from 3.4% in 2014 to 3.1% a, reflecting slower growth in certain emerging economies and in oil-exporting countries. Despite this unsettled economic background, the global pharmaceuticals market continued to grow. Global sales were \u00a3428 billion for the period January to September 2015, up from \u00a3393 billion during the same nine months in 2014. North America remained the largest pharmaceuticals market, with a 49% share of global sales (up from 45% in 2014). Europe represented 21%, down from 24%, Asia Pacic was relatively static at 23%, emerging markets fell to 22% from 23%, with Japan down to 8% from 9%. In 2015, the global vaccines market grew by 4% to around $27.5 billion. It is expected to continue growing at around 4% per year and represent around $35 billion by 2020. b The consumer healthcare markets in which GSK operates are estimated to be worth more than $100 billion, and are projected to grow by 3-4% annually over the next ve years. c We have evaluated the implications for our business of a possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In our view, there are advantages in the UK remaining part of the EU, where the Group would continue to have easy access to a signicant economic bloc, be able to operate within an established and harmonised regulatory approval system and continue to benet from EU advocacy on international trade discussions. However, while the UK leaving the EU would create uncertainty and add complexity to a wide range of our business activities, with some short-term disruption likely, we have plans in place to mitigate these effects, and we do not currently believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the Group's results or nancial position. Global societal trends impacting healthcareIn emerging markets long-term economic growth, increasing expectations for healthcare provision, and changing diets and lifestyles are increasing demand for healthcare products across all life stages, especially to treat chronic conditions including respiratory and cardiovascular disease. This demand is expected to grow signicantly faster in these markets over the coming years than in more mature economies. This will create funding challenges.In developed economies, ageing populations and improvements in medical technology are further adding to the pressure on healthcare budgets. Changing societal attitudes are also shaping the healthcare environment. People are taking an increasingly active role in managing their own health which is creating more demand for healthcare products. Finally, the heightened geopolitical uncertainty in several key regions is likely to impact certain healthcare markets during 2016 and beyond. GSK's group of three world leading businesses in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, and our global presence, means we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities (see our strategic response opposite). Pricing and market access The pressure on, and public debate about, the industry's approach to pricing, continued to increase during 2015 in all key markets, but particularly in the US. Alongside this, many healthcare systems are focusing on how to assess the value of medicines, with formal health technology assessments (HTAs) continuing to grow in importance. In both Japan and the US, new assessment processes are being piloted, while more established systems in Europe continue to present challenges that can delay launch or restrict patient populations. However, successful market access negotiations for innovative, value-adding products continued in most countries during 2015, demonstrating a continued willingness to pay for treatments that meet genuine unmet patient needs. Both the highly-charged public debate on pricing and the increased influence of value assessments are likely to continue in 2016 and beyond which will continue to create uncertainty for the industry. Increased collaboration between different stakeholders will be key to deliver mutually acceptable pricing and access solutions. US The healthcare landscape in the US continues to see substantial change, with a strong focus on continuing to expand healthcare coverage and controlling costs in areas of high growth. At the same time, the US government is implementing policies that shift payment away from the traditional fee-for-service arrangements and towards approaches that are intended to increase competition by incentivising efciency and quality.

Public commentary on this issue was not able to capture the complexities of pricing structures and condential discounts creating a lack of transparency. Many stakeholders, including policy makers, presidential election candidates, payers, providers and patients called for pricing reform, and we expect pricing to be a focus of policy debates in the US in 2016 and beyond.GSK Annual Report 2015 9Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Changing lifestyles leading to changing disease burdens Our strategic response Global and sustainable pricing We aim to improve returns from our R&D innovation by striking a balance between price and volume generation. We are actively working with payers, policymakers, physicians and others on solutions to address concerns about the cost of healthcare. Realising and maximising value - for patients, for providers, and for innovators - has to be at the centre of this discussion.

The market grew in 2015, primarily due to the use of new high-priced medicines for hepatitis C, putting ever greater constraints on healthcare budgets. Inequality of access to medicines, both between European countries and within patient populations, as well as affordability, remain signicant issues. Despite much debate on the issue of medicines affordability, and in particular affordability for member states with lower GDP, practical challenges remain to any signicant reform of medicines pricing and access. Japan There was a strong focus on pricing in Japan, with the government implementing a new approach to mitigate the scal burden associated with medicines that have annual sales of more than 100 billion yen, and which exceeded signicantly the sales forecast agreed with the government at launch. Emerging markets Governments across the emerging market regions continue to seek ways to improve access to healthcare while at the same time manage healthcare expenditure. Countries dependent on oil may look to limit spending on health as a result of the signicant decrease in oil prices. Countries as diverse as Ghana, China and India are looking to expand the population covered by government-funded health schemes. This increases the opportunities for high volume tenders but also impacts pricing.Regulatory environment Prescription medicines and vaccines are highly regulated to ensure patients and users have access to safe and effective medicines. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves new medicines and in 2015 approved 45 novel medicines (41 in 2014). This is the highest number of approvals across the pharmaceutical industry since 1996. The healthcare landscape continues to undergo substantial change, with a much stronger focus on improving quality and controlling costs. The FDA is responding to these challenges by working with industry to advance alternative approaches to help reduce the time and cost in developing new medicines particularly generics, which include amongst others the use of biomarkers and real world data. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulates new medicines and in 2015 issued 43 positive opinions for medicines containing new active substances (36 in 2014). During 2015, the EMA continued its efforts to help accelerate patient access to valuable new medicines. This included progressing its Adaptive Pathways Pilot and proposals to launch a new scheme to boost innovation, called 'PRIME' (PRIority MEdicines). In Japan, in 2015, 38 new medicines received approval along with the rst two regenerative (cell based) medicine products, one of which was developed by JCR Pharmaceuticals, a partner of GSK. Six products obtained the rst designations under the 'sakigake' fast-track review system, introduced in 2015 to promote early development and regulatory application in Japan ahead of the rest of the world. Intellectual property and patent protection developments To ensure a reasonable return on investment, research-based healthcare companies rely on the protection of their intellectual property through patents, regulatory data exclusivity, and other rights. Patent expiry or the early loss of a patent can lead to the availability of a generic version of a product, which is often cheaper as the generic manufacturer does not typically incur signicant R&D costs. In developed markets, generics can rapidly capture a large share of the market. Market erosion may be less in emerging markets. During 2015, agreement was reached on the Trans-Pacic Partnership, giving inter alia ve years of data exclusivity for most non-biologic pharmaceutical products and, for biologics, an additional three years of equivalent protection. These provisions will be introduced over a period of time depending on the country if the agreement is ratied by the US Congress. The EU has also concluded bilateral agreements with other markets of this region in 2015, such as with Vietnam, which should improve the regulatory environment, and enhance patient access to key medicines and vaccines. A number of other trade agreements are under negotiation, such as the Trans-Pacic Trade and Investment Partnership and the EU-Japan FTA. In some markets the availability of intellectual property rights, particularly patents and data protection, may be more limited and more difcult to enforce than in developed world markets. For example, India, Brazil and Argentina have implemented, or are considering, practices that restrict the availability of patents. In addition, some countries are considering more widespread use of compulsory licensing. Vaccines and other biological products do not currently face such a degree of generic competition, largely because for these products, the research required is more difcult, the product is more complex, and the quality is more dependent on technical manufacturing processes, compared to small molecule medicines. While intellectual property protections are available for consumer healthcare products, their importance and effectiveness are different. Consumer healthcare products are also covered by national regulation regarding testing, approval, manufacturing, labelling, marketing and advertising. These products have strong reliance on brand loyalty and trade mark protection to create and protect value over time, especially in emerging markets. Competition GSK operates in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace. 2015 saw rapid consolidation within the sector in response to the signicant market pressure on the industry. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharma, medical and biotech sector hit a new record in 2015, with transactions reaching $575 billion globally ($380 billion in 2014) d and with 530 deals in the sector in the US alone.e The consumer healthcare market also remains highly competitive with several high prole deals in 2015. 650m new babies by 2020~1bn 60+ year olds by 2020 (+20%)A growing population >7bn people >6bn people outside US and Europe Footnotes d MergerMarket.

Our established risk management framework, coupled with our internal controls, helps us maintain our focus on managing the principal risks affecting our business. The principal risks listed in the table opposite are those we believe could cause our results to differ materially from expected and historical results. They are also the risks that may signicantly impact our strategic priorities of Grow, Deliver and Simplify. Our Corporate Executive Team review the principal risks annually in the fourth quarter to assure appropriateness for the following year. In 2015, it was agreed to consolidate the reporting and descriptions of a number of principal risks to align with how these are managed across the business, this consolidated list is reported opposite. Within the table, we have summarised how we dene each risk and our assessment of the change in risk during 2015. This assessment is based on the external environment in which we operate, our business operations and the impact of our internal controls on the severity of the risk in the period. Our risk exposure is continually reviewed by senior management and is therefore subject to change as a result of internal and external factors, future events or otherwise. For full details on the denition, context, potential impact and mitigating activities see pages 231 to 240. Progress in 2015 We established a Global Risk Management Ofce to help drive best practices and standards across the business. Its remit includes standardising our methodology for managing the principal risks and identifying signicant emerging risks to our business. We continued to evolve our anti-bribery and corruption team, with enhanced resourcing and focus, with a remit that includes third party oversight (TPO). We also commissioned external assessors to evaluate our highest risk suppliers and distributors. Building on efforts in 2014, we enhanced and standardised our a pproach to regional reviews of our internal controls, with our Pharmaceuticals business the rst to be assessed using our new approach. The annual reviews, which enable us to conrm that company standards, local laws and regulations are understood and adhered to, will take place in all our businesses in 2016. Our viability statement on page 52 sets out our assessment of the prospects of the Group over the next three years, and has been made with reference to, amongst other things, our principal risks and how these are managed.Principal risk and denitionGSK Annual Report 2015 17Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur Chief Medical Ofcer leads a large Global Safety and Pharmacovigilance team, which maintains global policies to guide our employees. This risk remains of paramount focus for us and we have mature and rigorous controls in place to manage it. Our Global Patents group continually analyses changes in patent laws and regulations and ensures that they are incorporated into our processes. Our continued focus on ensuring we have robust and effective processes in place has meant that our assessment of this risk has not changed from 2014. Our Chief Product Quality Ofcer is accountable for our Quality Management System including implementation of associated policies and leading our global network of Quality Councils. In our view, this risk has continued to escalate due to increased regulations and sanctions across all companies in our sector. In response, we have signicantly invested in, reinforced and strengthened the quality culture of the organisation. Our Chief Financial Ofcer and Group Financial Controller oversee our internal controls relating to nancial information and reporting, tax and treasury. We introduced additional resources and monitoring to ensure that robust nancial controls were maintained during 2015, effectively managing risks while the initial phase of integrating the former Novartis' businesses into our control and reportin g framework were implemented, and the ongoing transformation and upgrade to our nancial systems and processes continued. Additional risk mitigation was introduced by amending the programme timelines of the ongoing system upgrades. We have an extensive global ABAC programme, policy and procedure, which includes training of all our employees. Whilst this risk remained signicant to GSK in 2015, the continuous improvements in our compliance training programmes as well as a review and reduction of our presence in a number of 'high risk' markets, manage the bribery and corruption risk exposure presented through our global business operations. We have a single global standard for promotional and marketing activities for GSK products to which all employees including third parties acting on our behalf must comply. In 2015 we introduced changes to how we engage with healthcare providers and implemented a new sales force incentive model globally, which we believe has decreased the level of risk. Our business is also structured to provide access to fast growing demand for healthcare and a balanced exposure to future changes in the industry environment. We have governance systems and controls to oversee our clinical trial research, use of biological samples, and data integrity in all of our key systems. While there is continued focus on regulatory inspections, we have in place established quality assurance programmes ensuring we have continued adherence to regulatory requirements. We have global EHSS standards that support clear policies which all employees are trained on. We believe the overall management of EHSS risk remains effective. GSK is reducing risk in both employee harm and traditional enterprise disruption categories such as process safety at our high risk chemical manufacturing facilities. Our Chief Information Security Ofcer oversees our global information policy and programme and regularly assesses changes by monitoring both our internal systems and the external environment. We believe this risk has increased for all major companies during the year including ourselves, due to the prominence of external threats. Internally, we continue to invest in improving capabilities and technological solutions to counter this threa t. Our Crisis and Continuity Management (CCM) governance board, supported by a team of CCM experts ensure that critical business operations have plans in place. Potential disruptions to our business will continue to be a risk, but we have established governance boards within each of our businesses and continue to learn from plan activations, enabling us to continue to drive improvements in our programme.

This is underpinned by our innovative Pharmaceuticals R&D organisation which drives the discovery and development in several core areas of research: HIV and infectious diseases, oncology, immuno-inflammation, respiratory and rare diseases. Respiratory We have the most extensive portfolio of respiratory products in the industry. Seretide/Advair remains the world's best selling branded respiratory product and we continue to lead scientic innovation in this area, working to ensure patients receive the most effective therapy possible through the most convenient devices. Over the past three years we have signicantly broadened and strengthened our respiratory portfolio with the these medicines are administered using our easy to use, patented dry powder inhaler, Ellipta .

We are targeting research at a portfolio of potential next-generation treatments for respiratory disease, beyond the current approach with inhaled medicines. In 2015, we launched Nucala (mepolizumab), GSK's rst injectable biologic for severe asthma. Multiple other potential medicines targeting the underlying causes of respiratory disease are also in development.\u00a314.2bn Turnover \u00a34.3bn Core operating prot 2015 performance summary -7% Reported sales growth CER -1% Pro-forma sales growth CER By 2020, nine products are expected to account for approximately 90% of sales in Respiratory compared to four in 2015GSK Annual Report 2015 21Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationAdvancing treatments to benet people living with HIV Tivicay has been prescribed to more than 105,000 people living with HIV since it was launched in August 2013, and Triumeq to more than 75,000 since August 2014. Their strong sales momentum, totalling \u00a31.3bn in 2015, positively supported our Pharmaceuticals business. In the US and many other countries, their performance has now overtaken previously leading third agents. Building on this success, Japan is the rst country where ViiV Healthcare has now established a leadership position as the country's largest HIV company. As we continue to evolve the way we engage with healthcare professionals, our Tivicay and Triumeq launches have also demonstrated how digital communication can enhance our interactions with them. Our rapid digital launch campaign saw open (64%) and click through rates (34%), which were signicantly above the industry average. This digital focus, which has been positively commented on by customers, remains a key priority.Access to our HIV treatments is a major focus and is reflected in the regulatory strategy we are taking for our dolutegravir-based regimen. We are seeking regulatory approval of these products in as many countries as possible as well as facilitating the approval process of generic versions of dolutegravir in countries where the need is most pressing. 2015 saw the rst ling of a generic dolutegravir by Aurobindo, supported by ViiV Healthcare's partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative. In 2015, ViiV Healthcare also signed an innovative manufacturing partnership with Desano Pharmaceuticals to enable the competitive supply of dolutegravir in China and a number of developing countries. By the end of 2015, Tivicay was available in 61 countries and Triumeq in 30. ~40 new potential medicines and vaccines in our pipeline proled at R&D event* 80% of which we believe are potentially rst-in-class * GSK R&D event on 3 November 2015GSK has the potential to le up to 20 assets with regulators by 2020HIV We also have a strong presence in HIV. Our global HIV business which is managed through ViiV Healthcare, a company majority, 78.3% owned by GSK, with Pzer and Shionogi as the other shareholders, is one of the leading HIV companies in the world. The strong recent performance of our HIV business is principally led by Tivicay (dolutegravir), an innovative integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and by single-pill treatment Triumeq - a combination of dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine. We have a signicant HIV R&D pipeline and are exploring new therapies for patients that could potentially enable long-term HIV control through infrequent dosing. In early 2016, ViiV Healthcare acquired Bristol-Myers Squibb's late stage HIV R&D assets and portfolio of preclinical and discovery stage HIV research assets. The acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group's leadership in HIV, and provide us with further new opportunities for growth. Specialty and Established Products In addition to respiratory and HIV, we sell several other innovative pharmaceutical products, including Benlysta , for the treatment of lupus disease, and Tanzeum/Eperzan , for Type 2 diabetes. Our Established Products portfolio includes mature medicines in the areas of anti-infectives, allergy, central nervous system, dermatology, respiratory and urology. These products are an important part of our Emerging Markets business - where we sell 40% more by volume than our second largest competitor.

Restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals cost base also continued. Reported Pharmaceutical sales were \u00a314,166 million, down 7% CER, primarily reflecting the disposal of marketed oncology products. Adjusting for the disposal, pro-forma turnover declined 1%, reflecting a 7% decline in respiratory sales and a 15% decline in sales of Established Products. This was largely offset by the growth in new Pharmaceutical products which had sales of \u00a31,713 million, an increase of \u00a31,284 million. Strong performance from HIV products, Triumeq and Tivicay, together with an acceleration in sales of new respiratory products helped deliver this performance. New Pharmaceutical product sales more than offset the decline in Seretide/Advair of \u00a3548 million. Global Seretide/Advair sales were \u00a33.7 billion, down approximately 30% from their peak in 2013. In 2015, we made signicant changes to further modernise our commercial model. We stopped paying healthcare professionals (HCPs) to speak about our products and instead have recruited a number of in-house medical experts. In addition, we have increased our digital communications with HCPs through webinars and 'click to chat' facilities enabling HCPs to talk in real time to GSK medical experts. Reactions from our customers has been very positive and we believe these changes offer GSK a source of a competitive advantage. Read more in the Group nancial review on pages 50 to 72.Deliver Pharmaceuticals pipeline progress In 2015, we continued to progress our Pharmaceutical R&D pipeline, which we believe offers signicant opportunity to drive the long-term performance of the Group. Our late stage pipeline delivered a new and rst-in-class medicine, with the approval in the US and Europe of Nucala , our anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of severe asthma with eosinophilic inflammation. The indication for Breo Ellipta was also expanded in the US with approval for the treatment of adults with asthma. In rare diseases, we led for European approval of Strimvelis , a gene therapy to treat patients with adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeciency syndrome (ADA-SCID) - if approved it will be the rst corrective gene therapy to be approved anywhere in the world. In immuno-inflammation positive results were achieved in phase III studies investigating subcutaneous Benlysta (lupus) and sirukumab (rheumatoid arthritis), with regulatory lings expected for both medicines in 2016. We received data in 2015 from SUMMIT, the Study to Understand Mortality and MorbidITy in COPD. While SUMMIT did not achieve statistical signicance on the primary endpoint, data generated from the study will inform the overall prole of the medicine and are expected to be submitted to authorities for label updates. GSK Annual Report 2015 23Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Two decades of innovative science delivers the rst biologic treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma patients This year's US and EU regulatory approvals for our severe asthma treatment Nucala (mepolizumab) were key milestones in a long journey of discovery. Nucala , GSK's rst injectable respiratory biologic therapy, was identied as a potential respiratory treatment in 1995. At that time, we were considering it as a treatment for mild to moderate asthma. However, initial results in this patient group were disappointing. Our R&D team did not give up on mepolizumab. We believed it had great potential if we could use emerging science to identify which patients could benet most. Aided by a growing understanding about the causes of asthma, in particular the role of the eosinophil - a type of white blood cell that can cause inflammation in the lungs - we focused our research to look specically at severe eosinophilic asthma patients.Less than 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma and a proportion of these have severe eosinophilic asthma. Many struggle to control their asthma despite medication, experiencing frequent asthma attacks and regular hospitalisation. They are some of the hardest to treat patients and the condition o/ften results in a disproportionately high burden on the patients and healthcare systems. With nine studies involving over 1,300 people, our research has allowed us to better understand the specic role eosinophils play in severe asthma and has led to the approval of the rst-in-class approved targeted treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma patients. 1st rst-in-class biologic therapy that targets the IL-5 antibodyIn 2015, we began phase III studies investigating our closed triple ICS/LAMA/ LABA combination treatment (COPD), dolutegravir in combination with infection), sirukumab (giant cell arteritis) and retosiban (pre-term labour). We stopped development of losmapimod as an anti-inflammatory agent for patients with acute coronary syndrome, when an interim analysis of data from an ongoing phase III trial failed to show an efcacy signal. As per the stepwise trial design, this interim review enabled us to limit further investment in the study. Deep portfolio of innovation In 2015, we proled a portfolio of innovative medicines, focused across ve core areas of pharmaceuticals research - HIV and infectious diseases, respiratory, oncology, immuno-inflammation and rare diseases - and vaccines R&D (see separate section). In total around 40 new potential medicines and vaccines were proled, supporting the Group's outlook for growth in the period 2016-2020 and the signicant opportunity our Group has to create value beyond 2020. We believe approximately 80% of the medicines reviewed have the potential to be rst-in-class with novel mechanisms of action. As a result, many may offer benets beyond current standards of care and, in some cases, could radically transform how patients are treated. In developing this portfolio of innovative medicines we have focused on targeting immune mechanisms that could alter the fundamental course of diseases, modify disease progression and present us with opportunities to achieve remission and functional cures. We are developing simplied treatment regimens and a potential new generation of long-acting medicines to provide long-term control and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Next generation technology platforms are also being used by our scientists, to increase our understanding of fundamental disease mechanisms so we can develop new approaches to disease management and control.24 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPharmaceuticals continued Notable advances within our Pharmaceutical R&D portfolio include potential leading-edge molecules in the eld of epigenetics and immuno-oncology for the treatment of cancer, the next generation of respiratory medicines beyond inhaled treatments and a portfolio of new antibodies for inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases and osteoarthritis. We are investigating potential new options for long-term control and prevention of HIV, opportunities designed to cure or induce long-term remission in both Hepatitis B and C and, in Rare Diseases, potential breakthrough cell and gene therapies. 2016/2017 milestones In 2016/2017 we expect a number of signicant development milestones in our Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines pipelines with up to ten regulatory lings including Shingrix (shingles vaccine), sirukumab (rheumatoid arthritis), subcutaneous Benlysta and our closed triple ICS/LAMA/LABA combination treatment in COPD (EU). We also expect up to ten phase III starts, including cabotegravir (HIV), daprodustat (anaemia) and our pentavalent candidate vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal meningitis, Men ABCWY, and up to 20 phase II starts in immuno-inflammation, oncology, respiratory and infectious diseases. In total, we have the potential to le up to 20 assets with the regulators by 2020, and between 2021 and 2025 up to 20 additional innovative assets now in clinical development. Pharmaceuticals R&D approach We are highly selective with our R&D, investing only in areas where we see the best opportunities, having considered patient need, the market opportunity and scientic understanding. We are also committed to improving our R&D productivity, so we can develop more innovative new medicines and vaccines with greater efciency. In 2009, we committed to publishing our estimated R&D internal rate of return (IRR), based on the investment made in our late stage pipeline and our expectations regarding long-term sales performance. This was estimated to be 11% in 2009 and 2011, and 13% in 2013. Applying the same methodology, the estimated IRR in 2015 has remained at 13%.

These nimble, personalised units, with their own budgets and so greater accountability for their projects, are far removed from the traditional hierarchical R&D business model. They help us to maintain flexibility in our research investment, while focusing on the most promising scientic opportunities - to drive and accelerate drug discovery output. Today we have around 30 DPUs, of which two thirds are from the original units established in 2009. The responsibility for guiding an investigational medicine through the later development stages to ling with regulators rests with our medicines development teams, which are small units of six to 10 people. We have also partnered with more than 1,500 organisations around the world, including academic institutions, public-private partnerships and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Such collaboration with external partners is a critical component of our R&D strategy, enabling us to access and increase our understanding of new areas of science and share the risk of development. As a result of this collaborative culture within GSK R&D, we estimate around 60% of the new molecular entities (NMEs) currently in clinical development were discovered internally and 40% from collaborations and external partners. The great time and cost involved in drug discovery and development make it essential that we are highly selective in investing and focusing our resources. The R&D executive team oversees strategic issues and overall budget management across R&D, while robust governance boards manage investment, technical, scientic and commercial decisions through the life cycle of R&D and once a new medicine has launched. Simplify Progress on simplifying the businessIn 2015, we signicantly reshaped our Pharmaceuticals business, and continued to reduce supply chain complexity, while retaining our commitment to quality. We have rescaled the commercial operations, global support functions, R&D and manufacturing that support this business. Our supply chain improvement programme aims to deliver industry-leading levels of performance. Since 2012, this programme has delivered signicant savings through procurement excellence (how and what we buy), logistics (distribution), portfolio optimisation - reducing the number of pharmaceutical pack variants by 27% (against the 2012 baseline), and streamlining our external supply network by 35%. We have strengthened our logistics operations by establishing ve regional supply and demand hubs, enabling more efcient use of our warehouses and transport reducing 'cost to serve' by \u00a3136 million. The ongoing roll-out of our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system across our commercial markets and manufacturing sites is a critical part of our transformation. Coupled with new planning capabilities, this increases end-to-end visibility and control, helping ensure supply and demand are robust and aligned. These changes will help improve service to our patients and consumers.Cost savings generated from Pharmaceuticals restru cturing will support delivery of \u00a33 billion annual savings for the Group by the end of 2017. Together with the improved performance of new products, this restructuring will improve the flexibility of our cost base and allow us to offset the headwinds to our operating margin from the continued decline in Seretide/Advair and other older products, while also supporting enhanced investments behind our new products the growth of which is key to deliver on our expected medium-term outlook to 2020 for the Pharmaceuticals business. We are committed to meeting the highest standards through stringent quality control and quality assurance processes. Our medicines and vaccines are manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, and our internal quality management system. In 2015, we had 86 regulatory inspections, and the vast majority concluded with satisfactory outcomes. We are working with regulators to bring those inspections with remaining concerns to an acceptable conclusion. In August 2015, following a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) re-inspection, the 2014 warning letter relating to our Cork manufacturing site was lifted. Collaboration with external partners is a critical component of our R &D strategy, enabling us to access and increase our understanding of new areas of science and share the risk of development 26 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information VaccinesGSK Annual Report 2015 27Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Our Vaccines business is one of the largest in the world.

We make available 39 paediatric, adolescent, adult and travel vaccines that protect against 21 different diseases, including: hepatitis, influenza, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus and cervical cancer. With the addition of the Novartis portfolio we gained two vaccines for the prevention of meningitis, Menveo , which is approved in the US for babies above two months and is marketed in 62 countries worldwide, and Bexsero , a new meningitis B vaccine currently available in 38 countries. Our new vaccine R&D pipeline brings together expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different technological platforms. We have 15 candidate vaccines in development against diseases including shingles, meningitis, RSV, Group B strep and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. The expansion of our portfolio has boosted our offering around the world, notably in the US, where Novartis had a strong presence and track record of regulatory approvals. GSK's signicant presence in emerging and developing countries is also providing new opportunities for the introduction and growth of newly acquired vaccines. For many years, we have used a 'tiered pricing' approach for our vaccines, based on gross national income, which enables countries to maintain and expand their commitment to immunisation as their economies grow. We are one of the largest contributors to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership to improve access to vaccines in developing countries. For more about our efforts to improve access to our medicines and vaccines, see our Responsible business section on page 38.Grow 2015 performance summaryReported Vaccines sales grew 19% to \u00a33,657 million with the US up 24%, Europe up 23% and International up 12%, as the business beneted from sales of the newly acquired products. On a pro-forma basis sales grew 3% with good contributions from Rotarix , Fluarix/FluLaval and Boostrix . In addition, we saw rapid sales growth of our new meningitis vaccine portfolio, Menveo and Bexsero , with sales up 43% pro-forma to \u00a3275 million. Notable was the decision made by the UK's National Health Service to include Bexsero in its national immunisation programme. Overall, growth was partly offset by declines in pro-forma sales of hepatitis A vaccines and Infanrix/ Pediarix . Sales were also impacted during the year by higher trade inventories inherited with the newly acquired vaccines in some international markets.

We currently have 15 candidate vaccines in early, mid and late-stage development against a range of diseases. In 2015, we reported further positive pivotal phase III trial data in adults over 70 for our most advanced candidate, Shingrix , for the prevention of shingles. We intend to le global regulatory applications for Shingrix in the second half of 2016. We also received a positive scientic opinion from the European regulators for our malaria vaccine, Mosquirix , for children aged six weeks to 17 months. Mosquirix is the rst vaccine for malaria to reach this milestone. Additionally, this was the rst regulatory review of our AS01 adjuvant technology, which is also used in Shingrix . For more about our malaria vaccine, see our Responsible business section on page 38. We continue to progress our paediatric vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella through an additional phase III trial which is required to achieve registration of the vaccine in the US. Vaccines innovation In November 2015, we proled a number of promising earlier stage assets in our vaccines pipeline. Our pentavalent candidate vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal meningitis, Men ABCWY, which combines two existing GSK meningococcal meningitis vaccines, is in advanced phase II development, with phase III studies planned for start in 2017. We have two novel candidate vaccines in phase II clinical development against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) a common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants that can lead to hospitalisation and an enhanced risk of severe asthma: one a paediatric RSV vaccine that uses a genetically engineered recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus - the same carrier used in our Ebola vaccine candidate and the second a glycoprotein RSV vaccine given to pregnant women that may provide infants with protective maternally-derived RSV-neutralising antibodies. We have 15 candidate vaccines in development against diseases including shingles, meningitis, RSV, Group B strep and COPD exacerbationsWe reported further positive pivotal phase III trial data in adults over 70 for our most advanced candidate, Shingrix, for the prevention of shingles. We intend to le global regulatory applications for Shingrix in the second half of 2016 1st Mosquirix is the rst malaria vaccine to receive a positive regulatory review90-97% efcacy of our most advanced late stage candidate vaccine, Shingrix , against shingles in two phase III studies30 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Impressive trial results prepare ground for new shingles vaccine Our new candidate vaccine Shingrix demonstrated long-lasting and eective protection against the pain and discomfort of shingles in pivotal phase III studies. Shingles suerers develop a painful itchy rash, which o/ften turns into blisters, on one side of their body. Up to 30% also develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), an intense and distressing pain that can last up to three months a/fter a shingles rash appears. Other possible complications include scarring, eyesight problems, secondary infection and nerve palsies. Nine out of 10 people, that is all those who have had chicken pox, are at risk from shingles. However the disease particularly aects adults over 50, with more than 50% of those over 85 likely to have the disease in their lifetime. Individuals with compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or people with HIV, are also especially susceptible.Shingrix demonstrated its great potential in trials involving 37,000 people from all over the world. October 2015 pivotal phase III study results showed it was 90% eective against shingles and 89% eective against PHN in people over 70. The ndings echoed earlier pivotal phase III study results showing 97% ecacy against shingles and 91% for PHN among the over-50s. The ndings also showed that, not only was the candidate vaccine eective for all ages, but that its eectiveness remained constant for four years a/fter it was administered. This is a signicant improvement on the existing vaccine, which is less eective for the very elderly and reduces in ecacy over time. Following our successful trial results, later in 2016 we intend to begin ling applications for Shingrix for the prevention of shingles with regulators in North America, Japan and Europe. With Shingrix trials also ongoing for people with compromised immune systems, we hope to be able to le a regulatory application for this group of patients in 2018.Vaccines continued We are exploring a maternal immunisation approach with our candidate vaccine in phase II development to prevent group B streptococcus (GBS), a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis that affects about one in 2,500 births in the US. In addition, we have a candidate vaccine in a phase II clinical proof of concept study for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We continue to work with our partners to accelerate development of our Ebola candidate vaccine to help prevent future disease outbreaks. Our candidate vaccine is being tested in phase II clinical trials in ve countries in West Africa. We are discussing potential regulatory pathways to le the candidate vaccine for approval with the FDA and other agencies. Investment and governance We are highly selective in how we invest and focus our resources in vaccines discovery and development. We prioritise our investment to meet the needs of patients and address some of the biggest remaining global health challenges. Our core vaccine R&D investment in 2015 was \u00a3525 million, up 18.5% from 2014. We have more than 2,000 scientists working across our vaccine R&D organisation. Oversight for the key decisions we make during the vaccines development process rests with the Vaccine Research and Development Board (VRDB) which reviews the R&D project strategy and advises on scientic and technical matters, and the Vaccine Investment Board (VIB), which makes the nal decision on whether to invest in a project, commercial opportunity and portfolio t. We continue to expand our early stage pipeline and strengthen our expertise with targeted investments. For example, our acquisition of GlycoVaxyn in February 2015 with its innovative biological conjugation platform technology supports our efforts to develop new vaccines for a range of bacterial diseases.GSK Annual Report 2015 31Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationVaccines research development cycle Registration/ post marketing surveillanceFile Phase (including immunology) Pre-clinical development Clinical development (including post marketing surveillance) Transfer process to manufacturing Simplify Progress on simplifying the business During 2015, we made substantial progress in integrating the new Novartis business which acted as a catalyst to further simplify our Vaccines operating model, strengthen our manufacturing network, and reduce supply costs. These changes will help to deliver the annual cost savings we set out in 2015 by 2017, and will help us deliver our target operating margin of at least 30% by 2020. Incremental annual cost savings in 2015, helped to increase the pro-forma operating prot margin by 0.8% on a CER basis to 26.4%. As part of the complex integration programme we completed all regulatory-required divestments under the transaction including the divestment of our meningitis vaccines, Nimenrix and Mencevax . We have also begun a restructuring programme to remove any duplication of infrastructure and roles. Investing in our supply chain GSK has 17 vaccines manufacturing sites strategically positioned around the world. This broad and diversied footprint gives us greater manufacturing capacity, efciency and flexibility. In 2015, we continued to make signicant investments in our manufacturing network in key areas including starting construction of a new hepatitis A facility at Wavre, Belgium and a major capital investment plan for our Rosia, Italy site where our meningitis vaccines are made. Committed to quality Our vaccines are manufactured to the highest quality standards, according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. Up to 70% of the time it takes to produce a vaccine is dedicated to quality control. In 2015, we had 49 regulatory inspections, all with satisfactory outcomes. In November 2015, our Ste. Foy facility's warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded after the FDA found that all remediation activities had been completed satisfactorily. We have 17 vaccines manufacturing sites around the world and distribute over 1.9 million vaccines every day to people across more than 150 countries 32 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Consumer HealthcareGSK Annual Report 2015 33Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Our Consumer Healthcare business has a portfolio of some of the world's most trusted and well loved brands.

Of note was Sensodyne , which grew double-digits across all regions and is close to generating sales of \u00a31 billion a year. We also had a very successful launch of Flonase Allergy Relief , following our strategy to switch the product from prescription only to OTC. Reported growth beneted from sales of the newly acquired products, particularly Voltaren , Otrivin and Theraflu , following the formation of the joint venture with Novartis. Pro-forma growth of 6% was predominantly driven by growth in the Oral health and Wellness categories. In 2015, 14% of Consumer Healthcare sales were generated from innovation launched within the last three years with more than 30 new-to-market product launches throughout the year. Our key innovation drivers in the year included Flonase in the US, and Sensodyne Complete in Japan which helped the Sensodyne brand to become the leading toothpaste in the country in 2015. Other key launches included: Sensodyne Repair and Protect Whitening Sensodyne Complete Fenbid Chewable 200mg Physiogel Calming Relief range Theraflu Warming Syrup Read more in the Group nancial review on pages 50 to 72.Deliver We have a strong innovation pipeline across all of our categories and we will continue to prioritise our investment in R&D. Core R&D investment in Consumer Healthcare in 2015 was \u00a30.3 billion (2014 - \u00a3159 million). Through the integration process, we are investing further in our R&D capabilities, integrating our marketing, scientic, regulatory, technical and medical teams in co-located hubs; in the UK, the US, Switzerland, India, China and Singapore. Going forward a third of our R&D organisation will be based in emerging markets. We are also building new sensory and packaging lab capabilities to ensure that we capitalise on trends in developments such as flavour or application techniques which can present growth opportunities. For example, we developed a formulation of Horlicks that consumers can mix in cold water, as hot water is not readily available for many people in the Indian subcontinent. A further example is Fenbid Chewable which we launched in China in 2015 as a pain relief product that does not need water. We also continue to invest in our Shopper Science Lab. This is a state-of-the-art facility that allows us to research our innovative products in both simulated digital and real life environments with our retail partners, to test packaging, claims and our shopper materials.We have identied a dozen markets where we will prioritise investment in advertising and promotion, capital expenditure, and place top talent. These markets will contribute to two thirds of our growthGSK Annual Report 2015 37Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information The 2015 US debut of Flonase Allergy Relief was the year's top over-the-counter (OTC) launch The launch of Flonase Allergy Relief underlined our eective dual capabilities in both pharmaceuticals and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). The nasal spray - which was formerly available only on prescription - contains the number one prescribed ingredient for providing temporary relief of hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies. Reflecting our heritage in respiratory medicines, it is the rst OTC spray to relieve both nasal and ocular symptoms and, whereas most allergy treatments target just one histamine, it inhibits six key substances. Our partnership with retailers enabled us to secure a strong presence in store with 23 miles of shelf space and almost one million point-of-sale devices. An integrated consumer marketing campaign worked simultaneously to engage shoppers. Within just a few months of launch Flonase captured more than 11% of the adult allergy product market and was the third leading brand in the category. It was also the leading allergy brand 'recommended by' both doctors and allergists and the number one 'recommended by pharmacists' nasal allergy brand. This strong performance was aided by Flonase's expert digital marketing campaign, which achieved striking results across the leading social media channels. 11% Within a few months of the US launch, Flonase captured more than 11% of the adult allergy product marketSimplify Progress on simplifying the business We are using the integration process to simplify the organisation, to build a leaner business with a renewed focus on delivering performance, increasing agility and developing a high performance culture. With over 80% of personnel exits in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture completed and 54 sites now consolidated, we are making good progress. These changes will help to deliver the annual cost savings expected from integration, and enables us to deliver our target operating margin of at least 20% by 2020 CER. Incremental annual cost savings in 2015 helped to increase the pro-forma operating prot margin by 1.8% on a CER basis to 11.3%. Careful planning enabled us to maintain a stable supply chain during the Novartis integration, so there were no disruptions in supply. At the same time we achieved an 8.4% net reduction of pack variants within our product portfolio. In 2015, we had 45 regulatory inspections, all with satisfactory outcomes. Our average service levels rose to 93% in 2015, from 87% in 2014, due to supply chain improvement programme initiatives, such as investments at our manufacturing sites, enhancements in systems and capacity, and reductions in single-sourced raw materials.

Our responsible business priorities GSK's responsible business priorities sit within the context of the macro-economic and social trends that affect all companies and wider society. These trends present both opportunities and challenges for global healthcare companies like GSK (see page 8). We report our progress across four areas: Health for all, Our behaviour, Our people, and Our planet. We identied our priorities in these areas by understanding the issues that are most important to our business and to our stakeholders. Our longer-term commitments across the four areas reflect global health needs and align with GSK's strategic priorities and our values. In many areas they also support the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. We detail our progress against these commitments in our responsible business supplement, available at www.gsk.com/responsibility.

Our open innovation model is core to this commitment. After 30 years of research, we have reached two signicant milestones in our journey to develop a vaccine to protect young children from malaria. In July 2015, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive scientic opinion for our malaria candidate vaccine Mosquirix , or RTS,S, in children aged six weeks to 17 months. Additionally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended that RTS,S should be introduced through a pilot roll-out. The WHO is now actively working with nancing bodies, and the malaria vaccine clinical trials partnership (including PATH and GSK) to generate support for the pilots, and to nalise the design of the pilot implementation programme.GSK developed RTS,S, which we will supply at a not-for-prot price, in partnership with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In addition to vaccines and medicines, a comprehensive approach to tackle malaria must include wider preventative measures. Since 2001, we have supported the Africa Malaria Partnership to promote the use of existing interventions, such as bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and anti-malarial treatments. In January 2016, we launched a new \u00a322 million partnership with Comic Relief, a UK-based charity, to ght malaria in ve endemic countries. As well as making new discoveries, we adapt existing products to tackle different health challenges. In October 2015, we submitted a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency for an antiseptic gel to prevent umbilical cord infections in newborns that we had reformulated from the chlorhexidine solution in our Corsodyl mouthwash. (See case study below.) Increasing antibiotic resistance is an emerging and urgent public health crisis. We have our own research unit focused on developing the next generation of antibiotics and an active pipeline of potential new medicines in development. Helping more newborns survive Three million newborn babies die each year from infection, o/ften when the newly-cut umbilical cord acts as an entry point for bacteria. This issue is exacerbated in developing countries, where many births take place at home. We have been working to reformulate the antiseptic chlorhexidine solution used in our Corsodyl mouthwash into a gel to prevent umbilical cord infections, using insights and on-the-ground knowledge from Save the Children. If the European Medicines Agency approves our 2015 regulatory application, we will oer the gel at a not-for-prot price and share our knowledge with others so that it can be manufactured locally.The WHO has recommended that our malaria candidate vaccine, RTS,S, should be introduced through a pilot programme Health for all Increasing access to healthcarePhoto: Colin Crowley, Save the Children Our most advanced asset - a topoisomerase inhibitor, gepotidacin (GSK2140944) - has been developed in collaboration with the US government's Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA). This asset has a novel mechanism of action and the potential to address multiple indications, and is now moving towards phase III studies, following positive phase II results.42 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur giving in 2015 27% 66%5%2% Cash \u00a356.6m Product and in-kind \u00a3136.9m Time (PULSE) \u00a33.7m Management \u00a311.1mSince 2009, our open innovation model has advanced research in such diseases as malaria and tuberculosis and in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which affect over one billion people. We have screened more than two million of our compounds to help combat these deadly infectious diseases and, in 2015, published data on high-quality hits against NTDs, initiating new research projects within and outside GSK. We invite external researchers to utilise our facilities, resources and expertise at our open lab in Tres Cantos, Spain. The lab's recent progress in NTD research has included developing the rst preclinical candidate to treat visceral leishmaniasis and a promising pre-candidate drug to combat Chagas disease. Open innovation is also central to our Africa non-communicable diseases (NCDs) open lab, launched in 2014. The lab will work in partnership with major funders, academic groups and governments to conduct research into NCDs. Extending affordability and availability Six billion people live in emerging markets, 300 million of whom will use healthcare for the rst time by 2020. Our flexible pricing strategy seeks to meet their healthcare needs, by providing more products at lower prices. Since 2010, we have capped the prices of our patented medicines and vaccines in the least developed countries (LDCs) at 25% of developed world prices, as long as our manufacturing costs are covered. We also have a tiered pricing approach, where poorer countries pay less. We offer our lowest vaccine prices to organisations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which supports countries with a low gross national income. In 2015, we froze our prices for countries that graduate from Gavi support so they can continue to buy our vaccines at discounted prices for a further decade. In middle-income countries, where many still live in poverty, our flexible pricing approach enables more people to access our products. In the Philippines, GSK has introduced a card and coupon patient programme, offering discounts of between 10-60% for selected products. In 2015, more than 58,000 patients accessed products, including antibiotics Augmentin and Zinnat , as well as our Seretide inhaler, through the programme. Building local capabilities improves access in developing countries by providing patients and consumers with locally relevant products while enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity and capability.Health for all continued Since 2010, we have capped the prices of our patented medicines and vaccines in the least developed countries (LDCs) at 25% of developed world prices, as long as our manufacturing costs are covered Increasing local access and supply is an important part of our commitment to Africa, and in 2015 we continued to evaluate options for manufacturing in Nigeria. In 2015, we started work on a \u00a3100 million pharmaceutical factory in India, and signed an innovative manufacturing partnership with China's Desano Pharmaceuticals to allow us to provide dolutegravir, our HIV treatment, at a competitive price to China and other countries. Affordability can also hinder access in developed countries. We broaden access to our products in these markets by nding flexible ways to price our medicines, while retaining returns for our investment in innovation. For example, in the US all of our six most recently launched new medicines were priced at parity or at a discount to the medicines we aim to supersede. In 2015, we reached agreement with the UK Government to make Britain the rst country with a nationwide vaccination programme against meningitis B. The agreement offers fair value for the National Health Service, while offering us a sustainable return. In the US, we offer various types of patient assistance to help ensure appropriate access to our medicines. GSK has programmes for eligible patients who do not have prescription drug coverage, those with a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan and we now offer specialty product assistance for eligible insured patients. As a result of new coverage options available following the Affordable Care Act, more patients are insured and fewer are requiring our Patient Assistance Programmes (PAP). However, as part of our commitment to access, we continue to provide services to help patients understand alternative coverage options. GSK Annual Report 2015 43Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information The European Medicines Agency adopted a positive scientic opinion for our malaria candidate vaccine, Mosquirix , in children aged six weeks to 17 months Our strategy in action 40,000 Frontline health workers trained in least developed countries since 2009In 2015, we published data on 600 high-quality hits against NTDs, initiating new research projects within and outside GSK Strengthening healthcare systems In the world's least developed countries (LDCs), a lack of trained healthcare workers prevents people from accessing life-saving medicines and vaccines. In the LDCs where we operate, we reinvest 20% of our LDC prots from the sale of pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare products to train and educate community health workers. Since 2009, we have reinvested \u00a321 million of our LDC prots in 35 countries, training 40,000 frontline health workers. These doctors, midwives, nurses and volunteers have reached 11 million people. In 2015, we expanded health worker training beyond LDCs to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In support of the UN One Million Community Health Workers Campaign we are funding a pilot to train 1,800 health workers in Ghana. Apart from training healthcare workers, we strengthen healthcare systems more broadly by, for example, improving health facilities, equipping training centres and encouraging governments to improve policies and increase investments. Our targeted product and nancial donations help provide healthcare for vulnerable communities. In 2015, our global community investment totalled \u00a3208.3 million, compared with \u00a3201.5 million in 2014.Partnership with Save the Children Through a ground-breaking, ve-year partnership with Save the Children we are helping to save one million children's lives in some of the world's poorest countries. The partnership involves combining our capabilities in R&D, supply chain, procurement and vaccines with the charity's local expertise. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, the partnership has created a model of essential services for neonatal, maternal and child health that can be replicated in other developing countries. In 2015 we estimate we have reached over 1.3 million children; fully immunising 23,500, treating 125,000 for diarrhoea, malaria or pneumonia, and screening more than one million for malnutrition. Complementing the partnership, we support a broad range of work to reduce childhood mortality. Many of our 20% reinvestment programmes focus on reducing child and maternal mortality in rural communities. For instance, in Nepal, we work with CARE International and the government to improve maternal, neonatal and reproductive health by improving the skills of frontline health workers, providing health equipment, and enabling communities to feedback on health centre performance. Our support has enabled more than 6,000 health workers in Nepal to be trained, reaching more than one million people.Photo: Martin Webb/Save the Children44 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur behaviour Putting the needs of patients and consumers rst Our approach We expect all employees to act in line with our values, of transparency, respect for people, integrity and to put patients and consumers rst. These values inform how we approach patient and consumer safety throughout product development and use; how we sell and market our medicines; how we train our employees and address misconduct, and the expectations we have of third parties. Patient and consumer safety Patient safety is our priority in the development, testing, manufacture and use of our products. All medicines have potential risks as well as benets. We have extensive controls to detect, evaluate and communicate benets and risks and any potential safety concerns about our products. We take the safety of those who take part in our clinical trials extremely seriously. Our trials are conducted in line with the International Conference on Harmonisation's Good Clinical Practice guidelines. An independent ethics committee reviews trial protocols before studies start and can prevent them from going ahead. Our global risk register helps research teams keep track of emerging risks to quality and safety standards. Risks are often identied through the regular self-audits of our own trials or those conducted by third parties on our behalf. We performed 381 audits of trials in 2015. Core to our focus on safety are the strict quality and safety standards upheld at all our manufacturing sites and throughout the product life cycle - from the sourcing of raw materials to the manufacturing and transportation of nished products. We strive to minimise the risk of counterfeit medicines. In 2015, we extended our end-to-end supply chain serialisation programme, Fingerprint, across 86 packaging lines in more than 18 manufacturing sites. The programme applies unique serial 'ngerprints' on products and logs them into a government-managed database, which they can be veried against at any point in the supply chain. Sales and marketing practices We have signicantly changed the way we sell and market our medicines and vaccines to further ensure patients' interests come rst and to better serve our customers. We believe these changes will provide long term commercial advantage. In January 2015, we completed the roll out of changes to the way sales teams are compensated. Our pharmaceutical medical representatives no longer have individual sales targets, but instead, are compensated based on their technical skills, scientic knowledge, quality of service they deliver to HCPs, and broader business performance. In the US, the approach has generated strong customer feedback - in a July 2015 survey of 3,599 US healthcare professionals, GSK ranked rst in both trust and customer value for the second time in a row. We remain committed to ongoing dialogue with the scientic community and peer-to-peer medical education, but we are modernising the way we engage with HCPs. As of January 2016, we no longer pay external HCPs to speak to other prescribers about our medicines. We continue to pay HCPs for non-promotional advisory services and clinical research. These payments are governed by rigorous controls and are based on fair market value. We have also changed how we support medical education, by no longer choosing which healthcare professionals are sponsored to attend scientic conferences. Instead, we will provide funding to independent professional bodies who will allocate funding to individuals. We are using multiple channels, including digital and real-time applications, to provide information in the way, and at the time, HCPs want it. In 2015, we used effective digital communications to support our interactions with HCPs when we launched two new HIV medicines, Tivicay and Triumeq . Healthcare professionals and scientists within GSK, including our Global Medical Experts, play an important role in informing their peers about our medicines. They are responsible for providing the right information to support the safe and effective use of our medicines. Transparency in clinical trial data We have pioneered ways to share information and data about our clinical trials. By providing greater access to trial data, we allow others to conduct further research and maximise the contribution made by the participants in our studies. Since 2004, we have had an online clinical study register where we make available information on our trials, including summaries of results. We were the rst pharmaceutical company to make clinical study reports - the basis of regulatory submissions, which include detailed information on trials - publicly available. We were also the rst company to sign up to AllTrials, which campaigns for every trial to be registered and the results reported. We have set up a system for researchers to request access to the detailed, anonymised, patient-level data that sit behind clinical trial results - www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com. This lists over 1,700 of our global clinical trials conducted since the formation of GSK and includes clinical trials from 12 other companies. The Wellcome Trust has taken over management of the panel which considers applications for access to the data, which was initially made up of independent experts appointed by GSK. This is an important step towards our vision of an independent data-sharing system of studies from across industry and academia. By the end of 2015, 118 research proposals had been submitted to access data from GSK trials. We have already given 62 research teams access to detailed trial data. Our Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct and an online resource centre guide our people in applying our values in everyday activities. In 2015, 99.9% of employees completed mandatory annual training on our Code. The online course is available in 23 languages and includes training on our values, ethical leadership, anti-bribery and corruption, and reporting issues or concerns. In 2015 it was extended to more than 30,600 complementary workers. Employees who do not complete the course may face disciplinary action. GSK Annual Report 2015 45Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationAnti-Bribery and Corruption We have zero tolerance for bribery or corruption. However, we recognise that we are exposed to bribery and corruption risk given our global footprint, particularly in markets where government structures and the rule of law are less developed and healthcare systems less mature. Our anti-bribery and corruption programme includes risk assessments, standards and practical guidance designed to prevent non-compliance. During 2015, all employees and complimentary workers completed basic level training, while 54,000 employees in high-risk roles completed additional advanced training. We are now rolling out a framework to engage and train third parties, based on their risk prole. Our approach is designed to prevent breaches, but if things do go wrong, we act promptly and decisively. Our centralised review committee oversees investigations into any allegations of bribery and corruption, and ensures they are prioritised consistently across the company. Reporting and investigating misconductWe centrally track misconduct allegations, concerns and security incidents received through our Speak Up channels, monitoring, and other routes. In 2015 we received over 5,780 such reports or allegations. The majority of these, 3,257 (3,203 in 2014), were through our Speak Up channels which offer people within and outside GSK the opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns anonymously or condentially through an independent third party by phone or on-line. All concerns raised are reviewed and over 2,670 formal investigations were initiated in response to these allegations. The ve most frequent categories of allegation were employee performance/relations, product promotion, interactions with HCPs, fraud and Anti-Bribery and Corruption. Disciplinary action Disciplinary action is taken when employees fail to act in line with our policies. In 2015, 3,574 employees were disciplined for policy violations (3,947 in 2014). The types of policy violations (see chart) in 2015 remained broadly the same as in 2014. Attendance and payroll remains the biggest type of violation at 48% of the total (43% in 2014), followed by good manufacturing practices at 11% (10% in 2014). Travel and expenses violations increased to 10% (3% in 2014), due to increased frequency of monitoring.Of the total disciplined, 297 received verbal warnings, 2,890 employees received a documented warning (3,131 in 2014) and 387 (373 in 2014) were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily. The highest number of dismissals were related to travel and expense policy violations which accounted for 130 dismissals, followed by 31 dismissals related to Code of Conduct violations and 22 for attendance/payroll violations. Working with third parties We expect all suppliers and third parties to comply with our standards on ethics, labour rights, health and safety, and the environment. In 2015, we introduced a comprehensive programme to strengthen our management of such risks in the supply chain. Following a review, 1,300 suppliers have been identied as high risk and are being assessed by external risk assessment experts. They will be required to complete an extensive questionnaire and demonstrate policies and management systems for responsible business issues. Additional due diligence may then follow. In 2015, we assessed around 200 distributors on four key risks: anti-bribery and corruption, labour rights, promotional activities and information protection. We also assessed more than 1,300 suppliers that support our manufacturing, in line with our quality management system, and audited 85 on their environmental, health and safety management systems. Our approach to tax We understand our responsibility to pay an appropriate amount of tax. We have robust internal policies, processes, training and compliance programmes to ensure we have alignment across our business and meet our tax obligations. We pay a signicant amount of tax in the UK, where most of our global corporate functions and signicant manufacturing and R&D facilities are located, and in other countries around the world where we have a substantial business and employment presence. Over the last 15 years we have paid \u00a327.3 billion in corporation tax globally. In the UK, we have paid \u00a32.7 billion since 2001, nearly 10% of the global total. In 2015, UK net sales were 4.2% of global net sales. Employees disciplined in 2015: breakdown of types of policy violations Attendance/payroll Good manufacturing practices/good distribution practices Travel and expenses Marketing and promotional activities Code of conduct Local work regulation violations Unauthorised absenteeism EHS/safety Falsication of documents Training completion Other We do not engage in articial tax arrangements - those without business or commercial substance. At the same time we have a responsibility to our shareholders to be nancially efcient and deliver a sustainable tax rate. Further details on our approach to tax and our tax disclosures can be found in the Group nancial review on page 53 in this report and in our responsible business supplement. Approach to human rights GSK is a signatory to the UN Global Compact, which sets out key principles for business on human rights. We are committed to upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core labour standards set out by the International Labour Organization. Our human rights steering group provides direction and oversight to help ensure we meet our commitments on human rights as set out in our Human Rights Statement, available on our website. In 2012 we identied seven priority areas for human rights for GSK: access to health care, air quality impact relating to propellants, clinical trial standards, employment practices, patient safety, product counterfeiting and use of third-party suppliers. 48% 7% 11%10%5%4%4%7%2%1% 1%46 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur approach We need a talented, motivated and resilient workforce if we are to deliver against our strategy and tackle global health challenges effectively. To achieve this, we aim to create a working environment where employees feel valued, respected, empowered and inspired. In 2015, as our business experienced signicant change, it was particularly important for us to listen to and support our people. Performance and engagement Our global performance system is underpinned by a set of clear expectations that emphasise not just results, but also how they are achieved in line with our values. We provide regular updates on our mission, strategy and progress through live broadcasts and messages from our CEO and Corporate Executive Team. Listening is also critical: in 2015 over 76,000 employees, 78% of our people, took part in our employee survey providing valuable feedback. This was up from 72% in the last survey in 2012. Supporting our people through restructuringIn 2015 we welcomed 12,000 Novartis employees to GSK. Clear, regular communication was crucial when introducing our new colleagues to our values, expectations, performance system and local employee practices and programmes. With the major reshaping of our global pharmaceuticals business occurring at the same time, we placed an equal focus on supporting employees leaving the company. We consult employees and their representatives on business changes that might affect them. Talent and leadership The number of graduates and postgraduates joining our programmes is increasing. In 2015, we recruited 470 graduates and postgraduates onto our Future Leaders and Esprit programmes globally, exceeding our target of 450. We also welcomed 74 apprentices in the UK, 34% of which are women, across a number of disciplines and locations. We are looking to expand our apprenticeship programme into other geographies in 2016.Following a steady reduction over 10 years, our reportable injury and illness rate increased slightly due to a large number of semicircular lipoatrophy cases in Brazil. This is a treatable condition associated with localised pressure from ofce furniture, and we took steps to support those affected and prevent recurrence. As a global business operating in more than 150 markets, serious incidents do occur. In August 2015, an employee tragically died in a boiler explosion at our site in Rixensart, Belgium. We are supporting the Belgian authorities with their investigations and checking every boiler across GSK. In October, a sales employee in India, who was travelling on business, sadly died after their motorcycle collided with another vehicle. Our Energy & Resilience programmes continued to help employees balance personal and professional responsibilities. 70% of those who took part in our employee survey agreed that they have sufcient energy to invest in the things that matter most at work and in life. Providing preventive healthcare To complement the employee healthcare benets in our established markets, our Partnership for Prevention (P4P) programme aims to provide all our employees and their families with unprecedented access to preventive healthcare services at little or no cost. Implementation is being prioritised in regions where access to preventive services is unavailable or limited, particularly in developing markets. The services, including immunisations and cancer screenings, are recommended by the World Health Organization and are now available to over 38,000 employees and family members in 52 countries. This places us halfway towards our target to implement P4P globally by 2018. In 2015, we welcomed 12,000 Novartis employees to GSK. Clear, regular communication was crucial when introducing our new colleagues to our values and expectations We put particular emphasis on leadership development. In 2015, more than 3,300 line leaders completed programmes to help them become managers. We also launched the Enterprise Talent initiative, which develops leaders with the potential and aspiration to become executives. Since 2010, we have trained more than 1,000 employees as coaches to help others full their leadership potential. Health and wellbeing We take a progressive approach to employee health, and protecting our workforce is a business priority. In 2015 we refreshed and simplied our health and safety standards, and reviewed our global health and well being strategy, setting out our plan that every GSK employee has access to a consistent and comprehensive health service. We continue to be recognised as a leader in health and wellbeing, and in May 2015 GSK won the Multinational Healthy Workplace Award from the Global Centre for Healthy Workplaces. Road safety is a signicant risk for our employees and we launched a driver safety programme in India that we plan to roll out more widely in our emerging markets. Our people GSK's people are essential to our success Volunteering to create change Through our PULSE Volunteer Partnership, our employees use their professional skills to create sustainable change for our non-prot partners and the communities they serve. Since its launch in 2009, PULSE has enabled 560 employees to work with 103 non-prot partners in 62 countries, providing nearly \u00a319 million worth of skilled services.GSK Annual Report 2015 47Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationDiversity and inclusion We value diversity. The diverse knowledge, perspectives, experiences and working styles of our global workforce strengthens our business and helps us meet the needs of our patients and consumers. We aim to improve gender balance at all levels. As at 31 December 2015, women represented 52% of recruits to our Future Leaders programme, 42% of management, 17% of our Corporate Executive Team and 29% of our Board. In 2015, 118 more female managers began Our Accelerating Difference programme for high performing women leaders. We strive to make GSK more accessible to people with disabilities. In December 2015 we partnered with the UK Government's Disability Condent campaign to raise disability awareness across our business, remove barriers, increase understanding and ensure that those with disabilities have the right opportunities. We are a global organisation serving diverse markets. Six nationalities are represented on our Corporate Executive Team and Board, and our employees in emerging markets, Asia Pacic and Japan represent 43% of our workforce. We aim to attract and develop local talent by partnering with universities and offering business opportunities. This is a particular focus of our Africa strategy, while our new regional headquarters in Singapore is helping to attract and develop local people in emerging markets. In 2015, we recruited 444 people from 53 countries for our Future Leaders graduate programme.

Inspiring the next generation of scientists By 2020, the UK alone will need one million new scientists and engineers to solve future challenges, including some of the biggest health challenges of tomorrow. As a research led healthcare company, GSK is playing a leading role in inspiring young people to get into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) as well as providing a range of career opportunities. Our Science Education and Early Talent team, along with our 362 STEM ambassadors across the UK, engage young people by demonstrating real-world science and engineering in schools, and manage our graduate and apprenticeship programmes. Rhiannon Lowe heads up a team of 150 ambassadors, all volunteer GSK employees from our site in Ware, Hertfordshire. She has been part of the programme since it began in 1999 alongside her job as an investigator in investigative preclinical toxicology, where she focuses on diseases of the developing world and gene therapy. She and her team put their expertise into practice to inspire people of all ages. They go into schools to demonstrate scientic experiments and host visits to GSK labs where students are given an opportunity to get involved in science that connects directly to our work and the real world. Rhiannon encourages girls, in particular, to pursue these subjects from a young age as women represent only 14% of all STEM professionals in the UK.\"When I was young I was told by one of my teachers to study drama, but I always enjoyed sciences and maths and ended up completing a PhD in virology and immunology, part-time, whilst at GSK,\" she said. In 2016, we aim to build on our experience in the UK by creating global STEM education programmes to give our employees the tools they need to inspire and foster the next generation of scientists and engineers worldwide. GSK oers a range of career opportunities in the STEM areas; ranging from summer internships, to apprenticeships, graduate and postgraduate programmes. Our apprenticeship programme oers school and college leavers the opportunity to join the company in a variety of roles from nance and IT to laboratory science and engineering. Apprentices learn on-the-job and become valued members of the team as they progress, working towards nationally recognised qualications and ultimately transition into a permanent role. The scheme has grown steadily in the UK, and our ambition is to continually expand the programme into new geographies, helping nurture this new generation of talent, and adding to the diversity of our business. 48 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur planet Reducing our environmental impacts Our approach Major environmental challenges are closely linked to global health concerns. Climate change and deforestation, for example, are exacerbating inequalities of health. As a global healthcare company we can help tackle both the effects of environmental change - and the causes. We aim to have a carbon neutral value chain by 2050, with ambitious interim goals to reduce carbon, water and waste. In the past ve years, we have made signicant progress. Carbon We aim to reduce our carbon footprint across the value chain by 25% by 2020, from the 2010 baseline, on the way to our 2050 goal of a carbon neutral value chain. To pursue these objectives we are reducing our operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) and engaging with suppliers, patients and consumers to cut the emissions linked to sourcing raw materials for our ingredients and to using our products (scope 3). In 2015, the volume of medicines, consumer health products and vaccines we sent out from our factories was 40% higher than 2010. At the same time, our value chain carbon footprint has only grown by 2% (vs 2010). We have therefore reduced the value chain carbon footprint of the products we shipped in 2015 by an average of 25% versus 2010. The continued growth in sales of our Ventolin propellant-based inhalers which emit greenhouse gases during the administration of medication to patients continues to impact our carbon footprint. We are researching solutions to this issue including changing the way we manufacture to reduce the amount of propellant used while maintaining efcacy for patients. In reducing emissions from raw materials, engaging with suppliers is crucial. Our approach, recognised at the 2015 Ethical Corporation Responsible Business Awards, is founded on data collection, collaboration and recognition. The Ecodesk online platform gathers data on carbon, water and waste from around 180 suppliers representing approximately \u00a3775 million - more than half - of our annual spend on raw materials. We have the most control over direct emissions from our own operations. In 2015, we reduced emissions within our operations, by a further 2% to 1.6 million tonnes of CO 2e. This is 21% less than 2010, with a cumulative saving of around 1 million tonnes of CO 2e over ve years. We have achieved this by using energy efciently and investing in renewable energy, which now provides around 4% of our total energy use. The wind turbine at our facility in Cork, Ireland, for example, generates 28% of the site's electricity and in 2015 delivered savings of \u20ac1 million and 4,100 tonnes of CO 2e. 25% We have reduced the value chain carbon footprint of the products we shipped in 2015 by an average of 25% versus 2010We hit our 2015 water target a year early, reducing our usage by 25% since 2010 - that's a saving of over 15 million m 3, more water than we use in a whole year1m We have reduced direct carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 21% since 2010, saving over 1 million tonnes of CO 2e over ve yearsOur strategy in actionTonnes CO 2ea2010 2015b Scope 11,712,125 12,394,789 12,533,559 12,400,202 Intensity ratios 2010 2013 2014 2015 Scope 1 and 2 emissions/ sales revenue (tonnes CO 2e/\u00a3m)69.5 69.0 69.4 69.0 Scope 1 and 2/FTE (tonnes CO 2e/FTE) 20.5 18.4 16.3 16.0 a Carbon emissions are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition). b Data includes former Novartis sites' emissions and headcount. Water By 2020 we aim to reduce GSK's water impact across the value chain by 20%, from its 2010 level. We met the 2015 milestone for our own operations a year early and, during 2015 itself, reduced this by a further 5%. We have achieved such reductions by investing in water-saving initiatives over the past ve years, focusing on sites with the highest water use and those in regions of water scarcity. Around 86% of the water used across our value chain comes from raw materials, mainly agricultural. In 2015 we partnered with The Energy and Resources Institute, a sustainable development NGO in India, to assess how we can reduce water impact in the rural communities that supply us with the wheat, barley and milk to manufacture Horlicks . In 2015, GSK laboratories, manufacturing sites and ofces used around 1% of our total water impact. We are making major investments to reduce this company-wide.Carbon emissionsGSK Annual Report 2015 49Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information In 2015, we scored 100% for climate change disclosure and a B for performance in the CDP's FTSE 350 Climate Disclosure Leadership IndexGSK is still the only pharmaceutical company to hold the Carbon Trust's Carbon Standard for cutting carbon emissions and its Water Standard for reducing water use across our operations globally25% Since 2010, we have cut our operational waste by 25% Consumer use accounts for about 13% of our water footprint - mainly for cleaning teeth. In 2015, we continued to encourage people not to leave water running while brushing, with Sensodyne's support for the 'Turn off the Tap' campaign in the UK. To realise our 2020 commitment, we are working with experts and NGOs to understand how best to cut our water impact across the value chain. We have combined data from the WWF Water Risk Filter across four areas - water scarcity, local water quality, health and social risks, and regulatory and reputational risks - to identify high water impact hotspots. Horlicks takes a Green Leap in India Horlicks is one of our best-known brands. Used as a nutritional supplement in India, it provides essential vitamins and minerals for growing children. But in 2012, we discovered through lifecycle analysis that Horlicks had the second largest carbon footprint of all our products. One reason for this was that our three Horlicks factories in India - in Nabha, Rajahmundry and Sonepat - were powered by coal. We are investing \u00a39.6 million in Project Green Leap to reduce carbon emissions and water use at these three Horlicks factories. For example, we continue to increase the amount of waste biomass we buy to replace coal as a fuel in our boilers. We will be constructing a new 1MW combined heat and power plant at Rajahmundry that will also be fuelled with waste biomass. This plant will improve eciency by capturing heat from power generation that would otherwise be wasted. At Sonepat, we are installing photovoltaic cells that generate 0.5MW of power from solar energy, and we are investing in ecient LED lighting across all three sites to cut our energy use. Since the project began in April 2014, we have cut carbon emissions by 14%. We have also installed euent treatment plants and rainwater harvesting systems that enable water to be reused and disposed of safely, cutting water use by 30% and helping to replenish groundwater and restore local water sources. \"We identied a huge opportunity, and have reduced carbon emissions at Sonepat by more than 5,000 tonnes between 2014 and 2015.\" Satyaprakash Punia Utilities and Site Energy Manager, Sonepat, India Waste We aim to reduce our operational waste by 50% by 2020, compared with 2010. Over the last ve years we have cut our operational waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) by 25%. We encourage our sites to view waste as a resource and to share best practice. For example, our facility in East Durham, in the US, building on insights from our Dungarvan plant in Ireland, will install a machine that recycles bre drums used for packaging, storage and transportation, saving more than US$300,000 per year. In 2015, we produced 15% less waste than the previous year. 6,900 tonnes, representing 5% of our total waste, was sent to landll in 2015, a reduction of 2,600 tonnes compared to 2014. By the end of 2015, 60% of our sites sent no waste to landll.

To deliver on this expectation and ensure sufcient nancial flexibility to continue to invest behind the synergy benets and other growth opportunities as well as respond to the potential exercise of put options by our partners in ViiV Healthcare and the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, we have retained all but \u00a31 billion of the net proceeds received from Novartis and a number of other non-strategic asset disposals. \u00a31 billion is being returned to shareholders in the form of a special dividend of 20 pence per share to be paid in April 2016. Retention of disposal proceeds and our continued focus on cash flow management and the protection of our credit prole has meant that during the year we were able to fund the restructuring and integration programmes, declare an ordinary dividend of 80 pence per share and reduce net debt by \u00a33.7 billion, securing the flexibility we need to complete the transition of our business and deliver on our strategic objectives. Viability statement A new requirement this year is to assess the future prospects of the Group over a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern provisions of the Corporate Governance Code.

This allowed us to release \u00a31 billion of incremental savings across the Group, ahead of our original targets by some \u00a3200 million. Importantly, we also created additional flexibility to invest behind both the R&D pipeline and new product launches, helping to build momentum in each of our three businesses. The Group is now better positioned to drive sustainable growth and, given the signicant restructuring and reshaping of our cost base, is better placed to deliver against our Financial architecture and drive growth in earnings per share ahead of sales, while improving cash generation to support the dividend over the longer term. The current level of dividend exceeds the cash flows generated by the business. Our strategy is designed to rebuild that capacity through the transition of the Group's business away from its previous reliance on Seretide/Advair to more broadly based and growing cash flows, driven by new products in Pharmaceuticals, the expansion of our Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses, operating cost savings arising from our integration and restructuring programme and a reduction in the level of restructuring spending as the programme comes to an end. During this period of transition, we have said that we intend to prioritise available cash, whether from operational cash flows or disposals, for the return of ordinary dividends to shareholders and to accelerate investment behind our restructuring and integration programmes to support more rapid delivery of the synergy benets and other new growth opportunities we have identied across the Group. Footnotes a Includes \u00a30.3 billion cash costs on legacy restructuring programmes now completed. b Total charges for the combined restructuring and integration programme are expected to be approximately \u00a35 billion, of which cash costs are expected to be approximately \u00a33.65 billion. The programme is expected to be largely complete by the end of 2017 .Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 52 GSK Annual Report 2015Group nancial review continued Viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, GSK has assessed the prospects of the Group over a longer period than the 12 months required by the 'Going Concern' provision. The Directors conrm that they have a reasonable expectation that GSK will continue to operate and meets its liabilities, as they fall due, over the next three years. The Directors' assessment has been made with reference to our current position and prospects, our strategy, the Board's risk appetite and our principal risks and how these are managed, as detailed on pages 16 and 17 in the Strategic report. The Board reviews our internal controls and risk management policies and approves our governance structure and code of conduct. It also appraises and approves major nancing, investment and licensing decisions, and evaluates and monitors the performance and prospects of GSK as a whole. The focus is largely on improving our long-term nancial performance through simplifying the operating model, growing a diversied global business, and delivering more products of value. The three year review considers our existing strategy and the associated principal risks that underpin our current three year plan, which the Directors review at least annually. The Directors believe that a three year assessment is most appropriate as it aligns with our normal and well established three year business planning processes. This three year period balances the long term nature of investments in the Pharmaceutical industry with a realistic assessment of the variability of the key drivers of near term business performance as well as external factors and regulation impacting the business. It also reflects our view on access to capital markets and funding requirements as projected within this analysis. The plan has been stress tested in a series of robust operational and principal risk downside scenarios as part of the Board's review on risk. The downside scenarios also con sider GSK's cash flows, dividend cover, funding strategy, insurance provision and recovery as well as other key nancial ratios over the period. These metrics have been subject to sensitivity analyses which involve flexing a number of the main assumptions underlying the forecasts both individually and in combination. Where appropriate, these analyses have been stress tested to ensure robustness of viability over the period and have evaluated the potential impact of material negative changes in the macro-economic and healthcare en vironment, increased pricing pressure in both the US and Europe, the accelerated impact of a generic alternative to Seretide/Advair , and our principal risks actually occurring as well as the earliest potential exercise of put options by our partners. The three year review also makes certain assumptions about the normal level of capital recycling likely to occur and considers whether additional nancing facilities will be required and the respective level of funding flexibility and headroom. Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors conrm they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment. Financial architecture Our nancial architecture is designed to support the consistent execution of our strategy and to enhance the returns we deliver to shareholders. It is focused on delivering more sustainable sales growth across the company, improving operating leverage, or protability, and enhancing our nancial efciency. This is in order to drive growth in EPS ahead of our sales performance and then convert more of those earnings into cash that can be used to invest in the business or return to shareholders, wherever we see the most attractive returns.This clear set of priorities ensures consistency in how capital is allocated across and between the different businesses within GSK with relative returns from each business benchmarked to relevant external comparatives using a Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI) based framework of metrics. Specic capital investments are also benchmarked in a similar way. Turnover growth The Group's turnover performance in 2015 reflected further progress in delivery against our strategic objective of building a more balanced set of growth drivers across our business. We continued to launch new products in our Pharmaceuticals business and we expanded our Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses through the Novartis transaction. These new sources of growth more than offset the decline of Seretide/Advair and some of our other older products and we delivered overall turnover growth of 6% CER in the year, up 1% pro-forma. Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccines products of \u00a32 billion in the year were a key driver but Consumer Healthcare also made a signicant contribution, up 6% pro-forma, with new products, including the recent Flonase OTC switch, driving growth. Operating leverage Our ability to deliver improved protability is heavily impacted by the overall trend in our sales, but it can also be affected by changes in the mix of business, regional and product contributions to growth in operating prot. 2015 saw a signicant change in the mix of the Group following the Novartis transaction, which helped create industry-leading Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses alongside the divestment of our marketed Oncology products. At the time of divestment, the Oncology business had a much higher operating margin than the acquired Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses, particularly given the heavy investment and cost structure inherited from Novartis. While the integration plans are addressing that cost structure directly and we have set targets for signicant margin improvement in both of the acquired businesses, our core operating margin in the short-term has been affected materially by the transaction, with a total impact of around three percentage points of sales. The reported core operating margin declined a total of 4.1 percentage points to 23.9% with substantially all of the additional 1.1 percentage point decline reflecting the impact of the benet in 2014 to the operating margin of a structural credit in SG&A of \u00a3219 million which was not repeated in 2015. Excluding this effect, the pro-forma core operating margin was broadly flat. This reflected the delivery of around \u00a31 billion of incremental cost savings from our integration and restructuring programmes. The savings contributed to offset price pressures in older parts of the portfolio and also added to the cost flexibility we have been building in recent years. This provided greater opportunities to reallocate resources across the Group, including reinvestment to support new launches and our R&D pipeline, but also improvements to our manufacturing capabilities and capacity. Our integration and restructuring programme is ahead of schedule. By the end of 2015, the programme had delivered approximately \u00a31.6 billion of annual savings and it remains on track to deliver \u00a33 billion of annual savings in total by the end of 2017. Financial efciency We continue to focus on improving our nancial efciency and overall funding costs while protecting our credit prole and, in particular, our short-term target credit ratings. Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 53GSK nancial architecture: driving improved returns to shareholders Sales growth EPSReturns to shareholdersOperating leverage Free cash flow Financial efciency Cash flow growth Approach to tax We understand our responsibility to pay an appropriate amount of tax. In 2015 the Group paid corporate income tax of \u00a32,062 million (2014 - \u00a31,108 million) on prots of \u00a310,526 million (2014 - \u00a32,968 million) representing a cash tax rate of 19.6% (2014 - 37.3%). The corresponding accounting tax charge on prots was \u00a32,154 million (2014 - \u00a3137 million). Tax risk is managed by a set of policies and procedures to seek to ensure consistency and compliance with tax legislation. Our Audit & Risk Committee and the Board are responsible for approving our tax policies and risk management. We seek to maintain open, positive relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide and we welcome constructive debate on taxation policy. There continued to be a signicant international focus on tax reform during 2015 - including the OECD's Base Erosion and Prot Shifting ('BEPS') project and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed 'Anti-BEPS' Directive and the increased use of scal state aid investigations. The OECD BEPS reports clarify the important principle that tax should be paid on prots throughout the supply chain, commensurate with where the prot making activity takes place. GSK supports this approach and has been active in providing relevant business input to assist in the successful delivery of the aims of the BEPS project. In particular, we support the implementation of the OECD's recommendations on Country-by-Country Reporting ('CBCR'), including the exchange of CBCR data between tax authorities, as being key to its success. This data, validated against existing information held on taxpayers, will support their ability to ensure multinational groups pay the right amount of tax. We do not engage in articial tax arrangements - those without business or commercial substance. At the same time we have a responsibility to our shareholders to be nancially efcient and deliver a sustainable tax rate. The ongoing alignment of our Group structure to reflect our mix of operations and geographies has helped us maintain an efcient effective tax rate. Our core tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%, similar to the rate in 2014 of 19.6%. However, some moderate upward pressure on the rate is expected over the next several years, given the Group's momentum and changing earnings mix in favour of the US in particular. For 2016 a core tax rate in the 20-21% range is expected. Our approach to tax is set out in detail within the Public Policy positions section of our website. Further details about our corporate tax charges for the year are set out on page 158. Earnings per share (EPS) Total EPS in 2015 saw a signicant increase to 174.3p, primarily driven by the prot on the disposal of our Oncology business. Core EPS declined 15%, mainly reflecting the short-term dilution of the Novartis transaction but also the impact of the continuing transition of our Pharmaceuticals business, particularly in Respiratory. In 2016, we expect core EPS percentage growth to reach double digits (CER). The base for this growth is the 2015 core EPS of 75.7p. Free cash flow Free cash flow generation in 2015 has been impacted by the ongoing transition of our pharmaceutical portfolio, particularly the decline in Seretide/Advair but also the short-term impact of the Novartis transaction and, in particular, the inherited levels of cost and investment that are being addressed as part of our synergy and integration plans. The restructuring costs of these plans and other costs of the Novartis transaction are being funded from the proceeds of the disposal of the Oncology business and other non-strategic assets, consistent with our general approach to funding the costs of restructuring. Excluding the cash restructuring charges incurred during the year of \u00a31.1 billion and the initial tax payments due on the Oncology disposal, as well as legal payments, free cash flow generated in 2015 was \u00a32.5 billion compared with \u00a33.9 billion in 2014, when adjusted on a comparable basis. In addition to rebuilding our cash generation capacity, we continue to focus on improving the efciency of capital investment and our use of working capital to reduce internal cash requirements. This is expected to allow us to build operating cash flows more quickly while maintaining the dividend, returning the Group to growth and protecting our credit prole. Returns to shareholders The Board approved an ordinary dividend of 80 pence for 2015, together with a special 20 pence dividend to be paid from the net proceeds of the Oncology business and other asset disposals. This will be distributed in April 2016 alongside the regular fourth quarter dividend for 2015. We also expect to pay annual dividends of 80 pence for 2016 and 2017. A fuller review of the nancial results is set out on pages 54 to 72. Simon Dingemans Chief Financial OfcerStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 54 GSK Annual Report 2015Financial review 2015 Results reporting Our Group nancial review discusses the operating and nancial performance of the Group, cash flows and our nancial position and resources. We compare the results for each year primarily with the results of the preceding year. This review discusses the total results of the Group and also core results. We also use a number of adjusted measures to report the performance of our business. These measures are used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies and are dened below. These measures are not dened in IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly described measures used by other companies. CER growth In order to illustrate underlying pe rformance, it is our practice to discuss the results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% represents growth at actual exchange rates. All growth rates included in this Report are at CER unless otherwise stated. Core results reporting Total reported results represent the Group's overall performance. However, these results can contain material unusual or non- operational items that may obscure the key trends and factors determining the Group's operational performance. As a result, we also report core results. Core results exclude the following items from total results: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill; major restructuring costs, including those costs following mate rial acquisitions; legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations, and acquisition accounting adjustments for material acquisitions, disposals of associates, products and businesses, other operating income other than royalty income, and other items, together with the tax effects of all of these items. Core results reporting is utilised as one of the bases for internal performance reporting alongside Total results, cash flow generation and a number other metrics. Core results are presented and discussed in this Group nancial review as we believe that core results are more representative of the performance of the Group's operations and allow the key trends and factors driving that performance to be more easily and clearly identied by shareholders. The denition of core results, as set out above, also aligns the Group's results with the majority of our peer companies and how they report earnings. Reconciliations between total and co re results, including detailed breakdowns of the key non-core items, are set out on page 62, and are provided to shareholders to ensure full visibility and transparency as they assess the Group's performance. Pro-forma results reporting The Novartis transaction completed on 2 March 2015 and so our reported year to date results include ten month's turnover of the former Novartis Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products and also exclude sales of the former GSK Oncology business from 2 March. Following the completion of the transaction with Novartis, we have reorganised the Group to reflect the greater balance between the Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses and respo nsibilities for some parts of these respective businesses have been realigned. We are reporting these three businesses separately with corporate costs reallocated to each accordingly so that the protability of each business is reflected more accurately. We have restated our segment information consistent with this realignment. In addition, we have presented unaudited pro-forma growth rates for turnover, core operating prot and core operating prot by business. Pro-forma growth rates are calculated comparing reported turnover and core operating prot for the year to December 2015 with the turnover and core operating prot for the year to December 2014 adjusted to include the equivalent ten month's sales of the former Novartis Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products and exclude the sales of the former GSK Oncology products from March to December 2014. Free cash flow Free cash flow is the net cash inflow from operating activities less capital expenditure, interest and dividends paid to non-controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and dividends received from joint ventures and associated undertakings. Free cash flow growth is calculated on a Sterling basis. A reconciliation is presented on page 65. Adjusted free cash flow Adjusted free cash flow excludes payments made to settle legal disputes. Working capital conversion cycle The working capital conversion cycle is calculated as the number of days sales outstanding plus days inventory outstanding, less days purchases outstanding. R&D internal rate of return The calculation for 2015 included products launched from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and compounds in phases IIb and III of the development process. The calculation was based on actual sales from 2013 to 2015, and forecast sales up to 2036, adjusted to reflect expected failure rates, which are broadly in line with standard industry failure rates. The cost base used in this calculation comprises an estimate of attributable R&D costs and actual and projected milestone payments where appropriate. This IRR estimate factored in applicable components of the Novartis transaction, including the acquisition costs and forecast cash flows of Bexsero and Men ABCWY, as well as cash flows for the relevant oncology assets divested (i.e. products launched since 2013 and AKT inhibitor). The oncology cash flows included estimated attributable R&D costs and an estimated proportion of the after-tax sale proceeds. Proceeds for products launched before 2013 are excluded for consistency with our overall methodology. The net impact of th e acquisitions and disposals on the estimated IRR is not material.Group nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 55Group turnover Turnover \u00a3bn Operating 2015 11,844 HIV 2,322 1,498 55 Pharmaceuticals 14,166 15,448 (7) (8) Vaccines 3,657 3,159 19 16 Consumer Healthcare 6,028 4,312 44 40 Segment turnover 23,851 22,919 6 4 Corporate and other unallocated turnover 72 87 (9) (17) Group turnover 23,923 23,006 6 4 CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% represents growth at actual exchange rates.

These declines were partly offset by sales of the new Respiratory products, \u00a3177 million in the year. 182124 15 12090603 0 2013 2014 201516.0 14.0 11.8 060708 01 0 2013 2014 20158.0 6.4 4.7Group nancial review continued 50% of Group turnover (14)% Reported CER growth(7)% Pro-forma CER growth Reported CER CER 15 01 0 2013 2014 20156.1 5.0 4.3Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 57The primary driver of the decline in Established Products was Lovaza , which was down 64% to \u00a393 million following the launch of generic competition in April 2014. Avodart declined 41% to \u00a3166 million reflecting the launch of generic competition in October 2015. Relenza sales more than doubled to \u00a369 million, partly reflecting US CDC orders, while Benlysta continued its strong growth with sales of \u00a3209 million, up 24%. In Europe, Global Pharmaceuticals turnover declined 16% to \u00a32,849 million and was down 7% on a pro-forma basis after adjusting for the impact of the Oncology disposal. Respiratory sales declined 9% to \u00a31,415 million with an 18% decline in Seretide due to increased generic competition and the ongoing transition to the new Ellipta products, which reported total sales of \u00a399 million in the year. Established Products sales were down 11% to \u00a3493 million, reflecting increased generic competition and some capacity constraints to supply of a number of products. International Global Pharmaceuticals sales of \u00a34,762 million were down 7% on a reported basis and down 3% on a pro-forma basis. Sales in Emerging Markets of \u00a32,963 million declined 9% (down 5% pro-forma). Emerging Market Respiratory sales declined 1%, with Seretide down 5%, impacted by increased generic competition and price pressure, offset by Flovent up 5%, Ventolin , up of Relvar Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta sales. Established Products were down 14%, and Dermatology products were down 15%, both partly impacted by supply constraints. Within Emerging Markets, China was down 18% reported (down 17% pro-forma), with Respiratory flat and Established Products down 21%, primarily reflecting signicantly increased pricing pressures and the ongoing reshaping of the business, including a number of product disposals. In Japan, Global Pharmaceutical sales were down 5% on a reported basis (down 1% pro-forma) to \u00a31,213 million with a 5% increase in Respiratory sales, primarily driven by Relvar Ellipta , offset by lower sales of Relenza , reflecting a weaker and earlier flu season than in 2014, and continued competitive pressures to a number of Established Products. Respiratory Respiratory sales in the year declined 7% to \u00a35,741 million. Seretide/Advair sales were down 13% to \u00a33,681 million, Flixotide/Flovent sales decreased 12% to \u00a3623 million and Ventolin sales fell 7% to \u00a3620 million. The combined total of all Ellipta product sales was \u00a3353 million. In the US, Respiratory sales declined 10% to \u00a32,750 million in the year (4% volume growth and a 14% negative impact of price and mix). Sales of Advair were \u00a31,865 million, down 13% (4% volume decline and a 9% negative impact of price and mix, including the benet of positive adjustments to payer rebates provisions in the fourth quarter). Flovent sales were down 19% to \u00a3379 million and Ventolin sales fell 15% to \u00a3304 million primarily as a result of net negative movements in payer rebates provisions. The new Ellipta products recorded sales of \u00a3177 million in the year. European Respiratory sales were down 9% to \u00a31,415 million, with Seretide sales down 18% to \u00a31,014 million (11% volume decline and a 7% negative impact of price and mix), reflecting the expected pressures of increased competition from generics and the transition of the Respiratory portfolio to newer products. Relvar Ellipta recorded sales of \u00a380 million in the year, while Anoro Ellipta recorded sales of \u00a316 million. Respiratory sales in the International region were flat at \u00a31,576 million with Emerging Markets down 1% and Japan up 5%. In Emerging Markets, sales of Seretide declined 5% to \u00a3460 million, while Ventolin grew 1% to \u00a3182 million. In Japan, sales of Relvar Ellipta of \u00a356 million, together with strong Avamys and Xyzal sales growth, more than offset a 13% decline in Adoair sales.Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology Sales in the category declined 9% to \u00a3858 million in the year. The Avodart franchise fell 15% to \u00a3657 million, with 1% growth in sales of Duodart/Jalyn more than offset by a 21% decline in sales of Avodart reflecting the patent expiry in the US in October 2015. Sales of Prolia were up 12% to \u00a343 million. In December 2015, Amgen re-acquired the rights to Prolia from GSK. Immuno-inflammation Immuno-inflammation sales grew 16% to \u00a3263 million. Benlysta sales in the year were \u00a3230 million, up 25%. In the US, Benlysta sales were \u00a3209 million, up 24%. Oncology Sales of oncology products were \u00a3255 million in the year (2014 - \u00a31,202 million) following the disposal of the Oncology business to Novartis on 2 March 2015. Other pharmaceuticals Sales in other therapy areas fell 4% to \u00a32,199 million in the year. Augmentin sales were down 2% at \u00a3528 million and Dermatology sales declined 9% to \u00a3412 million, in part adversely affected by supply constraints. Relenza sales were up 22% to \u00a3109 million driven by US CDC orders. Sales of products for Rare diseases declined 6% to \u00a3371 million, primarily as a result of generic competition to Mepron in the US. Established Products Established Products turnover fell 15% to \u00a32,528 million in the year. Sales in the US were down 30% to \u00a3647 million, primarily reflecting a 64% fall in sales of Lovaza to \u00a393 million. Europe was down 11% to \u00a3493 million, reflecting increased generic competition to a number of products and some supply constraints. Seroxat sales fell 12% to \u00a335 million. International was down 8% to \u00a31,388 million, primarily reflecting lower sales of Seroxat/Paxil , down 10% to \u00a3143 million, due to generic competition in Japan, and of Zefx , down 23% to \u00a3125 million. This was partly offset by increased Valtrex sales, up 30% to \u00a3121 million, following the regaining of exclusivity in Canada from late 2014 until October 2015. Sales in China fell 21% to \u00a3249 million, primarily reflecting signicantly increased pricing pressures, together with supply constraints on Zefx .Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 58 GSK Annual Report 2015HIV (7) (9) Lexiva/Telzir 65 87 (25) (25) 136 (8) (9) 730 57 >100 >100 Trizivir 26 36 (28) (28) Other 57 73 (19) (22) 2,322 1,498 54 55 Worldwide HIV sales increased 54% to \u00a32,322 million, with the US up 77%, Europe up 46% and International up 15%.

The business beneted from sales of the newly acquired products, primarily the Meningitis portfolio, in Europe and the US. The 3% pro-forma growth was mainly driven by Bexsero sales in Europe and strong Rotarix , Fluarix/FluLaval , and Boostrix sales in the US. The growth was partly offset by a decline in Infanrix/Pediarix sales due to the return of a competitor to the market in the US, increased competitor activity in Europe and supply constraints in International. Hepatitis A vaccines sales declined due to supply constraints and International was impacted by higher trade inventory of newly acquired vaccines. Cervarix sales declined following the introduction of a new competitor vaccine.Group nancial review continued 3.03.54.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.00.5 0 2013 2014 20151.41.52.3 1.52.0 1.0 0.5 0 2013 2014 20150.91.01.7\u00a31.7bn Operating prot 72% Reported CER growth10% of Group turnover 54% Reported CER growth15% of Group turnover 19% Reported CER growth3% Pro-forma 2.01.50.10.5 0 2013 2014 20153.43.23.7 1.52.0 1.0 0.5 0 2013 2014 20151.0 1.0 1.0Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 59In the US, sales grew 24% on a reported basis (up 9% pro-forma) to \u00a31,258 million. Pro-forma growth was driven mainly by a strong performance from Fluarix/FluLaval as a result of the conversion to the Quadrivalent formulation, Rotarix beneting from CDC stockpile replenishments, Boostrix due to market share gains, and the Meningitis portfolio driven primarily by the launch of Bexsero . This growth was partly offset by an Infanrix/Pediarix sales decline of 17%, primarily as a result of the return to the market of a competitor vaccine during 2014 combined with lower CDC stockpile purchases than in 2014. In Europe, sales grew 23% on a reported basis (up 9% pro-forma) to \u00a31,097 million. Pro-forma growth primarily reflected increased sales in the Meningitis portfolio with Bexsero gaining in several private markets including Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal as well as in the UK following its inclusion in the NHS immunisation programme. Menveo also delivered incremental sales as a result of tender awards in the UK and Italy. Growth was partly offset by sales declines in Infanrix/Pediarix due to supply constraints and increased competitor activity, Hepatitis A vaccines due to supply constraints, and Cervarix following the introduction of a new competitor vaccine. Germany grew strongly with the MMRV portfolio, Boostrix and Infanrix/Pediarix , all up due to better supply and competitor supply shortages. In International, sales grew by 12% on a reported basis but declined 5% on a pro-forma basis to \u00a31,302 million. The pro-forma performance was mainly driven by lower tender volumes in Latin America, particularly for Synflorix , partly offset by increased market access and demand for Synflorix in Africa and Bangladesh. Cervarix sales decreased in Mexico and South Africa due to lower demand. Infanrix/Pediarix and Hepatitis A vaccines sales were down, reflecting supply constraints, and the newly acquired vaccines declined due to the phasing of shipments and higher trade inventory levels inherited as part of the acquisition.

Turnover grew 44% to \u00a36,028 million, beneting signicantly from the sales of the newly-acquired products included in the Joint Venture. On a pro-forma basis, growth was 6% (4% volume and 2% price), primarily reflecting strong growth in the US following the launch of OTC Flonase , buoyant sales in India driven by Horlicks as well as global specialist Oral health growth, partly due to a recovery from supply disruptions in 2014. Sales from new GSK innovations (product introductions within the last three years on a rolling basis) represented approximately 14% of sales, higher than in prior years primarily due to the Flonase switch to OTC earlier in the year. Other key 2015 launches included S ensodyne Repair and Protect Whitening in the US and Germany, Voltaren 12 hour and the roll-out of Sensodyne mouthwash.25% of Group turnover 44% 1.0 0.5 0 2013 2014 20150.7 0.50.7Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 60 GSK Annual Report 2015US sales grew 56% on a reported basis to \u00a31,430 million, and 22% on a pro-forma basis. Flonase was the region's principal growth driver. Oral health sales continued to be driven by Sensodyne , up 13%, with the launch of Sensodyne Repair and Protect Whitening , supply recovery and distribution gains for Sensodyne Pronamel . Excedrin grew 9% following the launch of the gel tablet format combined with momentum in the tension headache variant. Theraflu posted strong growth due to its re-launch, the new warming syrups format and price increases. Nicorette lozenges, Nicorette Mini lozenges and alli returned to the market but Tums was impacted by supply constraints and increased competitive pressure during the year. Sales in Europe grew 70% on a reported basis to \u00a31,788 million and grew 3% pro-forma. The pro-forma performance was driven by Oral health products, which reported growth of 6%, reflecting strong performances from both Sensodyne and Gum health products following an improved supply position compared with 2014, new advertising in key markets, and the roll out of new Sensodyne variants across the region. In Wellness, pain relief recorded a strong double-digit pro-forma performance, driven by Voltaren which also beneted from new marketing campaigns. The brand recorded its highest market shares in many of the major European markets, including Germany, Italy, Poland and France. These strong performances were partly offset by adverse performances in the Nutrition and Skin health categories, due to the re-alignment of resources across the brand portfolio following the integration of the businesses and the termination of a number of third party supply arrangements as part of a supply chain simplication initiative. International sales of \u00a32,810 million grew 27% on a reported basis and were up 2% pro-forma. Oral health sales grew strongly across the region with double-digit growth on Sensodyne and Denture care products. Wellness sales declined 3% on a pro-forma basis, largely a result of the impact of the excess channel inventories in parts of the acquired consumer businesses, most notably China, Russia and Middle East, together with generic competition which impacted Panadol Osteo in Australia, and economic and political uncertainties in Venezuela. India led the growth amongst the priority markets, reporting double-digit performances from Eno, Sensodyne and Horlicks , driven by distribution gains and new marketing campaigns and the re-launch of the improved chocolate flavoured Horlicks . Sales in Brazil were down to low-single digits as the business transitioned to new product formulations in the sun care business.Total results The total results of the Group are set out below.

The increase reflected the disposal of our higher margin Oncology business and the acquisition of the lower margin Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses from Novartis. In addition, there were adverse price movements, particularly in US Pharmaceutic als, and increased investments in Vaccines to improve the reliability and capacity of the supply chain, together with increased intangible asset amortisation and impairment charges and higher integration and restructuring costs. This was partly offset by an improved product mix, particularly as a result of the growth in HIV sales, and the benets of the Group's ongoing cost reduction programmes. Selling, general and administration SG&A costs as a percentage of sales were 38.6%, 2.8 percentage points higher than in 2014 and 2.3 percentage points higher on a CER basis. This increase primarily reflected the impacts of the Novartis transaction in 2015 and the \u00a3219 million credit in SG&A in 2014 from a release of reserves following simplication of our entity structure, together with higher integration and restructuring costs and increased promotional product support, particularly for new launches in Respiratory, Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and HIV. This was partly offset by the benets of the Pharmaceuticals cost reduction programme, synergies in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare and lower legal charges. Research and development R&D expenditure increased 2% CER to \u00a33,560 million (14.9% of turnover) compared with \u00a33,450 million (15.0% of turnover) in 2014. The benets of the cost reduction programmes in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare R&D were more than offset by higher integration and restructuring costs.Group nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationGSK Annual Report 2015 61 Other operating income Net other operating income of \u00a37,715 million (2014 - \u00a3700 million expense) included the profits on the disposals of the Oncology business of \u00a39,228 million and ofatumumab of \u00a3200 million. This was partly offset by a further increase in the liability for the contingent consideration for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture of \u00a31,874 million (2014 - \u00a3768 million) following the improved sales performance of Tivicay and Triumeq . The liability of \u00a33,409 million at 31 December 2015 represents the present value of expected future payments to Shionogi. Further details of the consideration due to Shionogi in relation to ViiV Healthcare are set out on page 70. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a310,322 million compared with \u00a33,597 million in 2014. The increase primarily reflected the profits on disposal of the Oncology business to Novartis and several equity investment and other asset disposals. This was partly offset by increased integration and restructuring costs, the adverse impact on margins of the disposal of the higher margin Oncology business and acquisition of the lower margin Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses from Novartis and the increase in the contingent consideration liability payable on the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture. Intangible asset amortisation decreased to \u00a3563 million from \u00a3575 million in 2014. Intangible asset impairments of \u00a3206 million (2014: \u00a3150 million) included impairments of several R&D and commercial assets. Both of these charges were non-cash items. Major restructuring charges accrued in the year were \u00a31,891 million (2014 - \u00a3750 million) and reflected the acceleration of a number of integration projects following completion of the Novartis transaction, as well as further charges as part of the Pharmaceuticals restructuring programme. Cash payments made in the year were \u00a31,131 million (2014 - \u00a3566 million). The programme has delivered approximately \u00a31 billion of incremental benefits in 2015 compared with 2014. Charges to date for the combined restructuring and integration programme are \u00a32.7 billion. The total cash charges of the combined programme are expected to be approximately \u00a33.65 billion and the non-cash charges up to \u00a31.35 billion. By the end of 2015, the programme had delivered approximately \u00a31.6 billion of annual savings and remained on track to deliver \u00a33 billion of annual savings in total. The programme is expected to be largely complete by the end of 2017. Legal charges of \u00a3221 million (2014 - \u00a3548 million) included the settlement of a number of existing matters and litigation costs. The charge in 2014 included the \u00a3301 million fine payable to the Chinese government. Cash payments were \u00a3420 million (2014 - \u00a3702 million). Acquisition-related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a32,238 million (2014 - \u00a3843 million). This included remeasurements of the liability and the unwinding of the discounting effects on the contingent consideration for the acquisition of the former Shionogi- ViiV Healthcare joint venture of \u00a31,874 million (2014 - \u00a3768 million); the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of the former Novartis Vaccines business of \u00a391 million, net of hedging gains (2014 - \u00a3nil); and the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture put option of \u00a383 million (2014 - \u00a3nil). Further details of the consideration due to Shionogi in relation to ViiV Healthcare are set out on page 70. Disposals and other items resulted in a net credit of \u00a39,712 million (2014 - \u00a3131 million charge). This included the profit on disposal of the Oncology business to Novartis of \u00a39,228 million and the profit on disposal of ofatumumab, together with equity investment and other asset disposals, equity investment impairments reflecting current market valuations, one-off required regulatory charges in R&D and certain other adjusting items.Net finance costs Finance income2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Interest and other finance income 99 66 Fair value movements 5 2 104 68 Finance expense Interest expense (719) (688 ) Unwinding of discounts on liabilities (16) (15) Remeasurements and fair value movements (8) (10) Other finance expense (14) (14) (757) (727) Profit on disposal of interest in associates The profit on disposal of associates was \u00a3843 million (2014 - \u00a3nil). This arose from the disposal of half of our investment in Aspen Pharmacare and the remeasurement of the remaining holding to market value on its reclassification to other investments. Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of profits of associates and joint ventures was \u00a314 million (2014 - \u00a330 million profit), including a \u00a316 million gain, being our share of the profit on a disposal of an investment recognised by one of the associates. In 2014, the share of profits of associates principally arose on our holding in Aspen Pharmacare. Profit before taxation Taking account of net finance costs, the profit on disposal of interest in associates and the share of profits of associates, profit before taxation was \u00a310,526 million compared with \u00a32,968 million in 2014.

In 2015 GSK made payments of \u00a3111 million in UK Corporation tax. In January 2016 GSK made further payments of \u00a3100 million in relation to UK Corporation tax. These amounts are for Corporation tax only and do not include various other business taxes borne by GSK each year. See 'Taxation' on page 158 for further details. Earnings per share Total EPS was 174.3p, compared with 57.3p in 2014, the increase primarily reflecting the profits on disposal of the Oncology business and the Aspen Pharmacare shares, partly offset by the increase in the liability for the contingent consideration due on the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and accelerated charges for major restructuring expenditure. Dividends The Board declared four interim dividends resulting in a total dividend for the year of 80 pence, in line with the dividend for 2014. In addition, the Board has declared a special dividend of 20 pence to be paid out of the proceeds of the disposals of the Oncology business and other assets.

The definition of core results is set out on page 54. Cost of sales 2015 2014 Growth \u00a3m% of turnover \u00a3m% of turnover CER% \u00a3% Cost of sales (7 ,520 )(31.4 )(6,535 ) (28.4 )18 15 Cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 31.4%, 3.0 percentage points higher than in 2014. On a pro-forma basis, the cost of sales percentage increased 0.8 percentage points and 1.0 percentage points on a CER basis. This reflected adverse price movements, particularly in US Pharmaceuticals, and increased investments in Vaccines to improve the reliability and capacity of the supply chain. This was partly offset by an improved product mix, particularly as a result of the growth in HIV sales, and the benefits of our ongoing cost reduction programmes. Selling, general and administration 2015 2014 Growth \u00a3m% of turnover \u00a3m% of turnover CER% \u00a3% Selling, general and administration (7 ,907 )(33.1 )(7 ,074 ) (30.7 )12 12 SG&A costs as a percentage of sales were 33.1%, 2.4 percentage points higher than in 2014 and 2.0 percentage points higher on a CER basis. On a pro-forma basis, SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased 1.2 percentage points, and 0.8 percentage points on a CER basis. This increase primarily reflected the impact of the \u00a3219 million credit in SG&A in 2014 from a release of reserves following simplification of our entity structure. Excluding this, SG&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points on a CER basis, driven by declines in Global Pharmaceuticals, including the benefits of the Pharmaceuticals cost reduction programme, and synergies in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, largely offset by promotional product support, particularly for new launches in Respiratory, Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and HIV. Research and development 2015 2014 Growth \u00a3m% of turnover \u00a3m% of turnover CER% expenditure declined 2% to \u00a33,096 million (12.9% of turnover) compared with \u00a33,113 million (13.5% of turnover) in 2014. On a pro-forma basis, R&D expenditure declined 5% reflecting the benefit of cost reduction programmes in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare R&D.The operations of Pharmaceuticals R&D are broadly split into Discovery activities (up to the completion of phase IIa trials) and Development work (from phase IIb onwards) each supported by specific and common infrastructure and other shared services where appropriate. Phase IV costs and other administrative expenses are reported in SG&A and are not included in the table below. The table below analyses core R&D expenditure by these categories: 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Discovery 744 739 Development 1,136 1,317 Facilities and central support functions 433 455 Pharmaceuticals R&D 2,313 2,511 Vaccines R&D 525 443 Consumer Healthcare R&D 258 159 Research and development 3,096 3,113 The proportion of Pharmaceuticals R&D investment made in the late-stage portfolio decreased from 52% of Pharmaceuticals R&D costs in 2014 to 49% in 2015, reflecting the completion of a number of late-stage programmes.

The core operating margin of 23.9% was 4.8 percentage points lower than in 2014. Excluding the adverse impact of currency movements, particularly from the Euro and Emerging Markets currencies, the core operating margin was 4.1 percentage points lower on a CER basis. This decline included a 3.0 percentage point impact of the Novartis transaction, reflecting the disposal of the higher margin Oncology business and the acquisition of the lower margin and different cost structures of the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses from Novartis.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 64 GSK Annual Report 2015On a pro-forma basis, core operating prot was 2.7% lower in CER terms compared with 2014 on a turnover increase of 1%, which primarily reflected a decline in the pro-forma core operating margin of 1.1 percentage points. However, this decline also included a 0.9 percentage point impact from the adverse comparison with 2014 which included a \u00a3219 million credit in SG&A from a release of reserves following simplication of the Group's entity structure and its trading arrangements. Excluding this effect, the core operating margin declined 0.2 percentage points reflecting the balance between the continued impact of the decline in sales of Seretide/Advair , including contracting and other price reductions, lower sales of Established Products, as well as the investments required behind multiple new launches in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, as we transition our product portfolio, offset by the savings released by our restructuring and integration programmes and the benets of an improved product mix, particularly from the growth in HIV sales. Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals operating prot was \u00a34,251 million, 12% lower than in 2014 in CER terms on a turnover decrease of 7%. The core operating margin of 30.0% was 2.6 percentage points lower than in 2014 and 1.8 percentage points lower on a CER basis. On a pro-forma basis, the core operating margin decreased 1.2 percentage points on a CER basis, which reflected adverse price movements in Global Pharmaceuticals, particularly in the US for Respiratory products, the increased promotional and manufacturing investments behind new product launches in Respiratory and HIV as well as targeted investments in manufacturing capacity and stability elsewhere in the portfolio, partly offset by a more favourable product mix, primarily driven by the growth in HIV sales, and the benets of the Group's cost reduction programmes. The core operating margin for Global Pharmaceuticals was 40.0% (2014 - 45.8%) and for HIV was 72.6% (2014 - 65.2%). Vaccines Vaccines operating prot was \u00a3966 million, 9% lower than in 2014 in CER terms on a turnover increase of 19%. The core operating margin of 26.4% was 5.2 percentage points lower than 2014 and 7.6 percentage points lower on a CER basis, primarily driven by the inclusion of the cost base of the former Novartis Vaccines business. Pro-forma core operating prot grew by 7% on a turnover increase of 3% on a CER basis. The pro-forma operating margin improved 0.8 percentage points to 26.4% reflecting an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of turnover due to additional supply chain investments and the benet to cost of sales in 2014 of a number of inventory adjustments, more than offset by reductions in SG&A and R&D from restructuring and integration benets. Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare operating prot was \u00a3680 million, 66% higher than in 2014 in CER terms on a turnover increase of 44%. The core operating margin of 11.3% was 0.1 percentage points lower than in 2014, but improved 1.7 percentage points on a CER basis. On a pro-forma basis the operating margin increased 1.8 percentage points on a CER basis. This was driven by a reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of turnover, reflecting benets from improved supply and pricing, as well as the delivery of integration synergies which together more than offset additional investment behind the growth of target power brands, particularly in Oral health and Wellness.Net nance costs Finance income2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Interest and other income 99 66 Fair value movements 5 2 104 68 Finance expense Interest expense (719) (688) Unwinding of discounts on liabilities 1 (2) Remeasurements and fair value movements (8) (10) Other nance expense (14) (14) (740) (714) Net nance expense was \u00a3636 million compared with \u00a3646 million in 2014. Share of after tax losses of associates and joint ventures The share of losses of associates and joint ventures was \u00a32 million (2014 - \u00a330 million prot). In March 2015, we reduced our shareholding in our signicant associate, Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited, from 12.4% to 6.2% of the issued share capital. As a result, we no longer account for Aspen as an associate.

Non-controlling interests The allocation of earnings to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3440 million (2014 - \u00a3222 million), including the non-controlling interest allocations of Consumer Healthcare segment prots of \u00a3205 million (2014 - \u00a360 million) and the allocation of ViiV Healthcare prots, which increased to \u00a3224 million (2014 - \u00a3132 million). Further details of our economic interest in the prots of ViiV Healthcare are set out on page 70. Core earnings per share Core EPS of 75.7p declined 15% in CER terms compared with a 9% decline in operating prot, primarily reflecting the greater contributions to growth from businesses in which there are signicant non-controlling interests.Group nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 65Cash generation and conversion A summary of the consolidated cash flow is set out below. 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Net cash inflow from operating activities 2,569 5,176 Net cash inflow/(outflow) from investing activities 6,037 (1,078) Net cash outflow from nancing activities (7 ,103) (5,385) Increase/(decrease) in cash and bank overdrafts 1,503 (1,287) Cash and bank overdrafts at beginning of year 4,028 5,231 Increase/(decrease) in cash and bank overdrafts 1,503 (1,287) Exchange adjustments (45) 84 Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year 5,486 4,028 Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year comprise: Cash and cash equivalents 5,830 4,338 Overdrafts (344) (310) 5,486 4,028 Adjusted net cash inflow from operating activities 2,989 5,878 The net cash inflow from operating activities for the year was \u00a32,569 million (2014 - \u00a35,176 million). Excluding legal settlements of \u00a3420 million (2014 - \u00a3702 million), adjusted net cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a32,989 million (2014 - \u00a35,878 million). This was after payments of non-core restructuring and integration costs of \u00a31,131 million (2014 - \u00a3566 million) and the initial tax payments arising on the sale of the Oncology business amounting to \u00a31,071 million, all of which have been funded from divestment proceeds. Excluding these items, the adjusted net cash inflow from operating activities would have been \u00a35,191 million (2014 - \u00a36,444 million), a reduction of \u00a31,253 million (19%). The decrease primarily resulted from the initial impact of the Novartis transaction, reflecting the disposal of GSK's higher margin Oncology business and the impact of acquiring the lower margin Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses as well as lower operating prots, primarily in Global Pharmaceuticals, and the impact of negative currency movements in the year. In addition, the cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability recognised in operating cash flows increased by \u00a3117 million in 2015. The total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in 2015 were \u00a3159 million, of which \u00a3121 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a338 million was recognised in purchases of businesses within investing cash flows. Free cash flow Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by the business after meeting our obligations for interest, tax and dividends paid to non-controlling interests, and after capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Free cash (outflow)/inflow (155) 2,620 Adjusted free cash flow 265 3,322 Free cash outflow was \u00a3155 million for the year. Excluding legal payments of \u00a3420 million (2014 - \u00a3702 million), adjusted free cash flow was \u00a3265 million (2014 - \u00a33,322 million). This was after non-core restructuring and integration costs, and the initial tax payments on the sale of the Oncology business. Excluding these items, the adjusted free cash inflow would have been \u00a32,467 million (2014 - \u00a33,888 million). The decrease reflected the same factors as for the net cash inflow from operating activities described above.A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, which is the closest equivalent IFRS measure, to free cash flow is shown below. Reconciliation of free and adjusted cash flow 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Net cash inflow from operating activities 2,569 5,176 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (1,380) (1,188) Purchase of intangible assets (521) (563) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 72 39 Interest paid (762) (707) Interest received 99 63 Dividends from associates and joint ventures 5 5 Distributions to non-controlling interests (237) (205) Free cash flow (155) 2,620 Legal payments 420 702 Adjusted free cash flow 265 3,322 Investment appraisal We have a formal process for assessing potential investment proposals in order to ensure decisions are aligned with our overall strategy. This process includes an assessment of the cash flow return on investment (CFROI), as well as its net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) where the timeline for the project is very long term. We also consider the impact on earnings and credit prole where relevant. The discount rate used to perfor m nancial analyses is decided internally, to allow determination of the extent to which investments cover our cost of capital. For specic investments the discount rate may be adjusted to take into account country or other risk weightings. Capital expenditure and nancial investment Cash payments for tangible and intangible xed assets amounted to \u00a31,901 million (2014 - \u00a31,751 million) and disposals realised \u00a310,554 million (2014 - \u00a3594 million). Cash payments to acquire equity investments of \u00a382 million (2014 - \u00a383 million) were made in the year and sales of equity investments realised \u00a3357 million (2014 - \u00a3205 million). Future cash flow Over the long term, we expect that future cash generated from operations will be sufcient to fund our operating and debt servicing costs, normal levels of capital expenditure, obligations under existing licensing agreements, expenditure arising from restructuring programmes and other routine outflows including tax, pension contributions and dividends, subject to the 'Risk factors' discussed on pages 231 to 240. We may from time to time have additional demands for nance, such as for acquisitions and share repurchases. We have access to other sources of liquidity from short and long-term capital markets and nancial institutions, in addition to the cash flow from operations, for such needs. Working capital 2015 2014 Working capital percentage of turnover (%) 23% 22% Working capital conversion cycle (days) 191 209 Our working capital programme has continued to make progress with further improvements in the collection of receivables and better inventory management. The reported working capital conversion cycle days were distorted by a temporary favourable impact of 15 days arising from the Novartis transaction. Excluding this impact, the conversion cycle for 2015 was around 206 days. The reduction of 3 days compared with 2014 was predominantly due to an increase in the denominator from increased restructuring costs in 2015 offset by a benecial impact from exchange, reduced receivables from improved collections and reduced inventory levels.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 66 GSK Annual Report 2015Financial position and resources 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Assets Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment Goodwill 5,162 3,724 Other intangible assets 16,672 8,320 Investments in associates and joint ventures 207 340 Other investments 1,255 1,114 Deferred tax assets 2,905 2,688 Other non-current assets 990 735 Total non-current assets 36,859 25,973 Current assets Inventories 4,716 4,231 Current tax recoverable 180 138 Trade and other receivables 5,615 4,600 Derivative nancial instruments 125 146 Liquid investments 75 69 Cash and cash equivalents 5,830 4,338 Assets held for sale 46 1,156 Total current assets 16,587 14,678 Total assets 53,446 40,651 Trade and other payables (9,191) (7 ,958) Derivative nancial instruments (153) (404) Current tax payable (1,421) (945) Short-term provisions (1,344) (1,045) Total Long-term borrowings (15,324) (15,841) Deferred (445) Pensions and other post-employment benets (3,229) (3,179) Other provisions (420) (545) Derivative nancial - (9) Other non-current liabilities (10,656) capital premium and equipment Our business is science-based, technology-intensive and highly regulated by governmental authorities. We allocate signicant nancial resources to the renewal and maintenance of our property, plant and equipment to minimise risks of interruption of production and to achieve compliance with regulatory standards. A number of our processes use chemicals and hazardous materials. The total cost of our property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2015 was \u00a320,750 million, with a net book value of \u00a39,668 million. Of this, land and buildings represented \u00a34,117 million, plant and equipment \u00a32,987 million and assets in construction \u00a32,564 million. In 2015, we invested \u00a32,134 million in new property, plant and equipment. This was mainly related to a large number of projects for the renewal, improvement and expansion of facilities at various worldwide sites. Property is mainly held freehold. New in vestment is nanced from our liquid resources. At 31 December 2015, we had contractual commitments for future capital expenditure of \u00a3659 million and operating lease commitments of \u00a3789 million. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs. We observe stringent procedures and use specialist skills to manage environmental risks from our activities. Environmental issues, sometimes dating from operations now modied or discontinued, are reported under 'Our planet' on page 48 and in Note 45 to the nancial statements, 'Legal proceedings'. Goodwill Goodwill increased during the year to \u00a35,162 million at 31 December 2015, from \u00a33,724 million. The increase reflected the goodwill arising from the acquired Novartis Vaccines business and the creation of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include the cost of intangibles acquired from third parties and computer software. The net book value of other intangible assets as at 31 December 2015 was \u00a316,672 million (2014 - \u00a38,320 million). The increase in 2015 reflected the impact of acquiring the Vaccines business (\u00a32,680 million), and the creation of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture (\u00a36,003 million), capitalised development costs of \u00a3217 million, partly offset by the amortisation and impairment of existing intangibles of \u00a3738 million and \u00a3217 million, respectively. Investments in associates and joint ventures We held investments in associates and joint ventures, with a carrying value at 31 December 2015 of \u00a3207 million (2014 - \u00a3340 million). The market value at 31 December 2015 was \u00a3267 million (2014 - \u00a31,388 million). The largest of these investments was in Theravance Inc. (now Innoviva Inc.) which had a book value at 31 December 2015 of \u00a3112 million. The market value at 31 December 2015 was \u00a3229 million. Until 1 September 2015, Theravance Inc. was accounted for as an equity investment as it was considered that the Group could not exert signicant influence over the company until that point. See Note 20 to the Financial statements 'Investments in associates and joint ventures'. Other investments We held other investments with a carrying value at 31 December 2015 of \u00a31,255 million (2014 - \u00a31,114 million). The most signicant of these investments was in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited which had a book value at 31 December 2015 of \u00a3383 million. Previously, the investment in Aspen was treated as an associate but in March 2015 we sold half of our holding in Aspen and as a result were no longer able to exert signicant influence over the company; the investment has been reported within Other investments since that date. The other investments include equity stakes in companies with which we have research collaborations, which provide access to biotechnology developments of potential interest and interests in companies that arise from business divestments.Group nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 67Derivative nancial instruments: assets We had current derivative nancial instruments held at fair value of \u00a3125 million (2014 - \u00a3146 million). The majority of this amount related to foreign exchange contracts both designated and not designated as accounting hedges. Inventories Inventory of \u00a34,716 million increased from \u00a34,231 million in 2014. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Novartis acquisition, partly offset by exchange movements. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables of \u00a35,615 million increased from 2014 impacted by the Novartis acquisition, partly offset by exchange movements. Derivative nancial instruments: liabilities We held current derivative nancial instruments at fair value of \u00a3153 million (2014 - \u00a3404 million, current: \u00a39 million, non-current). This primarily related to foreign exchange contracts both designated and non-designated (inter-company loans and trade receivables) as accounting hedges. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables amounting to \u00a39,191 million increased from \u00a37,958 million in 2014, reflecting the effect of the Novartis acquisition and an increase in accruals for customer returns and rebates. Provisions We carried deferred tax provisions and other short-term and non-current provisions of \u00a33,286 million at 31 December 2015 (2014 - \u00a32,035 million) of which \u00a3352 million (2014 - \u00a3520 million) related to legal and other disputes and \u00a3816 million (2014 - \u00a3527 million) related to the Operational Excellence provision. Provision has been made for legal and other disputes, indemnied disposal liabilities, employee related liabilities and the costs of restructuring programmes to the extent that at the balance sheet date a legal or constructive obligation existed and could be reliably estimated. Pensions and other post-employment benets We account for pension and other post-employment arrangements in accordance with IAS 19. The decits, net of surpluses before allowing for deferred taxation were \u00a31,584 million (2014 - \u00a31,689 million) on pension arrangements and \u00a31,387 million (2014 - \u00a31,397 million) on unfunded post-employment liabilities. The decreases in the decits were predominantly driven by higher discount rates that we used to discount the value of the liabilities, partly offset by an increase in the UK inflation rate together with net obligations acquired as a result of the Novartis transaction. In December 2010, the UK scheme purchased an insurance contract that will guarantee payment of specied pensioner liabilities. This contract was valued at \u00a3755 million at 31 December 2015.Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities of \u00a310,656 million at 31 December 2015 (2014 - \u00a32,401 million) included \u00a33,549 million (2014 - \u00a31,619 million) of contingent consideration payable, of which \u00a33,110 million (2014 - \u00a31,579 million) was in respect of the acquisition in 2012 of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture, and \u00a3398 million was payable to Novartis in relation to the Vaccines acquisition during 2015. In addition, \u00a36,287 million related to the present value of the estimated amount payable by us in the event of full exercise of Novartis' right to require us to acquire its 36.5% shareholding in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture.

The decrease in net debt primarily reflected the impact of the Novartis transaction in which we sold our Oncology business for net cash proceeds of \u00a310.0 billion and paid \u00a33.4 billion, net of cash acquired, to purchase the Novartis Vaccines business. The rst tax payments on the Novartis transaction amounting to \u00a31,071 million have been made. In addition, we sold part of our shareholding in Aspen for cash proceeds of \u00a3564 million and paid dividends to shareholders of \u00a33,874 million. Net debt also reflected an exchange loss on the translation of cash held by the Group's Venezuelan subsidiaries. Because of the continuing political and economic uncertainties in Venezuela, at 31 December 2015, we changed the exchange rate used to translate our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Up to that point, we applied one of the ofcial rates available of VEF 6.3/US$1. At 31 December 2015, this was changed to VEF 199.6/US$1 (VEF 293.4/\u00a31). This change had no signicant impact on the Group income statement, but gave rise to an exchange loss on translation of the cash held by the Venezuelan subsidiaries of \u00a394 million.

The increase arose from the impact of both operating prots and business and asset disposal prots, partly offset by the remeasurement of the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration and the dividends paid in the year.

The Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture put option of \u00a36,204 million reflects the recognition of the initial value of the liability on the Group balance sheet. The changes in non-controlling interest primarily reflect the recognition of the Novartis share of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture.2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 3,000 \u00a3m equivalent GBP bonds EUR bonds USD bonds Other bank borrowings Leases2016 Group nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 69Share purchases In 2015, the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts acquired \u00a399 million of shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc (2014 - \u00a3245 million). Shares are held by the Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under the Group share option and award schemes. A proportion of the shares held by the Trusts are in respect of awards where the rules of the scheme require us to satisfy exercises through market purchases rather than the issue of new shares. The shares held by the Trusts are matched to options and awards granted. At 31 December 2015, the ESOP Trusts held 30 million (2014 - 53 million) GSK shares against the future exercise of share options and share awards. The carrying value of \u00a375 million (2014 - \u00a3151 million) has been deducted from other reserves. The market value of these shares was \u00a3409 million (2014 - \u00a3726 million). During 2015, no shares were repurchased. At 31 December 2015, we held 491.5 million shares as Treasury shares (2014 - 491.5 million shares), at a cost of \u00a36,917 million (2014 - \u00a36,917 million), which has been deducted from retained earnings. The company does not expect to make any ordinary share repurchases in 2016. No ordinary shares were purchased in the period 1 January 2016 to 25 February 2016. Commitments and contingent liabilities Financial commitments are summarised in Note 40 to the nancial statements, 'Commitments'. Other contingent liabilities and obligations in respect of short and long-term debt are set out in Note 32 to the nancial statements, 'Contingent liabilities' and Note 31 to the nancial statements, 'Net debt'. Amounts provided for pensions and post-retirement benets are set out in Note 28 to the nancial statements, 'Pensions and other post-employment benets'.

The terms of these arrangements can include upfront fees, equity investments, loans and commitments to fund specied levels of research. In addition, we will often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' are achieved. As some of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, the potential obligation to make milestone payments will continue for a number of years if the compounds move successfully through the development process. Generally, the closer the product is to marketing approval, the greater the probability of success. The amounts shown above within intangible assets represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones were achieved, and include \u00a35.1 billion which relates to externalised projects in the discovery portfolio. A number of new commitments were made in 2015 under licensing and other agreements, offset by amendments to existing agreements. In 2013, we reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions over a three year period, including in 2013, to eliminate the pension decit identied at the 31 December 2011 actuarial funding valuation. If the decit persists, further contributions would be payable in the following four years depending on the level of decit. The table above includes this commitment but excludes the normal ongoing annual funding requirement in the UK of approximately \u00a3140 million. For further information on pension obligations, see Note 28 to the nancial statements, 'Pensions and other post-employment benets'. Contingent liabilities The following table sets out contingent liabilities, comprising discounted bills, performance guarantees, letters of credit and other items arising in the normal course of business, and when they are expected to expire.

A provision is made where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and this is included in Note 29 to the nancial statements, 'Other provisions'. We provide for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes when an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate of the outflow may be made. At 31 December 2015, other than for those disputes where provision has been made, it was not possible to make a reliable estimate of the potential outflow of funds that might be required to settle disputes where the possibility of there being an outflow was more than remote. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary signicantly from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities. This is discussed further in 'Risk factors' on pages 231 to 240 and Notes 14 and 45 to the nancial statements, 'Taxation' and 'Legal proceedings'.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 70 GSK Annual Report 2015Non-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare Trading prot allocations Because ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group, 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating prot, prot after tax) are included within the Group income statement and a portion of the earnings is allocated to the non-controlling interests owned by the other shareholders, in line with their respective equity shareholdings (Pzer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%). Each of the shareholders, including GSK, is also entitled to preferential dividends determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings of ViiV Healthcare allocated to each shareholder will change. In particular, the increasing sales of Tivicay and Triumeq have a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to us. We were entitled to approximately 80% of the core earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2015. The preferential dividends allocated to Pzer and Shionogi are included in the non-controlling interest line. Acquisition-related arrangements As part of the agreement reached to acquire Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, we agreed to pay additional consideration to Shionogi contingent on the performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, principally dolutegravir. At 31 December 2015, the fair value of the contingent consideration due, representing the discounted value of the total amount estimated to be payable, was \u00a33,409 million and this has been recognised in the Group's balance sheet with \u00a3299 million shown in trade and other payables and \u00a33,110 million in other non-current liabilities. Payments are made to Shionogi each quarter to reduce the liability in instalments. The payments are calculated based on the sales performance of the relevant products in the previous quarter and are reflected in the cash flow statement partly in operating cash flows and partly in purchases of businesses, within investing activities. The part of each payment relating to the original estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012 of \u00a3659 million is reported in purchases of businesses and the part of each payment relating to the increase in the liability since the acquisition is reported within operating cash flows. During 2015, these cash payments amounted to \u00a3159 million in total, of which \u00a3121 million was reported in operating cash flows and \u00a338 million in purchases of businesses. Exit rights In certain circumstances, Pzer and Shionogi may require us to acquire their shareholdings at a price based on the likely valuation of ViiV Healthcare if it were to conduct an initial public offering (IPO). Pzer may request an IPO of ViiV Healthcare at any time and if either we do not consent to such IPO or an offering is not completed within nine months, Pzer could require us to acquire its shareholding. Shionogi may also request GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in certain circumstances and six month windows commencing in 2017, 2020 and 2022. Under the original agreements, we had the unconditional right, so long as we made no subsequent distribution to our shareholders, to withhold our consent to the exercise of either of the Pzer or Shionogi put options and, as a result, in accordance with IFRS, we did not recognise liabilities for these put options on our balance sheet. However, following our recent review of the prospects for the ViiV Healthcare business, and our conclusion that we intended to retain ViiV Healthcare, we have decided that the put options held by Pzer and Shionogi should now be recognised on the Group's balance sheet. For the liability for the put options to be recognised on the Group's balance sheet, IFRS requires the agreements giving us the rights to withhold consent to be changed to remove those rights. We have now notied Pzer and Shionogi that we have irrevocably given up these rights and we will recognise the liability for the put options on the Group's balance sheet in 2016. The estimated present value of the liability for the two put options is approximately \u00a32 billion, after adjustments for the value of the preferential dividends due to each of the shareholders. Consistent with this revised treatment, in 2016 we also expect to recognise liabilities on the Group's balance sheet for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pzer and Shionogi. The estimated aggregate present value of the liability for preferential dividends to both Pzer and Shionogi is approximately \u00a3170 million. Critical accounting policies The consolidated nancial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted for use in the European Union, and also with IFRS as issued by the IASB, following the accounting policies approved by the Board and described in Note 2 to the nancial statements, 'Accounting principles and policies'. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the nancial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies, for which information on the judgements and estimates made is given in Note 3 to the nancial statements, 'Key accounting judgements and estimates', and in the relevant detailed notes to the nancial statements as indicated below, relate to the following areas: Turnover Taxation (Note 14) Legal and other disputes (Notes 29 and 45) Goodwill and other intangible asset impairments (Notes 18 and 19) Business combinations (Note 38) Pensions and other post-employment benets (Note 28). Information on the judgements and estimates made in these areas is given in Note 3 to the nancial statements, 'Key accounting judgements and estimates'. Turnover In respect of the Turnover accounting policy, our largest business is US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, and the US market has the most complex arrangements for rebates, discounts and allowances. The following briefly describes the nature of the arrangements in existence in our US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business: We have arrangements with certain indirect customers whereby the customer is able to buy products from wholesalers at reduced prices. A chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contractual discounted price. Accruals for estimating chargebacks are calculated based on the terms of each agreement, historical experience and product growth ratesGroup nancial review continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 71 Customer rebates are offered to key managed care and group purchasing organisations (GPO) and other direct and indirect customers. These arrangements require the customer to achieve certain performance targets relating to the value of product purchased, formulary status or pre-determined market shares relative to competitors. The accrual for customer rebates is estimated based on the specic terms in each agreement, historical experience and product growth rates The US Medicaid programme is a state-administered programme providing assistance to certain poor and vulnerable patients. In 1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program was established to reduce state and federal expenditure on prescription drugs. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law. We participate by providing rebates to states. Accruals for Medicaid rebates are calculated based on the specic terms of the relevant regulations or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. These are accrued for at the time of invoicing and adjusted subsequently to reflect actual experience We record an accrual for estimated sales returns by applying historical experience of customer returns to the amounts invoiced, together with market related information such as stock levels at wholesalers, anticipated price increases and competitor activity. A reconciliation of gross turnover to net turnover for the US Pharmaceuticals business, including Puerto Rico, is as follows: 20152014 (restated) 2013 (restated) \u00a3mMargin % \u00a3m Margin % \u00a3m Margin % Gross turnover 8,212 100 7 ,789 100 8,684 100 Market driven segments (1,737) (21) (1,260) (16) (1,063) (12) Government mandated and state programs (1,874) (23) (1,381) (18) (1,194) (14) Cash discounts (154) (2) (147) (2) (168) (2) Customer returns (79) (1) (59) (1) (64) (1) Prior year adjustments 113 1 156 2 79 1 Other items (248) (2) (161) (2) (99) (1) Total deductions (3,979) (48) (2,852) (37) (2,509) (29) Net turnover 4,233 52 4,937 63 6,175 71 Market driven segments consist primarily of Managed Care and Medicare plans with which GSK negotiates contract pricing that is honoured via rebates and chargebacks. Mandated segments consist primarily of Medicaid and Federal government programs which receive government mandated pricing via rebates and chargebacks. The balance sheet accruals for rebates, discounts, allowances and returns for the US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business are managed on a combined basis. At 31 December 2015, the total accrual amounted to \u00a31,464 million (2014 - \u00a31,308 million). A monthly process is operated to monitor inventory levels at wholesalers for any abnormal movements. This process uses gross sales volumes, prescription volumes based on third party data sources and information received from key wholesalers. The aim of this is to maintain inventories at a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption. On this basis, US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines inventory levels at wholesalers and in other distribution channels at 31 December 2015 were estimated to amount to approximately ve weeks of turnover. This calculation uses third party information, the accuracy of which cannot be totally veried, but is believed to be sufciently reliable for this purpose. Legal and other disputes In respect of the accounting policy for Legal and other disputes, the following briefly describes the process by which we determine the level of provision that is necessary. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 37, 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets', we provide for anticipated settlement costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and legal and other expenses arising from claims against the Group. We may become involved in signicant legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be included in the Annual Report, but no provision would be made. This position could change over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's nancial statements. Like many pharmaceutical companies, we are faced with various complex product liability, anti-trust and patent litigation, as well as investigations of its operations conducted by various governmental regulatory agencies. Throughout the year, the General Counsel of the Group, as head of the Group's legal function, and the Senior Vice President and Head of Global Litigation for the Group, who is responsible for all litigation and government investigations, routinely brief the Chief Executive Ofcer, the Chief Financial Ofcer and the Board of Directors on the signicant litigation pending against the Group and governmental investigations of the Group. These meetings, as appropriate, detail the status of signicant litigation and government investigations and review matters such as the number of claims notied to us, information on potential claims not yet notied, assessment of the validity of claims, progress made in settling claims, recent settlement levels and potential reimbursement by insurers. The meetings also include an assessment of whether or not there is sufcient information available for us to be able to make a reliable estimate of the potential outcomes of the disputes. Often, external counsel assisting us with various litigation matters and investigations will also assist in the brieng of the Board and senior management. Following these discussions, for those matters where it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of a provision, if any, that may be required, the level of provision for legal and other disputes is reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. These matters are discussed further in Note 45 to the nancial statements, 'Legal proceedings'.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 72 GSK Annual Report 2015Treasury policies We report in Sterling and pay dividends out of Sterling prots. The role of Corporate Treasury is to monitor and manage our external and internal funding requirements and nancial risks in support of our strategic objectives. We operate on a global basis, primarily through subsidiary companies, and we manage our capital to ensure that our subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to optimise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. Treasury activities are governed by policies approved annually by the Board of Directors, and most recently on 8 July 2015. A Treasury Management Group (TMG) meeting, chaired by our Chief Financial Ofcer, takes place on a monthly basis to review treasury activities. Its members receive management information relating to these activities. Treasury operations The objective of our treasury activity is to minimise the post-tax net cost of nancial operations and reduce its volatility in order to benet earnings. We use a variety of nancial instruments to nance our operations and derivative nancial instruments to manage market risks from these operations. These derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate swaps, are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into currencies required for Group purposes and to manage exposure to nancial risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes and our Treasury policies specically prohibit such activity. All transactions in nancial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation. Capital management Our nancial strategy, implemented through our Financial architecture, supports the Group's strategic priorities and it is regularly reviewed by the Board. We manage the capital structure of the Group through an appropriate mix of debt and equity. Our long-term credit rating with Standard and Poor's is A+ (stable outlook) and with Moody's Investor Services ('Moody's') is A2 (negative outlook). Our short-term credit ratings are A-1 and P-1 with Standard and Poor's and Moody's respectively. Liquidity risk management Our policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash flow forecasts and funding requirements are monitored by the TMG on a monthly basis. Our strategy is to diversify liquidity sources using a range of facilities and to maintain broad access to funding markets. Each day, we sweep cash from a number of global subsidiaries to central Treasury accounts for liquidity management purposes. Interest rate risk management Our objective is to minimise the effective net interest cost and to balance the mix of debt at xed and floating interest rates over time. The policy on interest rate risk management limits the amount of floating interest payments to a prescribed percentage of operating prot.Foreign exchange risk managementForeign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are not typically hedged. Our objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency costs where possible. Our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk. Foreign currency cash flows can be hedged selectively under the management of Treasury and the TMG. These include hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from acquisitions and disposals of assets. Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash flows. These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling. Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets. Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets. The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly. Counterparty risk management We set global counterparty limits for each of our banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Corporate Treasury's usage of these limits is monitored daily by a Corporate Compliance Ofcer (CCO) who operates independently of Corporate Treasury. Any breach of these limits would be reported to the CFO immediately. The CCO also monitors the credit rating of these counterparties and, when changes in ratings occur, noties Corporate Treasury so that changes can be made to investment levels or to authority limits as appropriate. In addition, relationship banks and their credit ratings are reviewed regularly and a report is presented annually to the TMG for approval.

Corporate governanceGSK Annual Report 2015 81Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationKey ndings/Action points Progress/Achievement The composition of the Board is due to change over the next two to three years which will require a carefully planned and thoughtfully executed refreshment programme. The Chairman Designate, together with the Nominations Committee, will seek to enhance the governance processes relating to Board composition, tenure and size. They will review and seek to develop objective specications and plans for all the Board's roles in alignment with our strategy, the external landscape, and the company's evolving circumstances.A Board composition assessment exercise has been undertaken to enable the Nominations Committee to plan for the Board changes due to occur in the next few years and to ensure that the Board has the necessary skills. The Directors have identied gaps in the Board's current composition relating to US pricing and healthcare, emerging markets and consumer healthcare knowledge. Closing these knowledge and experience gaps will be considered as part of the process of recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors combined with the refreshment of designated specialist roles on the Board, such as scientic and medical expertise (SME) and the Senior Independent Director (SID).The Board was pleased that Vindi Banga and Dr Jesse Goodman, as SID designate and SME respectively, agreed to join the Board. Their appointments have helped to ll the identied skills gaps. The Nominations Committee continues to refresh the Board to meet the Company's future needs. Given the speed and complexity of the external landscape changes, and potential for surprises, highly experienced Non-Executive Directors are a crucial component of the Board's composition. The critical skill sets of potential candidates, such as international markets and cultural experience, crisis and stakeholder management, will be considered and the composition choices of peer group Boards will be benchmarked.Such characteristics have been factored into the individual search proles and selection process to recruit new Non-Executive Directors. The replacement of the current SID who is due to retire at the 2016 AGM is a priority issue. The Chairman Designate is leading the search involving internal and external candidates for this role. A SID specication is being developed that balances the replacement of existing knowledge with the ability to work well with the Chairman Designate, conduct robust Board evaluations, interact well with shareholders and be able to commit the necessary time to the role.Vindi Banga, whose background and experience fullled the requirements of our SID specication was appointed as SID designate in September 2015 and will succeed Sir Deryck Maughan, our current SID, at the conclusion of our 2016 AGM. Consideration should be given to reducing the size of the Board, if it is judged to have a strong enough composition and dynamic. This aspiration will be considered against a refreshed Board competence/skills matrix that is being used as part of the Board refreshment programme, and is linked to the company's strategy.The Board has, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, agreed and is working towards an ideal Board size of around 12 directors. Consideration should be given to enhancing the Non-Executive Director evaluation process. The Chairman Designate will lead this process and consider best practice techniques, such as a combination of annual individual and peer evaluations.The Chairman concluded this review and agreed to introduce peer evaluation to further inform his annual review meetings with each Board director. Board performance action points for 2016 The agreed action points arising from the 2015 Board evaluation review, internally facilitated by our Company Secretary, Victor ia Whyte, against which progress will be disclosed in GSK's 2016 Annual Report, are set out below: StrategyExecutive succession and NED refreshmentDeep dives and sites visits ShareholdersBoard materials and logistics Assist newer Directors with additional background brieng materials ahead of debates on strategy. Arrange more regular discussion of medium and longer term strategy with fresh insights from different perspectives. Implement suggestions to further enhance the effectiveness of the annual Board & CET strategy meetings. Further increase the focus on executive succession plans and ensure the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan. Consider alternative suggestions for Non-Executive Director refreshment. Consider further deep dives particularly on: R&D strategy and pipeline, product launches, US pricing, joint ventures, new business models and GMS. Consider holding one site visit to an operational site each year.Review and look to further enhance how the company communicates with shareholders.Continue the drive to make Board/Committee materials more concise and also effective in highlighting issues and concerns. Aim to have less presentation time and more time for discussion and debate at meetings. Allow for social time for Board members to get to know each other better given the number of new Board members.Board governance continued 2015 Board performance action points Progress against the conclusions of the 2014 Board evaluation review, independently facilitated by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited, is set out below: 82 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationCorporate governance continued Corporate governance framework The Board has a coherent corporate governance framework with clearly dened responsibilities and accountabilities designed to safeguard and enhance long-term shareholder value and provide a robust platform to realise the Group's strategy to Grow, Delive r and Simplify.

Sir Philip satised the FRC Code's independence test on his appointment to the Board, and is responsible to shareholders for the performance of the Group and leads discussions with them. Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors provide a strong, independent element on the Board. They are well placed to constructively challenge and support management and to shape proposals on strategy and succession planning. Between them, they bring independent judgement and a breadth of skills and experience gained at the most senior levels of international business operations and academia. Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of appointment which sets out the terms and conditions of his or her directorship. All our Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper performance of their duties. No precise timings are given as this will vary from year to year depending on the company's activities. They are expected to attend all Board meetings, and any additional meetings as required. The Board considers all of its Non-Executive Directors, including those with tenure of more than nine years, to demonstrate an appropriate degree of independence in character and judgement and to be free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement. The independence and commitment of those Non-Executive Directors who have served on the Board for over six years was subjected to a rigorous review. Senior Independent Non-Executive DirectorSir Deryck Maughan has been our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) since 1 May 2013.

Vindi Banga will succeed Sir Deryck as SID when he retires from the Board after our AGM on 5 May 2016. CEO Sir Andrew is responsible for the management of the business, developing the Group's strategic direction for consideration and approval by the Board and implementing the agreed strategy. He is assisted by other members of the Corporate Executive Team (CET), which meets at least 11 times a year and more often if required.

Board composition and diversity We seek to build an effective and complementary Board, whose capability is appropriate for the scale, complexity and strategic positioning of our business. The process for Board appointments is led by the Nominations Committee and is described on pages 95 to 97. We are mindful of the need to balance the composition of the Board and its Committees and to refresh them progressively over time so that we can draw upon the experience of longer serving Directors, while tapping into the new external perspectives and insights which more recent appointees bring to the Board's deliberations. Non-Executive Directors are drawn from a wide range of industries and backgrounds, including pharmaceutical and healthcare, medical research and academia, and retail, insurance and nancial services, and have appropriate experience of complex organisations with global reach. Some have considerable experience of the pharmaceutical industry and the more recent appointees bring a new approach to the Group, and to Board discussions. The Board's diversity policy is set out on page 97 and for details of the gender diversity of GSK's global workforce, see page 47.In addition to the scheduled meetings, the Board also met on a quorate basis on ve occasions to consider corporate transactions, including the Novartis transaction. Corporate governance continued Diversity Experience Scientic 27% Finance 27% Industry Over 9 years 25% Board induction A number of new Non-Executive Directors have joined the Board during the year and have each undertaken Board induction programmes that commenced when they were each appointed. The programme devised for our new Chairman, was based on the principles of the company's new Non-Executive Directors programmes outlined below. It was further customised to take account of his leadership role at GSK. A core element of this was individual meetings he held on a listening tour of GSK's major shareholders, to understand rsthand their views and perspectives on the Group, the company's strategy, leadership, business model, performance and trading environment. His enhanced programme is set out in full on page 81 of GSK's 2014 Annual Report. The induction programmes for Urs Rohner, Vindi Banga and Dr Jesse Goodman have been: (i) Individually designed and facilitated: by the Chairman and the Company Secretary. (ii) Designed with the purpose: to orientate and familiarise them with our industry, organisation, governance and our strategy to Grow, Deliver & Simplify. (iii) Customised: to take account of their respective experience, different geographical backgrounds and business perspectives, in light of the particular roles they would perform and the Committees on which they would serve. Key elements of the induction programmes including one-to-one briengs, \"teach-in\" sessions and site visits undertaken by Urs Rohner, Vindi Banga and Dr Jesse Goodman are set out below: Executive Directors to discuss GSK's strategic, nancial and R&D priorities. CET members to cover our principal Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines businesses, together with the R&D and GMS organisations that underpin our operating model. Other senior executives to cover our core operations such as Strategic Development, Finance, Tax, Treasury, Audit and Assurance, HR, Investor Relations and Global Ethics and Compliance. Site visits to our GMS, Vaccines, and R&D facilities. Investor meetings which have been particularly customised for Vindi Banga in his role of SID. CIA each new Director receives two hours of training on our CIA obligations.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 85Board, business awareness and training To ensure that our Non-Executive Directors develop and maintain a greater insight and understanding of the business, they are invited to attend internal management meetings, including meetings of the CET, the Research & Development Executive (RADEX), the Product Executive, the Scientic Review Board, the Portfolio Investment Board, the US Commercial Accountability Board and the Risk Oversight and Compliance Council (ROCC). They also meet employees informally during visits to the Group's operations and at receptions held around Board meetings. The Chairman also meets with each Director annually on a one-to- one basis to discuss his or her ongoing training and development requirements. The Board is kept up-to-date on legal, regulatory and governance matters through regular papers from the Company Secretary and presentations by internal and external advisers. The Board members undertook specic refresher training on, and under the provisions of, the CIA in March 2015. Each new Board member is required, as part of his or her induction programme, to receive comprehensive training on the CIA. Philip Hampton and Urs Rohner, in January 2015, Vindi Banga, in September 2015, and Jesse Goodman, in January 2016 have each taken part in such a training session as part of their induction programmes. 2015 Internal evaluation of the Board The Board carries out an evaluation of its performance and that of its Committees every year and the evaluation is facilitated externally every third year. The progress of the Board against the agreed action points of the 2014 evaluation, which was externally facilitated by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited, are disclosed on page 81. The 2015 Board and Committees evaluation process was conducted internally by the Secretary, at the request of the Chairman and the CEO, who: prepared surveys that were completed by Board members and held interviews with each Director; discussed the outcomes and recommendations with the Chairman; and following discussion with the Board as a whole, identied areas for improvement as agreed by the Board. Amongst the areas reviewed were Board oversight issues, shareholders and other stakeholder relationships, Board culture and how it balances challenge and support, ethics, strategy and priorities. The Board is viewed by all members as effective, strong and well able and equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. The action points arising from the 2015 evaluation are disclosed on page 81. Chairman and Non-Executive Director evaluation The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) sought feedback on the Chairman's performance and canvassed views on the Chairman's performance from the Non-Executive Directors collectively. The results of the Chairman's effectiveness review were then discussed by the Chairman and the SID. The Chairman met with each Non-Executive Director to discuss individual contributions and performance, together with training and development needs. He also shares peer feedback that is provided as part of the evaluation process. In addition, the Chairman met with all the Non-Executive Directors independently of the Executive Directors.Accountability Internal control framework The Board recognises its responsibilities to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's position and prospects. The Board has accountability for reviewing and approving the effectiveness of internal controls operated by the Group, including nancial, oper ational and compliance controls, and risk management. The GSK Internal Control Framework (the Framework) is the means by which GSK assures compliance with laws and regulations, the reliability of nancial reporting and the effectiveness of risk management. The Framework assists in the ongoing process of the Board's identication, evaluation, and management of the company's Principal Risks as required by the FRC's Code, and is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of not achieving business objectives. A t-for-purpose internal control framework, in conjunction with embedding the GSK Values and our 'Speak Up' reporting lines, ensures that our Principal Risks are actively and effectively controlled. For more information see 'Our approach to risk' on pages 16 to 17. The Framework is designed to ensure the risks associated with conducting our business activities are effectively controlled in line with GSK's risk appetite. We believe the Framework provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. To ensure effective governance and an ethical culture, GSK has established the Risk Oversight and Compliance Council (ROCC). This team of senior leaders is authorised by the Board to assist the Audit & Risk Committee (the Committee) in overseeing risk management and internal control activities. It also provides the business with a framework for risk management, upward reporting of signicant risks, GSK Values and policies. Each business unit and global support function has a risk board structure which reports to the ROCC. These Risk Management and Compliance Boards (RMCB) are responsible for local 'tone from the top', risk management and internal controls. The ROCC and the RMCBs are assisted by Global Ethics and Compliance (GEC), which is responsible for supporting risk management and the development and implementation of practices that facilitate employees' compliance with laws and policy. GEC also provides assistance to help employees meet high ethical standards by operating in accordance with our Values, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations and corporate responsibility. GSK's Audit & Assurance (A&A) provides an objective view (i.e. assurance) to senior management and the Board of how risk is being managed across the Group in line with an agreed Assurance Plan. This assurance helps them meet their oversight and advisory responsibilities in fullling our strategic and operational ambitions and building trust with our patients and other stakeholders. A&A has a dual reporting line into the CFO and the Committee. The Committee receives reports from Business Unit Heads, GEC and A&A on areas of signicant risk to the Group and on related internal controls. These reports provide summaries of changes to the control environment within each Principal Risk area. Following consideration of these reports, the Committee reports annually to the Board on the effectiveness of controls.86 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationThe Board, through the Committee, has conducted a robust assessment of the Group's Principal Risks and the Framework, and has considered the effectiveness of the system of internal controls in operation across the Group for the year covered by this Annual Report and up to the date of its approval by the Board. The Board's review focuses on the company and its subsidiaries and does not extend to material associated undertakings, joint ventures or other investments, although it considers the risk of the company's participation in these activities. There are established procedures and controls in place to identify entities whose results must be consolidated with the Group's results. We believe the process followed by the Board, through the Committee, in reviewing regularly the system of internal controls and risk management arrangements is in accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the FRC. These ongoing review and monitoring arrangements were expanded during the year to include the impact of the Novartis transaction that closed on 2 March 2015. For further details see page 88.This is in accordance with the provisions of the FRC's Code, which provide that the Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the Principal Risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The Board provides oversight to help ensure that the Group maintains sound risk management and internal control systems. The Framework has been in operation for the whole year and continues to operate up to and beyond the date of the approval of this Annual Report. A review of the Group's risk management approach is further discussed in 'Our approach to risk' section of the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 17. Our management and mitigation of each Principal Risk is explained in 'Principal risks and uncertainties' on pages 231 to 240. The Group's viability is discussed in the Group nancial review section of the Strategic report on page 52.Corporate governance continued Independent Business MonitoringIndependent Assurance Risk Assessment Discipline and EnforcementWrittenStandards& Controls Training CommunicationManagementMonitoring Responding to Problem sEnterprise Oversight GSK ValuesBusiness ActivitiesOur internal control framework Key Individual Accountability Line Management Accountability with Compliance Business Management Accountability with Compliance Audit & AssuranceAudit & Risk CommitteeResponsible for reviewing and approving the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management and internal controlsBoard of DirectorsResponsible for our system of corporate governance, strategy, risk management and nancial performance Risk Oversight and Compliance CouncilAuthorised by the Board to assist the Audit & Risk Committee in overseeing the risk management and internal control activities of the GroupCorporate Executive TeamSupports the CEO in managing our business and activities Risk Oversight and Compliance CouncilEnsure that appropriate internal controls for effective risk management are implemented Complemented by Country Executive Risk Boards to ensure a consistent approach to risk management across local geographiesBusiness units Responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks within their businessesAccountability for monitoring Responsibility for implementingGovernance structure of risk managementStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 87Remuneration Our Remuneration report comprises the Remuneration Committee Chairman's annual statement and the annual report on remuneration and is set out on pages 102 to 126. In addition, we have produced a summary of the shareholder approved Remuneration policy report, which is set out on pages 127 to 128. Relations with shareholders We work to engage effectively wi th shareholders through our regular communications, the AGM and other investor relations activities. It has been a particularly busy year in terms of shareholder engagement, in what has been a transformational year for the company as a result of the Novartis transaction. In addition to the continuous dialogue the CEO and CFO maintain with institutional shareholders, in which they held 40 individual meetings and hosted 13 group events, there has been a number key shareholder engagement events during the year, including: the new Chairman undertaking a listening tour of our institutional investors to understand rsthand their views and perspectives on the issues and challenges facing the industry and GSK; holding an Investor Day in May 2015, at which the CEO and the leaders of our Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare businesses outlined the strategic proposition for the reshaped Group and proled the medium to long-term shape and opportunities for GSK; holding an R&D event in November 2015, at which the CEO and leaders of our R&D Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines businesses proled 40 potential new medicines and vaccines that offer signicant opportunity to drive long-term performance and deliver new benets to patients and consumers; and also holding our annual investors meetings in November 2015, at which the new Chairman and Remuneration Committee Chairman, the Audit & Risk Committee Chairman, our SID and Company Secretary discussed corporate governance and remuneration matters with our institutional investors. Committee reports The reports of the Audit & Risk, Nominations and Corporate Responsibility Committees, descri bing the activities of those Committees during the year, are set out on pages 88 to 99.88 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationCorporate governance continued Dear Shareholder During 2015, the Committee's agenda has continued to be built around the usual review of our nancial results and ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of the company's internal control and risk management arrangements. This year, however, it has also had a particular focus on the impact of the Novartis transaction that we closed on 2 March 2015. The transaction resulted in very material change in all three of our core businesses and has required signicant integration and restructuring efforts to embed the acquired businesses in Vaccines and Consumer and extract the oncology marketed products from Pharmaceuticals. Regular reviews were held by the Committee to ensure that our control framework and reporting requirements were being maintained throughout. In addition, the Committee has continued to monitor the Group's key ongoing transformation and simplication programmes including, in particular, those in our Global Support Functions where we are continuing to simplify our operating model through programmes such as Finance Transformation as well as undertaking major upgrades to the Group's systems and global processes, including core ERP, HR and supply chain platforms. The Committee has also regularly reviewed the Group's cyber security and the progress of our Infoprotect programme which is designed to address this risk specically. New standards introduced into the FRC's Code for 2015 have required additional focus from the Committee this year to ensure our compliance with these requirements. Probably the most signicant change this year has been the new requirements relating to the company's viability which we report on for the rst time on page 52. Finally, the Committee has approved the formal commencement of an audit tender in the autumn of 2016 that will result in a new audit rm replacing PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) at the beginning of 2018. This is a signicant and important step for the Committee and the Board and more details on the audit tender process, its governance and timescales can be found on page 92. Internal framework for control and risk management The enhancements made to our internal control framework have helped to build a stronger culture of compliance and enable a multi-faceted approach to streng thening controls around each of our Principal Risks. During 2015, extensive training and communications were implemented across our compliance functions, and in turn, with key risk groups in each of our business units. This progress has been supported by our Global Ethics and Compliance (GEC) function. The activities of GEC were re-organised and enhanced during 2015 to put in place a network of experts sitting in Centres of Excellence that manage the key elements of our Principal Risks and internal control framework. This new governance model is designed to standardise, prioritise and drive integrated compliance controls across each of our Principal Risks.The following Centres of Excellence have been established: Global Risk Ofce has accountability for strengthening risk management by standardising methodology around managing our Principal Risks, including our combined ABAC and Third Party risk programme, as well as identifying emerging risks through scanning the external and internal environment, and serving as the steward of our internal control framework model by proactively communicating and monitoring effective implementation. Strategy, Planning and Operations has accountability for ensuring our global system of governance is embedded by maintaining and proactively delivering standards, policies, training and our values assurance programme throughout GSK. Investigations & Independent Business Monitoring offers three tiers of service, delivered via regional hubs, to provide a consistent framework for delivering effective Independent Business Monitoring which is also aligned to GSK's Values. Other related initiatives overseen by the Committee included: Improved coordination of our investigatory efforts through the establishment of an Enterprise Investigations Committee to accelerate the management of 'Speak-Up', Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABAC) and Computer Security Incident Response issues, assign issues for investigation as appropriate, and enable greater collaboration across GEC, Legal, HR and our Computer Security Response teams. Monitoring progress in implementing the programme of actions underway to enhance the control of our ABAC risk and ultimately incorporate ABAC requirements in to regular business practices. Employee and management accountability was further improved in 2015 through the establishment of a network of ABAC owners within the business units, broadening of ABAC training and communications across the enterprise, the introduction of periodic certications, the reinforcement of the linkage between GSK Values and performance, and the implementation of a new policy on senior management nancial recoupment. Completion of General Manager (GM) Conrmations of the operation of our internal control framework for all markets in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines businesses, excluding the US which has a different system of review. This was completed in 2015. The assessment process has become an annual process and now operates a standardised and consistent approach. Output from these reviews has been consolidated to provide a clearer view of current trends, assist with the identication of potential gaps and facilitate the sharing of good practices. In 2016, Consumer Healthcare will implement a similar process for GM Conrmation of the operation of our internal control framework for key risks and minimum controls. Novartis integration Oversight of the Novartis transaction has been a key priority for the Committee, given the importance of the success of the transaction to the Group. The Committee has received regular reports and presentations on the integration and management of the acquired Novartis businesses from an operational, internal control accounting and risk management perspective both in the run up to the close of the transaction in March 2015 and regularly throughout the year as the integration and associated restructuring programmes began to be implemented. In addition, on-boarded Novartis employees have successfully completed the mandatory training on our Code of Conduct, ABAC, and Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations.Audit & Risk Committee Report Judy LewentAudit & Risk Committee Chairman Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 89Global Support Function simplication programmes The Committee has continued to review regularly the multi-year programmes underway to simplify our support functions and standardise our operating model around new and upgraded platforms. These programmes are now well established but are at a peak of activity currently as the new platforms and processes are rolled out across the Group, compounded by the additional requirements to integrate the former Novartis businesses into the Group's operating and reporting infrastructure. Signicant progress has been reported with the completion of new global HR and supply chain forecasting systems and multiple cut overs of local operating companies onto the new ERP platform delivered during the year with targeted control levels maintained throughout. The Committee has also paid particular attention to the parallel transformation programmes underway in a number of the support functions, especially the Finance Transformation initiative, to ensure that controls and reporting requirements are not affected. InfoProtect The Committee continues to keep the multi-year programme to enhance, secure and strengthen our cyber security defences under close scrutiny. As part of this review process a cyber security report is submitted by the Chief Information Security Ofcer to each scheduled meeting and we were pleased that a number of key risk reduction initiatives were delivered during the year. UK Corporate Governance Code Following the issue of FRC's updated Code and associated Guidance that came into effect for the 2015 nancial reporting year, the Committee has devoted time to satisfying itself that our internal control and risk management arrangements and monitoring practices accord with these new enhanced requirements. A particular area of investment during the year was the development and recommendation to the Board of a new viability statement, which examines the company's longer term solvency and viability and is set out on page 52. We agreed the analytical and assurance work by management that underpins the statement and considered that three years was an appropriate timeframe on which to base an assessment of long-term viability as it aligns with our regular business planning period. The Committee also reviewed the outcome of the stress testing performed by management and recommended that the Directors conrm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of the assessment. The Committee will continue its work to encourage and support further enhancements to the Group's internal controls and audit assurance arrangements. In addition, I look forward to reporting the conclusion of our external audit tender process and to explaining how the plan to manage the transition from PwC to our new auditor will operate.

In considering the quarterly nancial results announcements and the nancial results contained in the 2015 Annual Report, the Committee reviewed the signicant issues and judgements made by management in determining those results. The Committee reviewed papers prepared by management setting out the key areas of risk, the actions undertaken to quantify the effects of the relevant issues and the judgements made by management on the appropriate accounting required to address those issues in the nancial statements. Signicant issues relating to the nancial statements The signicant issues considered in relation to the nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are set out in the following table, together with a summary of the nancial outcomes where appropriate. In addition, the Committee and the external auditors have discussed the signicant issues addressed by the Committee during the year and the areas of particular audit focus, as described in the Independent Auditor's Report on pages 131 to 137. Signicant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the nancial statements How the issue was addressed by the Committee Going concern basis for the preparation of the nancial statementsThe Committee considered the outcome of management's half-yearly reviews of current and forecast net debt positions and the various nancing facilities and options available to the Group. Following a review of the risk and potential impact of unforeseen events, the Committee conrmed that the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the nancial statements continued to be appropriate. Revenue recognition, including returns and rebates (RAR) accrualsThe Committee reviewed management's approach to the timing of recognition of revenue and accruals for customer returns and rebates. The US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines accrual for returns and rebates was \u00a31.5 billion at 31 December 2015 and the Committee reviewed the basis on which the accrual had been made and concurred with management's judgements on the amounts involved. A fuller description of the process operated in the US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business in determining the level of accrual necessary is set out in 'Critical accounting policies' on page 70. Provisions for legal matters, including investigations into the Group's commercial practicesThe Committee received detailed reports on actual and potential litigation from both internal and external legal counsel, together with a number of detailed updates on investigations into the Group's commercial practices. Management outlined the levels of provis ion and corresponding disclosure considered necessary in respect of potential adverse litigation outcomes and also those areas where it was not yet possible to determine if a provision was necessary, or its amount. At 31 December 2015, the provision for legal matters was \u00a30.4 billion, as set out in Note 29 to the nancial statements, 'Other provisions'. Provisions for uncertain tax positionsThe Committee considered current tax disputes and areas of potential risk and concurred with management's judgement on the levels of tax contingencies required. At 31 December 2015, the Group's balance sheet included a tax payable liability of \u00a31.4 billion. Impairments of intangible assetsThe Committee reviewed management's process for reviewing and testing goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment. The Committee accepted management's judgements on the intangible assets that required writing down and the resulting impairment charge of \u00a3217 million in 2015. See Note 19 to the nancial statements, 'Other intangible assets' for more details. Valuation of contingent consideration in relation to ViiV HealthcareThe Committee considered management's judgement that following the further improved sales performance of Tivicay and Triumeq , it was necessary to increase the liability to pay contingent consideration for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture. At 31 December 2015, the Group's balance sheet included a net contingent consideration liability of \u00a33.4 billion. See Note 38 to the nancial statements, 'Acquisitions and disposals' for more details. Novartis transaction items including Vaccines contingent consideration and Consumer Healthcare put optionThe Committee received regular reports throughout the year on the progress of the Novartis transaction. The Committee reviewed the basis of the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired from Novartis, and in particular, the calculations of the liabilities for the Vaccines contingent consideration and the Consumer Healthcare put option. The Committee concurred with management's judgements on the amounts to be recognised.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 92 GSK Annual Report 2015Corporate governance continued Audit tender governance In December 2015, the Committee agreed that, to achieve the move to a new audit rm to take over the audit for the 2018 nancial year, an audit contract tender be conducted in the autumn of 2016. A nal recommendation by the Committee of at least two audit rms with a preference expressed for the appointment of one of those rms is anticipated to be made in December 2016 for nal approval by the Board by the end of 2016. The Committee will direct and supervise the tender process and has agreed the implementation of a robust audit tender governance structure to deliver a successful audit contract tender process with minimal disruption to the Group. The main elements of this governance structure are as follows: Audit Tender Planning Team Remit: design, plan, implement and run audit tender processMeets: weeklyOperations Steering Committee Remit: coordinate/execute audit tender process and consider shortlisting arrangementsMeets: monthly then fortnightly towards end of processExecutive Steering Committee Remit: lead/oversee audit tender process implementationAssess candidates; liaise with the ARC during process and nal evaluation Members: ARC Chair, CFO, Group Financial Controller and Company SecretaryMeets: monthlyAudit & Risk Committee Remit: direct and supervise audit tender process and recommend new auditor to the BoardBoard Remit: Appoints new auditor with effect from 1 January 2018 and agrees to seek shareholder approval for the appointment at the AGMAudit tendering PwC has been the auditor of the company and the Group since the inception of each in 2000. Their performance has been reviewed annually and audit partner rotation requirements have been observed. During this time, the Directors have not sought to tender PwC's contract. As a result of the UK's implementation of the EU's mandatory rm rotation requirements, the company is required to re place PwC with another auditor no later than for the nancial year commencing 1 January 2021. In January 2015, when the Committee, as usual, reviewed PwC's performance for the previous year and recommended their reappointment for a further year, it also considered whether to initiate or defer an external audit contract tendering process. The Committee agreed that given the level of change that was being experienced in the business, it was not appropriate to put the a udit out to tender in 2015. However, having reviewed the relative merits of conducting a tender and the recent changes in regulation s in this area, the Committee considered that it was in the best interests of shareholders to plan to undertake a tender process in the second half of 2016. It would target appointing the new auditor with effect from 1 January 2018, which would coincide with the end of the current Pw C partner's ve year tenure as the Group audit engagement leader. If the company was to reappoint PwC from 1 January 2018, a new PwC Partner would need to be appointed and PwC would still be required to rotate after the 2020 audit. Consequently, PwC will not be asked to participate in the anticipated tender exercise in the second half of 2016. Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 93Ongoing effectiveness and quality of external audit process The Committee is committed to ensuring on an ongoing basis that GSK receives a high quality and effective audit. In evaluating the effectiveness of the audit process prior to making a recommendation on the re-appointment of the external auditor, the Committe e reviews the effectiveness of their performance against criteria which it agrees, in conjunction with management, at the beginni ng of each year's audit. The cycle of activities the Committee typically undertakes each year to satisfy itself of external audit quality and effectiven ess, together with their timelines, is set out below. Performance expectations for GSK's external auditor Specic auditor responsibilities Wider auditor responsibilities Discuss approach and areas of focus in advance with early engagement on understanding the implications of GSK's new operating model Ensure Sarbanes-Oxley scope and additional procedures are discussed and endorsed by management and communicated on a timely basis within GSK and PwC Avoid surprises through timely reporting of issues at all levels within the Group Ensure there is clarity of roles and responsibilities between the auditor and local management Respond to any issues raised by management on a timely basis Meet agreed deadlines Provide continuity and succession planning of key employees of the auditor Provide sufcient time for management to consider draft auditor reports and respond to requests and queries Employ consistent communication between local and central audit teams. Provide up-to-date advice on the new viability statement requirement Provide up-to-date knowledge of technical and governance issues, providing accurate and timely advice Serve as an industry resource; communicating best practice and industry trends in reporting Adhere to all independence policies (including GSK's policies, the Financial Reporting Council's ISA 240 and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission standards) Deliver a focused and consistent audit approach globally that reflects local risks and materiality Liaise with GSK's Audit & Assurance team to avoid duplication of work and Global Ethics and Compliance team to ensure common understanding of audit outcomes Provide consistency of advice at all levels of the organisation Ultimately provide a high quality service to the Board, be scrupulous in their scrutiny of the Group and act with utmost integrity. The detailed criteria the Committee uses for judging the effectiveness of the external auditor and their overriding responsibil ity to deliver a smooth running, thorough and efciently executed audit are set out below: Auditor re-appointment process Matters addressed: review effectiveness of external auditor against expectations set in previous year review auditor's independence, appropriate level of qualications, expertise and resources consider whether auditor exhibited appropriate level of challenge/scepticism in their work consider whether to initiate or defer an audit contract tender once satised, recommend to Board auditor re-appointment at next AGMAuditor expectations settingFormal auditor appointment and audit planningCommittee evaluation and budget setting Matters addressed: agree the performance expectations of the auditor for the upcoming auditMatters addressed: shareholders vote at AGM on resolutions to appoint auditor and x their remuneration review and agree audit plan for upcoming audit consider auditor's quality control procedures agree and set statutory audit fee receive management feedback on prior year's audit process through survey covering: - robustness of audit process - quality of delivery, people and serviceMatters addressed: review feedback from Committee members independently as part of annual Committee evaluation covering: - relationship with auditor - quality of insights they provide Committee on their work - whether they have sufcient access to auditor with management pre-approve budget for non-audit services (ideally below 50% of statutory audit fee) for following year January March May December Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 94 GSK Annual Report 2015Corporate governance continued Non-audit services The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits the engagement of the external auditor for the provision of certain services such as legal, actuarial, internal audit outsourcing or nancial information systems design. Where the external auditor is permitted to provide non-audit services (such as audit-related, tax and other services), the Committee ensures that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded by a policy requiring pre-approval by the Committee for such services. There were no contractual or si milar obligations restricting the Group's choice of external auditor. All non-audit services over \u00a350,000 are put out to competitive tender with nancial service providers other than the external auditor, in line with the Group's procurement process, unless the skills and experience of the external auditor make them the most suitable supplier of the non-audit service under consideration, in which case a request for proposal is submitted by the relevant CET member to the CFO for approval. Non-audit services spending is monitored by the Committee on a quarterly basis and discussed with the Committee Chairman. The following policy guidelines on engaging the external auditor to provide non-audit services are observed: ascertaining that the skills and experience of the external auditor make them a suitable supplier of the non-audit services; ensuring adequate safeguards are in place so that the objectivity and independence of the Group audit are not threatened or compromised; and ensure that the total fee levels do not exceed 50% of the annual audit fee, except in special circumstances where there would be a clear advantage in the company's auditor undertaking such additional work. Fees paid to the company's auditor and its associates are set out below. Further details are given in Note 8 to the nancial statements, 'Operating prot'. Where possible, other accounting rms are engaged to undertake non-audit services. * The fee for audit and assurance services in 2015 includes \u00a37.5 million arising from the Novartis transaction and the subsequent increase in complexity of the Group. Approximately half of this is expected to be recurring.Fair, balanced and understandable assessment One of the key compliance requirements of a group's nancial statements is for the Annual Report to be fair, balanced and understandable. The coordination and review of Group-wide contributions into the Annual Report follows a well established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the external auditor. The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of GSK's 2015 Annual Report to ensure that it met the requirements of the FRC's Code. This enabled the Committee, and then the Board, to conrm that GSK's 2015 Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable. Code of Conduct and reporting lines We also have a number of well established policies, including a Code of Conduct, which is availa ble on the governance section of our website, and condential 'Speak Up' reporting lines for the reporting and investigation of unlawful conduct. An updated version of the Code of Conduct was published in January 2014. CMA Order 2014 Statement of compliance The Committee conrms that during 2015 the company has complied with the mandatory audit processes and audit committee responsibilities provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority Statutory Audit Services Order 2014, as outlined in this report which describes the work of the Committee in discharging its responsibilities. Committee evaluation The Committee's annual evaluation was internally facilitated by the Company Secretary, and supplemented by a questionnaire circulated to Committee members on behalf of the Committee Chairman. It was concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively. In terms of enhancements to the Committee's deliberations the following improvement points were agreed: Continue to improve on paper content and focus, ensuring brevity throughout; Further increase the focus on setting, monitoring and adjusting risk appetite; Incorporate the new Risk Oversight Compliance Council reporting updates on new and emerging issues into the Committee's agenda, to aid anticipation of potential risk and audit issues; and Consider the division of meetings into two halves, focusing on traditional nancial and audit related matters for Committee members only, and risk, litigation and serious issues facing the Group. The Committee subsequently debated the organisation of its meetings and agreed that all Board members wished to continue to attend the entire meeting. 2014 2013 Audit and assurance services Other services, including tax, regulatory, compliance and treasury-related servicesServices related to the Novartis 05 20155.38.6 5.330 20.0 20.120.027.5*Audit/non-audit service three year comparison graph (\u00a3m)Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 95Dear Shareholder One of the rst key priorities when I joined the Board at the start of the year was to succeed Sir Christopher Gent as Nominations Committee Chairman. Last year was a year of signicant transition and this meant that I could focus immediately on tailoring the refreshment of the Board in line with the: agreed principles and actions set out in Dr Tracy Long's 2014 external evaluation review; and requirements of the reshaped Group to create and maximise the long-term value of the Novartis transaction to shareholders. The Nominations Committee (the Committee) has had a busy year and has made good progress towards its aim of rst considering Board size and composition and then replacing a number of planned retirements for Non-Executive Board members and addressing identied skills gaps. The Committee has also focused on effective management succession of executive management. Progress in respect of these elements is set out below. Board size and composition A central element of the current Board refreshment programme was the consideration of the most appropriate size and composition for the Board given the scale, complexity and strategic positioning of the business. In performing this analysis, the Committee used an enhanced Board competence and experience matrix linked to the company's strategy and underpins the Board refreshment programme. We are making good progress in identifying an ideal future size of the Board, which is likely to see a reduction in the second half of 2016. As part of this analysis, the Committee has also factored the increased target of 33% size in female representation by 2020 as outlined by Lord Davies in his nal 'Women on Boards' report published in October 2015. CEO and management succession The Committee has continued to scrutinise the robustness of succession planning arrangements for the Executive Directors and each executive management role, together with the adequacy of the pipeline of leadership talent below the CET. After what will have been nearly 10 years as CEO, Sir Andrew has indicated to the Board his intention to retire from the company in early 2017. The Board has agreed that he will retire on 31 March 2017. The Committee will now start a formal search for a successor and will consider internal and external candidates for the role. To that end, Egon Zehnder and Korn Ferry have been engaged.Senior Independent Director (SID) succession Sir Deryck Maughan has brought his own style to the role of SID, discharging its responsibilities with great diligence including leading and concluding the recent Chairman succession search process. We were pleased that Sir Deryck agreed to further extend his tenure on the Board to step down at the AGM in May 2016. He brings continuity to the Board's composition, given his signicant knowledge of, and experience in, GSK's business affairs. In a period of signicant change to the Board's membership, Sir Deryck has helped to facilitate the transition between Sir Christopher and myself. In addition, as a Committee member, he has helped in the search and recruitment of his successor, as SID. The Committee was pleased to recommend to the Board the appointment of Vindi Banga as SID designate. Vindi joined the Board in September 2015 and was appointed to the same Committees as Sir Deryck in January 2016 (Nominations, Audit & Risk and Remuneration). They are working closely together to ensure a smooth transition. Vindi will succeed Sir Deryck as SID at the conclusion of the AGM on 5 May 2016. Scientic and Medical Expert (SME) succession Dr Daniel Podolsky has served as the Board's US-based designated SME with great distinction during his tenure on the Board. He will be stepping down from the Board as planned at the 2016 AGM after serving nine years. After commencing the search for his successor in this highly specialist role at the beginning of the year, the Committee was pleased to recommend to the Board the appointment of Dr Jesse Goodman as a Non-Executive Director and SME. He joined the Board in January 2016 and was appointed to the Corporate Responsibility Committee with effect from May 2016. Further details on the role criteria and recruitment process for the SID and SME roles and rationale behind the Committee recommending Vindi Banga and Dr Jesse Goodman's appointments is given on page 96. Committee membership Lynn Elsenhans was appointed to the Committee in January 2015 to join me and Judy Lewent as newer appointees to ensure the Committee achieved a good balance between longer serving Committee members and newer appointees to support shaping the Board for the longer term. I was also grateful to Sir Christopher for sharing his insights and deep understanding of the evolution of the Board, its culture and composition during the period of his stewardship. The Committee's key focus in 2016 will be the progression of our management succession plans working in collaboration with the CEO. In addition, we will continue to refresh the non-executive representation on the Board with the aim of reducing the overall Board size to around twelve members.

CEO and management succession The Committee and the CEO, with assistance from the Head of Human Resources, have been working on managing succession arrangements for the Executive Directors and each executive management role to secure the best leadership for the company. The specication for each role is considered in detail against the current and future needs of the changing environment in which the company operates. In compiling any succession plan, internal and external talent are considered and reviewed against the specication which has been drawn together. In terms of the Executive team, as part of ensuring more focused management of the company's Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines, and Pharmaceuticals businesses as a result the transformational Novartis transaction: Emma Walmsley who was previously President, Consumer Healthcare was appointed CEO of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture business and became a member of its Board when the Novartis transaction successfully completed on 2 March 2015; following the announcement by Deirdre Connelly, President North America Pharmaceuticals, in February 2015 of her intention to retire from GSK, her role was not replaced on the CET; and, in addition Bill Louv, Senior Vice President, Core Business Services retired as planned from GSK in 2015. His successor reports to the CFO, but is not a member of the CET.Refreshment of specialist roles on the Board During 2015, as part of an orderly refreshment of the Board, a particular area of focus for the Committee was the searches for a successor to Sir Deryck Maughan as SID and Dr Daniel Podolsky as our US-based SME, both of whom are due to retire and stand down from the Board after our 2016 AGM. The Committee felt that in determining the key essentials for the SID, it was very desirable to have a UK-based director, or failing that, someone who travelled and spent the majority of their time in the UK. It was also thought important that the individual should have a strong understanding of the UK corporate governance environment. Korn Ferry, who only provides recruitment services to the company, was engaged to conduct the search for the SID and they provided a long and then a short list of potential candidates. After interviewing suitable SID candidates, feedback was sought from and support was received from certain investors before the Committee recommended to the Board Vindi Banga as a potential independent Non-Executive Director and SID designate. He was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2015. The Board considered that he had a strong operational bias, bringing with him many years of commercial experience and a track record of delivering outstanding performance in a highly competitive global consumer-focused industry, which will be invaluable to the company. He currently serves as a non-executive director on the Boards of two other FTSE 100 companies. Vindi will succeed Sir Deryck Maughan as SID when he steps down from the Board at the close of the AGM on 5 May 2016. When the Committee was drawing up the role specication for the new SME role it considered that Dr Podolsky's successor should ideally have a strong business perspective, be US-based, understand the US healthcare environment, be a medic who was close to the patient either through running operations at scale in a hospital or an institution, have an understanding of vaccines, preferably, (or if not Respiratory) considering the standing of GSK's Vaccines portfolio since the Novartis transaction was completed. Internal soundings were taken from within Vaccines and R&D to identify potential external candidates. Egon Zehnder undertook a full external market search for suitable candidates. Egon Zehnder, who only provides recruitment services to the company, was engaged to conduct the search for the US-based SME role. Dossiers of potential Non-Executive appointees were considered by the Committee and candidates were shortlisted for interview on merit and against objective criteria, after assessing their relevant qualications and time commitments. After interviewing suitable SME candidates, the Committee recommended to the Board Dr Jesse Goodman as a potential Non-Executive Director and SME. He was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2016. Dr Jesse Goodman is a leader in public health who brings a wealth of expertise spanning science, medicine, vaccines, regulation and public health, and has a proven record in addressing pressing public health needs from both the academic and federal sectors, which will be invaluable to GSK and the Board.Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information GSK Annual Report 2015 97Board and committee changes The ongoing refreshment of the Board has resulted in orderly and planned changes in the composition of the Board and its Committees during the year on the recommendation of the Committee. These changes, including the planned retirements of Dr Stephanie Burns, Sir Deryck Maughan, Dr Daniel Podolsky and Hans Wijers from the Board at the close of the AGM in May 2016, are set out below. Board appointments and retirements The refreshment of the Board has led to the following orderly changes of Board members. Director Appointment date Retirement date Sir Philip Hampton 1 January 2015 N/A Urs Rohner 1 January 2015 N/A Vindi Banga 1 September 2015 N/A Dr Jesse Goodman 1 January 2016 N/A Sir Christopher Gent N/A 7 May 2015 Tom de Swaan N/A 7 May 2015 Jing Ulrich N/A 7 May 2015 Dr Stephanie Burns N/A 5 May 2016 Sir Deryck Maughan N/A 5 May 2016 Dr Daniel Podolsky N/A 5 May 2016 Hans Wijers N/A 5 May 2016 Board composition and diversity We are mindful of the need to balance the composition of the Board and its Committees and to refresh them progressively over time so that we can draw upon the experience of longer serving Directors, while tapping into the new external perspectives and insights which more recent appointees bring to the Board's deliberations. Non-Executive Directors are drawn from a wide range of industries and backgrounds, including pharmaceutical and healthcare, medical research and academia, and retail, insurance and nancial services, and have appropriate experience of complex organisations with global reach. Some have considerable experience of the pharmaceutical industry and the more recent appointees bring a new approach to the Group, and to Board discussions.We are committed to the diversity of our boardroom and we are similarly committed to equal opportunities for all our employees at all levels of the organisation. The diversity and inclusiveness of our workforce are promoted throughout GSK. A key requirement of an effective board is that it comprises a range and balance of skills, experience, knowledge, gender and independence, with individuals that are prepared to challenge each other and work as a team. This needs to be backed by a diversity of personal attributes, including character, intellect, sound judgement, honesty and courage. The Committee is responsible for developing measurable objectives to support the implementation of the Board's diversity policy, including gender, and monitoring progress towards the achievement of these objectives. In terms of the balance of Board gender diversity, we exceeded the target of at least 25% by 2013 that we had set ourselves in May 2011 and our current female Board level representation stands at 27%. We have noted Lord Davies' new target to increase female board representation to at least 33% by 2020 as set out in his 'Women on Boards: Five Year Summary' report published in October 2015. We also have a good representation of women in management positions which is illustrated on page 47 as part of the gender diversity of GSK's global workforce. We will continue to support efforts to further increase the pipeline of women into senior positions within GSK. We also support the engagement of executive search rms such as MWM, Egon Zehnder and Korn Ferry, who have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms on gender diversity and best practice. Committee evaluation The Committee's annual evaluation was internally facilitated by the Company Secretary on behalf of the Committee Chairman, and supplemented by a questionnaire circulated to Committee members. It was concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively. In terms of enhancements to the Committee's work it was agreed that more focus should be directed to forward planning for executive succession. Replenishment of the Board in anticipation of Directors rotating off the Board would also be a key priority.

In addition, the Committee has acted as custodian of the policies and practices that dene and safeguard the reputation of the company. As the new Chair of the Committee I will seek to build on his legacy as the Committee continues to challenge and shape the company's responsible business agenda. The Committee members bring a wide range of experience and insight from across different sectors to provide oversight of the company's responsible business opportunities and risks. This has been invaluable in relation to the Committee's assessment of the corporate responsibility challenges of integrating the Novartis assets the company acquired during a year of substantial change. I have been particularly pleased that the work of the Committee this year has focused on issues that are material to GSK's mission, strategy and values. Much of our discussions have focused on how the company seeks to balance the need for a return on investment for innovation with the need to price its products appropriately to drive access for a broad range of patients. In addition, we have considered the ways in which GSK continues to build its commitment to operating transparently and with integrity through its commercial model transformation. I am also pleased that we continue to enjoy positive engagement with investors on our Responsible Business Commitments which have included, in particular, a focus on our approach to addressing Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABAC) issues from a reputational perspective, the changes to how we sell and market our medicines to healthcare professionals, access and innovation, and clinical trials transparency disclosures.

The Committee has a rolling agenda and receives reports from members of the CET and senior managers to ensure that progress in meeting our Responsible Business Commitments within four areas of focus is reviewed on an annual basis as follows: Health for all: innovating to address currently unmet health needs; improving access to our products, irrespective of where people live or their ability to pa y; and controlling or eliminating diseases affecting the world's most vulnerable people. Our behaviour: putting the interests of patients and consumers rst, driven by our values in everything we do and backed by robust policies and strong compliance processes. Our people: enabling our people to thrive and develop as individuals to deliver our mission Our planet: growing our business while reducing our environmental impact across the value chain.

They provide that Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter instance, a Director appointed in this way retires at the rst AGM following his or her appointment. Our Articles also provide that Directors should normally be subject to re-election at the AGM at intervals of three years or annually if they have held ofce for a continuous period of nine years or more. However, the Board agreed in 2011 that all Directors who wish to continue as members of the Board should seek re-election annually in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. A Director may cease to be a Director if he or she: becomes bankrupt ceases to be a Director by virtue of the Companies Act or the Articles suffers mental or physical ill health and the Board resolves that he or she shall cease to be a Director has missed Directors' meetings for a continuous period of six months without permission and the Board resolves that he or she shall cease to be a Director is prohibited from being a Director by law resigns, or offers to resign and the Board accepts that offer is required to resign by the Board Directors' conflicts of interest All Directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, a direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict with the company. Our Articles provide a general power for the Board to authorise such conflicts. The Nominations Committee has been authorised by the Board to grant and regularly review any potential or actual conflict authorisations, which are recorded by the Company Secretary and noted by the Board. Directors are not counted in the quorum for the authorisation of their own actual or potential conflicts. On an ongoing basis, the Directors are responsible for informing the Company Secretary of any new actual or potential conflicts that may arise or if there are any changes in circumstances that may affect an authorisation previously given. Even when provided with authorisation, a Director is not absolved from his or her statutory duty to promote the success of the company. If an actual conflict arises post-authorisation, the Board may choose to exclude the Director from receipt of the relevant information and participation in the debate, or suspend the Director from the Board, or, as a last resort, require the Director to resign.The Nominations Committee reviewed the register of potential conflict authorisations in January 2016 and reported to the Board that the conflicts had been appropriately authorised and that the process for authorisation continues to operate effectively. Except as described in Note 35 to the nancial statements, 'Related party transactions', during or at the end of the nancial year no Director or connected person had any material interest in any contract of signicance with a Group company. Independent advice The Company has an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent legal and/or nancial advice at the company's expense where they deem it necessary. Indemnication of Directors Qualifying third party indemnity provisions (as dened in the Companies Act 2006) are in force for the benet of Directors and former Directors who held ofce during 2015 and up to the signing of the Annual Report. Change of control and essential contracts We do not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are fundamental to the ability of the business to operate effectively, nor is the company party to any material agreements that would take effect, be altered, or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid. We do not have agreements with any Director that would provide compensation for loss of ofce or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the company's share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover.

The Directors' Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 16 March 2016 and signed on its behalf by: Philip Hampton Chairman 16 March 2016102 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationDear Shareholder Following the 2015 AGM, I succeeded Tom de Swaan as Chair of the Remuneration Committee (the 'Committee'), and I am pleased to present to you our Remuneration Report for 2015. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Tom on behalf of the Committee for his leadership during his time as its Chairman. Remuneration decisions in respect of 2015 2015 marked further substantial progress against our strategy of creating a balanced group of three world leading businesses in Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, with a clear aim to deliver growth and improve returns to shareholders. The Group is in a strong position to succeed as a long-term business with global scale and less exposure to risk and volatility. In the past year, we have accelerated new product sales growth, integrated the new businesses in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare and restructured our Pharmaceuticals business. Our nancial results were ahead of the guidance set out towards the start of the year, and we believe we are well positioned to return to Core earnings per share growth in 2016. Against this background, the key decisions made by the Committee in respect of 2015 remuneration were as follows: The bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors were determined by reference to performance against the agreed nancial measures, as well as the Committee's assessment of their individual performance. GSK achieved performance in excess of the relevant nancial targets for the year. The improved performance for 2015, together with the assessment of individual performance and contribution, resulted in bonus awards for 2015 which were ahead of the previous year. I would draw shareholders' attention to the detailed disclosure in the following report of our annual bonus plan and of the bonuses earned. We have further enhanced the reporting of our annual bonus plan and of the bonuses to be paid, to help shareholders understand how these awards were earned. I hope that shareholders will join me in welcoming these enhanced disclosures. Vesting of the 2013 Performance Share Plan and Deferred Annual Bonus Plan awards was based on the agreed measures of relative TSR, adjusted free cash flow, R&D new products and business diversication performance, each over the three years to 31 December 2015. The overall vesting level achieved for the 2013 LTI awards was 37.75%. Further details of that achievement are also presented in the following report.Remuneration report Chairman's annual statement The Committee believes that signicant shareholdings remain a key mechanism for aligning the personal interests of our executives with the interests of long-term shareholders. Sir Andrew's shareholding is over 10 times his base salary in GSK shares, which is well in excess of his share ownership requirement of four times his base salary. As disclosed in our 2014 Remuneration Report, the setting of adjusted free cash flow and R&D new product targets for LTI awards granted in 2015 was delayed pending the completion of the Novartis transaction. Targets for these awards were agreed and details of the adjusted free cash flow target were communicated via a stock exchange announcement on 31 July 2015. Given the signicance of the transaction, the Committee also considered the impact of the changes on targets for the outstanding 2013 and 2014 LTI awards. The key principle was to ensure that the incentives continued to operate as originally intended. The Committee has focussed on ensuring that the stretch of performance targets was retained and that incentives continued to measure performance against the strategic objectives originally identied at grant. Details of the decisions reached are set out in the following report. Agenda for 2016 No material changes to executive remuneration are proposed for 2016. The Committee decided that salary levels for Executive Directors would be increased by 2.5% effective 1 January 2016. This is consistent with the salary increase budget for our broader employee populations in the UK and US. Given that our Remuneration Policy will expire at our 2017 AGM, this year the Committee will be undertaking a review of GSK's remuneration arrangements. As part of this review we will continue our regular dialogue with shareholders and will hold our annual meetings with GSK's largest investors later in the year to listen to their views and feedback. Meanwhile, if any shareholders have any feedback on our current remuneration arrangements, or views on where we should focus the review, please do not hesitate to pass those comments for my attention to our Company Secretary, Victoria Whyte. AGM Finally, I would like to thank shareholders for their input and engagement during my rst year as Chairman of the Committee and I welcome all shareholders' feedback on this report. We look forward to receiving your support for our 2015 Remuneration Report at our AGM on 5 May 2016.

PSP awards are subject to a three-year performance period and an additional two-year vesting period.109 to 110 Performance Share Plan (PSP) The performance share awards for the Executive Directors are as follows: % of salary CEO 600 CFO 400 Chairman, Global Vaccines 500109 to 110Executive Directors' remuneration summary Remuneration principles and policy Principles The Committee believes in pay for performance and that Executive Directors' remuneration should be designed to promote the long-term success of the company. The Committee seeks to ensure that performance-related elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. Policy The Committee considers the company's shareholder approved remuneration policy, our Executive Directors' pay comparator groups and pay levels for the wider employee population of the Group when determining the total individual pay packages of the Executive Directors. The balance between the xed, short-term variable and long-term variable elements of pay is carefully reviewed, with overall packages weighted heavily towards the latter to closely align Executive Directors' interests with those of shareholders. The table below summarises how the Committee sets each element of the remuneration packages for our Executive Directors.104 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationSir Andrew Witty, CEOSimon Dingemans, CFODr 718 1,212 1,212 Benets 110 144 8% 1,316(3)18% 365 8% C.

(2) The Committee may in specic circumstances, and in line with stated principles, apply clawback/malus, as it determines appropri ate. Following due consideration by the Committee, there has been no recovery of sums paid (clawback) or reduction of outstanding awards or vesting levels (malus) applied during 2015 in respect of any of the Executive Directors. (3) The difference in the 2015 and 2014 pension values for Dr Slaoui is due to movements in the interest rate assumption (IRA) used in the projection to age 65. The IRA had decreased from 2013 to 2014 but then increased slightly from 2014 to 2015.Annual report on remuneration continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 105Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationThe following sections provide details of each element of 'Total remuneration', including how the Committee implemented the approved remuneration policy in 2015 and how it will be applied in 2016.

The section of the plan that Sir Andrew is a member of provides for a normal retirement age of 60 and a maximum pension value o f 2/3rds of pensionable salary. Since 1 April 2013, pensionable earnings increases have been limited to 2% per annum for all memb ers, including Sir Andrew. Simon DingemansSimon Dingemans is not a member of any GSK pension plan for pension contributions and instead receives a cash payment in lieu of pension of 20% of base salary in line with GSK's dened contribution pension plan rates. Simon Dingemans receives death in service and ill-health insurance that is provided as part of the pension plan. This has been included in his employee benets on page 105. Dr Moncef SlaouiDr Slaoui is a member of the Cash Balance Pension Plan and the Supplemental Cash Balance Pension Plan which provides for an Executive Pension Credit. GSK makes annual contributions to Dr Slaoui's pension plans of 38% of his base salary. The plans provide a cash sum at retirement and the fund increases at an interest rate set annually in advance, based on the 30 year US Tr easury bond rate. The plan has no entitlement to a spouse's pension or to pension increases. He was an active member of the Belgium AG Insurance (ex-Fortis) Plan (Belgian Plan) until 31 May 2006 and has been a deferred member since. This plan is a dened benet plan with a lump sum payable at a normal retirement age of 60. There are no further company contributions to this plan. Dr Slaoui is also a member of the 401(k) plan open to all US employees and the ESSP, a savings scheme open to executives to acc rue benets above US government limits imposed on the 401(k) Plan. Contributions to both plans are invested in a range of funds. Th e combined contribution rate under the plans is up to 6% (2% core contributions plus a match of up to 4%) of total base salary an d bonus, less any bonus deferred under the DABP.

During this time, he has built u p pensionable service in the Belgian Plan, the Cash Balance and Supplemental Pension Plans. Annual employer cash contributions were made to t he 401(k) Plan and ESSP. His current pension entitlement is a product of his service and progression within GSK. The difference in the 2015 and 2014 pen sion values is due to movements in the interest rate assumption (IRA) used in the projection to age 65. The IRA had decreased from 2 013 to 2014 but then increased slightly from 2014 to 2015.Annual report on remuneration continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 107Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPay for performance (audited) Annual bonus For 2015, the annual bonus was based on the following nancial measures and weightings.The majority of the annual bonus opportunity is based on a formal review of performance against stretching nancial targets. This outcome is then adjusted to reflect individual performance by applying an individual performance multiplier (IPM). The IPM is set by the Committee taking into account performance against individual objectives. The multiplier may be set betwee n 0% and 150%. Generally, in a year when an Executive Director has performed strongly against all of his objectives, it would be expected that they would receive an IPM towards the top of that range. 2015 performance against targets Core Group operating prot Core Group PBIT Vaccines performance Weighting Sir Andrew Witty 75% 25% - Simon Dingemans 75% 25% - Dr Moncef Slaoui -2 5 % 7 5 % 2015 performance Target \u00a36,092 million \u00a35,885 million \u00a3850 million Outcome \u00a36,405 million \u00a36,224 million \u00a3896 million The table below sets out the matters which the Committee considered in respect of the nancial measures and weightings set for the Executive Directors. Financial performance Core Group operating prot and core Group prot before interest and tax Group turnover increased 6% CER on a reported basis to \u00a323,923 million and 1% CER on a pro-forma basis. Core Group operating prot and core Group prot before interest and tax were ahead of targets set for 2015. Prots beneted from the acceleration in sales of new products together with cost savings released by the Group's restructuring and integration programmes. Offsetting these benets were declines in sales of Seretide/Advair , lower sales of Established Products and the investments made to support the new product launches. The short-term dilution of the Novartis transaction together with an adverse comparison to 2014, which included an SG&A credit, also impacted core operating prot in 2015. Excluding both of these, the core operating margin declined 0.2 percentage points. Vaccines performanceVaccines sales were \u00a33,675 million, up 19% CER and up 3% on a pro-forma basis in 2015. The pro-forma growth was primarily driven by Bexsero sales in Europe and strong Rotarix , Fluarix/FluLaval and Boostrix sales in the US. Vaccines operating prot was \u00a3966 million, down 9% CER primarily reflecting inclusion of the cost base acquired from the former Novartis vaccines business. On a pro-forma basis, Vaccines operating prot was up 7%. Substantial progress was made on the integration of the acquired business in 2015. Initial restructuring and integration benets helped to deliver an improvement of 0.8 percentage points in the pro-forma core operating margin of 26.4% on a CER basis in 2015. The core Group operating prot and core Group PBIT targets and outcomes for the purpose of annual bonuses differ from core Grou p operating prot and PBIT disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report primarily because both the target and outcome numbers are calculated applying GSK budget exchange rates and not actual exchange rates. The core Group operating prot measure excludes corporate costs, but these costs are included in core Group PBIT.

Simon Dingemans Mr Dingemans delivered strong nancial leadership for the Group in 2015: Restructuring and integration ahead of schedule with \u00a31 billion of incremental cost savings delivered for costs of \u00a31.9 billion. On track to deliver \u00a33 billion of annual savings by the end of 2017. Reduced net debt by \u00a33.7 billion despite signicant cash restructuring costs. 2015 core EPS of 75.7p, ahead of nancial guidance of high teens decline.

Expectation to pay 80p full year ordinary dividend for 2016 and 2017. Dr Moncef Slaoui Under Dr Slaoui's leadership, the Vaccines business delivered strong performance against plan for 2015. Vaccines sales grew 19% to \u00a33.7 billion with the business benetting from sales of newly acquired products, primarily the meningitis portfolio ( Menveo/Bexsero ) in Europe and the US as well as strong sales growth from legacy GSK vaccines such as Fluarix/FluLaval , Rotarix and Boostrix in the US. Dr Slaoui also delivered a number of strategic priorities: Following the completion of the Novartis transaction in March 2015, Dr Slaoui led the effective integration of the GSK and Novartis vaccines organisations. Accelerated commercialisation of the acquired portfolio, particularly the meningitis portfolio. Signicant contribution to global public health agen da with extensive research and development progress on candidate vaccines for malaria and Ebola. Led successful vaccines R&D organisation; successes through the year included positive Phase III trial success for a candidate vaccine for Shingles.Pay for performance continuedAnnual report on remuneration continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 109Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationValue earned from long-term incentives (LTIs) 2013 awards with a performance period ended 31 December 2015 (audited) The Committee reviewed the performance of the PSP and DABP matching awards granted to Executive Directors against targets set i n 2013. The performance achieved in the three years to 31 December 2015 and the vesting levels are set out in the table below. The Committee previously provided estimates of vesting for 2013 awards in GSK's 2013 and 2014 Annual Reports. Those estimates were based on performance achieved at that time and the following reflects performance achieved over the course of the whole performance period. In line with the Committee's agreed principles for each measure, actual performance against targets was rev iewed and adjustments made as appropriate to reflect the impact of the Novartis transaction on the business and to ensure that the ves ting outcome reflected genuine underlying business performance. Performance measures and relative weightingVesting Performance targets and performance achieved% of maximum% of award R&D new product performance (25%)The R&D new product performance measure was based on an aggregate three-year revenue target for New Product sales. New Products are dened as products launched in the performance period and the two preceding years. Therefore products launched in the years 2011 to 2015 were included. Aggregate sales for the period were \u00a36.19 billion. The vesting schedule is shown below with straight-line vesting between these points. This vesting schedule has been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Novartis transactions, i.e. revenues from divested Oncology products were removed from the target and outcome for 2015 in determining performance. One acquired Vaccines product, Bexsero , was judged to meet the condition of a 'new product' and has therefore been included in the target and outturn. Target % vesting Maximum (25%)The target originally set for this element at the time of grant was based on aggregate revenues from Vaccines, Consumer Healthcare and Emerging Markets, and Japan with the purpose of incentivising and rewarding the growth of a globally diversied business. The Remuneration Committee determined that the original target was not sustainable in light of the transformational three-part transaction with Novartis. The Committee therefore reviewed both the original target and performance in light of the additional sales from the acquired Vaccines business and the Consumer Healthcare joint venture, and overall progress made towards the strategic goal of diversication. The Committee noted several strong performances from business initiatives over the period including in relation to Fluarix/Flulaval following the launch of the Quadrivalent formulation, strong Emerging Market sales from products such as Synflorix and Rotarix , progress in Japan in transitioning the respiratory portfolio to the new Ellipta portfolio, and the successful OTC switch of Flonase in Consumer Healthcare. All of these factors have supported the Group's ambition of creating a long-term business with global scale and reduced exposure to risk and volatility, consistent with the strategic targets identied at the start of the performance period. It was subsequently determined that in light of the progress made during the performance period, vesting for this element should be between threshold and maximum and that 69% of this element of the award should vest.69% 17 .25% Adjusted free cash flow performance (25%)The Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) vesting schedule which was disclosed at the time of grant had a vesting threshold of \u00a314.06 billion, and maximum vesting for achieving \u00a316.66 billion. During 2015, the Committee reviewed the target and vesting schedule in light of the completion of the Novartis transaction and determined that it should be adjusted to reflect the impact of the transactions and other restructuring.

Based on aggregate sales of new products for the two years, and based on performance measure denitions, vesting is currently estimated to be around maximum. Adjusted free cash flow performance (1/3rd)The Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) vesting schedule which was disclosed at the time of grant had a vesting threshold of \u00a313.68 billion, and maximum vesting for achieving \u00a316.22 billion. During 2015, the Committee reviewed the target and vesting schedule in light of the completion of the Novartis transaction and determined that it should be adjusted to reflect the impact of the transactions and other restructuring. The adjusted vesting schedule is: 25% (threshold) of the award vests for achieving AFCF of \u00a310.92 billion, 50% for achieving \u00a311.26 billion, 75% for achieving \u00a312.38 billion and 100% (maximum) for achieving \u00a312.95 billion, with straight-line vesting between these points. Based on AFCF for the two years ending 31 December 2015, and on performance measure denitions, vesting is currently estimated to be below threshold. Relative TSR performance (1/3rd)For the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, GSK's TSR rank position was 10th in the comparator group of ten pharmaceutical companies (GSK and nine other companies).

Adjusted free cash flow performance (1/3rd)The Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) vesting schedule for the 2015 awards was determined following the completion of the Novartis transaction and disclosed via an announcement to the Stock Exchange in July 2015. In order to fully assess disciplined use of restructuring funds over the period 2015-2017 , the Committee added back planned restructuring costs for the period of \u00a33.3 billion which are being separately funded from retained divestment proceeds. In order to incentivise management to deliver the restructuring at or below those planned costs, any overspend or underspend versus the \u00a33.3 billion will then translate into an adjustment in determining adjusted free cash flow performance relative to target. The vesting schedule for this award is: 25% (threshold) of the award vests for achieving AFCF of \u00a311.5 billion, 50% for achieving \u00a311.9 billion, 75% for achieving \u00a313.0 billion and 100% (maximum) for achieving \u00a313.6 billion, with straight-line vesting between these points. Based on AFCF for the year, and on performance measure denitions, vesting is currently estimated to be between threshold and maximum. Relative TSR performance (1/3rd)For the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015, GSK's TSR rank position was 10th in the comparator group of ten pharmaceutical companies (GSK and nine other companies). The vesting schedule and comparator group are as set out for the 2016 awards on page 112. If the ranking position remains at this level, vesting would be below threshold. Current estimate of potential total vesting for 2015 awards Between 50% and 75% vestingUpdate on performance of ongoing LTI awards The Committee also reviewed the performance of the PSP and DABP matching awards granted to Executive Directors in 2014 and 2015. The following tables provide an estimate of vesting taking into account performance to date. Actual vesting levels will o nly be determined based on performance over the full three-year performance periods. The indications below should therefore not be regarded as predictions of the nal vesting levels. In line with the Committee's agreed principles for each measure, these estimates of vesting include adjustments that will be re quired to reflect the impact of the Novartis transaction on the business and to ensure that the outcome reflects genuine underlying busi ness performance. Further details on any adjustments made will be provided at the time of vesting.Annual report on remuneration continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 111Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationExecutive director remuneration in 2016 (audited) Performance targets for 2016 awards The 2016 performance targets and vesting schedules are set out in the table on page 112.

This revenue target is based on new product sales to incentivise better R&D performance and commercialisation. New products are dened as products launched in the performance period and the two preceding years. Therefore, for the 2016-2018 performance period, products launched in the years 2014-2018 will be included in the target. Performance (% of threshold) % vesting Maximum 122% 100% Threshold 100% 25% Adjusted free cash flow performance(1/3rd)The use of cash flow as a performance measure is intended to recognise the importance of effective working capital management and of generating cash to fund the Group's operations, investments, and ordinary dividends to shareholders. The free cash flow target represents the operating prot of the business adjusted for non-cash items after deducting the cost or benet of working capital, capital expenditure and taxation, and after adding back planned restructuring costs for the period of \u00a32.3 billion which are being separately funded from retained divestment proceeds. In order to incentivise management to deliver the restructuring at or below those planned costs, any overspend or underspend versus the \u00a32.3 billion will then translate into an adjustment in determining adjusted free cash flow performance relative to target. The adjustments to free cash flow, used to set the target for the purpose of the performance measure, include legal settlements, special pension contributions, foreign exchange, divestments and acquisitions. The measure post-adjustment is the \"adjusted free cash flow\".Adjusted free cash flow % vesting Maximum \u00a313.8 billion 100% \u00a313.2 billion 75%\u00a312.0 billion 50% \u00a311.6 billion 0% Relative TSR performance(1/3rd) Focuses on the delivery of value to shareholders.

Historical vesting for GSK's LTIs The following table shows historical vesting levels under the company's long-term incentive plans (Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching awards, Performance Share Plan and Share Option Plan) in respect of awards made to executives since 2007.* This index comprises AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co, Novartis, Pzer, IndexGSK Pharma Peers Total Return Index*Performance graph and table The following graph sets out the performance of the company relative to the FTSE 100 index, and to the pharmaceutical performance comparator group for the seven-year period to 31 December 2015. The graph has been prepared in accordance with the Remuneration Regulations and is not an indication of the likely vesting of awards granted under any of the company's incentive plans. These indices were selected for comparison purposes as they reflect both the index of which GSK is a constituent and the industry in which it operates.CEO Remuneration table 37.75% 13.5% 31% 24% 70%(2)35%(2)35% (1) 2009 and 2010 bonus amounts include amounts paid under the Operational Efciency Bonus in place for those years. The overall maximum bonus receivable was still subject to a limit of 200% of base salary. (2) In respect of the 2007 and 2008 PSP awards. Sir Andrew also had outstanding awards over 195,500 and 525,000 share options, granted in 2007 and 2008 respectively, which lapsed in full. These have not been included in the total vesting percentage due to the distorting effect of aggregating conditional shares and share options. Malus and clawback policy The company's policy on malus and clawback is set out in the company's Remuneration policy report which is available at www.gsk.com in the Investors section. The Committee has jurisdiction on malus and clawback in respect of the executives. In the event of a 'triggering' event (e.g. signicant misconduct by way of violation of regulation, law or signicant GSK policy, such as the Code of Conduct), the company will have the ability to claw back up to three years' annual and deferred bonuses as well as vested and unvested LTIs. The Recoupment Committee exercises this authority for the wider employee base. It is comprised of senior executives with relevant oversight and appropriate experience, including the Senior Vice President, Global Ethics and Compliance, and the Senior Vice President & General Counsel. From 1 January 2015, in respect of each nancial year, the Committee discloses whether it (or the Recoupment Committee) has exercised clawback or malus. Disclosure will only be made when the matter has been the subject of public reports of misconduct, where it has been fully resolved, where it is legally permissible to disclose and where it can be made without unduly prejudicing the company and therefore shareholders. In line with these disclosure guidelines, neither the Committee (nor the Recoupment Committee) has exercised malus or clawback during 2015. The Committee has determined that the release of some shares under the LTI plans may be delayed in the case of leavers, to reinforce the implementation of the malus and clawback policy. Also, in the case of deferred bonus awards under the DABP granted to executives who then retire or are made redundant, the vesting of those awards will normally be delayed so that they vest on their original timescales rather than vesting earlier at the end of the year in which the termination date falls.Other remuneration and performance disclosures114 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOther all-employee share plans The Executive Directors participate in various all-employee share plans, including ShareSave and ShareReward. The ShareSave Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs approved plan open to all UK employees. Participants may save up to \u00a3250 a month from their net salaries for a xed term of three years and at the end of the savings period they have the option to buy GSK shares at a discount of up to 20% of the market price set at the launch of each savings contract. Sir Andrew Witty and Simon Dingemans each contribute the maximum of \u00a3250 a month into the ShareSave Plan. The ShareReward Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs approved plan open to all UK employees on the same terms. Participants contribute up to \u00a3125 a month from their gross salaries to purchase GSK shares and the company matches the number of GSK shares bought each month under this arrangement. Sir Andrew Witty and Simon Dingemans each contribute the maximum of \u00a3125 a month to buy shares under the ShareReward Plan. Dilution limits All awards are made under plans which incorporate dilution limits consistent with the guidelines published by the Investment Association, which was formed following the merger of the IMA and the ABI. These limits are 10% in any rolling ten year period for all plans and 5% in any rolling ten year period for executive share plans. Estimated dilution from existing awards made over the last ten years up to 31 December 2015 is as follows: Relative importance of spend on pay The table shows the percentage changes in the Group's dividends paid to shareholders, share buy-back and total employee pay. 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m % change Total employee pay 8,030 7 ,520 7 Dividends 3,874 3,843 1 Share buyback - 238 (100) The gures in the table above are as set out on pages 141 and 155. Dividends declared in respect of 2015 were \u00a33,871 million (2014 - \u00a33,865 million), i.e. an increase of 1%. Given the impact of the sustained strength of Sterling on free cash flow, the company suspended its share repurchase programme during 2014. Following the completion of the Novartis transaction, GSK will return approximately \u00a31 billion of the net proceeds by way of a special dividend payable at the same time as the 2015 Q4 dividend. The special dividend is not included in the above amounts. The company does not expect to make any ordinary share repurchases in 2016. Total employee pay is based on 101,192 employees, the average number of people employed during 2015 (2014 - 98,702).Percentage change in remuneration of CEO Sir Andrew Witty UK Employees 2015 \u00a3000 % change % change Salary 1,087 This reflects salary earned in, benets received in and annual bonus earned in respect of 2015 compared with 2014. For the wider UK employee population, the salary increase includes the annual salary review as well as any additional changes in the year, e.g. on promotion. The increase in benets for the CEO is not as a result of a change to his benet arrangements. UK employee benets are unchanged on the previous year as there have been no changes to our benet policies or levels. It does not reflect any changes to the level of benets an individual may have received as a result of a change in role, e.g. promotion. The UK population was considered to be the most relevant comparison as it most closely reflects the economic environment encountered by the CEO. External appointments for Executive Directors The Board encourages Executive Directors to hold one external directorship each once they have become established in their roles, to broaden their experience and development, and help increase the pool of Non-Executive Director candidates. Any outside appointments are considered by the Nominations Committee to ensure they would not cause a conflict of interest and are then approved by the Chairman on behalf of the Board. It is the company's policy that remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by the individual Executive Director. During 2015, Dr Moncef Slaoui did not receive any fees in relation to his membership of the Qatar Biomedical Research Institute Scientic Advisory Committee, as no meetings took place in the period. He earned a $400 honorarium for attending a board meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Director of National Institute of Health. There are no other external appointments for which he receives any remuneration. During 2015, Sir Andrew Witty and Simon Dingemans did not hold any external appointments for which they were remunerated.

He was appointed Committee Chairman with effect from 8 May 2015, following the retirement of Tom de Swaan as Committee Chairman and Non-Executive Director on 7 May 2015. Role of the Committee The role of the Committee is to set the company's remuneration policy so that GSK is able to recruit, retain and motivate its executives. The remuneration policy is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is consistent with the company's scale and scope of operations, supports the business strategy and growth plans and helps drive the creation of shareholder value. Terms of reference The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the company's website. The terms of reference, which are reviewed at least annually, were last revised in January 2016 to reflect best practice and corporate governance developments. Governance The Board considers all of the members of the Committee to be independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee met six times in scheduled meetings during 2015, with each member attending as follows: MembersCommittee member sinceAttendance at full meetings during 2015 Urs Rohner (Chairman from 7 May 2015)1 January 2015 6/6 Vindi Banga 1 January 2016 0/0 Dr Stephanie Burns 1 May 2013 6/6 Judy Lewent 1 January 2013 6/6 Sir Deryck Maughan 1 July 2012 5/6 Hans Wijers 10 October 2013 5/6 Sir Christopher Gent* 1 January 2007 3/3 Tom de Swaan* (Chairman to 7 May 2015)20 May 2009 3/3 *Sir Christopher Gent and Tom de Swaan retired from the Board on 7 May 2015. In addition to the six scheduled meetings, the Committee met on a quorate basis on three occasions to approve the formal grant of long-term incentive awards to employees below the CET, and address other LTI administrative matters. Committee meetings usually include a closed session, during which only members of the Committee are present. Other individuals may also be invited to attend Committee meetings during the year. Executives and other Committee attendees are not involved in any decisions, and are not present at any discussions regarding their own remuneration. The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee and attends all meetings. Other attendees at Committee include: AttendeeRegular attendeeAttends as required CEO \u0016 CFO \u0016 Head of Human Resources \u0016 Head of Reward \u0016 Committee Adviser - Deloitte LLP \u0016Adviser to the Committee The Committee has access to external advice as required. The Committee carried out a formal review of the independent advisers to the Committee in 2013. As a result of this review, the Committee reappointed Deloitte LLP to provide it with independent advice on executive remuneration. The Committee Chairman agrees the protocols under which Deloitte provides advice and the Committee is satised that the advice they have received from Deloitte has been objective and independent. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants' Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The code of conduct can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. Deloitte provided independent commentary on matters under consideration by the Committee and updates on market practice and legislative requirements. Deloitte's fees for advice provided to the Committee in 2015 were \u00a3138,130. Fees were charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte LLP also provided other consulting, tax and assurance services to GSK during the year. However, the Committee is satised that this does not compromise the independence of the advice they have received from Deloitte. Willis Towers Watson provided additional market data to the Committee.

The annual meetings were held in November 2015, at which Urs Rohner, Committee Chairman, shared updates on remuneration matters in the last 12 months and proposals for 2016 onwards. In particular this covered proposed enhanced annual bonus disclosures for inclusion in the 2015 Annual Report. In addition, investors' initial views were sought on the future development of the approved Remuneration Policy in advance of the anticipated submission by the company of a binding shareholder resolution to approve a new Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM. Committee evaluation The Committee's annual evaluation was internally facilitated by the Company Secretary, and supplemented by a questionnaire circulated to Committee members on behalf of the Committee Chairman. It was concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively. In terms of enhancements to the Committee's deliberations it was agreed that the Committee would focus its attention during 2016 on reviewing the company's Remuneration Policy.Annual report on remuneration continued Remuneration governanceGSK Annual Report 2015 117Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPrincipal activities and matters addressed during 2015 Remuneration Governance and other matters Month Overall Items specic to: Annual bonus and LTIs January Approve CET salary increase recommendations Review and approve R&D Annual bonus target metric Review and approve executives' 2014 bonuses Set CEO 2015 bonus objectives Update on Deferred Annual Bonus Plan Rules Update on LTI performance for 2012 LTI awards (2012-2014) Review draft 2014 Remuneration report Review shareholder feedback from annual investor meetings Review Committee external evaluation report February Receive update on remuneration related implications of the Novartis transaction Review LTI performance outcomes and approve vesting of 2012 LTI awards (2012-2014) for CET and below CET Review and approve 2015-2017 LTI grants for CET and below Grant interim Share Value Plan awards (below CET) Review 2014 Remuneration report March Remuneration environment update Update on Performance Share Plan for employees below CET Grant awards to certain eligible former Novartis employees Update on remuneration considerations for 2015 July Review of CEO and CFO pay competitiveness Review of remuneration benchmark comparator groups Approve adjusted free cash flow target for 2015 awards following completion of the Novartis transaction Review AGM and remuneration report feedback, the external remuneration environment and performance target disclosures for incentive plans Approve Committee evaluation process Review Chairman fees Environmental update August Grant interim and main Share Value Plan awards (below CET) October Consider remuneration report disclosures for 2015 Update on CEO, CFO and CET remuneration competitiveness Draft plan for review of remuneration policy for 2017 AGM Update on LTI vesting for 2013 awards (2013-2015) Review adjustment principles for LTI measures in respect of the Novartis transaction Update on remuneration report disclosures Preparation for annual investor meetings November Annual meeting with investors December Annual CET benchmarking and competitiveness review Approve Executive Director salary increases for 2016 Grant awards to certain eligible former Novartis employees Review Investment Association Principles of Remuneration Update on remuneration report disclosures Review shareholder feedback from annual investor meetingsRemuneration governance continued118 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationChairman and other Non-Executive Directors The company aims to provide the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors with fees that are competitive with those paid by other companies of equivalent size and complexity, subject to the limits contained in GSK's Articles of Association. Chairman's fees Chairman Sir Philip Hampton was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 1 January 2015, and received the standard annual fee for a Non-Executive Director of \u00a385,000, until 1 April 2015, he then received fees of \u00a3350,000 per annum as Deputy Chairman. Since his appointment as Chairman at the conclusion of the AGM on 7 May 2015, his fees increased to \u00a3700,000 per annum. He has elected to take 25% of his fees as GSK shares.

GSK Annual Report 2015 121Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationDirectors' interests in shares continued i) The following table sets out details of options (including nil-cost options under the DABP) exercised during 2015 by Executive Directors. Dr Moncef Slaoui did not exercise any options during the year. Type of award Date of grantNumber of shares under option Date of exercise Grant priceMarket price at exerciseGain on exercise (000) Sir \u00a3573 In respect of options under the SOP and the ShareSave plans, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date that the options rst vest. The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date. If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise. This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration. No options vested for Executive Directors during 2015. In respect of nil-cost options under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Director is recorded as remuneration (under a nnual bonus) for the year to which it relates. The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost option comprises this remuneration, the total o f the amounts received in re-invested dividends prior to vesting and the gains or losses resulting from movements in the share price between the dates of grant and exercise for the initial bonus amount deferred and the dates of dividend reinvestment and exercise for the re-inve sted dividends. For the matching element of the DABP, the remuneration of the Executive Director is recorded in the year that the performance c riteria end and represents the number of vested shares multiplied by the price at vesting. The gain recorded on exercise of the nil-cost op tion comprises the total of this remuneration and the gain or loss resulting from the movement in the share price between vesting and exercise . For Sir Andrew Witty: The total gain of \u00a31,490 following the exercise of 776 options granted under the ShareSave Plan. The gain of \u00a3819,158 recorded following the exercise of the 57 ,932 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2011 comprises remuneration of \u00a3700,000 recorded in 2011 as annual bonus and a net gain of \u00a3119,158 relating to the re-inves tment of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise date. The gain of \u00a3110,589 recorded following the exercise of the 7 ,821 nil-cost options relating to the DABP matching award comprise s remuneration of \u00a3122,008 recorded in 2014 in relation to the DABP (see page 122) and an investment loss of \u00a311,419 relating to the movement in the share price between the vesting and exercise dates. For Simon Dingemans: The total gain of \u00a3595 following the exercise of 310 options granted under the ShareSave Plan. The gain of \u00a3503,718 recorded following the exercise of the 34,220 nil-cost options relating to the deferral of bonus earned in respect of 2011 comprises remuneration of \u00a3413,520 recorded in 2011 as annual bonus and a net gain of \u00a390,198 relating to the re-investmen t of dividends prior to vesting and movements in the share price between grant and dividend re-investment dates and the exercise dat e. The gain of \u00a368,006 recorded following the exercise of the 4,620 nil-cost options relating to the DABP matching award comprises remuneration of \u00a372,072 recorded in 2014 in relation to the DABP (see page 123) and an investment loss of \u00a34,066 relating to th e movement in the share price between the vesting and exercise dates. j) For Non-Executive Directors, total interests include shares or ADS received as part or all of their fees under the Non-Executiv e Director Share Allocation Plan. Note that dividends received on shares or ADS under the plan during 2015 were converted into shares or A DS as at 31 December 2015. k) Sir Christopher Gent, Tom de Swaan and Jing Ulrich all retired from the Board on 7 May 2015. They elected to receive their shar es from the Non-Executive Directors' Share Allocation Plan immediately upon retiring from the Board. Dividend entitlements in respect o f the Q3 and Q4 2014 and the Q1 2015 dividends were paid in cash in accordance with the plan rules.122 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationAnnual report on remuneration continued Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching awards Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DABP) matching awards are made annually to Executive Directors, based on the individual's mandatory deferral and voluntary bonus deferral election. The company will match shares or ADS up to one-for-one depending on the company 's performance during a three-year performance period. Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 109, 110 a nd 112 of this report. Awards to UK-based Executive Directors are made in the form of nil-cost options. Once an award vests, the UK-based Executive Director may choose to exercise the award at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant. Awards to US-based Executive Directors are made as conditional awards of ADS. The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of the matching shares or ADS is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant award vests. If the award vests after the date of the Remun eration report, the calculation is performed using the average share or ADS price over the last quarter of the nancial year. If an Exe cutive Director chooses not to exercise the nil-cost options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise. This increase or decrea se in value is the result of an investment decision and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration. Dividends are reinvested on the nil-cost options or conditional awards of shares or ADS made to Executive Directors up to the d ate of vesting. The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of DABP matching awards. Market price at grant and at vesting represent the closing share prices on those dates.

Under the terms of the PSP, the number of shares or ADS vesting is determined following the end of the relevant performance period and is dependent on GSK's performance during that period. Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 109, 110 and 112. Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares or ADS awarded to executives throughout the performance period and up to the date of vesting. At vesting, UK participants receive the relevant number of shares and US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards. The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of performance shares is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant PSP award vests. The PSP awards made to Sir Andrew Witty in 2012, 2013 and 2014 have three-year performance periods. However, the deeds of award specied that 25% of the awards would be subject to a further two-year vesting period (ve years in total). During thi s two-year period, there are no additional performance criteria and the awards will only lapse if Sir Andrew is dismissed for cau se. The remuneration in respect of these awards will therefore be considered to be realised in full following the determination by the Remuneration Committee of the vesting levels of the initial 75% of the awards (i.e. full remuneration will be recognised at the end of the three-year performance period). From 2015, the whole of the award made to each Executive Director has a three-year performance period, and an additional two-year vesting period. Each award will therefore only vest after ve years. During the nal two years of the vesting period, the award for each Director will only lapse if he is dismissed for cause. The remuneration in respect of the awards and dividend equivalent up to that point will therefore be recognised at the end of the three-year performance pe riod (i.e. in the 2017 Remuneration report). The following tables provide details for each Executive Director in respect of PSP awards. Market price at grant and at vesting represent the closing share prices on those dates.

Where an individual is a member of a GSK legacy dened benet plan, a dened contribution plan or an alternative pension plan arrangement and is subsequently appointed to the Board, he or she may remain a member of that plan. Annual bonus To incentivise and recognise execution of the business strategy on an annual basis. Rewards the achievement of stretching annual nancial and strategic business targets and delivery of personal objectives.Financial, operational and business targets are set at the start of the year by the Committee and bonus levels are determined by the Committee based on performance against those targets. Individual objectives are set at the start of the year by the Committee and performance against objectives is assessed by the Committee. Executive Directors are required to defer 25% of any bonus earned into shares, or ADS as appropriate, for three years. They may defer up to an additional 25% of bonus earned, up to an overall maximum deferral of 50%. Deferred shares vest at the end of the three year performance period. Long-term incentive awardsTo incentivise and recognise delivery of the longer term business priorities, nancial growth and increases in shareholder value compared to other pharmaceutical companies. In addition, to provide alignment with shareholder interests, a retention element, to encourage long-term shareholding and discourage excessive risk taking.Deferred Annual Bonus Plan Deferred shares may be matched subject to the achievement of performance conditions over three years. Matching awards may be conditional shares or nil-cost options and are eligible for dividend equivalents in respect of the performance period. Performance Share Plan Conditional awards are made annually with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over three years. Vested awards are subject to an additional two-year vesting period. Awards are eligible for dividend equivalents up to the date of vesting.Annual bonusValue earned from long-term incentive awards C.

The following is a summary of this poli cy.128 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationNon-Executive Director remuneration policy Element Purpose and link to strategy Overview Chairman's fee To provide an inclusive flat rate fee that is competitive with those paid by other companies of equivalent size and complexity subject to the limits contained in GSK's Articles of Association.There is no formal maximum, however, fees are reviewed annually and set by reference to a review of the Chairman's performance and independently sourced market data. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to the Board on the fees payable to the Chairman. The Chairman does not participate in discussions in respect of his fees. Fees can be paid in a combination of cash and/or GSK shares or ADS. Basic fee There is no formal maximum, however, fees are reviewed annually and set by reference to independently sourced market data. The Chairman and CEO are responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to the Board on the fees payable to the company's Non-Executive Directors. A minimum of 25% is delivered in the form of GSK shares or ADS. Supplemental feesTo provide additional compensation for Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) taking on additional Board responsibilities or undertaking intercontinental travel to meetings.Additional fees for Committee Chairmen, intercontinental travel, the Senior Independent Director and Medical/Scientic Experts. Current fee levels are set out on page 118 of the 2015 Annual Report. Benets To facilitate execution of responsibilities and duties required by the role.Travel and subsistence costs for Non-Executive Directors are incurred in the normal course of business in relation to meetings on Board and Committee matters and other GSK-hosted events. This includes Non-Executive Directors undertaking intercontinental travel to meetings. Non-Executive Directors may from time to time be accompanied by their spouse or partner to these meetings or events. The costs associated with the above are all met by the company and in some instances, they are deemed to be taxable and therefore treated as benets for the Non-Executive Director. Non-Executive Directors' share allocation planTo enhance the link between directors and shareholders, GSK requires Non-Executive Directors to receive a signicant part of their fees in the form of GSK shares or ADS.At least 25% of the Non-Executive Directors' total fees, excluding those of the Chairman, are paid in the form of GSK shares or ADS and allocated to a share or ADS account. The Non-Executive Directors may also take the opportunity to invest part or all of the balance of their fees into the same share or ADS account. The GSK shares or ADS which are notionally awarded to the Non-Executive Directors and allocated to their interest accounts are set out in the Directors' interests table on page 119 of the 2015 Annual Report. The accumulated balances of these GSK shares or ADS, together with the notional dividends accrued, are not paid out to Non-Executive Directors until they leave the Board. Upon leaving, the Non-Executive Directors will receive either the GSK shares or ADS, or a cash amount equivalent to the value of the GSK shares or ADS at the date of leaving, or date of payment if later. Letter of appointmentNon-Executive Directors' and the Chairman's terms of engagement are set out in letters of appointment as set out in the table on page 118 of the 2015 Annual Report.Non-Executive Directors will be subject to annual election or re-election and will normally serve no longer than nine years from the date of rst election by shareholders at a general meeting. The Chairman will be subject to annual appointment by shareholders and may serve longer than nine years from the date of rst election by shareholders at a general meeting.2014 Remuneration policy summary continuedStrategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationIn this section Directors' statement of responsibilities 130 Independent Auditor's report 131Financial statements 138Notes to the nancial statements 142 Financial statements of GlaxoSmithKline plc prepared under UK GAAP 211Financial statements GSK Annual Report 2015 129130 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration report and the Group nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. UK company law requires the Directors to prepare nancial statements for each nancial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Group nancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. In preparing the Group nancial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Under company law the Directors must not approve the Group nancial statements unless they are satised that they give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, nancial position and prot or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those nancial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state that the Group nancial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS as issued by the IASB, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group nancial statements; prepare the nancial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufcient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the nancial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group nancial statements and the Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Group nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, comprising principal statements and supporting notes, are set out in 'Financial statements' on pages 138 to 210 of this report. The responsibilities of the auditors in relation to the Group nancial statements are set out in the Independent Auditors' report on pages 131 to 137. The Group nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are included in the Annual Report, which is published in printed form and made available on our website. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report on our website in accordance with UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of nancial statements. Access to the website is available from outside the UK, where comparable legislation may be different. Each of the current Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report 2015 conrms that, to the best of his or her knowledge: the Group nancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, nancial position and prot of the Group; and the Strategic report and risk sections of the Annual Report, which represent the management report, include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.Disclosure of information to auditors The Directors in ofce at the date of this Annual Report have each conrmed that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information. This conrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. Going concern basis Pages 51 to 72 contain information on the performance of the Group, its nancial position, cash flows, net debt position and borrowing facilities. Further information, including Treasury risk management policies, exposures to market and credit risk and hedging activities, is given in Note 41 to the nancial statements, 'Financial instruments and related disclosures'. Having assessed the principal risks and other matters considered in connection with the viability statement, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the nancial statements. Internal control The Board, through the Audit & Risk Committee, has reviewed the assessment of risks and the internal control framework that operates in GSK and has considered the effectiveness of the system of internal control in operation in the Group for the year covered by this Annual Report and up to the date of its approval by the Board of Directors. The UK Corporate Governance Code The Board considers that GlaxoSmithKline plc applies the principles and complies with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code maintained by the Financial Reporting Council, as described in the Corporate Governance section on pages 80 to 101. The Board further considers that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy. As required by the Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, the auditors have considered the Directors' statement of compliance in relation to those points of the UK Corporate Governance Code which are specied for their review. Annual Report The Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, comprising the Report of the Directors, the Remuneration report, the Financial statements and additional information for investors, has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by Philip Hampton Chairman16 March 2016Directors' statement of responsibilitiesGSK Annual Report 2015 131Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationReport on the Group nancial statements Our opinion In our opinion, GlaxoSmithKline plc's Group nancial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's affairs at 31 December 2015 and of its prot and cash flows for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRSs\") as adopted by the European Union; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in Note 1 to the Group nancial statements, the Group, in addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In our opinion, the Group nancial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. What we have audited The Group nancial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise: the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2015; the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended; the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the Group nancial statements which include a summary of signicant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the nancial statements. These are cross-referenced from the nancial statements and are identied as audited. The nancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group nancial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. Our audit approach Overview Materiality Overall group materiality: \u00a3200 million which represents approximately 4% of prot before tax, adding back certain non-recurring items (\"adjusted prot before tax\"). Audit scope Our audit included full scope audits of 28 reporting components with specic audit procedures performed at a further 39 reporting components. Taken together, the components at which audit work was performed accounted for 65% of consolidated revenue, 80% of consolidated prot before tax and 76% of adjusted prot before tax and covered all components that individually contributed more than 2% of revenue, prot before tax and adjusted prot before tax.Areas of focus Three-part transaction with Novartis Rebates, discounts, allowances and returns in the US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business Investigations into the Group's commercial practices Litigation Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets Re-measurement of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration Uncertain tax positions Context The context of our audit is set by the Group's major activities in 2015. The most signicant event of the last twelve months has been the completion of the Group's three-part transaction with Novartis AG. This has therefore become a new area of focus for our audit in 2015 given the number of signicant management estimates and judgements required to account for the transaction (including valuations of acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of acquisition accounting, recognition and measurement of a put option liability and certain tax judgements) and the broad range of nancial statement line items that are impacted. At the same time, fewer markets migrated in 2015 compared to either 2013 or 2014 onto the Group's common enterprise-wide resource planning platforms (\"ERP\") or moved nancial transaction and accounting services to business process outsourcing locations (\"BPO\") and to in-house business service centres (\"BSC\"). This decision was taken consciously by management given the competing pressures on the organisation to complete and integrate the Novartis transaction. As a result, transformation of the Group's nance processes, highlighted as an area of focus in our 2014 report, was an area of lower risk in 2015 and is not included as an area of focus in the 2015 report. However, we expect this area to feature again as an area of focus in 2016 as the newly acquired Novartis businesses start to be migrated onto GSK's centralised platforms. We also added a new area of focus for the Group's estimation of the fair value of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration reflecting the signicant estimation uncertainty inherent in the calculation of this balance and given the continued increase in the size of this balance in response to changes in management estimates to address better than expected performance of acquired products and revisions to certain other assumptions. Following the resolution of the investigation into the Group's Chinese Pharmaceuticals business in September 2014 - and considering the output of our audit work over this risk in 2013 and 2014 - our focus for 2015 was principally directed at the nancial reporting judgements relating to the active investigations by the Department of Justice (\"DoJ\") in the US and Serious Fraud Ofce (\"SFO\") in the UK. Our other areas of focus have been rened to reflect developments in the Group's business including consideration of the expansion of healthcare reform and continued competitive pricing pressure and discounting in the US, progress in litigation to which the Group is exposed, the impact of changes in the Group's segmental reporting following the Novartis transaction on the determination of cash generating units (\"CGUs\") for impairment testing purposes and management's assessment of uncertain tax positions.Independent Auditors' report to the members of GlaxoSmithKline plc132 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationArea of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Three-part transaction with Novartis Refer to Notes 3, 30 and 38 in the Group nancial statements. On 2 March 2015, the Group completed its three-part transaction with Novartis AG. The Group acquired Novartis' existing Vaccines business for cash consideration of US$5.25 billion, disposed of its Oncology business for cash consideration of US$16.0 billion and each party contributed its existing Consumer Healthcare business into a new venture, in which the Group has a 63.5% controlling interest. We focused on this area because the accounting for each component of the three-part transaction gave rise to the following signicant audit risks: The recognition of goodwill (\u00a31,350 million) and intangible assets (\u00a38,683 million) on the acquisitions of Vaccines and the Novartis Consumer Healthcare business; Accounting for the establishment of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture is complicated and required the fair valuing of the portion of GSK's existing business contributed (\u00a34,116 million) and of the non-controlling interest that arose on the acquisition (\u00a32,150 million); A number of internal restructuring steps were undertaken prior to the Oncology disposal and the Cons umer Healthcare and Vaccines acquisitions in order to support these transactions in a tax efcient manner; and The Group recognised a liability for the present value of the expected redemption price of a written put option over Novartis' non-controlling interest in the new Consumer Healthcare venture (the \"Consumer put option\"), for which the value is subject to signicant judgement and estimation uncertainty. At 31 December 2015, this liability had a carrying value of \u00a36,287 million.Deploying our valuations specialists, we audited the methodology, underlying assumptions and mechanical accuracy of valuation models for each of the signicant acquired intangible assets, consideration paid (including contingent consideration) and the settlement of pre-existing relationships. We challenged the cash flow projections that underpinned each of these valuations, including the Consumer put option, by comparing to historical cash flows and understanding the reasons for the growth prole of projections. Deploying our tax specialists, we evaluated the external tax opinions obtained by management to verify their technical accuracy and to validate that the steps taken by the Group in effecting the transactions are consistent with the external advice and opinions. We instructed component teams at 13 locations to undertake certain substantive procedures over the acquired opening balance sheets for Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, including attendance at inventory counts close to the acquisition date, physical verication of assets acquired and substantive procedures focused on revenue and cost cut-off. As a result of our work, we determined that the provisional purchase price allocations for the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare acquisitions outlined in Note 38 to the Group nancial statements were reasonable. In connection with the Oncology disposal, we veried the cash proceeds and we reperformed management's calculation of the resultant gain on disposal. We found that the pre-tax gain on disposal of Oncology of \u00a39,228 million and the associated tax charge of \u00a31,920 million were reasonably stated, with the latter reflecting management's best estimate of the incremental tax risk arising as a result of the three-part transaction. We determined that the carrying value of the Consumer put option was calculated in accordance with the agreement with Novartis, was based on board approved projections for the business and was reasonably stated. Finally, we found the disclosures in respect of each aspect of the transaction to be reasonable, providing a fair reflection of the accounting and valuations judgements.Independent Auditors' report continued The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (\"ISAs (UK & Ireland)\"). We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the nancial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of signicant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, and the risk of fraud in revenue recognition. Procedures designed and executed to address these risks included use of data enabled auditing techniques to test journal entries and post-close adjustments, testing and evaluating management's key accounting estimates for reasonableness and consistency, undertaking cut-off procedures to verify proper cut-off of revenue and expenses and testing the existence and accuracy of revenue transactions. In addition, we incorporate an element of unpredictability into our audit work each year. The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identied as areas of focus in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specic areas in order to provide an opinion on the Group nancial statements as a whole. Any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. For each area of focus below, where appropriate, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of key internal controls over nancial reporting, including testing the operation of IT systems from which nancial information is generated. This is not a complete list of all risks identied by our audit. GSK Annual Report 2015 133Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationArea of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Rebates, discounts, allowances and returns in the US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines businessRefer to Notes 3 and 27 in the Group nancial statements. The Group makes sales to various customers in the US that fall under certain commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrangements, of which the most signicant are Medicaid and Medicare. The Group also provides a right of return to its customers for certain products. These arrangements result in deductions to gross sales in arriving at turnover and give rise to obligations for the Group to provide customers with rebates, discounts, allowances and the right of return, which for unsettled amounts are recognised as an accrual. We focused on this area because rebates, discounts, allowances and returns arrangements are complex and because establishing an appropriate accrual requires signicant judgement and estimation by the directors. This judgement is particularly complex in a US healthcare environment in which competitive pricing pressure and product discounting are growing trends. The directors have determined an accrual of \u00a31,464 million to be necessary at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014 - \u00a31,308 million).We obtained management's calculations for accruals under applicable schemes and validated the assumptions used by reference to the Group's stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts, third party data related to patient enrolment in US government funded benet schemes and historical levels of product returns. We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns levels (where relevant) and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical accuracy of the Group's estimates in previous years, including certain changes made to management's estimates in 2015 to update Medicaid rebates for a new pricing methodology and to respond to the impact of competitive pricing pressures (particularly for Advair ) and greater discounting in the US market more generally. We formed an independent expectation of the largest elements of the accrual at 31 December 2015 using third party data and compared this expectation to the actual accrual recognised by the Group. Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any material differences between our independent expectations and the accrual. Investigations into the Group's commercial practices Refer to Notes 3, 29 and 45 in the Group nancial statements. The Group remains subject to ongoing investigations by the DoJ in the US and the SFO in the UK into the Group's commercial practices in a number of markets. At 31 December 2015, the Group has concluded that it does not yet have sufcient clarity on the likely timing of the completion of these investigations nor is it able to make a sufciently reliable estimate of any nes or penalties that either the DoJ or the SFO might impose on the Group on completion of their respective investigations. As a result, the Group has stated in note 45 that it is unable to recognise a provision for its estimate of the eventual outcome of either investigation. In addition, the Group is carrying out its own investigations in a number markets to ascertain if activities similar to those previously alleged in China have occurred elsewhere. We focused on the following risks, which might have a material impact on the Group's nancial statements: That nes and penalties might be forthcoming in respect of ongoing investigations into the Group's commercial practices, including those by the DoJ and SFO, that could give rise to the need for material provisions or asset impairments; and That illegal acts similar to those previously alleged in China have occurred elsewhere in the Group.We met with the directors, management, in-house legal counsel and spoke with the Group's external advisors to assess the risk of occurrence of similar acts to those previously alleged in China, the status of ongoing investigations and the potential for further nes and penalties. This included understanding and evaluating the Group's internal investigations processes, which assess risks and allegations reported through various channels including whistle-blowing hotlines. We also evaluated the ongoing enhancements and changes that have been made to other control processes and business practices since the original allegations in China in 2013. Deploying our forensic specialists, we assessed the scope and ndings of the investigative work performed by the Group as well as the risk assessment exercise that management has performed into third party interaction and engagement more broadly. We used the output of this assessment to instruct ten component teams (including certain markets not otherwise included in Group audit scope) to undertake risk-focused audit procedures to address the audit risk that the Group nancial statements might be materially misstated due to the potential nancial implications of alleged illegal acts. In respect of the DoJ and SFO investigations, we independently circularised external legal counsel engaged by the Group to obtain its views on the status of the investigations and to ascertain the reasonableness of management's assertions in respect of the likely outcome of each investigation. We discussed the responses received directly with external legal counsel and found that they were consistent with the representations received from management. We were satised with the Group's provisioning decisions at 31 December 2015 and with the adequacy of the disclosures given the status of these investigations. Litigation Refer to Notes 3, 29 and 45 in the Group nancial statements. The pharmaceuticals industry is heavily regulated which increases inherent litigation risk. The Group is engaged in a number of legal actions, including product liability, an ti-trust and related private litigation, of which the most signicant are disclosed in Notes 29 and 45. We focused on this area as the eventual outcome of claims is uncertain and the positions taken by the directors are based on the application of material judgement and estimation. Accordingly, unexpected adverse outcomes could signicantly impact the Group's reported prot and balance sheet position. During the year, the most signicant increase to the Group's litigation provisions was in respect of the Paxil product liability referred to in Notes 29 and 45 which was reassessed following unsuccessful mediation with plaintiffs giving rise to a subsequent revision of management's best estimate of settling these claims. This increase was more than offset by utilisation of existing provisions of \u00a3428 million. At 31 December 2015, the Group held provisions of \u00a3352 million in respect of legal actions (31 December 2014 - \u00a3520 million). We discussed the status of signicant known actual and potential litigation with in-house legal counsel. We obtained and substantively tested evidence to support the decisions and rationale for provisions held or decisions not to record provisions, including correspond ence with legal counsel and other counter-parties to litigation. We also monitored and considered external information sources to identify potential legal actions. We developed an independent expectation of the litigation provisions based on product litigation history and other available evidence to challenge the valuation and completeness of the provisions recognised by the Group. We obtained conrmations from external legal counsel to conrm our understanding of settled and outstanding litigation and asserted claims. We evaluated signicant adjustments to legal provisions recorded during the year to determine if they were indicative of management bias. In respect of the increase in the provision for Paxil product liability litigation, we obtained sufcient evidence to conclude that this increase was reasonable, including review of external legal advice. As disclosed in Notes 29 and 45 to the Group nancial statements, the eventual outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on the outcome of future events and the position taken by the Group is inherently judgemental. We found that in the context of the Group nancial statements taken as a whole the judgements made by management were reasonable and the disclosures made in respect of these provisions and contingent liabilities were appropriate.134 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationIndependent Auditors' report continued Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets Refer to Notes 3, 18 and 19 in the Group nancial statements. The Group has \u00a316.0 billion of intangible assets (31 December 2014 - \u00a37.8 billion), comprising signicant licenses, patents and acquired trade marks (and excluding computer software). In addition, the Group has \u00a35.2 billion of goodwill at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014 - \u00a33.7 billion). The Group recognised impairments to these intangible assets amounting to \u00a3206 million during the year. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets are contingent on future cash flows and there is risk if these cash flows do not meet the Group's expectations that the assets will be impaired. The impairment reviews performed by the Group contained a number of signicant judgements and estimates including revenue growth, the success of new product launches, patent expiry dates, prot margins, cash conversion, terminal values and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions might lead to a change in the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill. During the year, the Group reduced its number of individual cash generating units (\"CGUs\") for goodwill impairment testing purposes from eight to four, comprising Global Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and ViiV Healthcare. This exercise was undertaken to align the CGUs to the Group's operating segments which were changed following the Group's restructuring following the Novartis transaction. Through this exercise, Vaccines has been treated as a separate CGU for the rst time and the Global Pharmaceuticals CGU aggregates pharmaceuticals businesses previously separated into the US, Europe, Japan, Emerging Markets and Other. We focused on acquired intangible assets, as these are the most signicant individually and in aggregate, and a number have indenite lives, including the most signicant of the intangible assets acquired from Novartis. The Group has also recognised goodwill from a number of its acquisitions, including the three-part transaction with Novartis.Deploying our valuations specialists, we obtained the Group's impairment analyses and tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including prot and cash flow growth, terminal values, the impact of the expiry of patents, potential product obsolescence and the selection of discount rates. We challenged management to substa ntiate its assumptions, including comparing relevant assumptions to industry and economic forecasts. We interrogated the integrity of supporting calculations and we corroborated certain information with third party sources, including expectations of performance of certain assets and components of the business. We obtained and evaluated management's sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and we performed our own independent sensitivity calculations to quantify the downside changes to management's models required to result in impairment. As a result of our work, we determined that the quantum of impairment recognised in 2015 was appropriate. For those intangible assets, including goodwill, where management determined that no impairment was required, we found that these judgements were supported by reasonable assumptions that would require unreasonable downside changes before any additional material impairment was necessary. In respect of the aggregation of CGUs, we conrmed that this is the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill for internal purposes, that it is consistent both with the way in which the Group's leadership team is structured and with how the Group's results and nancial position are reported to the CET and that no CGU for goodwill impairment testing purposes is larger than any of the Group's new operating segments. Re-measurement of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration Refer to Notes 3, 30, 38 and 41 in the Group nancial statements. When the Group's subsidiary, ViiV Healthcare, acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, \u00a3659 million was recognised as contingent consideration. This represented the fair value of expected payments to be made to Shionogi, contingent on future sales of dolutegravir products. This liability is required to be re-measured to its fair value at each reporting date. Since its initial recognition, it has been increased in response to actual and future sales signicantly exceeding original expectations. At 31 December 2015, the associated nancial liability was \u00a33,409 million (31 December 2014 - \u00a31,684 million). We focused on this area as the fair value of the contingent consideration is determined by a number of signicant unobservable inputs and by management judgements and estimates, including forecast future sales of Tivicay and Triumeq , the overall market size for HIV therapies and the potential impact of competitor products launched in 2015 and expected to be launched in the future. In addition, the valuation is sensitive to changes in other assumptions, including discount and tax rates, both of which were revised in determining the valuation at 31 December 2015.Deploying our valuations specialists, we evaluated management's fair value computation model, including the pro jections and key assumptions used therein. We also compared the Group's projections for its dolutegravir products against certain third party expectations and found them to be reasonable. In particular, we considered reasonably possible alternative scenarios, comprising a downside case in the event that products launched by competitors cannibalise more of the Group's market share than anticipated in management's base case and an upside case when the competitor launches are less successful. These scenarios result in contingent consideration liabilities that are materially lower and higher respectively. Notwithstanding this, we believe that the Group has a reasonable basis for its determination of the fair value at 31 December 2015 and that the value reflects management's best estimates. We validated that the methodology was consistent with previous years, and that where certain inputs were changed, such as discount and tax rates, we validated that appropriate triggers occurred in 2015 to support such changes. We also veried that the updated assumptions were reasonable. We also validated that the Group's disclosures in respect of this liability, including the disclosure of estimation uncertainty and its impact on the fair value of the liability are reasonable. Uncertain tax positions Refer to Notes 3 and 14 in the Group nancial statements. The Group operates in a complex multinational tax environment and there are open tax and transfer pricing matters with UK and overseas tax authorities. In addition, from time to time the Group enters into transactions with complicated accounting and tax consequences, including the three-part transaction with Novartis in 2015. Judgement is required in assessing the level of provisions required in respect of uncertain tax positions. At 31 December 2015, the Group has recognised provisions of \u00a31,687 million in respect of uncertain tax positions (2014 - \u00a31,344 million).In conjunction with our UK, US, international tax and transfer pricing specialists, we evaluated and challenged management's judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the Group's tax provisions. This included obtaining and evaluating certain third party tax opinions that the Group has obtained to assess the appropriateness of any assumptions used. In understanding and evaluating management's judgements, we considered the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries, the outturn of previous claims, judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates and developments in the tax environment. From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the Group nancial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgements that are required to formulate the provisions mean that the range of possible outcomes is broad.GSK Annual Report 2015 135Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationHow we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Group nancial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the Group operates. The Group nancial statements are a consolidation of over 500 reporting components. We identied 28 reporting components that, in our view, required an audit of their complete nancial information due to their size or risk characteristics. Specic audit procedures over signicant balances and transactions were performed at a further 39 reporting components to give appropriate coverage of material balances. Where these reporting components are supported by shared nancial service centres, these centres were also included in Group audit scope. None of the reporting components not included in our Group audit scope individually contributed more than 2% to consolidated revenue, prot before tax or adjusted prot before tax. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting component units. As a result, nine overseas components were visited by senior members of the Group audit team, including each of the Group's nancially signicant components in the US (which are visited at least annually) alongside Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and India. We also held a two day audit planning workshop in London attended by 34 of our component teams, largely focused on the impact of the three-part transaction with Novartis alongside other planning and risk assessment activities. In addition, we visited four of the shared service centres supporting reporting components in Group audit scope. For those components in Group audit scope where a site visit was not undertaken, our involvement included regular dialogue with our component teams, review of component auditor work papers and participation in certain component audit clearance meetings. Further specic audit procedures over central functions, the Group consolidation and areas of signicant judgement (including taxation, goodwill, intangible assets, treasury, post-retirement benets, litigation and the elimination of unrealised intercompany prot in inventory) were directly led by the Group audit team. Taken together, the territories and functions where we performed our audit work accounted for 65% of consolidated revenue, 80% of consolidated prot before tax and 76% of adjusted prot before tax. This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the divisional and Group levels, including testing of monitoring co ntrols and disaggregated analytical review procedures, which covers a signicant portion of the Group's smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our Group audit scope. In addition, we obtained audit evidence over certain out-of-scope components through the procedures we undertook at the Group's shared service centres, encompassing BPOs and BSCs, and over centralised IT infrastructure where these processes are standardised. Overall group materiality \u00a3200 million (2014 - \u00a3215 million). How we determined it Approximately 4% of prot before tax (\u00a310,526 million), adding back certain non-recurring items including the re-measurement char ge for the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration (\u00a31,874 million), the re-measurement charge of the Consumer Healthcare put option (\u00a383 million), major restructuring costs (\u00a31,896 million), legal costs (\u00a3221 million), equity investment impairments (\u00a3263 million) and impairment of intangible assets (\u00a3206 million) and deducting non-recurring net income relating to major acquisition and disposal activity (net \u00a310,599 million). Rationale for benchmark applied The Group's principal measure of earnings comprises core results, which adds back to statutory results a number of items of income and expenditure including those detailed above. Management uses this measure as it believes that it eliminates the volatility inherent in one-off items. We took this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that we did not adjust prot before tax to add back amortisation of intangible assets and certain other smaller non-core items as in our view these are recurring items which do not introduce volatility to the Group's earnings. Materiality is lower than last year primarily due to the effect of lower prots in 2015. Going concern Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors' statement, set out on page 130, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are also required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group nancial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.As noted in the directors' statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group nancial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the Group nancial statements were signed. As part of our audit, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to it misstatements identied during our audit above \u00a310 million (2014 - \u00a310 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of ou r audit procedures on the individual nancial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the nancial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the nancial statements as a whole as follows:136 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationAdequacy of information and explanations received Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Directors' remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specied by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Corporate governance statement Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: information in the Annual Report is: - materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group nancial statements; or - apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or - otherwise misleading.We have no exceptions to report. the statement given by the directors on page 130, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.We have no exceptions to report. the section of the Annual Report on page 88, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.We have no exceptions to report. The directors' assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relat ion to: the directors' conrmation in the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. the directors' explanation in the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualications or assumptions.We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors' statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of t he principal risks facing the Group and the directors' statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group, set out on page 52. Our review wa s substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making enquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent wit h the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.Other required reporting Consistency of other information Companies Act 2006 opinion In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the nancial year for which the Gro up nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group nancial statements.Independent Auditors' report continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 137Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationResponsibilities for the nancial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the directors' statement of responsibilities set out on page 130, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group nancial statements and for being satised that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors. This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. What an audit of nancial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the nancial statements sufcient to give reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signicant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial statements. We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors' judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the nancial statements. We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. In addition, we read all the nancial and non-nancial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.Other matters We have reported separately on the parent company nancial statements of GlaxoSmithKline plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 and on the information in the directors' Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

GSK's principal pharmaceutical products include medicines in the following therapeutic areas: respiratory, anti-virals, central nervous system, cardiovascular and urogenital, metabolic, anti-bacterials, dermatology, rare diseases, immuno-inflammation, vaccines and HIV. Compliance with applicable law and IFRS The nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations, as adopted by the European Union. The nancial statements are also in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Composition of nancial statements The consolidated nancial statements are drawn up in Sterling, the functional currency of GlaxoSmithKline plc, and in accordance with IFRS accounting presentation. The nancial statements comprise: Consolidated income statement Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Consolidated balance sheet Consolidated statement of changes in equity Consolidated cash flow statement Notes to the nancial statements. Composition of the Group A list of the subsidiary and associated undertakings which, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the amount of prot or the net assets of the Group is given in Note 44, 'Principal Group companies'. Accounting principles and policies The nancial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention modied by the revaluation of certain items, as stated in the accounting policies, and on a going concern basis. The nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies approved by the Board and described in Note 2, 'Accounting principles and policies'. Information on the application of these accounting policies, including areas of estimation and judgement is given in Note 3, 'Key accounting judgements and estimates'. The preparation of the nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Implementation of new accounting standards An amendment to IAS 19 'Dened benet plans: Employee contribution' was issued in November 2013 and was implemented by GSK from 1 January 2015. The amendment provides additional guidance on the treatment of contributions to dened benet plans from employees and third parties and has no material impact on the current period. Financial period These nancial statements cover the nancial year from 1 January to 31 December 2015, with comparative gures for the nancial years from 1 January to 31 December 2014 and, where appropriate, from 1 January to 31 December 2013. Parent company nancial statements The nancial statements of the parent company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and with UK accounting presentation. The company balance sheet is presented on page 213 and the accounting policies are given on page 214. 2 Accounting principles and policies Consolidation The consolidated nancial statements include: the assets and liabilities, and the results and cash flows, of the company and its subsidiaries, including ESOP Trusts the Group's share of the results and net assets of associates and joint ventures the Group's share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations. The nancial statements of entities consolidated are made up to 31 December each year. Entities over which the Group has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to the Group, generally through control over the nancial and operating policies, are accounted for as subsidiaries. Where the Group has the ability to exercise joint control over, and rights to the net assets of, entities, the entities are accounted for as joint ventures. Where the Group has the ability to exercise joint control over an arrangement, but has rights to specied assets and obligations for specied liabilities of the arrangement, the arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation. Where the Group has the ability to exercise signicant influence over entities, they are accounted for as associates. The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated into the consolidated nancial statements using the equity method of accounting. The Group's rights to assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations are included in the consolidated nancial statements in accordance with those rights and obligations. Interests acquired in entities are consolidated from the date the Group acquires control and interests sold are de-consolidated from the date control ceases.Notes to the nancial statementsGSK Annual Report 2015 143Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information2 Accounting principles and policies continued Transactions and balances betw een subsidiaries are eliminated and no prot before tax is taken on sales between subsidiaries until the products are sold to customers outside the Group. The relevant proportion of prots on transactions with joint ventures, joint operations and associates is also deferred until the products are sold to third parties. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity. Deferred tax relief on unrealised intra-Group prot is accounted for only to the extent that it is considered recoverable. Goodwill is capitalised as a separate item in the case of subsidiaries and as part of the cost of investment in the case of joint ventures and associates. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the operation acquired. Where the cost of acquisition is below the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. Identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest, exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excess is recorded as goodwill. The costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Where not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired the non- controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. Changes in the Group's ownership percentage of subsidiaries are accounted for within equity. Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency of the Group company at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are included in the income statement. On consolidation, assets and liabilities, including related goodwill, of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are translated into Sterling using average rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the prots for the year retained by overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are translated into Sterling, less exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings which hedge the Group's net investment in these operations, are taken to a separate component of equity. When translating into Sterling the assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures which are reported in currencies of hyper-inflationary economies, adjustments are made where material to reflect current price levels. Any loss on net monetary assets is charged to the consolidated income statement.Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against orders received, title and risk of loss is passed to the customer, reliable estimates can be made of relevant deductions and all relevant obligations have been fullled, such that the earnings process is regarded as being complete. Turnover represents net invoice value after the deduction of discounts and allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Market conditions are evaluated using wholesaler and other third-party analyses, market research data and internally generated information. Value added tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue. Where the Group co-promotes a product and the counterparty records the sale, the Group records its share of revenue as co-promotion income within turnover. The nature of co-promotion activities is such that the Group records no costs of sales. Pharmaceutical turnover includes co-promotion revenue of \u00a314 million (2014 - \u00a322 million; 2013 - \u00a337 million). In addition, initial or event-based milestone income (excluding royalty income) arising on development or marketing collaborations of the Group's compounds or products with other parties is recognised in turnover. Milestone income of \u00a3nil is included in turnover (2014 - \u00a357 million; 2013 - \u00a378 million). Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements. Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Manufacturing start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred. Shipment costs on inter-company transfers are charged to cost of sales; distribution costs on sales to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenditure. Restructuring costs are recognised and provided for, where appropriate, in respect of the direct expenditure of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufciently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken.144 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information2 Accounting principles and policies continued Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when the criteria for recognising an asset are met, usually when a regulatory ling has been made in a major market and approval is considered highly probable. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the Group's policy. Environmental expenditure Environmental expenditure related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benet is discernible is charged to the income statement. The Group recognises its liability on a site-by-site basis when it can be reliably estimated. This liability includes the Group's portion of the total costs and also a portion of other potentially responsible parties' costs when it is probable that they will not be able to satisfy their respective shares of the clean-up obligation. Recoveries of reimbursements are recorded as assets when virtually certain. Legal and other disputes Provision is made for the anticipated settlement costs of legal or other disputes against the Group where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. In addition, provision is made for legal or other expenses arising from claims received or other disputes. In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, there is sufcient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims. In certain cases, an incurred but not reported (IBNR) actuarial technique is used to determine this estimate. The Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be included but no provision would be made. Costs associated with claims made by the Group against third parties are charged to the income statement as they are incurred. Pensions and other post-employment benets The costs of providing pensions under dened benet schemes are calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which benet is expected to be derived from the employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualied actuaries. Pension obligations are measured as the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high quality corporate bonds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The costs of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to dened benet pension schemes and spread over the period during which benet is expected to be derived from the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries. Actuarial gains and losses and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. The Group's contributions to dened contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. The fair values of these options and awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods. The Group provides nance to ESOP Trusts to purchase company shares to meet the obligation to provide shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement. Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves. A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect the ultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at the cost of purchase or construction less provisions for depreciation and impairment. Financing costs are capitalised within the cost of qualifying assets in construction. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less residual value of PP&E, excluding freehold land, using the straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Residual values and lives are reviewed, and where appropriate adjusted, annually. The normal expected useful lives of the major categories of PP&E are: Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Lease term or 20 to 50 years Plant and machinery 10 to 20 yearsEquipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years On disposal of PP&E, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and impairments are removed from the nancial statements and the net amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the income statement. Leases Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benets and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as nance leases, as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in PP&E or computer software and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under nance leases. Assets held under nance leases are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter. The interest element of the lease rental is included in the income statement. All other leases are operating leases and the rental costs are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less impairments. Goodwill is deemed to have an indenite useful life and is tested for impairment at least annually. Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilit ies exceeds the consideration paid, this excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 145Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information2 Accounting principles and policies continued Other intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation and impairments. Licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights separately acquired or acquired as part of a business combination are amortised over their estimated useful lives, generally not exceeding 20 years, using the straight-line basis, from the time they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for determining the amortisation charge take into account patent lives, where applicable, as well as the value obtained from periods of non-exclusivity. Asset lives are reviewed, and where appropriate adjusted, annually. Contingent milestone payments are recognised at the point that the contingent event becomes probable. Any development costs incurred by the Group and associated with acquired licences, patents, know-how or marketing rights are written off to the income statement when incurred, unless the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met, usually when a regulatory ling has been made in a major market and approval is considered highly probable. Acquired brands are valued independently as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from third parties where the brand has a value which is substantial and long term and where the brands either are contractual or legal in nature or can be sold separately from the rest of the businesses acquired. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful lives of up to 20 years, except where it is considered that the useful economic life is indenite. The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as intangible xed assets where the software or site supports a signicant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. ERP systems software is amortised over seven to ten years and other computer software over three to ve years. Impairment of non-current assets The carrying values of all non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a stand-alone basis or as part of a larger cash generating unit, when there is an indication that the assets might be impaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with indenite useful lives and intangible assets which are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Any provision for impairment is charged to the income statement in the year concerned. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses on other non-current assets are only reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine recoverable amounts and only to the extent that the revised recoverable amounts do not exceed the carrying values that would have existed, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairments been recognised. Investments in associates, joint ventures and joint operations Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at the Group's share of their net assets at date of acquisition and of their post-acquisition retained prots or losses together with any goodwill arising on the acquisition. The Group recognises its rights to assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations. Available-for-sale investments Liquid investments and other investments are classied as available-for-sale investments and are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Impairments arising from the signicant or prolonged decline in fair value of an equity investment reduce the carrying amount of the asset directly and are charged to the income statement. On disposal or impairment of the investments, any gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income are reclassied to the income statement. Dividends on equity investments are recognised in the income statement when the Group's right to receive payment is established. Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year. Purchases and sales of equity investments are accounted for on the trade date and purchases and sales of other available-for-sale investments are accounted for on settlement date. Inventories Inventories are included in the nancial statements at the lower of cost (including raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads) and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a rst in, rst out basis. Pre-launch inventory is held as an asset when there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. Before that point a provision is made against the carrying value to its recoverable amount; the provision is then reversed at the point when a high probability of regulatory approval is determined. Trade receivables Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less any provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions are made where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous experience and general economic conditions. When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable it is written off, rstly against any provision available and then to the income statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for are credited to the income statement. Long-term receivables are discounted where the effect is material. Borrowings All borrowings are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing.146 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information2 Accounting principles and policies continued Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid applying tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the nancial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable prots will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Derivative nancial instruments and hedging Derivative nancial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by GSK are foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and options. The Group does not hold or issue derivative nancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative nancial instruments are classied as held-for-trading and are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are classied on inception as cash flow hedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective. Ineffective portions are recognised in prot or loss immediately. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are reclassied to the income statement when the hedged item affects prot or loss. Net investment hedges are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement. Discounting Where the time value of money is material, balances are discounted to current values using appropriate rates of interest. The unwinding of the discounts is recorded in nance income and nance expense.3 Key accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the nancial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the nancial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The following are considered to be the key accounting judgements and estimates made. Turnover Revenue is recognised when title and risk of loss is passed to the customer, reliable estimates can be made of relevant deductions and all relevant obligations have been fullled, such that the earnings process is regarded as being complete. Gross turnover is reduced by rebates, discounts, allowances and product returns given or expected to be given, which vary by product arrangements and buying groups. These arrangements with purchasing organisations are dependent upon the submission of claims some time after the initial recognition of the sale. Accruals are made at the time of sale for the estimated rebates, discounts or allowances payable or returns to be made, based on available market information and historical experience. Because the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the nal outcome, and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix. The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Market conditions are evaluated using wholesaler and other third-party analyses, market research data and internally generated information. Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group. Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid, and deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable prots will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised, based on management's assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable prots. Factors affecting the tax charge in future years are set out in Note 14, 'Taxation'. A 1% change in the Group's effective tax rate in 2015 would have changed the total tax charge for the year by approximately \u00a3105 million. The Group has open tax issues with a number of revenue authorities. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. In calculating any such liability GSK applies a risk based approach which takes into account, as appropriate, the probability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under international tax treaties. These estimates take into account the specic circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each dispute progresses. GSK continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments. Where open issues exist the ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of negotiations with the relevant tax authorities or, if necessary, litigation proceedings.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 147Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information3 Key accounting judgements and estimates continued Legal and other disputes The Group provides for anticipated settlement costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and legal and other expenses arising from claims against the Group. These estimates take into account the specic circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgmental and could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each dispute progresses. Details of the status and various uncertainties involved in the signicant unresolved disputes are set out in Note 45, 'Legal proceedings'. The company's Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements. In resp ect of product liability claims related to certain products there is sufcient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims. The Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be included, but no provision would be made and no contingent liability can be quantied. At 31 December 2015 provisions for legal and other disputes amounted to \u00a30.4 billion (2014 - \u00a30.5 billion). The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The position could change over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's nancial statements by a material amount. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairments Goodwill is deemed to have an indenite life and so is not amortised. Annual impairment tests of the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated are performed. Impairment tests are based on established market multiples or risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using appropriate interest rates. The assumptions used in these impairment tests are set out in Note 18, 'Goodwill'. In each case the valuations indicate sufcient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill. Impairment tests on other intangible assets are undertaken if events occur which call into question the carrying values of the assets. Where brands and other intangible assets which are not yet available for use are not amortised, they are subject to annual impairment tests. Valuations for impairment tests are based on established market multiples or risk-adjusted future cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset, where limited, discounted using appropriate interest rates as set out in Note 19, 'Other intangible assets'. The assumptions relating to future cash flows, estimated useful lives and discount rates are based on business forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental. Future events could cause the assumptions used in these impairment tests to change with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group.Business combinations Any contingent consideration included in the consideration payable for a business combination is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. These fair values are generally based on risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using appropriate interest rates. The fair values are reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually, and any changes are reflected in the income statement. At 31 December 2015, the liability for contingent consideration amounted to \u00a33,855 million (2014 - \u00a31,724 million) (see Note 38, 'Acquisitions and disposals'). Of this amount, \u00a33,409 million (2014 - \u00a31,684 million) arose on the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012 and \u00a3405 million arose on the acquisition of the Vaccines business from Novartis in 2015. During 2015, the Group granted a put option to Novartis in respect of Novartis' shareholding in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. In certain circumstances, Novartis has the right to require GSK to acquire its 36.5% shareholding in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture at a market-based valuation. This right is exercisable in certain windows from 2018 to 2035 and may be exercised either in respect of Novartis' entire shareholding or in up to four instalments. GSK has recognised a nancial liability of \u00a36,287 million in Other non-current liabilities at 31 December 2015. This represents the present value of the estimated amount payable by GSK in the event of full exercise of the right by Novartis and is calculated by applying market-based multiples to forecast future prots in accordance with the shareholder agreements. Sensitivity analysis is given in Note 30, 'Other non-current liabilities'. The assumptions relating to future cash flows and discount rates are based on business forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental. Future events could cause the assumptions used in these projections or the market-based multiples to change with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group. Pensions and other post-employment benets The costs of providing pensions and other post-employment benets are charged to the income statement in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee benets' over the period during which benet is derived from the employee's services. The costs are assessed on the basis of assumptions selected by management. These assumptions include future earnings and pension increases, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on assets and mortality rates, and are disclosed in Note 28, 'Pensions and other post-employment benets'. Where a surplus on a dened benet scheme arises, or there is potential for a surplus to arise from committed future contributions, the rights of the Trustees to prevent the Group obtaining a refund of that surplus in the future are considered in determining whether it is necessary to restrict the amount of the surplus that is recognised. The expected long-term rates of return on bonds are determined based on the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds. An equity risk premium is added to this for equities. Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used. Sensitivity analysis is provided in Note 28, 'Pensions and other post-employment benets', but a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the net pension decit of approximately \u00a3630 million and an increase in the annual pension cost of approximately \u00a324 million. The selection of different assumptions could affect the future results of the Group.148 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information4 New accounting requirements The following new and amended accounting standards have been issued by the IASB and are likely to affect future Annual Reports. The amendment to IFRS 11 is not expected to have a material impact on the results and nancial position of the Group. The impacts of IFRS 15, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 on the results and nancial position of the Group are currently being assessed. An amendment to IFRS 11 'Joint arrangements' was issued in May 2014 and will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2016. The amendment requires the acquisition of a joint operation that meets the denition of a business to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business combinations'. IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' was issued in May 2014 and will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2018. The Standard provides a single, principles-based approach to the recognition of revenue from all contracts with customers. It focuses on the identication of performance obligations in a contract and requires revenue to be recognised when or as those performance obligations are satised. IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' was issued in its nal form in July 2014 and will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2018. The Standard will replace the majority of IAS 39 and covers the classication, measurement and derecognition of nancial assets and nancial liabilities, impairmen t of nancial assets and provides a new hedge accounting model. IFRS 16 'Leases' was issued in January 2016 and will be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2019. The Standard will replace IAS 17 'Leases' and will require lease liabilities and right of use assets to be recognised on the balance sheet for almost all leases.5 Exchange rates The Group uses the average of exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings into Sterling and period end rates to translate the net assets of those undertakings. The currencies which most influence these translations and the relevant exchange rates were: 2015 2014 2013 Average rates: US$/\u00a3 1.53 1.65 1.57 Euro/\u00a3 1.37 1.24 1.18 Yen/\u00a3 153 Period end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.47 1.56 1.66 Euro/\u00a3 1.36 1.29 187 174Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 149Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information6 Segment information Operating segments are reported based on the nancial information provided to the Chief Executive Ofcer and the responsibiliti es of the Corporate Executive Team (CET). The completion of the Novartis transaction on 2 March 2015 has changed the balance of th e Group and GSK has changed its segment reporting to reflect this. With effect from 1 January 2015, GSK has reported results under ve segments: Global Pharmaceuticals, HIV, Pharmaceuticals R&D, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare and individual members of the CET are responsible for each segment. Comparative information has been restated accordingly. In addition, the 2013 segment turnover and prot have been restated to exclude the divestments completed in 2013. The Group's management reporting process allocates intra-Group prot on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the prot analyses below have been presented on that basis. The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the Head of Research & Development and is reported as a separate segment. Corporate and other unallocated turnover and costs include the results of several Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products which were held for sale in a number of markets in order to meet anti-trust approval requirements, together with the costs of corporate functions.

For 2015, GSK is reporting these programmes together as one combined programme and the total restructuring costs of \u00a31.9 billio n in 2015 were incurred in the following areas: Restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals business in North America, Emerging Markets and Europe leading to staff reductions in sa les force and administration. Restructuring of the R&D organisation, predominantly in the United Kingdom, North America and Japan. Projects to simplify or eliminate processes leading to staff reductions in support functions. Transformation of the Manufacturing and Vaccines businesses to deliver a step change in quality, cost and productivity. The integration of the Novartis Consumer Healthcare business to the new Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. The analysis of the costs charged to operating prot under these programmes is as follows: 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m2013 \u00a3m Increase in provision for major restructuring programmes (see Note 29) (718) (267) (179) Amount of provision reversed unused (see Note 29) 44 41 1 Impairment losses recognised (419) -( 6 0 ) Other non-cash charges (51) (15) (5) Other cash costs (747) (472) (284) (1,891) (750) (517) Asset impairments of \u00a3419 million (2014 - \u00a3nil; 2013 - \u00a360 million) and other non-cash charges totalling \u00a351 million (2014 - \u00a315 million; 2013 - \u00a35 million) are non-cash items, principally xed asset write downs in manufacturing and research facilities and accelerated depreciation where asset lives in R&D have been shortened as a result of the major restructuring programmes. All ot her charges have been or will be settled in cash and include the termination of leases, site closure costs, consultancy and project management fees. 11 Finance income 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m2013 \u00a3m Interest income arising from: cash and cash equivalents 71 56 55 available-for-sale investments 1 12 derivatives at fair value through prot or loss 24 -- loans and receivables 3 92 Fair value adjustments on derivatives at fair value through prot or loss 5 22 104 68 61 All derivatives at fair value through prot or loss other than designated and effective hedging instruments (see Note 41, 'Fina ncial instruments and related disclosures') are classied as held-for-trading nancial instruments under IAS 39.

(now Innoviva, Inc.). This investment has been accounted for as an investment in an associate since 1 September 2015, as described in Note 20 'Investments in associates and j oint ventures'. Previously it was included in Other investments. The Group's share of after tax prots of associates includes a loss of \u00a38 million in respect of Theravance (now Innoviva). In March 2015, the Group divested half of its shareholding in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited and ceased to account for the remaining investment as an associate. The investment in Aspen is now included in Other investments (Note 21). In 2014 and 2013, Aspen was the Group's only signicant associate. Summarised income statement information in respect of Aspen is set out below for the periods in which the Group accounted for its investment in Aspen as an associate. The Group's 2015 share of after tax prots of associates and other comprehensive income includes a prot of \u00a310 million and other comprehensive income of \u00a32 millio n in respect of Aspen.

The prot on disposal of interest in associates of \u00a3843 million in the year arose on the Group's divestment of one half of its shareholding in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited in March 2015. This included a gain of \u00a3457 million resulting from the change in measurement basis of the Group's retained investment in Aspen on reclassication of the investment following the divestment. The retained investm ent was transferred from Investments in associates, which are equity accounted, to Other investments, which are measured at fair value.158 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information14 Taxation Taxation charge based on prots for the year2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m2013 \u00a3m UK current year charge 156 221 107 Rest of world current year charge 2,924 1,092 1,311 Charge in respect of prior periods (508) (571) 131 Total current taxation 2,572 742 1,549 Total deferred taxation (418) (605) (530) 2,154 137 1,019 In 2015, GSK made payments of \u00a3111 million in UK Corporation tax. In January 2016 GSK made further payments of \u00a3100 million in relation to UK Corporation tax. These amounts are for Corporation tax only and do not include the various other business taxes borne by GSK each year. A signicant component of the deferred tax credit for each of 2015 and prior periods arose in respect of the remeasurement of t he contingent consideration in relation to the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture. In 2015 the credit also included the unwind of deferred tax liabilities on the disposal of the Group's Oncology business to Novartis. In 2014 the credit also included recogni tion of a deferred tax asset on capital losses anticipated to be utilised on completion of the Novartis transaction. The following table reconciles the tax charge calculated at the UK statutory rate on the Group prot before tax with the actual tax charge for the year.

The impact of differences in overseas taxation rate s arose from prots being earned in countries with tax rates higher than the UK statutory rate, the most signicant of which in 2015 we re the US, India, France and Germany. This was partially offset by the increased benet of intellectual property incentives from the UK Pa tent Box and Belgian Patent Income Deduction regimes. Such regimes provide a reduced rate of corporate income tax on prots earned from qual ifying patents. The impact of overseas tax rates was further offset by permanent differences on disposals during 2015 which were subje ct to the UK 'Substantial Shareholdings' Exemption from tax. In 2014 the anticipated Oncology disposal resulted in the recognition of def erred tax assets on capital losses subsequently utilised in 2015. The reduction in the benet provided by R&D credits reflects the change in the UK regime to record the benet within the R&D expense in the income statement. Re-assessments of prior year estimates in 2015 incl ude a benet of \u00a3498 million from the resolution of a number of tax matters in various countries. Future tax charges , and therefore our effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restruct urings, the location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms and resolution of open matters as we continue to bring our ta x affairs up to date around the world.

GSK's biggest risk with r espect to taxation is that different tax authorities will seek to attribute further prot to activities being undertaken in their juri sdiction potentially resulting in double taxation. While GSK applies OECD established principles in matching the prot generated by each legal entit y to the risk borne and value being added by each part of the value chain, this is inherently subjective and can be challenged by tax au thorities. This gives rise to complexity and delay in resolving audits with revenue authorities as to the prots on which individual Group companies are liable to tax. In calculating the tax liability of the Group, GSK applies a risk based approach to determine the transactio ns most likely to be subject to challenge and the probability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under internatio nal tax treaties. There continues to be a signicant international focus on tax reform - including the OECD's \"BEPS\" project, and European Commis sion initiatives such as the proposed 'Anti-BEPS' Directive and the increased use of scal state aid investigations. Together with d omestic initiatives around the world, these may result in signicant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax autho rity disputes. In turn, this could affect adversely our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are o pen and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate. The aggregate amount of unremitted prots at the balance sheet date was approximately \u00a316 billion (2014 - \u00a320 billion). UK legi slation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most overseas prots, subject to certain exceptions. Prov ision for deferred tax liabilities of \u00a3180 million (2014 - \u00a3147 million) has been made in respect of withholding taxation that would arise on the distribution of prots by certain overseas subsidiaries. The unremitted prots on which deferred tax has not been provided is \u00a31.5 billion (2014 - \u00a31.6 billion). Deferred tax on distribution of these prots has not been provided on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

As part of this process, a review has been conducted to ensure consistent and appropriate classication and reporting across th e Group and its segments which has resulted in a number of classication adjustments within property, plant and equipment. This reclass ication has no impact on the net book value of property, plant and equipment reported at each year-end or the income statement for any year but, within the stated total for PP&E, has reduced the opening balance of assets in construction at 1 January 2014 by \u00a3401 mill ion and increased the opening balances of land and buildings and plant, equipment and vehicles by \u00a3183 million and \u00a3218 million, respec tively, with equivalent adjustments to the reclassications reported in 2014. 162 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information17 Property, plant and equipment continued The net book value at 31 December 2015 of the Group's land and buildings comprises freehold properties \u00a33,155 million (2014 - \u00a33,160 million), properties with leases of 50 years or more \u00a3327 million (2014 - \u00a3336 million) and properties with leases of le ss than 50 years \u00a3196 million (2014 - \u00a3162 million). Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2015 are leased assets with a cost of \u00a3756 million (2014 - \u00a3733 million), accumul ated depreciation of \u00a3233 million (2014 - \u00a3226 million), impairment of \u00a3nil (2014 - \u00a39 million) and a net book value of \u00a3523 million (2014 - \u00a3498 million). Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2015 are leased assets with a cost of \u00a331 milli on (2014 - \u00a368 million), accumulated depreciation of \u00a327 million (2014 - \u00a317 million), impairment of \u00a3nil (2014 - \u00a32 million) and a net book value of \u00a34 million (2014 - \u00a349 million). Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation cl auses. The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rational ise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses signicant inputs which are not b ased on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These calcu lations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating uni t, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks. For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected t o give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate. The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%. The net impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales \u00a3109 mi llion (2014 - \u00a336 million), R&D \u00a363 million (2014 - \u00a311 million) and SG&A \u00a3174 million (2014 - \u00a347 million), and include \u00a3327 million (2014 - \u00a3nil) arising from the major restructuring programmes. Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the origin al impairments are deemed no longer to apply. All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales. The carrying value at 31 December 2015 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was \u00a3138 milli on (2014 - \u00a3225 million). 18 Goodwill 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Cost at 1 January 3,724 4,205 Exchange adjustments 66 34 Additions through business combinations (Note 38) 1,372 - Transfer to assets held for sale - (511 ) Movements in contingent consideration balances - (4) Cost at 31 December 5,162 3,724 Net book value at 1 January 3,724 4,205 Net book value at 31 December 5,162 3,724 During 2015, GSK divested to Novartis its marketed Oncology portfolio, acquired Novartis' Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) and created the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture with Novartis over which GSK has control with an equity interest of 63.5%. The acquisitions resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill which was allocated to Vaccines (\u00a3576 million) and Consumer Healthcare (\u00a3774 million). The disposal of the Oncology business resulted in a transfer of goodwill to assets held for sale in 2014 and a reduction in goodwill in Global Pharmaceuticals of \u00a3497 million. This disposal was completed in 2015. The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is allocated to the following cash generating units: 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Global Pharmaceuticals 2,826 2,774 HIV 126 124 Vaccines 1,003 487 Consumer Healthcare 1,207 339 Net book value at 31 December 5,162 3,724 The goodwill balance at 31 December 2014 has been reallocated to reflect the revised cash generating units for 2015.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 163Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information. 18 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model. Fair value l ess costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adj usted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specic country or currency risks. The valuation method ology uses signicant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the Global Pharmaceuticals, HIV, Vaccines an d Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rateTaxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information. Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.Terminal growth rates based on management's estimate of future long-term average growth rates.Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region. Period of specific projected cash flows Five years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate Global Pharmaceuticals 1% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets, reflect the impact of fut ure generic competition and take account of new product launches. In each case the valuations indicate sufcient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely t o result in an impairment of the related goodwill. Goodwill is monitored at the segmental level. The Global Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with i ndenite lives with a carrying value of \u00a3240 million (2014 - \u00a3595 million). The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a coll ection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indenite lives with a carrying value of \u00a37.71 billion (2014 - \u00a31.48 billio n).

The brands are in relatively similar stable and protabl e market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, d iversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low. The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could l imit their useful lives. Accordingly, they are not amortised. Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment ari se. This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash flow forecasts with a termin al value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency spe cic risks. This valuation methodology uses signicant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valu ation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growt h, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain th e product's marketability and registration in the relevant juris dictions. These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of management's budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition. The terminal growth rates applied of between nil and 3% are management's estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets. In each case the valuations indicate s ufcient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible a ssets.166 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information20 Investments in associates and joint ventures Joint ventures \u00a3m Associates \u00a3m2015 Total \u00a3mJoint ventures \u00a3m Associates \u00a3m2014 Total \u00a3m At 1 January 8 332 340 15 308 323 Exchange adjustments 12 3 (1) (18) (19) Additions 13 10 23 279 Disposals - (143) (143) - (1) (1) Transfer from/(to) other investments -1 4 6 146 - (13) (13) Distributions received -( 3 8 ) (38) - (5) (5) Other movements - (165) (165) -1 61 6 Prot/(loss) after tax recognised in the consolidated income statement (2) 16 14 (8) 38 30 Other comprehensive income recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income -2 7 27 --- At 31 December 20 187 207 8 332 340 The Group held one signicant associate at 31 December 2015, Theravance, Inc., which changed its name to Innoviva, Inc. on 8 Ja nuary 2016. At 31 December 2015, the Group owned 32 million shares or 27.8% of Theravance Inc. (now Innoviva Inc.), which is a biopharmaceutical company listed on NASDAQ. The company partnered with GSK in the development of Relvar/Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta and receives royalty income from sales of these products. It is also eligible to receive royalty income from sales of vilanter ol monotherapy, if approved and commercialised, and retains a 15% econ omic interest in future payments made by GSK programmes partnered with Theravance Biopharma, Inc. GSK recognised Theravance as an associate on 1 September 2015, following the expiry of a governance agreement related to the Group's investment in the company. Under the terms of that governance agree ment, the Group was required (with certain limited exceptions) to vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the inde pendent directors of the board or in proportion to other shareholders' votes cast. The expiry of the governance agreement and removal o f this voting rights' restriction was considered to provide the Group with the ability to exert signicant influence over the activitie s of the company. The investment had a market value of \u00a3229 million at 31 December 2015. Other movements primarily reflect the recognitio n of GSK's share of Theravance's past losses on the transfer of Theravance to investments in associates. At 31 December 2014, the Group's only signicant investment in associate was its holding of 12.4% in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited. In March 2015, the Group sold half of its holding in Aspen. As a result, the Group no longer has the ability to exert signicant influence over Aspen, and the Group's remaining investment in Aspen is accounted for in Other investments.

Other investments include li sted investments of \u00a3987 million (2014 - \u00a3892 million), the increase arising from additions, fair value adjustments and the transfer of the Group's investment in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited from Investments in associates to Other investments, offset by the tran sfer of the Group's investment in Theravance, Inc. to Investments in associates and disposals and impairments, principally relating to Aspen. At 31 December 2015, the Group held 22.1% of the common stock of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. The Group's investment in Theravance Biopharma is accounted for as an equity investment as the Group does not have the power to exert signicant influence over the activities of the company. In 2014, the Group and Theravance Biopharma entered into a governance agreement which expires in 2017. Under this agreement, the Group does not have the right to appoint a director to the Theravance Biopharma board and must (with certain limited exceptions) vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the independent directors of the board o r in proportion to other shareholders' votes cast. On 1 September 2015, a similar governance agreement with another investee, Theravance, Inc. (now Innoviva, Inc.) expired. The e xpiry of this agreement was considered to provide the Group with the ability to exert signicant influence over the activities of the company and the Group has therefore accounted for its shareholding as an investment in an associate since that date. In March 2015, the Group sold half of its shareholding in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited, an investment which it had previou sly accounted for as an associate. As a result of the sale, the Group was no longer considered to have the ability to exert signic ant influence over Aspen and the Group's remaining investment was transferred from Investments in associates to Other investments. At 31 December 2015, this investment had a fair value of \u00a3383 million. On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times. The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within Other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments. These impairments initially re sult from prolonged or signicant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which a ny further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement. The carrying value at 31 December of Other investments which have been impaired is as follows: 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Original cost 1,049 558 Cumulative impairments recognised in the income statement (549) (420) Subsequent fair value increases 279 268 Carrying value at 31 December 779 406 22 Other non-current assets 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Amounts receivable under insurance contracts 477 447 Pension schemes in surplus 258 93 Other receivables 255 195 990 735168 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information24 Trade and other receivables 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Trade receivables, net of provision for bad and doubtful debts 3,824 3,556 Accrued income 55 37 Other prepayments 307 252 Interest receivable 9 9 Employee loans and advances 36 28 Other receivables 1,384 718 5,615 4,600 Trade receivables included \u00a38 million (2014 - \u00a328 million) due from associates and joint ventures.

The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the l ight of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned. Pension benets can be provided by state schemes; by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from con tributions paid in respect of each employee; or by dened benet schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. Some 'hybrid' dened benet schemes also include dened contribution sections.170 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued Pension costs of dened benet schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method. In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies. Formal, independent, actua rial valuations of the Group's main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years. Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income. Discount rates are derived from A A rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields a re used. Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benet payments. Projected inflation rate and pension incre ases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts. In the UK, mortality r ates are determined by adjusting the SAPS S2 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience. These rates are then projecte d to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females. In the US, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reflect recent expe rience. These rates are projected using scale BB-2D to allow for future improvements in life expectancy. The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2035 for an individual the n at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male YearsFemale YearsMale YearsFemale Years Current 27 .8 29.9 27 .1 28.8 Projected for 2035 29.7 32.0 28.8 30.5 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts. Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return. Investments are diversied to limit the nancial effect of the failure of any individual investment. The Group reviewed the inv estment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seekin g assets and 45% liability matching assets. In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets. The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans' assets might decline, the in vestment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the Plans' liabilities might increase. In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match f uture pension obligations, the Group has dened an overall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range of assets. The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term inflatio n, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk. The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19R basis, these cash flows are s ensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate (AA corporate bond yield curve) where an increase in long -term inflation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in t he liabilities. In the UK the dened benet pension schemes operated for the benet of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate. These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme. In the US the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benet schemes were merged during 2001. In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US. The Group has applied the following nancial assumptions in assessing the dened benet liabilities: UK US Rest of World 2015 % pa2014 % pa2013 % pa2015 % pa2014 % pa2013 % pa2015 % pa2014 % pa2013 % pa Rate 2.00 2.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 2.70 3.60 4.50 4.20 3.80 4.60 2.20 2.00 3.40 Expected pension 3.00 4.20 0.60 0.50 0.90 Inflation rate 3.10 3.00 3.40 2.25 2.25 2.25 1.40 1.40 1.80Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 171Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three years ended 31 December 2015 in relation to the dened benet pension and post-retirement charged to operating prot Current service cost 131 67 110 308 22 Past service cost/(credit) 25 2 (10) 17 (8) Net interest cost 14 22 13 49 52 Gains from settlements - 1 (9) (8) (7) Expenses 7 4 4 15 - 177 96 108 381 59 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 82 (30) 147 199 62 PensionsPost-retirement benets 2014UK \u00a3mUS \u00a3mRest charged to operating prot Current service cost 119 66 90 275 24 Past service cost/(credit) 7 1 (11) (3) (8) Net interest (credit)/cost (7) 14 14 21 54 Gains from settlements - - (4) (4) - Expenses 6 4 2 12 - 125 85 91 301 70 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income (629) (223) (244) (1,096) charged to operating prot Current service cost 117 74 89 280 37 Past service cost/(credit) 4 - (31) (27) (273) Net interest cost 12 17 17 46 61 Expenses 6 4 4 14 - 139 95 79 313 (175) Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 349 257 74 680 167 The past service credit of \u00a3273 million in 2013 includes an amount of \u00a3279 million in relation to the restructuring of the US p ost-retirement medical obligations for both active and retired members under the age of 65.

During 2015, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK pension schemes totalling \u00a385 million (2014 - \u00a385 million; 2013 - \u00a393 million) and \u00a3111 million (2014 - \u00a3nil; 2013 - \u00a3nil) to the US scheme. In 2013, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension decit identied at the 31 Decembe r 2011 actuarial funding valuation. Based on the funding agreements following the 2011 valuation, the additional contributions ar e expected to be \u00a385 million in 2016. The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate; the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reflected the asset mix of the scheme s.

Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to product liability, anti-trust, government investigations (principally relating to the SEC/DOJ and SFO related investigations), contract terminations, self insurance and environmental clean-up. The charge for the year of \u00a3257 million (\u00a3225 million net of reversals and estimated insurance recoveries) primarily related to provisions for product liability cases regarding Paxil and other products, commercial disputes and various other government investigations. The discount on the provisions decreased by \u00a31 million in 2015 (2014 - \u00a3nil) and was calculated using risk-adjusted projected cash flows and risk-free rates of return. The movement in 2015 includes an increase of \u00a31 million (2014 - \u00a31 million) arising from a change in the discount rate in the year. In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, there is sufcient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. It is in the nature of the Group's business that a number of these matters may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over many years. Litigation proceedings, including the various appeal procedures, often take many years to reach resolution, and out-of-court settlement discussions can also often be protracted. The Group is in potential settlement discussions in a number of the disputes for which amounts have been provided and, based on its current assessment of the progress of these disputes, estimates that \u00a30.3 billion of the amount provided at 31 December 2015 will be settled within one year. At 31 December 2015, it was expected that none (2014 - \u00a3nil) of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third party insurers. For a discussion of legal issues, see Note 45, 'Legal proceedings'.Major restructuring programmes In 2013, the Group initiated the Major Change restructuring programme focused on opportunities to simplify supply chain processes, build the Group's capabilities in manufacturing and R&D and restructure the European Pharmaceuticals business. The Pharmaceuticals restructuring programme, announced in October 2014, will rescale commercial operations, global support functions and the relevant R&D/manufacturing operations across Pharmaceuticals. In addition, an integration restructuring programme was initiated in 2015, following the completion of the Novartis transaction. All of these restructuring and integration programmes are now reported together as one combined major restructuring programme. Provisions for staff severance payments are made when management has made a formal decision to eliminate certain positions and this has been communicated to the groups of employees affected and appropriate consultation procedures completed, where appropriate. No provision is made for staff severance payments that are made immediately. Pension augmentations arising from staff redundancies of \u00a325 million (2014 - \u00a37 million) have been charged during the year and then transferred to the pension obligations provision as shown in Note 28, 'Pensions and other post-employment benets'. Asset write-downs have been recognised as impairments of property, plant and equipment in Note 17, 'Property, plant and equipment'. The majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised in the next two years. Employee related provisions Employee related provisions include obligations for certain medical benets to disabled employees and their spouses in the US. At 31 December 2015, the provision for these benets amounted to \u00a3111 million (2014 - \u00a3114 million). Other employee benets reflect a variety of provisions for severance costs, jubilee awards and other long-service benets. Other provisions Included in other provisions are insurance provisions of \u00a398 million (2014 - \u00a383 million), onerous property lease provisions of \u00a332 million (2014 - \u00a333 million) and a number of other provisions including vehicle insurance and regulatory matters.178 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information30 Other non-current liabilities 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Accruals and deferred income 64 92 Contingent consideration (Note 38) 3,549 1,619 Consumer Healthcare put option liability 6,287 - Other payables 756 690 10,656 2,401 The Consumer Healthcare put option liability relates to the ability of Novartis to put its shares in the Consumer Healthcare Jo int Venture to GSK at certain points in the future, commencing in 2018.

Long-term borrowings repayable after ve years carry interest at effective rates between 1.49% and 6.39%. The repayment dates range from 2022 to 2045. Pledged assets The Group has pledged investments in US Treasury Notes with a par value of $105 million (\u00a371 million), (2014 - $105 million (\u00a367 million)) as security against irrevocable letters of credit issued on the Group's behalf in respect of the Group's self-insurance activity. Provisions in respect of self-insurance are included within the provisions for legal and other disputes discussed in Note 29, 'Other provisions'. In addition, \u00a337 million (2014 - \u00a332 million) of assets included in Note 22, 'Other non-current assets', which do not form part of Net debt, were pledged as collateral against future rental payments under operating lease arrangements entered into by Human Genome Sciences, Inc. prior to its acquisition by the Group.

GSK and Novartis have contributed their respective Consumer Healthcare businesses into a Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture in a non-cash transaction. GSK has an equity interest of 63.5% and majority control of the Joint Venture. In addition, GSK has acqui red Novartis' global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion (\u00a33.417 bil lion) with contingent consideration representing subsequent potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion (\u00a31.2 billion) arising on t he achievement of specied development targets and ongoing royalties based on the future sales performance of certain products, an d so the total amount payable is unlimited. The rst milestone of $450 million (\u00a3300 million) was paid on 26 March 2015. Other business acquisitions In addition, GSK completed one smaller Vaccines business acquisition for cash consideration of \u00a3120 million, net of cash acquir ed, and the fair value of existing investments of \u00a315 million. This represented goodwill of \u00a322 million and intangible assets of \u00a31 24 million less other net liabilities of \u00a311 million. The fair values of the assets acquired in business combinations, including goodwill, are set out in the table below. These amou nts are provisional and subject to change.

The goodwill in the businesses acquired represents the potentia l for further synergies arising from combining the acquired busi nesses with GSK's existing businesses together with the value of the workforce acquired. The majority of the goodwill recognised is no t expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Total transaction costs recognised in 2014 and 2015 for the acquisitions from Novartis amounted to \u00a3102 million. Since acquisition on 2 March 2015, turnover of \u00a31,941 million arising from the Novartis Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines busine sses has been included in Group turnover. If the businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that Gro up turnover in 2015 would have been approximately \u00a3320 million higher. These businesses have been integrated into the Group's existing acti vities and it is not practicable to identify the impact on the Group prot in the period. Disposals OncologyGSK has divested its marketed Oncology business, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also granted commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for consideration of $16 billion (\u00a310,395 million) be fore purchase adjustments.186 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information38 Acquisitions and disposals continued Other business disposals GSK also made a number of small business disposals in the period for net cash consideration of \u00a3309 million.

Okairos has been fully integrated into the GSK business and it is not practicable to separately ident ify the impact on the Group prot for the year. The other acquisitions occurred shortly before the end of the year and had no material impact on the Group prot for the year. The goodwill arising on the acquisitions reflects potential for business synergies and the value of workforce acquired. The majo rity of this goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of the acquisitions are reported within the US, Europe, Emerging Markets, Japan, Other trading and unallocated Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare operating segments.

The amounts are not risk-adjusted or discounted. A number of commitments were made in 2015 under licensing and other agreements. These new arrangements were offset by reduced commitments due on prior year transactions including amendments to the agreement with Ionis and Shionogi. In 2013, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension decit identied at the 31 December 2011 actuarial funding valuation. A payment of \u00a385 million is due in 2016. Future payments will be based on the decit position of the scheme, up to a maximum of \u00a3255 million. The table above includes this commitment, but excludes the normal ongoing annual funding requirement in the UK of approximately \u00a3140 million. The Group also has other commitments which principally relate to revenue payments to be made under licences and other alliances . Commitments in respect of future interest payable on loans are disclosed before taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases are disclosed below. \u00a3314 million (2014 - \u00a3310 million) is provided against these commitments on the Group's balance sheet.

These derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate swaps, are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into currencies required for Group purposes and to manage exposure to nancial risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. GSK does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes and the Treasury policies specically prohibit such activity. All transactions in nancial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation. Capital management GSK's nancial strategy supports the Group's strategic priorities and is regularly reviewed by the Board. GSK manages the capital structure of the Group through an appropriate mix of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt of \u00a310.7 billion (see Note 31, 'Net debt') and shareholders' equity of \u00a35.1 billion (see 'Consolidated statement of changes in equity' on page 140). Total capital, including that provided by non-controlling interests, is \u00a319.6 billion. Our long-term credit rating with Standard and Poor's is A+ (stable outlook) and with Moody's Investor Services ('Moody's') it is A2 (negative outlook). The Group's short-term credit ratings are A-1 and P-1 with Standard and Poor's and Moody's respectively. Liquidity risk management GSK's policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated funding requirements. The strategy is to diversify liquidity sources using a range of facilities and to maintain broad access to funding markets. At 31 December 2015, GSK had \u00a31.3 billion of borrowings repayable within one year and held \u00a35.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments of which \u00a34.2 billion was held centrally. GSK has access to short-term nance under a $10 billion (\u00a36.8 billion) US commercial paper programme. GSK also has \u00a31.9 billion ve year committed medium-term facilities and $2.5 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) of 364 day committed facilities. These facilities were put in place in September 2015 and were undrawn at 31 December 2015. GSK considers this level of committed facilities to be adequate given current liquidity requirements. GSK has a \u00a315 billion European Medium Term Note programme and at 31 December 2015, \u00a37.4 billion of notes were in issue under this programme. The Group also has a US shelf registration statement and at 31 December 2015, had $13.0 billion (\u00a38.8 billion) of notes in issue under this programme. GSK's long-term borrowings mature at dates between 2016 and 2045.Market risk Interest rate risk managementGSK's objective is to minimise the effective net interest cost and to balance the mix of debt at xed and floating interest rates over time. The policy on interest rate risk management limits the amount of floating interest payments to a prescribed percentage of operating prot. Foreign exchange risk management Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are not typically hedged. The Group's objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency costs where possible. GSK's internal trading transactions are matched centrally and inter-company payment terms are managed to reduce foreign currency risk. Foreign currency cash flows can be hedged selectively including hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from acquisitions and disposals of assets. Where possible, GSK manages the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, the Group seeks to denominate borrowings in the currencies of the principal assets and cash flows. These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling. Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in Group overseas assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets. Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce exposure to the Group's investment in overseas assets (see 'Net investment hedges' section of this note for further details).

Credit ratings are assigned b y Standard and Poor's and Moody's respectively. Where the opinion of the two rating agencies differ, GSK assigns the lower rating of the t wo to the counterparty. Where local rating agency or Fitch data is the only source available, the ratings are converted to global ratings equivalent to those of Standard and Poor's or Moody's using published conversion tables. 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Credit risk The Group considers its maximum credit risk at 31 December 2015 to be \u00a311,423 million (31 December 2014 - \u00a39,054 million) which is the total of the Group's nancial assets with the exception of 'Other investments' (comprising equity investments) which bear equity risk rather than credit risk. See page 195 for details on the Group's total nancial assets. At 31 December 2015, GSK's greatest concentration of credit risk was \u00a30.8 billion with Citibank (A/A1) (2014 - \u00a30.7 billion with HSBC (AA-/Aa3)). Treasury-related credit risk GSK sets global counterparty limits for each of GSK's banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Usage of these limits is monitored daily. GSK actively manages its exposure to credit risk, reducing surplus cash balances wherever possible. This is part of GSK's strategy to regionalise cash management and to concentrate cash centrally as much as possible. The table below sets out the credit exposure to counterparties by rating for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives. The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, although, under ISDA agreements, the amount at risk is the net position with each counterparty. Table (e) on page 199 sets out the Group's nancial assets and liabilities on an offset basis.Following the completion of the Novartis transaction in March 2015, GSK's cash and liquid investment balances increased materially. A signicant proportion of these funds were placed in a number of AAA/Aaa rated US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds and AAA/Aaa rated liquidity funds. During 2015, the credit ratings of a number of the Group's relationship banks were downgraded, most notably Deutsche Bank which was downgraded to BBB+/Baa1 from A-/A3. Where possible, measures have been taken to reduce the exposure to lower rated counterparties, including further active management of cash balances within GSK's European cash pool. At 31 December 2015, \u00a348 million of cash is categorised as held with unrated or sub-investment grade rated counterparties (lower than BBB-/Baa3) of which \u00a331 million is cash in transit. The remaining exposure is concentrated in overseas banks used for local cash management or investment purposes (including \u00a37 million in Nigeria held with Zenith Bank and United Bank for Africa, \u00a32 million with BTV in Austria and \u00a32 million with Islandsbanki in Iceland). Of the \u00a3386 million of bank balances and deposits held with BBB/Baa rated counterparties, \u00a385 million was held with BBB-/Baa3 rated counterparties. This includes bank balances or deposits of \u00a353 million with State Bank of India and \u00a325 million with HDFC Bank in India. These banks are used for either local cash management purposes or for local investment purposes.194 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued GSK's centrally managed cash reserves amounted to \u00a33.1 billion at 31 December 2015, all available within three months. This excludes \u00a31.1 billion centrally managed cash held by ViiV Healthcare, a 78.3% owned subsidiary. The Group has invested centrally managed liquid assets in bank deposits, Aaa/AAA rated US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds and Aaa/AAA rated liquidity funds. Wholesale and retail credit risk Outside the US, no customer accounts for more than 5% of the Group's trade receivables balance. In the US, in line with other pharmaceutical companies, the Group sells its products through a small number of wholesalers in addition to hospitals, pharmacies, physicians and other groups. Sales to the three largest wholesalers amount to approximately 82% of the sales of the US elements of the Global Pharmaceuticals, HIV and Vaccines segments. At 31 December 2015, the Group had trade receivables due from these three wholesalers totalling \u00a3990 million (2014 - \u00a3908 million). The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of these wholesalers such that, if one or more of them encounters nancial difculty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group's nancial results. The Group's credit risk monitoring activities relating to these wholesalers include a review of their quarterly nancial information and Standard & Poor's credit ratings, development of GSK internal risk ratings, and establishment and periodic review of credit limits. However, the Group believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts (see Note 24, 'Trade and other receivables'). Fair value of nancial assets and liabilities The table on page 195 presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's nancial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. The fair values of the nancial assets and liabilities are included at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents - approximates to the carrying amount Liquid investments - based on quoted market prices or calculated based on observable inputs in the case of marketable securities; based on principal amounts in the case of non-marketable securities because of their short repricing periods Other investments - equity investments traded in an active market determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price; other equity investments determined by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the discounted cash flows of the underlying net assets Short-term loans, overdrafts and commercial paper - approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments Long-term loans - based on quoted market prices in the case of European and US Medium term notes and other xed rate borrowings (a level 1 fair value measurement); approximates to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and other loans Contingent consideration for business acquisitions - based on present values of expected future cash flows Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and options - based on the present value of contractual cash flows or option valuation models using market sourced data (exchange rates or interest rates) at the balance sheet date Receivables and payables - approximates to the carrying amount Company-owned life insurance policies - based on cash surrender value Lease obligations - approximates to the carrying amount. Fair value of investments in GSK shares At 31 December 2015, the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts held GSK shares with a carrying value of \u00a375 million (2014 - \u00a3151 million) and a fair value of \u00a3409 million (2014 - \u00a3726 million) based on quoted market price. The shares are held by the ESOP Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under employee incentive schemes. In 2015, the carrying value, which is the lower of cost or expected proceeds, of these shares has been recognised as a deduction from other reserves. At 31 December 2015, GSK held Treasury shares at a cost of \u00a36,917 million (2014 - \u00a36,917 million) which has been deducted from retained earnings.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 195Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued 2015 2014 NotesCarrying value \u00a3mFair value \u00a3mCarrying value \u00a3mFair value 5,830 4,338 4,338 Available-for-sale investments: Liquid investments (Government bonds) a 75 75 69 69 Other investments a 1,255 1,255 1,114 1,114 Loans and receivables: Trade and other receivables and certain Other non-current assets in scope of IAS 39 b 5,114 5,114 4,232 4,232 Financial assets at fair value through prot or loss: Other non-current assets in scope of IAS 39 a,b 279 279 269 269 Derivatives designated as at fair value through prot or loss a,d,e 66 76 76 Derivatives classied as held for trading under IAS 39 a,d,e 119 119 70 70 Total nancial assets 12,678 12,678 10,168 10,168 Financial liabilities cost: Borrowings excluding obligations under nance leases: - bonds in a designated hedging relationship d (4,124) (4,349) - other bonds (13,387) (15,209) (13,540) (15,706) - bank loans and overdrafts e (435) (435) (379) (379) - commercial paper -- (656) (656) Total borrowings excluding obligations under nance leases f (16,562) (18,516) (18,699) (21,090) Obligations under nance (85) Total borrowings (16,632) (18,586) (18,784) (21,175) Trade and other payables, Other provisions and certain Other non-current liabilities in scope of IAS 39 c (14,748) (14,748) (7 ,566) (7 ,566) Financial liabilities at fair value through prot or loss: Trade and other payables, Other provisions and certain Other non-current liabilities in scope of IAS 39 a,c (3,855) (3,855) (1,724) (1,724) Derivatives designated as at fair value through prot or loss a,d,e (97) (97) (3) (3) Derivatives classied as held for trading under IAS 39 a,d,e (56) (56) (410) (410) Total nancial liabilities (35,388) (37 ,342) (28,487) (22,710) (24,664) (18,319) (20,710) The valuation methodology used to measure fair value in the above table is described and categorised on page 194.

Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such prices are not ava ilable, the asset or liability is classied as Level 2, provided all signicant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observa ble market data. If one or more of the signicant inputs to the valuation model is not based on observable market data, the instrument is classied as Level 3. Other investments classied as Level 3 in the tables below comprise equity investments in unlisted entities with which the Group has entered into research collaborations and also investments in emerging life science companies. Trade and other payables and Other non-current liabilities classied as level 3 comprise contingent consideration for business acquisitions.

Th e Group's foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less. At 31 December 2015, the Group held outstanding foreign exchan ge contracts with a net asset fair value of \u00a361 million (\u00a3115 million asset less \u00a354 million liability). At December 2014, the fai r value was \u00a3331 million net liability (\u00a368 million asset less \u00a3399 million liability). Following the announcement of the Novartis transaction in April 2014, GSK entered into a number of forward exchange contracts t o protect the Sterling value of the net US dollar proceeds due to the Group on completion of the transaction. At 31 December 2014 , these contracts were in a loss position and resulted in a liability of \u00a3264 million and an unrealised loss of \u00a3299 million. At maturi ty on 2 March 2015, these contracts were in a loss position of \u00a3319 million and resulted in a realised loss of \u00a355 million in the year. This loss has partly offset the gain in the Sterling value of the proceeds received by the Group on divestment of its Oncology business as a result of favourable exchange movements since the inception of the forward contracts. The overall increase in the net asset fair value has been due to the maturity of this hedge during the year and to increased he dging of inter-company loans that are not designated as accounting hedges. Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company loan balances.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 199Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value hedges At 31 December 2015, the Group had no designated fair value hedges. Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Group's net investment in its European (Euro) and Japanese (Yen) foreign opera tions as shown in the table above. Net assets in Swiss (Franc) and South African (Rand) foreign operations were also in designated net investment hedges, although none remained outstanding at 31 December 2015. The carrying value of bonds on page 195 includes \u00a32,740 million (2014 - \u00a34,124 million) that are designated as hedging instrume nts in net investment hedges. Cash flow hedges During 2015, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which it designated as cash flow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Group's European and US medium term notes. In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging fluctuations in long-term interest rates when p ricing bonds issued in prior years. The balance is reclassied to nance costs over the life of these bonds. (e) Offsetting of nancial assets and liabilities The following tables set out the nancial assets and nancial liabilities which are subject to offsetting, enforceable master n etting arrangements and similar agreements. Amounts which are set off against nancial assets and liabilities in the Group's balance s heet are set out below. For Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables, Derivative nancial assets and Derivative nancial li abilities, amounts not offset in the balance sheet but which could be offset under certain circumstances are also set out.

The maturity anal ysis of xed rate debt is stated by contractual maturity and of floating rate debt by interest rate repricing dates.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include ca sh and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative nancial instruments. The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such nancial instruments to changes in foreign exchange a nd interest rates. Foreign exchange sensitivity Foreign currency exposures arise from the translation of nancial assets and liabilities which are not in the functional curren cy of the entity that holds them (cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts, inter-company loans and deposits, other receivabl es and payables and trade receivables and payables) and derivative nancial instruments hedging legal provisions and activities arisin g from acquisitions and disposals of assets. The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US dollar, Euro and Japane se Yen. Based on the Group's net nancial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening of Sterling against these currencies, w ith all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the table below. The table excludes nancial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another nancial instrument. 2015 2014 Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposuresIncrease/(decrease) in income \u00a3mIncrease/(decrease) in income \u00a3m 10 cent appreciation of the US dollar (2014: 10 cent) 77 (263) 10 cent appreciation of the Euro (2014: 10 cent) 7 11 10 yen appreciation of the Yen (2014: 10 yen) (1) - An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would cause the following increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3(67) million, \u00a3(6) million and \u00a31 million (2014 - \u00a3169 million, \u00a3(10) million and \u00a3nil) for US dollar, Euro and Yen exchange rates respectively.

Interest rate sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates wi ll affect future cash flows or the fair values of nancial instruments. The majority of debt is issued at xed interest rates and changes in the floating rates of interest do not signicantly affect t he Group's net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn floating rates of interest. The table below hypothetically shows the Group's sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US dollar an d Euro variable rate nancial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates applicable to floating rate nancial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% (100 basis points), and assuming other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Group's nance income for 2015 would have increased by approximately \u00a337 million (2014 - \u00a35 million increase). A 1% (100 basis points) movement in in terest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity. 2015 2014 Income statement impact of interest rate movementsIncrease/(decrease) in income \u00a3mIncrease/(decrease) in income \u00a3m 1% (100 basis points) increase in Sterling interest rates (2014: 1%) 19 (19) 1% (100 basis points) increase in US dollar interest rates (2014: 1%) 14 19 1% (100 basis points) increase in Euro interest rates (2014: 1%) 4 5 (h) Contractual cash flows for non-derivative nancial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Group's n on- derivative nancial liabilities on an undiscounted basis. The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded. For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under nance leases. Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rat e at the balance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December. Contractual cash flows in re spect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 40, 'Commitments'.

In addition, there is an increase of \u00a31 billion in forecast future cash flows in respect of contingent consideration p ayable for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012. These increases are partially offset by a reducti on of \u00a32.6 billion in forecast future cash flows for repayment of debt and debt interest. The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Group's derivative instruments, excluding embedded derivatives and equity options which are not material, using undiscounted cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies a re translated using spot rates at 31 December. The gross cash flows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table although, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these inst ruments. The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have decreased compared to 31 December 2014 due to the maturity of the foreign exchange contracts that were hedging the US dollar proceeds of the Novartis transaction. 2015 2014 Receivables \u00a3mPayables \u00a3mReceivables \u00a3mPayables \u00a3m less than one year 18,283 (18,318) 21,586 (21,841) Between one and two years 20 (20) -- Gross contractual cash flows 18,303 (18,338) 21,586 (21,841) 42 Employee share schemes GSK operates several employee share schemes, including the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period and the Performance Share Plan, whereby award s are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of spe cied performance targets. The granting of these restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cos t of the schemes more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee. The Group also operates savings related share op tion schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc at a discounted price. Grants of restricted share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting or performance period. Awards u nder the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc but in some circumstan ces may be settled in cash. Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years' saving. I n accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant. Options under historical share option schemes were granted at the market price ru ling at the date of grant. The total charge for share-based incentive plans in 2015 was \u00a3349 million (2014 - \u00a3346 million; 2013 - \u00a3319 million). Of this a mount, \u00a3307 million (2014 - \u00a3302 million; 2013 - \u00a3243 million) arose from the Share Value Plan. See Note 9, 'Employee Costs' for furth er details.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 203Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information42 Employee share schemes continued GlaxoSmithKline share award schemes Share Value Plan Under the Share Value Plan, share awards are granted to certain employees at no cost. The awards vest after two and a half to t hree years and there are no performance criteria attached. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share p rice on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 5.7% (2014 - 5.2%; 2013 - 5.0%) over the duration of th e award.

The percentage of eac h award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during t he same period. For awards granted from 2014 to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period. These are adjusted free cash flow, TSR and R&D new product performance. For those awards made to all other eligible employees the performance conditions are based on both GSK's EPS growth compared with the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period and adjusted free cash flow. In addition, some businesses have an element of their award based on a strategic or operational business measure, over a three year measurement p eriod, specic to the employee's business area. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant. For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant. During 2015, awards were made of 4.6 million shares at a weighted fair value of \u00a312.19 and 1.3 million ADS at a weighted fair v alue of $37.27. At 31 December 2015, there were outstanding awards over 13.2 million shares and 3.5 million ADS. Share options and savings-related options For the purposes of valuing options and savings-related options to arrive at the share based payment charge, a Black-Scholes op tion pricing model has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Risk-free interest rate Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Savings-related options grant price (including 20% discount) \u00a310.14 \u00a311.31 \u00a312.47204 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information42 Employee share schemes continued Options outstandingShare option schemes - sharesShare option schemes - ADSSavings-related share option schemes Number 000Weighted exercise price Number 000Weighted exercise price Number 13,227 \u00a312.86 10,957 $47 .75 6,611 \u00a310.68 Range of exercise prices on options outstanding at year end \u00a311.47 - \u00a314.93 $33.42 - $58.00 \u00a310.13 - \u00a312.47 Weighted market price on exercise during year \u00a314.73 $44.63 \u00a313.45 Weighted average remaining contractual life 2.2 years 1.6 years 2.8 years Options over 4.4 million shares were granted during the year under the savings-related share option scheme at a weighted averag e fair value of \u00a31.78. At 31 December 2015, 5.9 million of the savings-related share options were not exercisable. All of the other sh are options and ADS options are currently exercisable and all will expire if not exercised on or before 22 July 2020. There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year. Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts The Group sponsors Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts to acquire and hold shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc to satisfy awards made under employee incentive plans and options granted under employee share option schemes. The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares with nance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions. In 2014, Treasury shares with a carr ying value of \u00a3150 million were purchased by the UK ESOP Trust to satisfy future awards under the shareholder approved Performance S hare Plan. The costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement. Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted fro m other reserves and amortised down to the value of proceeds, if any, receivable from employees on exercise by a transfer to reta ined earnings. The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.

Und er the original agreements, GSK had the unconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of either put option. In February 2016, GSK notied Pzer and Shionogi that it had irrevocably given up this right. This will lead to recognition of a liability for these put options on the Group's balance sheet in 2016. The estimated present value of the liability for the two put option s is approximately \u00a32 billion, after adjustments for the value of preferential dividends due to each of the shareholders. Consistent with this revised treatment, in 2016 GSK will also recognise liabilities on the Group's balance sheet for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pzer and Shionogi. The estimated aggregate present value of the liability for prefe rential dividends to both Pzer and Shionogi is approximately \u00a3170 million. On 22 February 2016, ViiV Healthcare completed two previously announced transactions with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). ViiV Healthcare acquired late-stage R&D assets from BMS for an initial upfront payment of $317 million followed by development and rst commercial sale milestones of up to $518 million, and tiered royalties on sales. ViiV Healthcare also acquired BMS's preclinica l and discovery stage HIV research business for an upfront payment of $33 million, followed by development and rst commercial sales milestones of up to $587 million, and further cons ideration contingent on future sales performance.Notes to the nancial statements continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 205Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information44 Principal Group companies The following represent the principal subsidiaries and their countries of incorporation of the Group at 31 December 2015.

The Group makes provision for these proceedings on a regular basis as summarised in Note 2, 'Accounting principles and policies' and Note 29, 'Other provisions'. The Group may become involved in signicant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosures about such cases would be included, but no provision would be made. With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other than those for which a provision has been made, the Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect at this stage. The Group does not believe that information about the amount sought by the plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law. Intellectual property claims include challenges to the validity and enforceability of the Group's patents on various products or processes as well as assertions of non-infringement of those patents. A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection for the product at issue. The consequences of any such loss could be a signicant decrease in sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations for the Group. Legal expenses incurred and provisions related to legal claims are charged to selling, general and administration costs. Provisions are made, after taking appropriate legal and other specialist advice, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute. For certain product liability claims, the Group will make a provision where there is sufcient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims. At 31 December 2015, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described in Note 14, 'Taxation') was \u00a30.4 billion. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's nancial statements. If this were to happen, it could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the Group in the reporting period in which the judgments are incurred or the settlements entered into. The most signicant of these matters are described below.Intellectual property Advair 2015, Pharmaceuticals (Mylan) led a petition for an Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the United States Patent and Trademark Ofce (USPTO) seeking to invalidate a patent covering the surfactant-free formulation and its use in the hydrofluoroalkane . The Group exclusively licenses the patent from 3M and has the rst right to enforce and defend it. The patent, which expires on 1 December 2021, is listed in the Orange Book. The Group led a Patent Owner's Preliminary Response opposing the institution of the IPR on 6 January 2015. A decision on institution is due by 6 April 2016. The patent that Mylan has challenged is just one of a number of patents covering Advair , Flovent and Ventolin and dose inhalers. Men B vaccines/ Bexsero Following its acquisition of the Novartis Vaccine business, the Group has taken over litigation originally led by Novartis against Pzer, Inc. (Pzer) in the UK, Italy and the United States related to meningococcal B (Men B) vaccines. On 18 February 2015, Novartis led suit against Pzer in the UK High Court (Patents Court) for a declaration that a European patent owned by Pzer was not infringed by Bexsero and was invalid. The Group assumed responsibility for this matter on 27 April 2015. Pzer led a Statement of Defence on 27 May 2015 and counterclaimed for infringement. Trial in the matter commenced on 7 March 2016. On 18 February 2015, Novartis led suit against Pzer in the Court of Rome for a declaration that a European patent owned by Pzer was not infringed by Bexsero and was invalid. The Group has assumed responsibility for this matter. The Group is also prosecuting a lawsuit against Pzer, originally led by Novartis, for a declaration that a European patent issued to Pzer related to meningitis B vaccines is not infringed by Bexsero . On 18 February 2015, Novartis led suit against Pzer in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement. The complaint asserts six patents against Pzer, alleging that Pzer's sale of Trumenba infringes those patents. Trumenba is indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. On 27 April 2015, the Group led a First Amended Complaint against Pzer reasserting the six patents originally asserted by Novartis, but also asserting one additional recently-granted patent. Infringement contentions were served by the Group on 29 October 2015; Pzer served non-infringement and invalidity contentions on 18 December 2015. The Group responded to Pzer's invalidity contentions on 5 February 2016. No dates have been set for summary judgment motions or trial.GSK Annual Report 2015 207Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information45 Legal proceedings continued Coreg CR Mylan sent a Paragraph IV certication, dated 26 August 2015, to the Group and Flamel Ireland Ltd. (Flamel) stating that it had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of a generic version of Coreg CR . The notice asserted that the patents listed in the Orange Book for Coreg CR were either invalid or not infringed by Mylan's product. On 9 October 2015, Flamel led a civil complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia alleging that My lan's product infringes Flamel's Orange Book-listed extended release formulation patent which expires 11 March 2026. The Group is the exclusive licensee of this patent for Coreg CR . Mylan answered on 18 December 2015, asserting that Flamel's patent was invalid or not infringed. Mylan also led a third party complaint against the Group requesting a declaration that the Group's patent on carvedilol phosphate hemihydrate is invalid or not infringed. A scheduling conference has been set for 12 May 2016. Epzicom/Kivexa/Trizivir On 6 February 2014, ViiV Healthcare received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) had led an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certication for Epzicom , alleging that the three patents listed in the Orange Book for Epzicom are either invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. ViiV Healthcare led suit against Lupin on 3 March 2014, alleging infringement of both the patent covering the combination of lamivudine and abacavir and the patent covering the hemisulfate salt of abacavir. ViiV Healthcare settled with Lupin on 22 June 2015, and the case was dismissed on 7 August 2015. On 2 June 2014, Apotex led a Petition requesting an Inter Partes Review (IPR) of the combination patent covering Epzicom and Trizivir . The USPTO granted the petition on 8 December 2014 which initiated the IPR. On 8 January 2015, Teva led a petition with the USPTO to join the proceeding. ViiV Healthcare led an opposition to Teva's joinder motion on 3 April 2015, and Teva's motion to join was denied on 25 June 2015. On 29 July 2015, ViiV Healthcare and Apotex settled the case, and the USPTO terminated the IPR on 3 August 2015. Teva Canada and Apotex each led Notices of Allegation challenging patents for Kivexa (lamivudine/abacavir) listed on the Canadian Patent Register. ViiV Healthcare led suit for infringement against Teva on 12 September 2013 under the patents covering abacavir hemisulfate and the combination of lamivudine and abacavir. ViiV Healthcare led suit against Apotex on 31 January 2014 under the patent covering abacavir hemisulfate and on 14 March 2014 for infringement of the patent covering the combination of lamivudine and abacavir. ViiV Healthcare settled the case against Teva on 24 April 2015 and against Apotex on 29 July 2015. Teva also challenged the claims of the combination patent covering Kivexa in Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The combination patent expires across Europe in 2016. In addition, ViiV Healthcare has a corresponding Supplementary Protection Certicate (SPC) for Kivexa that does not expire until late 2019. Teva also challenged the validity of the SPC. ViiV Healthcare reached a settlement with Teva in May 2015 and the litigation was terminated. In May 2015, Mylan led an action in the UK Patents Court alleging that the patent covering the combination of lamivudine and abacavir for Kivexa is invalid. They also allege that the SPC based upon the patent is invalid because it was not the rst marketing authorisation for the combination, alleging instead that the prior approval of Trizivir was the rst. Trial is scheduled for May 2016. In addition, Mylan has challenged the combination patent and associated SPC in France, Italy and Portugal. No trial dates have been set in these jurisdictions. Lexiva On 10 December 2014, Lupin led a petition with the USPTO for an IPR alleging that the patent covering the active ingredient for Lexiva is invalid. ViiV Healthcare led a Patent Owner's Preliminary Response opposing the petition on 12 April 2015. On 9 July 2015, the USPTO granted in-part and denied in-part the petition for an IPR. Signicantly, the USPTO denied the petition for the basic compound claims covering Lexiva , while granting the petition for other claims in the patent. On 24 July 2015, Lupin requested reconsideration of the decision not to initiate review of the claims specically covering Lexiva . On 14 October 2015, ViiV Healthcare requested adverse judgment as to the claims upon which review was granted (effectively cancelling those claims). On 2 November 2015, the USPTO denied Lupin's motion for reconsideration and, on 3 November 2015, the USPTO cancelled the requested claims and terminated the IPR, leaving the claims covering Lexiva intact. On 4 February 2016, Lupin led a new petition for an IPR on the remaining claims. A Patent Owner's Preliminary Response is due 11 May 2016. Product liability Pre-clinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of potential products to determine the safety and efcacy of products for use by humans following approval by regulatory bodies. Notwithstanding these efforts, when drugs and vaccines are introduced into the marketplace, unanticipated safety issues may become, or be claimed by some to be, evident. The Group is currently a defendant in a number of product liability lawsuits related to the Group's Pharmaceutical, Vaccine and Consumer Healthcare products. The most signicant of these matters are described below. The Group has been able to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of the matters discussed in this category and has included a provision, as appropriate, for the matters below in the provision for legal and other disputes. Matters for which the Group has made a provision are also noted in Note 29, 'Other provisions'.208 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationNotes to the nancial statements continued 45 Legal proceedings continued Avandia The Group has been named in product liability lawsuits on behalf of individuals asserting personal injury claims arising out of the use of Avandia . The federal cases led against the Group are part of a multi-district litigation proceeding pending in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the 'MDL Court'). Cases have also been led in a number of state courts. As of February 2016, the Group has reached agreements to settle the substantial majority of federal and state cases pending in the US. Fifteen purported class actions on Avandia are pending in Canada. There are four purported class actions seeking economic damages on behalf of third party payers (TPPs) asserting claims arising under various state and federal laws, including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), state unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The MDL Court has consolidated these four actions for pre-trial proceedings, and has appointed a Plaintiffs Steering Committee. The Group is ling a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision that the TPPs state a valid cause of action. The sole remaining consumer class action, brought on behalf of Missouri residents, was dismissed by the MDL Court; the Third Circuit has afrmed the MDL's decision dismissing the action. As a result, no consumer class actions remain. Seroxat/Paxil and Paxil CR The Group has received numerous lawsuits and claims alleging that use of Paxil (paroxetine) has caused a variety of injuries. Most of these lawsuits contain one or more of the following allegations: (i) that use of Paxil during pregnancy caused congenital malformations or persistent pulmonary hypertension; (ii) that Paxil treatment caused patients to commit suicidal or violent acts; and (iii) that the Group failed to warn that patients could experience certain symptoms on discontinuing Paxil treatment. Pregnancy The Group has reached agreements to settle the majority of the US claims relating to the use of Paxil during pregnancy as of February 2016, but a number of claims related to use during pregnancy are still pending in various courts in the US. Other matters have been dismissed without payment. Currently, there are twelve trials scheduled in 2016. There are two proposed, and one certied, class actions in Canada. The action that has been certied as a national class action is in British Columbia and relates to cardiovascular defects. An appeal from that certication decision was dismissed in October 2013, and the case is scheduled to be tried in October 2016. Acts of violence As of February 2016, there were six pending matters concerning allegations that patients who took paroxetine or Paxil committed or attempted to commit suicide or acts of violence. Trial on one of these cases is scheduled for 19 September 2016. Discontinuation In the UK, in late 2010, due to poor prospects of success, public funding of Seroxat claimants who had alleged withdrawal reactions was ceased. The majority of the claimants discontinued their claims. In 2011, about 120 claimants appealed the decision to the Special Cases Review Panel. The Special Cases Review Panel denied the appeal, and the public funding certicate was discharged by the Legal Aid Agency on 29 January 2015. One hundred and three cases remain. These were the subject of a hearing held on 14 December 2015. The judgement from the hearing was published on 4 February 2016 and allowed the remaining claims to continue under court management. A further case management conference is expected by the summer. Zofran Plaintiffs allege that their children suffered birth defects as a result of the mothers' ingestion of Zofran and/or generic ondansetron for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. Plaintiffs assert that the Group sold Zofran knowing it was unsafe for pregnant women, failed to warn of the risks, and illegally marketed Zofran \"off-label\" for use by pregnant women. As of February 2016, the Group is a defendant in 226 personal injury lawsuits brought on behalf of 236 individual plaintiffs in the US. All 221 federal cases are part of a multi-district litigation proceeding (MDL) in the District of Massachusetts. The Group is also a defendant in four proposed class actions in Canada, which are in their early stages. Class certication issues in these cases have not yet been addressed. On 27 January 2016, the MDL court issued an order denying the Group's motion to dismiss all claims of the grounds that they are preempted under federal law. The Group may renew the motion at a later date. The MDL continues with monthly status conferences where issues such as the sufciency of the pleadings and the scope of discovery will be addressed. GSK Annual Report 2015 209Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information45 Legal proceedings continued Sales and marketing and regulation The Group has been able to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of the matters discussed in this category, and has included a provision for such matters in the provision for legal and other disputes, except as noted below. Matters for which the Group has made a provision are also noted in Note 29, 'Other provisions'. SEC/DOJ and SFO Anti-corruption enquiries The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an industry-wide enquiry in 2010 into whether pharmaceutical companies may have engaged in violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) relating to the sale of pharmaceuticals, including in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Group is one of the companies that has been asked to respond to this enquiry and is cooperating with the SEC and DOJ. The Group has informed the DOJ and SEC about the investigation of its China operations by the Chinese government that was initiated in 2013 and the outcome of that investigation. The Group also has briefed the DOJ and SEC regarding other countries and issues. The Group also has advised the UK Serious Fraud Ofce (SFO) regarding the investigation of its China operations by the Chinese government and the outcome of that investigation. The SFO has requested information from the Group on its commercial operations in a number of countries. On 27 May 2014, the SFO informed the Group that it had formally opened a criminal investigation into the Group's practices. The Group is responding to the SFO's requests. The Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of these investigations, and no provision has been made for them. US Vaccines subpoena On 25 February 2016, the Group received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Ofce for the Southern District of New York requesting documents relating to the Group's Vaccines business. The Group is responding to the subpoena. The Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of this matter, and no provision has been made for it. US subpoena relating to Imitrex and Amerge On 7 March 2016, the Group received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Ofce for the Southern District of New York requesting documents relating to the Group's US contracts for Imitrex and Amerge . The Group is responding to the subpoena. The Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of this matter, and no provision has been made for it. Avandia The Group is defending an action by the County of Santa Clara, California, which was brought under California's consumer protection laws seeking civil penalties and restitution as a result of the Group's marketing of Avandia . The Group has led a number of dispositive motions which are pending before the MDL Court. The County of Santa Clara recently has led a motion to dismiss the action from federal court for lack of federal jurisdiction. This motion has been briefed and argued by the parties.Average wholesale price State Attorneys General in Wisconsin and Illinois have led suit against the Group and a number of other pharmaceutical companies claiming damages and restitution due to average wholesale price (AWP) and/or wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) price reporting for pharmaceutical products covered by the states' Medicaid programmes. These cases allege that the Group reported or caused to be reported false AWP and WAC prices, which, in turn, allegedly caused state Medicaid agencies to reimburse providers more money for covered medicines than the agencies intended. The states have sought recovery on behalf of the states as payers and, in some cases, on behalf of in-state patients as consumers. The Group has reached a settlement with the State of Wisconsin resolving all claims in the matter. The Illinois case is ongoing, and no trial date has yet been set. Cidra third-party payer litigation On 25 July 2013, a number of major US healthcare insurers led suit against the Group in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania County Court of Common Pleas seeking compensation for reimbursements they made for medicines manufactured at the Group's former Cidra plant in Puerto Rico. These insurers claim that the Group knowingly and illegally marketed and sold adulterated drugs manufactured under conditions non-compliant with cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) and that they, as third-party insurers, were unlawfully induced to pay for them. The suit alleges both US federal and various state law causes of action. The case had been stayed pending the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on an overlapping, potentially dispositive issue in the Group's third-party payer litigation regarding Avandia . As a result of the Third Circuit's denial of the Group's petition, the judge in this litigation has lifted the stay. The parties have led supplemental briengs on the Group's motion to dismiss and await a ruling from the court. The Group has made no provision for this matter. Anti-trust/competition The Group has been able to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect of the matters discussed in this category and has included a provision for such matters in the provision for legal and other disputes, except as noted below. Matters for which the Group has made a provision are also noted in Note 29, 'Other provisions'. UK Competition and Markets Authority investigation On 12 February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a decision ning the Group and two other pharmaceutical companies for infringement of the Competition Act. The CMA imposed a ne of \u00a337.6 million on the Group, as well as nes totalling \u00a37.4 million against the other companies. This relates to agreements to settle patent disputes between the Group and potential suppliers of generic paroxetine formulations, entered between 2001 and 2003. The Group terminated the agreements at issue in 2004. The Group believes it has strong arguments to defend its actions and is currently examining the CMA's nding with its legal advisors with a view to appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal such that the ne is overturned or substantially reduced. Accordingly no provision has been made for this matter.210 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information45 Legal proceedings continued Lamictal Purported classes of direct and indirect purchasers led suit in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that the Group and Teva Pharmaceuticals unlawfully conspired to delay generic competition for Lamictal , resulting in overcharges to the purchasers, by entering into an allegedly anti-competitive reverse payment settlement to resolve patent infringement litigation. A separate count accuses the Group of monopolising the market. On 26 June 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision to dismiss the case and remanded the action back to the trial court. On 26 October 2015, the trial court denied the Group's motion for a stay and set a schedule for early dispositive motions and discovery. The Group led a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on 19 February 2016. Wellbutrin XL Plaintiffs claimed antitrust injury related to allegedly sham patent litigation led by Biovail against generic companies pursuing ANDAs for generic Wellbutrin XL . The Group was named as a party plaintiff in two patent infringement actions but later withdrew from those matters. The Group was not a party in the remaining two patent infringement actions relating to Wellbutrin XL . Plaintiffs alleged that a conspiracy to delay generic approval existed between Biovail and the Group, but the Court granted summary judgment in favour of the Group on those claims. The sole remaining claim related to plaintiffs' allegations that the Group entered into an anti-competitive reverse payment settlement to resolve the patent infringement litigation. The Court granted summary judgment in favour of the Group on all claims, and the matter is currently pending appeal before the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Court. Commercial and corporate Where the Group is able to make a reliable estimate of the expected nancial effect, if any, for the matters discussed in this category, it has included a provision in respect of such matters in the provision for legal and other disputes as set out in Note 29, 'Other provisions'. Securities/ERISA class actions - Stiefel There are currently three outstanding lawsuits brought by former Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. (Stiefel) employees alleging that Stiefel and its ofcers and directors violated the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and federal and state securities laws by inducing Stiefel employees to sell their shares in the employee stock plan back to Stiefel at a greatly undervalued price and without disclosing to employees that Stiefel was about to be sold to the Group. The Fried case is currently on appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with oral argument having taken place in February 2016. Stiefel won a complete defence verdict in this matter at a jury trial in federal court in Florida in October 2013 and the plaintiff appealed. Trial of a second Florida case has been stayed pending resolution of the Fried matter. Discovery also continues in a case pending in New York federal court. In addition to the private litigant suits, on 12 December 2011, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led a formal complaint against Stiefel and Charles Stiefel in the US District Court for the District of Florida alleging that Stiefel and its principals violated federal securities laws by inducing Stiefel employees to sell their shares in the employee stock plan back to the company at a greatly undervalued price and without disclosing to employees that the company was about to be sold. The case had been stayed but was returned to active status in early summer 2015. On 30 November 2015, the court entered orders asking the parties to rebrief their summary judgment motions and setting a pretrial conference for August 2016. The Group has made a provision for the Stiefel litigation. Environmental matters The Group has been notied of its potential responsibility relating to past operations and its past waste disposal practices at certain sites, primarily in the US. Some of these matters are the subject of litigation, including proceedings initiated by the US federal or state governments for waste disposal, site remediation costs and tort actions brought by private parties. The Group has been advised that it may be a responsible party at approximately 21 sites, of which 11 appear on the National Priority List created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund). These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the US Government for cleanup costs. In most instances, the Group is involved as an alleged generator of hazardous waste. Although Superfund provides that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs, these proceedings are frequently resolved on the basis of the nature and quantity of waste disposed of by the generator at the site. The Group's proportionate liability for cleanup costs has been substantially determined for 18 of the sites referred to above. The Group's potential liability varies greatly from site to site. While the cost of investigation, study and remediation at such sites could, over time, be signicant, the Group routinely accrues amounts related to its share of the liability for such matters.GSK Annual Report 2015 211Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationDirectors' statement of responsibilities in relation to the company's nancial statements The Directors are responsible for preparing the parent company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, nancial statements and the Remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and regulations. UK company law requires the Directors to prepare nancial statements for each nancial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the parent company nancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Under company law the Directors must not approve the parent company nancial statements unless they are satised that they give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, nancial position and prot or loss of the company for that period. In preparing those nancial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state with regard to the parent company nancial statements that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company nancial statements; prepare the nancial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufcient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the nancial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the parent company nancial statements and Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The parent company nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, comprising the balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2015 and supporting notes, are set out on pages 213 to 216 of this report. The responsibilities of the auditors in relation to the parent company nancial statements are set out in the Independent Auditors' report on page 212. The nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are included in the Annual Report, which is published in printed form and made available on our website. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report on our website in accordance with UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of nancial statements. Access to the website is available from outside the UK, where comparable legislation may be different. The Strategic Report and risk sections of the Annual Report, which represent the management report, include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.Disclosure of information to auditors The Directors in ofce at the date of this Annual Report have each conrmed that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information. This conrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. Going concern basis Having assessed the principal risks and other matters considered in connection with the viability statement, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the nancial statements. The UK Corporate Governance Code The Board considers that GlaxoSmithKline plc applies the principles and complies with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code maintained by the Financial Reporting Council, as described in the Corporate Governance section on pages 80 to 101. The Board further considers that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy. As required by the Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, the auditors have considered the Directors' statement of compliance in relation to those points of the UK Corporate Governance Code which are specied for their review.

What we have audited The nancial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise: the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2015; the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the nancial statements, which include a summary of signicant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the nancial statements. These are cross-referenced from the nancial statements and are identied as audited. The nancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the nancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 \"Reduced Disclosure Framework\". Other required reporting Consistency of other informationCompanies Act 2006 opinionIn our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the nancial year for which the nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the nancial statements. ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (\"ISAs (UK & Ireland)\") we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: materially inconsistent with the information in the audited nancial statements; or apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or otherwise misleading. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations receivedUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or the nancial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Responsibilities for the nancial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the Directors' statement of responsibilities set out on page 211, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the nancial statements and for being satised that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors. This report, including the opinion s, has been prepared for and only for the company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. What an audit of nancial statements involves We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the nancial statements sufcient to give reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signicant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial statements. We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors' judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the nancial statements. We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. In addition, we read all the nancial and non-nancial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. Other matter We have reported separately on the Group nancial statements of GlaxoSmithKline plc for the year ended 31 December 2015. The company has passed a resolution in accordance with section 506 of the Companies Act 2006 that the senior statutory auditor's name should not be stated.

Impairment of investments The carrying value of investments are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that the investment might be impaired. Any provision resulting from an impairment review is charged to the income statement in the year concerned. Share based payments The issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant over the company's shares, represents additional capital contributions by the company in its subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiaries results in a corres ponding increase in shareholders' equity. The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued, allocated over the underlying grant's vesting period. Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid applying tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the nancial statements. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable against future taxable prots. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted. Financial guarantees Liabilities relating to guarantees issued by the company on behalf of its subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value and amortised over the life of the guarantee. Legal and other disputes The company provides for anticipated settlement costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and legal and other expenses arising from claims against the company. At 31 December 2015 provisions for legal and other disputes amounted to \u00a340 million (2014 - \u00a325 million).GSK Annual Report 2015 215Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationF) Fixed assets - investments 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Shares in GlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited 613 613 Shares in GlaxoSmithKline Holdings (One) Limited 18 18 Shares in GlaxoSmithKline Holdings Limited 17 ,888 17 ,888 Shares in GlaxoSmithKline Mercury Limited 33 33 18,552 18,552 Capital contribution relating to share based payments 1,139 1,139 Contribution relating to contingent consideration 405 - 20,096 19,691 G) Trade and other receivables 2015 \u00a3m2014 \u00a3m Amounts due within one year: UK Corporation tax recoverable 201 205 Other receivables 41 3 Deferred tax recoverable - 205 Amounts owed by Group undertakings 5,977 10,055 6,219 10,468 Amounts due after more than one year:Amounts due by Group undertakings 416 432 6,635 10,900 The deferred tax balance of \u00a3205 million reported in 2014 and reversed in 2015 arose as a result of the recognition of a deferr ed tax asset on tax losses expected to be used following completion of the Novartis transaction on 2 March 2015.C) Key accounting judgements and estimates Legal and other disputes The company provides for anticipated settlement costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and legal and other expenses arising from claims against the company. These estimates take into account the specic circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgmental and could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each dispute progresses. The company's Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements. At 31 December 2015 provisions for legal and other disputes amounted to \u00a340 million (2014 - \u00a325 million). The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The position could change over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the company's nancial statements by a material amount.Contingent consideration Any contingent consideration included in the consideration payable for a business combination is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. These fair values are generally based on risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using appropriate interest rates. At 31 December 2015, the liability for contingent consideration amounted to \u00a3405 million on the acquisition of the Vaccines business from Novartis in 2015. The assumptions relating to future cash flows and discount rates are based on business forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental. Future events could cause the assumptions used in these projections to change with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the company. D) Operating prot A fee of \u00a312,053 (2014 - \u00a311,523) relating to the audit of the company has been charged in operating prot. E) Dividends The directors declared four interim dividends resulting in a dividend for the year of 80 pence, in line with the dividend for 2014. A special dividend of 20 pence has also been declared in the year. For further details, see Note 16 to the Group nancial statements, 'Dividends'.

The factors below are those that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We must adapt to and comply with a broad range of laws and regulations. These requirements apply to research and development, manufacturing, testing, approval, distribution, sales and marketing of Pharmaceutical, Vaccine and Consumer Healthcare products, and affect not only the cost of product development but also the time required to reach the market and the likelihood of doing so successfully. Moreover, as rules and regulati ons change, and governmental interpretation of those rules and regulations evolves, the nature of a particular risk may change. Changes to certain regulatory regimes may be substantial. Any change in, and any failure to comply with, applicable law and regulation could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Similarly, our business exposes us to litigation and government investigations, including but not limited to product liability litigation, patent and antitrust litigation and sales and marketing litigation. Litigation and government investigations, including related provisions we may make for unfavourable outcomes and increases in related costs such as insurance premiums, could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. More detail on the status and various uncertainties involved in our signicant unresolved disputes and potential litigation is set out in Note 45, 'Legal proceedings,' on pages 206 to 210. UK regulations require a discussion of the mitigating activities a company takes to address principal risks and uncertainties. A summary of the activities that the Group takes to manage each of our principal risks accompanies the description of each principal risk below. The principal risk factors and uncertainties are not listed in order of signicance. Risk denition Failure to appropriately collect, review, follow up, or report adverse events from all potential sources, and to act on any relevant ndings in a timely manner. Risk impact The impact of this risk is potentially to compromise our ability to conduct robust safety signal dete ction and interpretation and to ensure that appropriate decisions are taken with respect to the risk/benet prole of our products, including the completeness and accuracy of product labels and the pursuit of additional studies/analyses, as appropriate. This could lead to potential harm to patients, reputational damage, product liability claims or other litigation, governmental investigation, regulatory action such as nes, penalties or loss of product authorisation. Context Pre-clinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of investigational Pharmaceutical, Vaccine and Consumer Healthcare Products to determine the safety and efcacy of the products for use by humans. Notwithstanding the efforts we make to determine the safety of our products through appropriate pre-clinical and clinical trials, unanticipated side effects may become evident only when products are widely introduced into the marketplace. Questions may be raised not only by our ongoing safety surveillance and post-marketing studies but also by governmental agencies and third-parties that may analyse publicly available clinical trial results. The Group is currently a defendant in a number of product liability lawsuits, including class actions, that involve signicant claims for damages related to our products. Litigation, particularly in the US, is inherently unpredictable. Class actions that seek to sweep together all persons who were prescribed our products increase the potential liability. Claims for pain and suffering and punitive damages are frequently asserted in product liability actions and, if allowed, can represent potentially open-ended exposure and thus, could materially and adversely affect the Group's nancial results. Mitigating activities The Chief Medical Ofcer (CMO) is responsible for medical governance for the Group under a global policy. Under that policy, safeguarding human subjects in our clinical trials and patients who take our products is of paramount importance, and the CMO has the authoritative role for evaluating and addressing matters of human safety. Individual Medical Ofcers and the Group's substantial Global Safety and Pharmacovigilance organisation keep track of any adverse issues reported for our products during the course of clinical studies. Once a Group product is approved for marketing, the Group has an extensive post-marketing surveillance and signal detection system. Information on possible side effects of medicines is received from several sources including unsolicited reports from health professionals and patients, regulatory authorities, medical and scientic literature and the media. It is our policy that employees are required to report immediately any issues relating to the safety or quality of our products. Each of our country managers is responsible for monitoring, exception tracking and training that helps assure the collection of safety information and reporting the information to the relevant central safety department, in accordance with Group policy and legal requirements. Information that changes the benet/risk prole of one of the Group's medicines will result in certain actions to characterise, communicate and minimise the risk. Proposed actions are discussed with regulatory authorities and can include modifying the prescribing information, communications to physicians and other healthcare providers, restrictions on product prescribing/availability to help assure safe use, and sometimes carrying out further clinical trials. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to stop clinical trials or to withdraw the medicine from the market. The Group's Global Safety Board (GSB), comprising senior physicians and representatives of supporting functions, is an integral component of the system. The GSB (including subsidiary boards dedicated to Consumer Healthcare Products and Vaccines) reviews the safety of investigational and marketed products across the Group and has the authority to stop a clinical trial if continued conduct of such trial is not ethically or scientically justied in light of information that has emerged since the start of the trial. In addition to the medical governance framework within the Group as described above, the Group uses several mechanisms to foster the early evaluation, mitigation, and resolution of disputes as they arise and of potential claims even before they arise. The goal of the programmes is to create a culture of early identication and evaluation of risks and claims (actual or potential), in order to minimise liability and litigation. Patient safetyPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors232 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors - continued Risk denition Failure to appropriately secure and protect intellectual property rights. Risk impact Any failure to obtain or subsequent loss of patent protection, including reducing the availability or scope of patent rights or compulsory licensing (in which a government forces a manufacturer to license its patents for specic products to a competitor), could materially and adversely affect our nancial results in those markets. Absence of adequate patent or data exclusivity protection could limit the opportunity to rely on such markets for future sales growth for our products, which could also materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Context As an innovative Pharmaceutical, Vaccine and Consumer Healthcare Products company, we seek to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products. Our ability to obtain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights with regard to our products is critical to our business strategy and success. Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products are usually only protected from being copied by generic manufacturers during the period of exclusivity provided by an issued patent or related intellectual property rights such as Regulatory Data Protection or Orphan Drug status. Following expiration of certain intellectual property rights, a generic manufacturer may lawfully produce a generic version of the product. We operate in markets where intellectual property laws and patent ofces are still developing and where governments may be unwilling to grant or enforce intellectual property rights in a fashion similar to more developed regions such as the EU, Japan and the US. Some developing countries have limited, or threatened to limit, effective patent protection for pharmaceutical products in order to facilitate early competition within their markets from generic manufacturers. We face competition from manufacturers of proprietary and generic pharmaceutical products in all of our major markets. Introduction of generic products, particularly in the US where we have our highest turnover and margins, typically leads to a rapid and dramatic loss of sales and reduces our revenues and margins for our proprietary products. We depend on certain key products for a signicant portion of our sales. One such product is our respiratory pharmaceutical product Seretide/Advair which accounts for signicant Group sales worldwide. The timing and impact of entry in the US for a generic product containing the same combination of active substances as Seretide/Advair is uncertain. The US patent for compositions containing the combination of active substances in Seretide/Advair expired during 2010 although the US patent on a component of the Advair Diskus device continues until August 2016. Generic products containing the same combination of active substances as Seretide/ Advair (in both metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers) have been launched by several manufacturers in a number of European markets. The timing and impact of entry in the US and major markets in Europe for a 'follow-on' product to Seretide/Advair is uncertain. Generic drug manufacturers have also exhibited a readiness to market generic versions of many of our most important products prior to the expiration of our patents. Their efforts may involve challenges to the validity or enforceability of a patent or assertions that their generic product does not infringe our patents. As a result, we are and may continue to be involved in legal proceedings involving patent challenges, which may materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Moreover, in the US, it has become increasingly common for patent infringement actions to prompt claims that anti-trust laws have been violated during the prosecution of the patent or during litigation involving the defence of that patent. Such claims by direct and indirect purchasers and other payers are typically led as class actions. The relief sought may incl ude treble damages and restitution claims. Similarly, anti-trust claims may be brought by government entities or private parties following settlement of patent litigation, alleging that such settlements are anti-competitive and in violation of anti-trust laws. A successful anti-trust claim by a private party or government entity could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. The expiration dates for patents for our major products which may affect the dates on which generic versions of our products may be introduced are set out on pages 228 to 229. Legal proceedings involving patent challenges are set out in Note 45 to the nancial statements, 'Legal proceedings'. Mitigating activities Our Global Patents group focuses on securing and protecting our patent rights. This global group maintains internal processes designed to seek to ensure su ccessful procurement, enforcement and defence of our patents with the goal of maintaining exclusive rights in markets for our products. The Global Patents group monitors new developments in international patent law to seek to ensure appropriate protection of our assets. Sometimes acting through trade associations, we work with local governments to seek to secure effective and balanced intellectual property protection designed to meet the needs of patients and payers while supporting long-term investment in innovation. Intellectual propertyGSK Annual Report 2015 233Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationRisk denition Failure to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or inadequate controls and governance of quality in the supply chain covering supplier standards, manufacturing and distribution of products. Risk impact A failure to ensure product quality could have far reaching implications in terms of patient and consumer safety resulting in product launch delays, supply interruptions and product recalls which would have the potential to do damage to our reputation. Associated regulatory, legal, an d nancial con sequences could materially and adversely affect ou r reputation and nancial results. Context Patients, consumers and healthcare professionals trust the quality of our products. A failure to ensure product quality is an enterprise risk which is applicable across all of our business activities. Product quality may be influenced by many factors including product and process understanding, consistency of manufacturing components, compliance with GMP, accuracy of labelling, reliability of the external supply chain, and the embodiment of an overarching quality culture. The internal and external environment continues to evolve as new products, new markets and new legislation are introduced, with increasing scrutiny of supply continuity, a focus on improved distribution practice and the introduction of novel cell and gene based therapies. Review of inspections conducted across the industry by national regulatory authorities during 2015 highlighted an ongoing focus on data integrity, contamination prevention and the rigour of quality investigations including the robust ness of decision making and the timely escalation of pertinent issues to regulatory authorities. Mitigating activities We have developed and implemented a single Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS) that denes the quality standards and systems for our businesses associated with Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products and clinical trial materials. This system has a broad scope and is applicable throughout the lifecycle of products from R&D to mature commercial supply. There is no single external global quality standard or system which governs the lifecycle of medicinal products and requirements are often complex and fragmented across national and regional boundaries. The ICH guideline Q10: Pharmaceutical Quality Systems provides a model for a comprehensive quality framework which takes into account international quality concepts and is designed to be implemented through the product lifecycle. This framework has been adopted by GSK and is augmented with a consolidation of multiple regulatory requirements from across the world in order to seek to ensure that the GSK PQS meets external expectations for Product Quality in the markets supplied. The PQS is regularly updated to seek to ensure it keeps pace with external regulatory changes, and reflects both operational improvements and new scientic understanding to support the delivery of consistent and reliable products. An extensive global network of quality and compliance professionals is aligned with each business unit to provide oversight and assist with the delivery of quality performance and operational compliance, from site level to senior management level. Management oversight of those activities is accomplished through a hierarchy of Quality Councils and through an independent Chief Product Quality Ofcer and Global Product Quality Ofce. GSK has implemented a risk-based approach to assessing and managing our third-party suppliers that provide materials used in nished products. Contract manufacturers making our products are expected to comply with standards identied by GSK and are audited to help provide assurance that expected standards are met. All staff members are regularly trained to seek to ensure that cGMP standards and behaviours based on our GSK values are followed. Additionally, advocacy and communication programmes are routinely deployed to seek to ensure consistent messages are conveyed across GSK, whether they originate from changes in regulation or learnings from inspec tions or regulatory submissions. There is a continued emphasis on the value of quality performance metrics to facilitate improvement and foster a culture of 'right rst time'. Product quality 234 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationRisk denition Failure to comply with current tax law or incurring signicant losses due to treasury activities; failure to report accurate nancial information in compliance with accounting standards and applicable legislation; failure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships. Risk impact Non-compliance with existing or new nancial reporting and disclosure requirements, or changes to the recognition of income and expenses, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action and could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Changes in tax laws or in their application with respect to matters such as transfer pricing, foreign dividends, controlled companies, R&D tax credits, taxation of intellectual property or a restriction in tax relief allowed on the interest on intra-group debt, could impact our effective tax rate. Signicant losses may arise from inconsistent application of treasury policies, transactional or settlement errors, or counterparty defaults. Any changes in the substance or application of the governing tax laws, failure to comply with such tax laws or signicant losses due to treasury activities could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Failure to adequately manage third-party relationships could result in business interruption and exposure to risk ranging from sub-optimal contractual terms and conditions, to severe business sanctions and/or signicant reputational damage. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business operations and nancial results. Context The Group is required by the laws of various jurisdictions to disclose publicly its nancial results and events that could materially affect the nancial results of the Group. Regulators routinely review the nancial statements of listed companies for compliance with new, revised or existing accounting and regulatory requirements. The Group believes that it complies with the appropriate regulatory requirements concerning our nancial statements and disclosure of material information including any transactions relating to business restructuring such as acquisitions and divestitures. However, should we be subject to an investigation into potential non-compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements, this may lead to restatements of previously reported results and signicant penalties. Our Treasury group deals in high value transactions, mostly foreign exchange and cash management transactions, on a daily basis. The Group's effective tax rate reflects rates of tax in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates that are both higher and lower than the UK rate and take into account regimes that encourage innovation and investment in science by providing tax incentives which, if changed, could affect the Group's tax rate. The tax charge included in our nancial statements is our best estimate of tax liability pending audits by tax authorities. The worldwide nature of our operations and cross-border supply routes can be complex and can lead to questions on tax audit. There continues to be a signicant international focus on tax reform, including the OECD's 'BEPS' project and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed 'anti-BEPS' Directive and the increased use of scal state aid investigations. Together with domestic initiatives around the world, these may result in signicant changes to established tax principals and an increase in tax authority disputes. These, regardless of their merit or outcomes, can be costly, divert management attention and may adversely impact our reputation.Third parties are critical to our business delivery and are an integral part of the solution to improve our productivity, quality, service and innovation. We rely on third-parties, including suppliers, distributors, individual contractors, licensees, and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners for discovery, manufacture, and marketing of our products and important business processes. Third party business relationships present a material risk. For example, we share critical and sensitive information such as marketing plans, clinical data, and employee data with specic third parties who are conducting the relevant outsourced business operations. Inadequate protection or misuse of this information by third parties could have signicant business impact. Similarly, we use distributors and agents in a range of activities such as promotion and tendering which have inherent risks such as inappropriate promotion or corruption. Insufcient internal compliance and controls by the distributors could affect our reputation. These risks are further increased by the complexities of working with large numbers of third parties. Mitigating activities The Group maintains a control environment designed to identify material errors in nancial reporting and disclosure. The design and operating effectiveness of key nancial reporting controls are regularly tested by management and via independent business monitoring. This provides us with the assurance that controls over key nancial reporting and disclosure processes have operated effectively. We keep up-to-date with the latest developments in nancial reporting requirements by working with our external auditors and legal advisors. There is shared accountability for nancial results across our businesses. Financial results are reviewed and approved by regional management and then reviewed with the Financial Controller and the Chief Financial Ofcer (CFO). This allows our Financial Controller and our CFO to assess the evolution of the business over time, and to evaluate performance to plan. Signicant judgments are reviewed and conrmed by senior management. Business reorganisations and newly acquired activities such as Novartis acquired businesses and Oncology divestitures are integrated into risk assessments and appropriate controls and reviews have been applied. We introduced additional resources and monitoring to ensure that robust nancial controls were mainta ined during 2015, effectively managing risks while the initial phase of integrating the former Novartis' businesses into our control and reporting framework were implemented, and the ongoing transformation and upgrade to our nancial systems and processes continued. Additional risk mitigation was introduced by amending the programme timelines of the ongoing system upgrades. The Group maintains a Disclosure Committee reporting to the Board, which reviews the Group's quarterly results and Annual Report and determines throughout the year, in consultation with its legal advisors, whether it is necessary to disclose publicly information about the Group through Stock Exchange announcements. The Treasury Management Group (TMG) meets on a regular basis to seek to ensure that liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation risks are all managed in line with the conservative approach as detailed in the associated risk strategies and policies which have been adopted by the Board. Financial control and reportingPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors - continuedGSK Annual Report 2015 235Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOversight of Treasury's role in managing counterparty risk in line with agreed policy is performed by a Corporate Compliance Ofcer (CCO), who operates independently of Treasury. Further details on mitigation of Treasury Risks can be found on page 192, Note 41, 'Financial in struments and related disclosures'. Tax risk is managed by a set of policies and procedures to seek to ensure consistency and compliance with tax legislation. We seek to maintain open, positive relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. We monitor government debate on tax policy in our key jurisdictions to deal proactively with any potential future changes in tax law. We engage advisors and legal counsel to review tax legislation and the implications for our business. Where relevant we are active in providing relevant business input to tax policy makers. A centralised team of dedicated specialists are responsible for managing transactional tax reporting and compliance. We submit tax returns according to statutory time limits and engage with tax authorities to seek to ensure our tax affairs are current, entering into arrangements such as Continuous Audit Programmes and Advance Pricing Agreements to provide long-term certainty over tax treatment where appropriate. In exceptional cases where matters cannot be settled by agreement with tax authorities, we may have to resolve disputes through formal appeals or other proceedings. Each business unit leadership team retains ultimate accountability for managing third party interactions and risks. When working with third parties, all GSK employees are expected to manage external interactions and commitments resp onsibly. This expectation is embedded in our values and code of conduct. It is our responsibility that all activities are performed safely and in compliance with applicable laws and GSK's values, standards and code of conduct.To seek to guide and enforce our global principles for interactions with third parties we have in place a policy framework applicable to buying goods and services, managing our external spend, paying and working with our third parties. This policy framework applies to all employees and complementary workers worldwide. The framework is complemented by technical and local standards designed to seek to ensure alignment with the nature of third party interactions, such as good manufacturing practice and adherence to local laws and regulations. Independent business monitoring of key nancial and operational controls is in place and is supplemented by periodic checks from the company's independent Audit & Assurance function. Continuous monitoring and performance of third parties is enhanced through a Third Party Oversight team in the Global Ethics and Compliance organisation. This team commenced implementation of a global programme that takes an enterprise view of third party related risks, the programme is strengthening risk assessment and due diligence efforts on third parties and improving the overall management of our third party risks through the lifecycle of the third party engagement. Oversight for the programme is provided by the newly created global risk ofce within GSK's Global Ethics and Compliance group. Financial control and reporting continued236 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors - continued Risk denition Failure to prevent GSK employees and third parties not complying with our ABAC principles and standards, as well as with all applicable legislation. Risk impact Failure to mitigate this risk could expose the Group and associated persons to governmental investigation, regulatory action and civil and criminal liability, as well as damage the Group's reputation, shareholder value, and our licence to operate in particular jurisdictions, all of which could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Context We are exposed to bribery and corruption risk through our global business operations. In some markets, the government structure and the rule of law are less developed, and this has a bearing on our bribery and corruption risk exposure. In addition to the global nature of our business, the healthcare sector is highly competitive and subject to regulation. This increases the instances where we are exposed to activities and interactions with bribery and corruption risk. The US and UK authorities are leading extra-territorial ABAC enquiries into certain of the Group's operations. These investigations are discussed further in Note 45 'Legal proceedings'.Mitigating activities Our Code of Conduct, values and behaviours and commitment to zero tolerance are integral to how we mitigate this risk. In light of the complexity and geographic breadth of this risk, we constantly enhance our oversight of activities and data, reinforce to our employees and contractors clear expectations regarding acceptable behaviours, and maintain on-going communications between the Group centre headquarters and local markets. The Group has an enterprise-wide ABAC programme designed to respond to the threat and risk of bribery and corruption. It builds on the Group's values and existing standards to form a comprehensive and practical approach to compliance, and is flexible to the evolving nature of our business. For example, we scaled our acquisition ABAC due diligence specic to the 2015 Novartis transaction. Our ABAC programme is supported by: top-level commitment from the Group Board of Directors and leadership throughout the business; ongoing risk assessment; a global ABAC policy; and written standards that address commercial and other practices that give rise to ABAC risk; due diligence of high risk third parties; ongoing training and communications; a condential reporting line; monitoring of compliance and an investigations team. In addition, the programme mandates enhanced controls over interactions with government ofcials and when undertaking business development transactions. Programme governance is provided by the Group's ABAC Governance Board which includes representation from key functional areas and business units. Additionally, we have a dedicated ABAC team responsible for the implementation and evolution of the programme in response to developments in the internal and external environment. This is complemented with ABAC investigations, ABAC Audit and Independent Business Monitoring teams which have separate reporting lines. We continually benchmark our ABAC programme against other large multi-national companies and use external expertise to review and help improve elements of our ABAC programme. As a result of the China and other country investigations, the Group has increased resources in both its centrally located ABAC team as well as regional ABAC teams. During 2015, we also completed an ABAC review and reduced our presence in a number of high-risk markets.Anti-Bribery and CorruptionGSK Annual Report 2015 237Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationRisk denition Failure to execute business strategies, or manage competitive opportunities or threats effectively and in accordance with the letter and spirit of legal, industry or company requirements. Risk impact Failure to manage risks related to commercialisation could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow a diversied global business and deliver more products of value. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in governmental investigation, regulatory action and legal proceedings brought against the Group by governmental and private plaintiffs. Failure to provide accurate and complete information related to our products may result in incomplete awareness of the benet:risk prole of our products and possibly suboptimal treatment of patients and consumers. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect the Group. Any practices that are found to be misaligned with our values could also result in reputational damage and dilute trust established with key stakeholders. Context We operate on a global basis in an industry that is both highly competitive and highly regulated. Our competitors may make signicant product innovations and technical advances and may intensify price competition. In light of this competitive environment, continued development of commercially viable new products and the development of additional uses for existing products are critical to achieve our strategic objectives. Developing new pharmaceutical, vaccine and consumer healthcare products is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process, however, and a product candidate may fail at any stage, including after signicant Group economic and human resources have been invested. Our competitors' products or pricing strategies or any failure on our part to develop commercially successful products, or to develop additional uses for existing products, could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. We are committed to the ethical and responsible commercialisation of our products to support our mission to improve the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better, and live longer. To accomplish this mission, we engage the healthcare community in various ways to provide important information about our medicines. Promotion of approved products seeks to ensure that HCPs globally have access to information they need, that patients and consumers have access to the products they need and that products are prescribed, recommended or used in a manner that provides the maximum healthcare benet to patients and consumers. We are committed to communicating information related to our approved products in a responsible, legal, and ethical manner. At times, researchers, HCPs, healthcare organisations (HCOs) and other external experts that we engage may be compensated for services and expertise provided. However, payments must not be excessive and must never be or be perceived to be an inducement or reward for prescribing or recommending our products. Consistent with our ABAC policies, they also must comply with a market's ABAC laws if the recipient of any payment is a government ofcial. In 2012, we paid $3 billion (\u00a31.9 billion) to resolve government investigations in the US focused in large part on promotional practices and in 2014 we paid RMB 3 billion (\u00a3301 million), to resolve a government investigation in China focused on offering money or property to non-government personnel in order to obtain improper commercial gains.Mitigating activities Our strategic objectives are designed to ensure the Group achieves its mission of helping people do more, feel better and live longer. The Group continues to transform by strengthening our presence in key emerging markets, restructuring R&D, simplifying core business operations and reducing our manufacturing footprint. Our recent transaction with Novartis has helped further accelerate this pace of change, while strengthening our three core businesses: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. These changes are allowing us to be more global and more relevant to the needs of the world. Our aim is to reach as many patients and consumers as we can, improving their health and wellbeing through the use of our products. How we deliver this goal is just as important as what we achieve. Our values provide a guide for how we lead and make decisions. We constantly strive to do the right thing and deliver quality products, seeking to ensure our behaviours reflect our values and the mission of our company. The Corporate Executive Team has set out their shared objectives which describe the most important priorities we need to deliver across the Group and a set of enterprise-wide projects which are critical to achieving these objectives. The strategic objectives are cascaded throughout the Group to ensure enterprise-wide alignment. Processes are in place to regularly review achievement towards these objectives. We have taken action at all levels of the Group to enhance and improve standards and procedures for promotional interactions, based on our values of transparency, respect, integrity and patient focus. We have policies and standards governing promotional activities undertaken by the Group or on its behalf. All of these activities we conduct worldwide must conform to high ethical, regulatory, and industry standards. Where local standards differ from global standards, the more stringent of the two applies. The Group has harmonised policies and procedures to guide above country Commercial Practices processes as well as claried applicable standards when engaging in the markets. Commercial Practices activities have oversight from both business unit Risk Management and Compliance Boards (RMCBs) and Country Executive Boards (CEBs) that manage risks across in-country business activities. All promotional materials and activities must be reviewed and approved according to the Group's policies and standards, and conducted in accordance with local laws and regulations, to seek to ensure that these materials and activities fairly represent the products or services of the Group. When necessary, we have disciplined (up to and including termination) employees who have engaged in misconduct and have broadened our ability to claw back remuneration from senior management in the event of misconduct. In 2015, GSK also implemented globally changes already made in the US to the compensation model for sales professionals and their managers who interact with HCPs. The changes eliminate rewards based on sales or market shares in individuals' territories in favour of rewards based on the quality of the individuals' interactions with healthcare professionals. Starting in 2016, GSK will implement its prior commitment to stop paying HCPs to deliver promotional presentations for GSK or directly to sponsor their travel to medical educational conferences. Commercialisation238 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors - continued Risk denition Failure adequately to conduct ethical and sound preclinical and clinical research. In addition, failur e to engage in scientic activities that are consistent with the letter and spirit of the law, industry, or the Group's requirements. Risk impact The impacts of the risk include harm to patients, reputational damage, failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, governmental investigation, legal proceedings brought against the Group by governmental and private plaintiffs (product liability suits and claims for damages), and regulatory action such as nes, penalties or loss of product authorisation. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Context Research relating to animals can raise ethical concerns. While we attempt to proactively address this, animal studies remain a vital part of our research. In many cases, they are the only method that can be used to investigate the effects of a potential new medicine in a living body before it is tested in humans, and they are generally mandated by regulators and ethically imperative. Animal research can provide critical information about the causes of diseases and how they develop. Some countries require additional animal testing even when medicines have been approved for use elsewhere. Clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients are used to assess and demonstrate an investigational product's efcacy and safety or further evaluate the product once it has been approved for marketing. We also work with human biological samples. These samples are fundamental to the discovery, development and safety monitoring of our products. The integrity of our data is essential to success in all stages of the research data lifecycle: design, generation, recording and management, analysis, reporting and storage and retrieval. Our research data is governed by legislation and regulatory requirements. Research data and supporting documents are core components at various stages of pipeline progression decision-making and also form the content of regulatory submissions. Poor data integrity can compromise our research efforts. There are innate complexities and interdependencies required for regulatory lings, particularly given our global research and development footprint. Rapid changes in submission requirements in developing countries continue to increase the complexity of worldwide product registration. Scientic Engagement (SE) is an essential part of scientic discourse dened as the interaction and exchange of information between GSK and external communities in order to advance scientic and medical understanding, including the appropriate development and use of our products. Such non-promotional engagement with external stakeholder groups is vital to GSK's mission and necessary for scientic and medical advance. The scope of SE activities includes: advisory boards; scientic consultancies; pre-planned informal discussions with Healthcare Professionals (HCP); sharing medical information; publications (including abstracts to congresses); scientic interactions with payers, patients, governments and the media; and support for Independent Medical Education. Non-independent educational activities are covered by Commercial Practices (CP). SE activities are essential but present legal, regulatory, and reputational risk if the sharing of data, invited media coverage or payments for service providers has, or is perceived to have, inappropriate promotional intent. The risks are particularly high where HCP engagement and associated Financial and/or Transfer of Value disclosures are required by GSK.Mitigating activities We established an Ofce of Animal Welfare, Ethics and Strategy (OAWES), led by the Chief of Animal Welfare, Ethics and Strategy, to seek to ensure the humane and responsible care of animals and increase the knowledge and application of non-animal alternatives for the Group. OAWES embeds a framework of animal welfare governance, promotes application of 3Rs (replacement, renement and reduction of animals in rese arch), explores opportunities for cross-industry data sharing, an d conducts quality assessments. We report the results of our human subject research for our medicines and vaccines on our publicly accessible clinical study register website, on government-required repositories, and we submit human research results as manuscripts for publication in peer reviewed scientic journals. During 2015, we disclosed over 450 Clinical Study Reports of marketed and terminated medicines (once the research results were published in the scientic literature) on our register, bringing the total reports available to over 550. By the end of 2015, we listed over 1,700 clinical trials on the GSK online system, www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com, and have completed our commitment to list completed global studies conducted since the formation of GSK in 2000. The online system allows researchers to request access to anonymised patient-level data from the Group's clinical trials after the medicine has been approved or terminated and the trial has been published. We have a Global Human Biological Samples Management (HBSM) governance framework in place to oversee the ethical and lawful acquisition and management of human biological samples. Our global HBSM network champions HBSM activities and provides an experienced group to support internal Sample Custodians on best practice. It remains an important priority to enhance our data integrity controls. During 2015 we began work on a new written standard to seek to ensure the integrity of our data across Research and Development (R&D). A Data Integrity Committee was in place throughout the year to provide oversight and a Data Integrity Quality Assurance team began conducting assessments intended to provide independent business monitoring of our internal controls for R&D activities. The Chief Regulatory Ofcer oversees the activities of the Regulatory Governance Board which includes promoting compliance with regulatory requirements and Group-wide standards, making regulatory services more efcient and agile, and further aligning regulatory capabilities with our international business needs at the enterprise and local levels. The Group strictly prohibits promotional practices prior to marketing authorisation, and care is taken to seek to ensure that Scientic Engagement activity is not perceived to be promotional. Specic accountability and authorisation for Scientic Engagement resides within the Medical Governance framework that is overseen by the Medical Governance Executive Committee (MGEC), accountable to the Chief Medical Ofcer. MGEC is responsible for oversight of applicable Policies and seeking to ensure the highest level of integrity and continuous development of Scientic Engagement at GSK. This framework seeks to ensure the right level of accountability and clear programme guidance above country across R&D business units and in Local Operating Companies (LOC). The Group takes an integrated approach to managing both Scientic Engagement and Commercial Practi ces related risks, including a combined guidance document for Promotional Code and Scientic Engagement standards. In this way, those considerations and risks that are common to both Scientic Engagement and Commercial Practices such as ABAC and Healthcare Professionals (HCP) engagements are managed in the right context and in one place to seek to ensure clarity and clear lines of accountability.Research practicesGSK Annual Report 2015 239Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationRisk denition Failure to manage EHSS risks in line with our objectives and policies and with relevant laws and regulations. Risk impact Failure to manage EHSS risks could lead to signicant harm to people, the environment and communities in which we operate, nes, failure to meet stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements, litigation or regulatory action, and damage to the Group's reputation and could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Context The Group is subject to health, safety and environmental laws of various jurisdictions. These laws impose duties to protect people, the environment and the communities in which we operate as well as potential obligations to remediate contaminated sites. We have also been identied as a potentially responsible party under the US Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act at a number of sites for remediation costs relating to our use or ownership of such sites. Failure to manage these environmental risks properly could result in litigation, regulatory action and additional remedial costs that may materially and adversely affect our nancial results. See Note 45 to the nancial statements, 'Legal proceedings', for a discussion of the environmental related proceedings in which we are involved. We routinely accrue amounts related to our liabilities for such matters.Mitigating activities The Corporate Executive Team is responsible for EHSS governance for the Group under a global policy. Under that policy, the CET seeks to ensure there is a control framework in place to manage the risks, impacts and legal compliance issues that relate to EHSS and for assigning responsibility to senior managers for providing and maintaining those co ntrols. Individual managers seek to ensure that the EHSS control framework is effective and well implemented in their respective business area and that it is fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, adequately resourced, maintained, communicated, and monitored. Additionally, each employee is personally responsible for ensuring that all applicable local standard operating procedures are followed and expected to take responsibility for EHSS matters. Our risk-based, proactive approach is articulated in our refreshed Global EHS Standards which support our EHSS policy and objective to discover, develop, manufacture, supply and sell our products without harming people or the environment. In addition to the design and provision of safe facilities, plant and equipment, we operate rigorous procedures that help us eliminate hazards where practicable and protect employees' health and well-being. Through our continuing efforts to improve environmental sustainability we have reduced our value chain carbon intensity per pack, water consumption and waste generation. We actively manage our environmental remediation obligations and seek to ensure practices are environmentally sustainable and compliant. Our EHSS performance results are shared with the public each year in our Responsible Business Supplement. Risk denition Failure to protect and maintain access to critical or sensitive computer systems or information. Risk impact Failure to adequately protect critical and sensitive systems and information may result in loss of commercial or strategic advantage, damage to our reputation, litigation, or other business disruption including regulatory sanction, which could materially and adversely affect our nancial results. Context We rely on critical and sensitive systems and data, such as corporate strategic plans, sensitive personally identiable information, intellectual property, manufacturing systems and trade secrets. There is the potential that malicious or careless actions expose our computer systems or information to misuse or unauthorised disclosure. Several GSK employees were indicted for theft of GSK research information. While the charges against the individuals are concerning, based on what we know, we do not believe this breach has had any material impact on the company's R&D activity or ongoing business. GSK is conducting a full internal review into what occurred, and planning to continue to enhance the multiple layers of data protection that we already have in place.Mitigating activities The Group has a global information protection policy that is supported through a dedicated programme of activity. To increase our focus on information security, the Group established the Information Protection & Privacy function to provide strategy, direction, and oversight while enhancing our global information security capabilities. We assess changes in our information protection risk environment through briengs by government agencies, subscription to commercial threat intelligence services and knowledge sharing with other Pharmaceutical an d cross-industry companies. We aim to use industry best practices as part of our information security policies, processes and technologies and invest in strategies that are commensurate with the changing nature of the security threat landscape. We are also subject to various laws that govern the processing of Personally Identiable Information (Pll). the Group's Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) have been approved by the UK Information Commissioner's Ofce for human resource and research activities data. BCRs have been signed by 23 European states allowing us transfer PII internationally between the Group's entities without individual privacy agreements in each European Union country.Environment, health and safety and sustainability Information protection 240 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationPrincipal risks and uncertainties Risk factors - continued Risk denition Failure to deliver a continuous supply of compliant nished product; inability to recover and sustain critical operations, including key supply chains, following a disruption, or to respond to a crisis incident, in a timely manner. Risk impact We recognise that failure to supply of our products can adversely impact consumers and patients who rely on them. A material interruption of supply or exclusion from healthcare programmes could expose us to litigation or regulatory action, incurring of nes or disgorgement and materially and adversely affect the Group's nancial results. The Group's international operations, and those of its partners, maintain a vast global footprint also expose our workforce, facilities, operations and information technology to potential disruption resulting from a natural event (e.g. storm or earthquake), a man-made event (e.g. civil unrest, terrorism), or a global emergency (e.g. Ebola outbreak, Flu pandemic). It is important for GSK to have robust crisis management and recovery plans in place to manage such events. Context Our supply chain operations are su bject to review and approval by various regulatory agencies that effectively provide our licence to operate. Failure by our manufacturing and distribution facilities or by suppliers of key services and materials could lead to litigation or regulatory action such as product recalls and seizures, interruption of supply, delays in the approval of new products, and suspension of manufacturing operations pending resolution of manufacturing or logistics issues. Materials and services provided by third-party suppliers are necessary for the commercial production of our products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), antigens, intermediates, commodities and components necessary for the manufacture and packaging of many of our Pharmaceutical, Vaccine and Consumer Healthcare products. Some of the third-party services procured, such as services provided by contract manufacturing organisations and clinical research organisations to support development of key products, are important to ensure continuous operation of our businesses. Although we undertake business continuity planning, single sourcing of certain components, bulk API, nished products, and services creates a risk of failure of supply in the event of regulatory non-compliance or physical disruption at the manufacturing sites or logistics system. The failure of a small number of single-source, third-party suppliers or service providers to full their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory non-compliance or physical disruption of logistics and manufacturing sites may result in delays or service interruptions. Through effective crisis management and business continuity planning we are committed to providing for the health and safety of our people, minimising damage and impact to the Group, and maintaining functional operations following a natural or man-made disaster, or a public health emergency. Mitigating activities Our supply chain model is designed to seek to ensure the supply, quality and security of our products globally. We closely monitor, through the Supply Chain Governance Committees, the inventory status and delivery of our products to seek to ensure that our customers have the medicines, vaccines and products they need. The improved linkage between commercial forecasting and manufacturing made possible by our Core Commercial Cycle methodology should over time, decrease the risk associated with demand fluctuations impacting our ability to supply or write-offs associated with product exceeding expiry dating. During 2015, each node of the supply chain was optimised to seek to ensure adequate safety stock while balancing working capital associated with the end-to-end supply chain. Safety stocks and backup supply arrangements for medically- critical and high-revenue products are in place to help mitigate this risk. In addition, the compliance of manufacturing external suppliers is routinely monitored in order to identify and manage supply base risks. Where practical, dependencies on single sources of critical items are removed. Our reliance on single source components has been further reduced for certain key products through qualication of alternative materials that will help improve supply chain robustness. In cases, where dual sourcing is not possible, an inventory strategy has been developed to protect the supply chain from unanticipated disruption. We continued to implement anti-counterfeit systems such as product serialisation in accordance with emerging supply chain requirements around the world. CCM governance for the Group is set forth in a global policy. Under that policy, each business unit and functional area head ('BU') ensures effective crisis management and business continuity plans are in place that include authorised response and recovery strategies, key areas of responsibility and clear communication routes before a business disruption occurs. Additionally, each BU is represented on a CCM governance board which performs risk oversight and provides vital information to the CCM programme team regarding new threats, acquisitions or signicant business or organisational changes. A dedicated team of CCM experts supports the business. Their responsibilities include: chairing the governance board; coordinating crisis management and business continuity training; facilitating exercises and monitoring to provide for global consistency and alignment; and centrally storing and monitoring updates for plans supporting our critical business processes. These activities help ensure an appropriate level of readiness and response capability is maintained. We also develop and maintain partnerships with external bodies like the Business Continuity Institute and the UN International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction which helps improve our business continuity initiatives in disaster prone areas and supports the development of community resilience to disasters. We continue to evaluate the implications for our business of a possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. While the UK leaving the EU would create uncertainty and potentially add complexity to a wide range of our business activities, we do not currently believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the Group's results in the longer term. We continually improve our CCM risk management programme and tools based on learning from plan activations. For example, the Group has implemented a global system that provides GSK leaders with access to the vital information they need to effectively respond to disruptions and for monitoring the status of their preparedness and response capability. We regularly solicit and take recommendations for improvements from many different sources/suppliers charged with the responsibility for assisting in managing GSK's risks and introduce new tools to improve our CCM practices. Crisis and continuity managementGSK Annual Report 2015 241Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationShare capital and control Details of our issued share capital and the number of shares held in Treasury as at 31 December 2015 can be found in Note 33 to the nancial statements, 'Share capital and share premium account'. Our Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and are also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADS). Each ADS represents two Ordinary Shares. For details of listed debt and where it is listed refer to Note 31 to the nancial statements, 'Net debt'. Holders of Ordinary Shares and ADS are entitled to receive dividends (when declared), the company's Annual Report, to attend and speak at general meetings of the company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. There are no restrictions on the transfer, or limitations on the holding, of Ordinary Shares and ADS and no requirements to obtain approval prior to any transfers. No Ordinary Shares or ADS carry any special rights with regard to control of the company and there are no restrictions on voting rights. Major shareholders have the same voting rights per share as all other shareholders. There are no known arrangements under which nancial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares and no known agreements on restrictions on share transfers or on voting rights. Shares acquired through our share schemes and plans rank equally with the other shares in issue and have no special rights. The trustees of our Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts have waived their rights to dividends on shares held by those trusts. Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holdersOther than certain economic sanctions, which may be in force from time to time, there are currently no applicable laws, decrees or regulations restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of dividends or other payments to holders of the company's shares who are non-residents of the UK. Similarly, other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations relating only to non-residents of the UK under English law or the company's Articles of Association on the right to be a holder of, and to vote in respect of, the company's shares. Interests in voting rights Other than as stated below, as far as we are aware, there are no persons with signicant direct or indirect holdings in the company.

We have not acquired or disposed of any interests in our own shares during the period under review.Share buy-back programme The Board has been authorised to issue and allot Ordinary Shares under Article 9 of the company's Articles of Association. The power under Article 9 and the authority for the company to make purchases of its own shares are subject to shareholder authorities which are sought on an annual basis at our Annual General Meeting (AGM). Any shares purchased by the company may be cancelled or held as Treasury shares or used for satisfying share options and grants under Group employee share plans. Our programme covers purchases of shares for cancellation or to be held as Treasury shares, in accordance with the authority renewed by shareholders at the AGM in May 2015, when the company was authorised to purchase a maximum of just over 486 million shares. Details of shares purchased, those cancelled, and those held as Treasury shares are disclosed in Note 33 to the nancial statements, 'Share capital and share premium account'. In determining specic share repurchase levels, the company considers the development of free cash flow during the year. Given the impact of the sustained strength of Sterling on free cash flow, the company suspended its shar e repurchase programme during 2014 and no shares were purchased during the nancial year ended 2015. The company conrms that it does not currently intend to make any further market purchases in 2016. The company will review the potential for future share buy-backs during 2017 in line with its usual annual cycle and subject to return and ratings criteria.

Dividends remain an essential component of total shareholder return and the company is committed to increasing its dividend over the long-term. Details of the dividends declared, the amounts and the payment dates are given in Note 16 to the nancial statements, 'Dividends'. GSK completed a transaction with Novartis in March 2015, whereby GSK and Novartis created a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare business, GSK acquired Novartis' global Vaccines business and GSK divested its marketed Oncology portfolio and related R&D activities. GSK plans to use the net cash transaction proceeds to fund a return of approximately \u00a31 billion (20p per share) to shareholders via a special dividend to be paid with GSK's Q4 2015 ordinary dividend payment.

Dividend fee for ADR holders GSK introduced a dividend fee for ADR holders with effect from the Q1 2015 dividend payment, authorised under the terms of the amended and restated Deposit Agreement. A notice was provided to registered ADR holders on 6 April 2015. The fee was introduced to offset, in part, the costs related to SEC registration including Sa rbanes-Oxley related expenses, administration of the ADS Facility and the maintenance of our NYSE listing fees. The fee is expected to remain in place for future dividends. The annual fee is currently set at $0.02 per ADR (or $0.005 per ADR per quarter).

It is not a complete analysis of all the possible tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or sale of these securities. It is intended only as a general guide. Holders are advised to consult their advisers with respect to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or sale of their shares or ADR and the consequences under state and local tax laws in the US and the implications of the current UK/US tax conventions. US holders of ADR generally will be treated as the owners of the underlying shares for the purposes of the current US/UK double taxation conventions relating to income and gains (Income Tax Convention), estate and gift taxes (Estate and Gift Tax Convention), and for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). UK shareholders This summary only applies to a UK resident shareholder that holds shares as capital assets. Taxation of dividends Different regimes apply to the taxation of dividend income payable to UK resident individuals in UK tax years up to 5 April 2016 and to those tax years commencing on or after 6 April 2016. For UK tax years up to and including 2015/16, UK resident shareholders will generally be subject to UK income tax on the full amount of dividends paid, grossed up for the amount of a tax credit. The tax credit may be set against the individual's income tax liability in respect of the gross dividend, but is not repayable to shareholders with a tax liability of less than the associated tax credit. To the extent that individuals' income exceeds the basic rate limit, but not the higher rate limit an upper dividend rate applies, which is set at 32.5% of the grossed up dividend gure and for those whose income exceeds the additional rate limit of \u00a3150,000, an additional dividend rate of 37.5% will normally apply. For UK tax years from 2016/17 onwards, dividend tax credits will no longer apply and UK resident individuals will be entitled instead to a dividend tax allowance of up to \u00a35,000, so that the rst \u00a35,000 of dividends received in a tax year will be free of tax. Dividends in excess of this allowance will be taxed at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers. UK resident shareholders that are corporation taxpayers should note that dividends payable on ordinary shares are generally entitled to exemption from corporation tax. Taxation of capital gains UK shareholders may be liable for UK tax on gains on the disposal of shares or ADR. For disposals by individuals and subject to the availability of any exemption or relief such as the annual exempt amount, a taxable capital gain accruing on a disposal of shares or ADR will be taxed at 28% if, after all allowable deductions, such shareholders' taxable income for the tax year exceeds the basic rate income tax limit. In other cases, a taxable capital gain accruing on a disposal of shares or ADR may be taxed at 18% or 28% or at a combination of both rates. Corporation taxpayers may be entitled to an indexation allowance which applies to reduce capital gains to the extent that such gains arise due to inflation. Indexation allowance may reduce a chargeable gain but will not create an allowable loss. Inheritance tax Individual (UK-domiciled or otherwise) shareholders may be liable to UK inheritance tax on the transfer of shares or ADR. Tax may be charged on the amount by which the value of the shareholder's estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way of lifetime gift or other disposal at less than full market value. In the case of a bequest on death, tax may be charged on the value of the shares at the date of the shareholder's death. If such a gift or other disposal were subject to both UK inheritance tax and US estate or gift tax, the Estate and Gift Tax Convention would generally provide for tax paid in the US to be credited against tax payable in the UK. Stamp duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) will, subject to certain exemptions, be payable on the transfer of shares at a rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the nearest \u00a35 in the case of stamp duty) of the consideration for the transfer. Notwithstanding this, provided that an instrument is executed in pursuance of the agreement that gave rise to the charge to SDRT and that instrument is stamped within six years of the agreement (including being stamped as exempt) any SDRT charge should be cancelled and any SDRT which has already been paid will be repaid. US shareholders This summary only applies to a shareholder (who is a citizen or resident of the US or a domestic corporation or a person that is otherwise subject to US federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the shares or ADR) that holds shares or ADR as capital assets, is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes and does not hold shares for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation that is carried on in the UK through a branch or agency. The summary also does not address the tax treatment of holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold shares or ADR as part of an integrated investment (including a 'straddle') comprised of a share or ADR and one or more other positions, and persons that own (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of the voting stock of the company, nor does it address tax treatment that may be applicable as a result of international income tax treaties.GSK Annual Report 2015 245Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationTaxation of dividends The gross amount of dividends received is treated as foreign source dividend income for US tax purposes. It is not eligible for the dividend received deduction allowed to US corporations. Dividends on ADR are payable in US dollars; dividends on shares are payable in pounds Sterling. Dividends paid in pounds Sterling will be included in income in the US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate on the day the dividends are received by the holder. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term or hedged positions, an individual eligible US holder will be subject to US taxation at a maximum rate of 23.8% in respect of qualied dividends. A qualied dividend as dened by the US Internal Revenue Service is a dividend that meets the following criteria: 1. Must be issued by a US corporation, a corporation incorporated in a US possession, or a corporation that is eligible for the benets of a comprehensive income tax treaty deemed satisfactory, as published by the IRS. 2. The dividends are not listed with the IRS as dividends that do not qualify. 3. The required dividend holding period has been met. The shares must have been owned by you for more than 60 days of the \"holding period\" - which is dened as the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date, or the day in which the stock trades without the dividend priced in. For example, if a stock's ex-dividend date is October 1, the shares must be held for more than 60 days in the period between August 2 and November 30 of that year in order to count as a qualied dividend. Dividends that are not qualied are subject to taxation at the US federal graduated tax rates, at a maximum rate of 43.4%. Some types of dividends are automatically excluded from being qualied dividends, even if they meet the other requirements. These include (but are not limited to): 1. Capital gains distributions 2. Dividends on bank deposits 3. Dividends held by a corporation in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 4. Dividends paid by tax-exempt corporations US state and local tax rates on qualied and non-qualied dividends may vary and would be assessed in addition to the federal tax rates communicated above .Taxation of capital gains Generally, US holders will not be subject to UK capital gains tax, but will be subject to US tax on capital gains realised on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADR. Such gains will be long-term capital gains (subject to reduced rates of taxation for individual holders) if the shares or ADR were held for more than one year, from the date the shares were vested/released. Short-term capital gains can be subject to taxation of rates of up to 43.4%, whereas long-term capital gains may be subject to rates of up to 23.8%. State and local tax rates on capital gains may also apply. Information reporting and backup withholding Dividends and payments of the proceeds on a sale of shares or ADR, paid within the US or through certain US-related nancial intermediaries are subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless the US holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or provides a taxpayer identication number and certies that no loss of exemption has occurred. Non-US holders generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certication of their non-US status in connection with payments received. Any amounts withheld will be allowed as a refund or credit against a holder's US federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. Estate and gift taxes Under the Estate and Gift Tax Convention, a US shareholder is not generally subject to UK inheritance tax. Stamp duty UK stamp duty and/or SDRT will, subject to certain exemptions, be payable on any transfer of shares to the ADR custodian or depository at a rate of 1.5% of the amount of any consideration provided (if transferred on sale), or their value (if transferred for no consideration). However, no stamp duty or SDRT should be payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADR. 246 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationShareholder services and contacts Registrar The company's registrar is:Equiniti Spencer (outside the UK) Equiniti provides a range of services for shareholders: Service What it offers How to participate Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)As an alternative to receiving cash dividends you may choose to reinvest your dividends to buy more GSK shares.

This will outline GSK's approach to, and performance in, our key responsible business areas, Health for all, Our behaviour, Our people and Our planet.248 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOther statutory disclosures US law and regulation A number of provisions of US law and regulation apply to the company because our shares are quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs. NYSE rules In general, the NYSE rules permit the company to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the US, provided that we explain any signicant variations. This explanation is contained in our Form 20-F, which can be accessed from the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) EDGAR database or via our website. NYSE rules that came into effect in 2005 require us to le annual and interim written afrmations concerning the Audit & Risk Committee and our statement on signicant differences in corporate governance. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Following a number of corporate and accounting scandals in the US, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Sarbanes-Oxley is a wide-ranging piece of legislation concerned largely with nancial reporting and corporate governance. As recommended by the SEC, the company has established a Disclosure Committee. The Committee reports to the CEO, the CFO and to the Audit & Risk Committee. It is chaired by the Company Secretary and the members consist of senior managers from nance, legal, corporate communications and investor relations. External legal counsel, the external auditors and internal experts are invited to attend its meetings periodically. It has responsibility for considering the materiality of information and, on a timely basis, determining the disclosure of that information. It has responsibility for the timely ling of reports with the SEC and the formal review of the Annual Report and Form 20-F. In 2015, the Committee met 14 times. Sarbanes-Oxley requires that the annual report on Form 20-F contain a statement as to whether a member of our Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) is an audit committee nancial expert as dened by Sarbanes-Oxley. Such a statement for each of the relevant members of the ARC (Stacey Cartwright and Judy Lewent) is included in the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 89 and in their biographies on page 76. Additional disclosure requirements arise under section 302 and section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley in respect of disc losure controls and procedures and internal control over nancial reporting. Section 302: Corporate responsi bility for nancial reports Sarbanes-Oxley also introduced a requirement for the CEO and the CFO to complete formal certications, conrming that: they have each reviewed the annual report on Form 20-F based on their knowledge, the annual report on Form 20-F contains no material misstatements or omissions based on their knowledge, the nancial statements and other nancial information fairly present, in all material respects, the nancial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented in the annual report on Form 20-F they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that ensure that material information is made known to them, and have evaluated the effectiveness of these controls and procedures as at the year-end, the results of such evaluation being contained in the annual report on Form 20-F they are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over nancial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliabilit y of nancial reporting and the preparation of nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles they have disclosed in the annual report on Form 20-F any changes in internal controls over nancial reporting during the period covered by the annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, the company's internal control over nancial reporting, and they have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of internal control over nancial reporting, to the external auditors and the ARC, all signicant deciencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over nancial reporting which are reasonably likely to affect adversely the company's ability to record, process, summarise and report nancial information, and any fraud (regardless of materiality) involving persons that have a signicant role in the company's internal control over nancial reporting. The Group has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures as at 31 December 2015. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and proced ures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. The CEO and CFO expect to complete these certications and report their conclusions on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures in March 2016, following which the certicates will be led with the SEC as part of our Group's Form 20-F. Section 404: Management's annual report on internal control over nancial reportingIn accordance with the requirements of section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the following report is provided by management in respect of the company's internal control over nancial reporting (as dened in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934): management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over nancial reporting for the Group. Internal control over nancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of nancial reporting and the preparation of nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over nancial reporting based on the framework, Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) there have been no changes in the Group's internal control over nancial reporting during 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, the Group's internal control over nancial reporting management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over nancial reporting as at 31 December 2015 and its conclusion will be led as part of the Group's Form 20-F, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has audited the consolidated nancial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015, has also assessed the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over nancial reporting under Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their audit report will be led with the Group's Form 20-F. GSK Annual Report 2015 249Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationSection 13(r) of the US Securities Exchange Act Section 13(r) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires issuers to make specic disclosure in their annual reports of certain types of dealings with Iran, including transactions or dealings with government-owned entities, as well as dealings with entities sanctioned for activities related to terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, even when those activities are not prohibited by US law and do not involve US persons. The Group does not have a legal entity based in Iran, but it does export certain pharmaceutical and vaccine products to Iran, via sales by non-US entities, to two privately held Iranian distributors. The Group also does business, via non-US entities, in other jurisdictions targeted by sanctions laws, including Syria, Crimea, North Korea and Sudan. We do not believe that any of the Group's direct dealings with Iran require specic disclosure under these requirements, and the Group limits sales to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba to essential medicines (determined in part using criteria set by the World Health Organization). The Group has no direct knowledge of the identity of its distributors' downstream customers in Iran, and it is possible that these customers include entities, such as government-owned hospitals and pharmacies, that are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government or by persons or entities sanctioned in connection with terrorism or proliferation activities. Because the Group has no direct knowledge of its distributors' customers, it cannot establish the proportion of gross revenue or sales potentially attributable to entities afliated with the Iranian government or parties sanctioned for disclosable activities. As a result, the Group is reporting the entire gross revenues (\u00a3nil) and net losses (\u00a30.41 million) from the Group's sales to Iran in 2015. The Group is also aware that some hospitals or other medical facilities in Lebanon may be afliated with or controlled by Hezbollah, which is designated by the United States as a terrorist organisation. Again, the Group does not deal directly with such facilities and sells through distributors. The Group is also unable to identify with certainty the degree or nature of any afliation of the end customers with Hezbollah, and the Group is unable to establish the proportion of gross revenue or sales potentially attributable to reportable entities. As a result, the Group is reporting the entire gross revenues (\u00a337 million) and net prots (\u00a315 million) from the Group's sales to Lebanon in 2015. Donations to political organisations and political expenditure With effect from 1 January 2009, to ensure a consistent approach to political contributions across the Group, we introduced a global policy to stop voluntarily all corporate political contributions. In the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015, the Group did not make any political donations to EU or non-EU organisations. Notwithstanding the introduction of this policy, in accordance with the Federal Election Campaign Act in the US, we continue to support an employee-operated Political Action Committee (PAC) that facilitates voluntary political donations by eligible GSK employees. The PAC is not controlled by GSK. Decisions on the amounts and recipients of contributions are made by participating employees exercising their legal right to pool their resources and make political contributions, which are subject to strict limitations. In 2015, a total of US$446,727 (2014 - US$525,900) was donated to political organisations by the GSK employee PAC. At the AGM in May 2001, shareholders rst authorised the company to make donations to EU political organisations and to incur EU political expenditure, under the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, of up to \u00a3100,000 each year. This authority has since been renewed annually. The Companies Act 2006 requires companies to continue to obtain shareholder approval before they can make donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure. However, we do not make and do not intend to make donations to political parties or independent election candidates, nor do we make any donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure. The denitions of political donations, political expenditure and political organisations used in the legislation are very wide. In particular, the denition of EU political organisations may extend to bodies such as those concerned with policy review, law reform, the representation of the business community and special interest groups such as those concerned with the environment, which the company and its subsidiaries might wish to support. As a result, the denitions may cover legitimate business activities not in the ordinary sense considered to be political donations or political expenditure. Such activities are not designed to support any political party or independent election candidate. The authority which the Board has sought annually is a precautionary measure to ensure that the company and its subsidiaries do not inadvertently breach the legislation.250 GSK Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor informationGroup companies In accordance with Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 a full list of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and joint arra ngements, the country of incorporation and effective percentage of equity owned, as at 31 December 2015 are disclosed below.

Forward-looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'will', 'project', 'plan', 'believe' and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or nancial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and nancial result s. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes and/or les with the SEC. All readers, wherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factors that are beyond the Group's control or precise estimate. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under 'Risk factors' on pages 231 to 240 of this Annual Report. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the knowledge and information available to the Directors on the date of this Annual Report. A number of adjusted measures are used to report the performance of our business. These measures are dened on page 54 and a reconciliation of core results to total results is set out on page 62. The information in this document does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to buy shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc or an invitation or inducement to engage in any other investment activities. Past performance cannot be relied upon as a guide to future performance. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a prot forecast. Assumptions related to 2016-2020 outlook In outlining the expectations for the ve-year period 2016- 2020, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and nancial benets from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. For the Group specically, over the period to 2020 GSK expects further declines in sales of Seretide/Advair . The introduction of a generic alternative to Advair in the US has been factored into the Group's assessment of its future performance. The Group assumes no premature loss of exclusivity for other key products over the period. The Group's expectation of at least \u00a36 billion of revenues per annum on a CER basis by 2020 from products launched in the last three years includes contributions from the current pipeline asset Shingrix . This target is now expected to be met up to two years earlier. The Group also expects volume demand for its products to increase, particularly in Emerging Markets. The assumptions for the Group's revenue and earnings expectations assume no material mergers, acquisitions, disposals, litigation costs or share repurchases for the Company; and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare or Consumer Healthcare. They also assume no material changes in the macro-economic and healthcare environment.
