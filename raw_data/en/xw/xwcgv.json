Myles Young , The Rock Church, Elk Grove, CA COVID -19 Vaccine: Facts for the Community andFaith -Based Organizations Introduction and Comments Myths about COVID -19 Vaccine Q&A Closing Remarks MYTH 1: You can delay routine vaccinations until the pandemic is over. You shouldn't postpone your vaccinations. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 2: The COVID -19 vaccines were developed too fast to be safe. The technology used to develop the new COVID -19 vaccines is not new. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 3: There were not enough participants in the clinical trials to declare the vaccines safe. Both COVID -19 vaccines enrolled tens of thousands of participants, many of whom were followed for two months after receiving the second dose, as is common with other vaccine trials. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 4: I already had COVID -19, so I do not need the vaccine. It's not clear how long a natural infection with COVID -19 provides immunity from the disease. There are reports of individuals becoming reinfected with the virus. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 5: COVID -19 vaccines were developed to deliver a microchip into my body. There is not a microchip in the vaccine. This false rumor started after comments were made about digital vaccine records. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 6: The vaccine will alter my DNA. This is not possible. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work in the cell's cytoplasm and never enter the cell nucleus, where the DNA, your genetic material, lives. Submit question in the Q & A featureIs the COVID -19 vaccine safe? All the COVID -19 vaccines being used have gone through rigorous studies to ensure they are as safe as possible. Systems that allow CDC to watch for safety issues are in place across the entire country. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat are the side effects of the COVID -19 vaccine? You may have pain and swelling at the injection site and experience fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. Side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Submit question in the Q & A featureIs there a risk of severe allergic reaction if I receive the vaccine? Serious problems from vaccination can happen, but they are rare. Submit question in the Q & A featureDo the COVID -19 vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue? No, the COVID -19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, Pfizer and Moderna did perform confirmation tests (to ensure the vaccines work) using fetal cell lines. Fetal cell lines are not the same as fetal tissue. Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from elective abortions in the 1970s and 1980s. No fetal cell lines were used to manuf acture the vaccine, and they are not inside the injection you receive. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhich lasts longer, immunity after getting COVID -19 or protection from COVID -19 vaccines? We don't know how long natural immunity might last. Current evidence suggests that getting the virus again (reinfection) is uncommon in the 90 days after the first infection with the virus that causes COVID -19. We won't know how long immunity lasts after vaccination until we have more data on how well COVID -19 vaccines work in real -world conditions. Submit question in the Q & A featureCan you get Covid -19 once you get the vaccine? It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID -19) after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. Submit question in the Q & A featureHow can people trust the vaccine in underprivileged communities with the history of being mistreated and tested on in the past? The choice to be vaccinated for COVID -19 is a personal one. I t's vital to have a relationship with your primary care physician and to ask questions and raise concerns until you have answers that allow you to make a good decision for yourself. Submit question in the Q & A featureExplain eschatology and what does it have to do with the COVID -19 vaccine? Eschatolgoy is the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind. Many within the religious community believe that a global vaccination leads us one step closer to a one-world government. Submit question in the Q & A featureIf I take the vaccine am I also accepting the mark of the beast? According to the bible the mark of the beast is a number. Receiving this vaccine does not equate to accepting the mark of the beast.
