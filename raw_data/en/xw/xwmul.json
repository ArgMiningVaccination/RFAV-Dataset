Herbal Dosing Guides Herbal medicines offer profound benefits in their capacity to both prevent and treat illness and disease and I believe that the safe integration of herbs into our life can transform our health and wellbeing. This is a view consistent with most traditional systems of medicine, including Ayurveda, which recommend that we support our mind and body with herbs on a daily basis to keep us strong, balanced and healthy. l. Herbal Dosing When it comes to deciding upon the optimal dose for using herbs, it is important to break this down into l) chronic dosing and 2) acute dosing, as explored in more detail below: Chronic Dosing This refers to the daily use of herbs on a long-term basis with the aim of enhancing health and treating/preventing chronic long term disorders. For example, you may decide to take Ashwaghanda on a daily basis to support immunity or increase energy, even though you are fit and well and are not suffering with any illness or disease. Or you may head over to the Ailment Management Plans on the Ayurvedic Mentor website because you have arthritis and implement the herbal treatment plan listed there and use this for several months or even indefinitely. These are examples of long-term chronic dosing. When using herbs in such a way, the following dosing guidelines apply; Tinctures: If using herbal tinctures then the maximum daily dose equals 20mls per day, administered as 5mls four times a day. This could be 20mls of one herb, l0mls of two herbs or 5mls of four herbs. Thus irrespective of how many herbs you are using, this 20mls per day ceiling applies. This also comes with the explicit assumption that you are using l:3 strength tinctures. These dosing guidelines apply ONLY to a 1:3 strength tincture, this is very important. Capsules/Powders: If using dried herbal powders or capsules, the maximum daily dose equals 6000mg per day. Thus as per the tinctures above, this could be 6000mg of one herb, 3000mg of two herbs or 2000mg of three herbs. Combining Tinctures and Powders: You can take tinctures and capsules alongside each other. The easiest way to do this is to work in percentages. So for example if you are taking 10ml of a tincture a day then you are using 50% of your maximum dose, so you would then need to take no more than 3000mg of a dried herbal powder. Acute Dosing This refers to the management of acute ailments such as a cold and other respiratory infections, urinary infections or headaches. Because these are acute and short lived ailments, higher doses of herbs used for shorter periods of time are required to effectively reduce the symptoms and speed up recovery time, using the following guidelines: Tinctures: If using herbal tinctures then the maximum acute daily dose equals 40mls per day. This could be 40mls of one herb, 20mls of two herbs or l0mls of four herbs. Because of the higher daily dose in comparison to the daily chronic tincture dose above, it is recommended to administer the tincture in smaller doses more regularly, ideally as 2.5mls every two hours. Thus irrespective of how many herbs you are using, this 40mls per day maximum applies. This also comes with the explicit assumption that you are using 1:3 strength herbs. These dosing guides do not apply to different strength tinctures. Capsules/Powders: If using dried herbal powders or capsules, the maximum acute daily dose equals 20g per day. Thus as per the tinctures above, this could be 20g of one herb, 10g of two herbs or 5g of four herbs. Combining Tinctures and Powders: You can take tinctures and capsules alongside each other. The easiest way to do this is to work in percentages. So for example if you are dosing an acute infection and you are taking 10ml of a tincture a day then you are using 25% of your maximum dose, so you would then need to take no more than 15g of a dried herbal powder. Important Points About Acute Dosing: 1. Acute doses are to be used for a maximum of 14-days; if the symptoms don't improve within 72 hours of treatment, please visit your GP for a full assessment. 11. If using a chronic dose and then you need to implement an acute dose, you need to stop taking the chronic dose whilst taking the acute dose. Once the acute ailment has cleared and the acute dose has stopped, you can then re-start the chronic dose. Other Key Points: 1. All the herbal information contained within this document specifically, and in the Ayurvedic Mentor generally, applies exclusively to adults aged 18 years or older. None of the approaches are to be used in under 18's. 2. Likewise, if you are taking any form of prescription medication, have any health concerns, are under medical supervision, are pregnant or breast feeding or have any form of liver or kidney disease, please seek a one to one consultation with a medical professional to ensure you are safely integrating herbal medicines. - evening everyone i hope you guys are all well um so weekly wisdom wednesday as usual um and tonight i did a short post earlier on this afternoon just to flag up yeah really important um topic i suppose tonight because something we wanted to talk about for a while um because it's an important area to talk about and to discuss and to cover and it's talking about we're looking at herbal dosing okay looking at herbal dose and looking at how we herbal look at how we hurt how we dose um herbs looking at what the maximum dosage range is for different in different contexts looking at how we dose for acute problems and chronic problems um and and and just going for you uh uh through a few points okay hi marcia hi laura i hope you guys are all well i'm assuming everyone can hear me okay hopefully i'm nice and clear um so obviously this video will go up onto the we'll put the recording of this video up onto the weekly wisdom tab in the in the the uh mentor website so you can refer back to it um hi rachel hope you're well so you know herbal medicines you know you know for me herbal medicines are such a foundation of health you know the capacity of herbal medicines to prevent illness um to treat illness to you just to help keep our body you know balanced and strong and healthy and robust and if you look at most well actually all as far as i can tell all traditional systems of medicine ayurveda traditional chinese medicine tibetan medicine traditional european medicine they all without exception advocate the use of herbal medicines as you know daily using herbs on a daily basis to keep ourselves strong in the same way that we should eat good food every day and we should move our bodies every day we should get sleep sleep good sleep every day we should be using herbs to support robust health and you know the evidence around the impact of herbs to do that is profound you know um and because of that you know we obviously talk about herbs a lot in on the ayurvedic mental we get probably more questions about herbs than anything else on the website on the iu vedic mental facebook page and also directly to us via email so i just wanted to clear up a few things because you know in terms of the i guess the consistency that we're seeing in some of the questions we're being asked okay so hi linda uh hi haley i hope you guys are all well so with herbal medicines in the same way that it there is for all medicines obviously the the key thing is dosage okay so even though the best herb the best medicine can either be profoundly healing or profoundly harmful depending upon how you're using it why you're using it and the dose you're using at you know if you think about something you know bog standard like neurofem or paracetamol you take two capsules it's brilliant it takes away your pain take 20 capsules and it could kill you okay so it's the same as herbal medicines used properly they're profoundly health promoting used irresponsibly they can cause damage um having said that there's been extensive international reviews of herbal medicine and the last one the last big one that i saw was in 2017 and the conclusion was that only one person um has died from misusing herbal medicine so we've got to put it into context but it's just important to be clear on a few points here okay um so when we're using herbs when we're using herbal medicines we've ultimately got two decisions we have to ask yeah we have to we have to base out our actions on we've got two different trajectories the first trajectory is the chronic long-term use of of herbs and the second trajectory is the acute short-term use of herbs and those two things are fundamentally different okay and we're gonna go through them individually and look at the dosing looking at you know why why it's so important to be aware of why you're using herbs because you know right now i'm not sick i haven't got any illnesses i haven't got any diseases i haven't got a cold i haven't got any infections so but i'm still using herbs you know like i said all lots of talks i've done you know i say i take you know i take 2 000 milligrams of ashwagandha every day and always have done and always will do until my dying day i have you know a good couple of teaspoons of turmeric um in in my porridge and in drinks i have a couple of cups of herbal tea um you know i use herbs you know uh liberally in in cooking um and that's not done to treat an illness you know if i've got if i had a really bad cold yes i'd be on the echinacea and the angiographician the elderberry and this that and the other so the the thing about chronic using herbs in a chronic in a chronic sense is that you can use herbs every day every day long term to keep yourself fit and well to prevent illness setting in like i just explained for me or you can use herbs chronically to treat a chronic ailment so if i had osteoarthritis you know or fibromyalgia something that's not gonna disappear so it's not gonna go away overnight i would be using herbal medicines to manage that pathology that ailment okay so i'd be using a herbal protocol for managing arthritis often managing fibromyalgia so when i'm talking about chronic dosing i'm not it doesn't just mean for treating an illness it could be preventative or it could be intervention it doesn't matter the key thing is that the herbs you're using every day on a long term basis okay that's the key thing we're talking about the chronicity of dosing is something we're using you know indefinitely or for a long in a long-term manner okay um so in the same way you know you might be and i'm sure and i know from the comments on the facebook page and quite a lot of you guys are using herbs in that capacity you might you might find that you know you want to keep your immune system strong or you might want to be tapping into the infection preventing benefits of ashwagandha and you might be using that every day or you might you know you might have headache headed over to the ailment management plan section of the of the website and you might be mobilizing some of the treatment protocols in there in a chronic way okay so that's fine so if you're using herbs in a chronic manner like that the the two things we need to focus on are are we using tinctures or are we using dry powders or capsules so wet herbs or dry herbs um and you know there's there's always i was just saying to holly actually earlier on today when we were talking about this i remember being in a a meeting when i was working at southampton in the integrative medicine department you know um with a group of experts talking about herbal dosing and this you know there was even that level of expertise and knowledge these guys you know having 30 40 years of experience there's still this debate around maximal dosing how high can we go for how long but there is a general consensus there's a general consensus around what the upper limit is on dosing herbs in a chronic manner okay and that's what i want to talk about now so if we're using herbs chronically every day like i've just said if we're using tinctures if we're using wet herbs liquid herbs the upper daily limit is 20 mils 20 ml okay so five teaspoons four times a day okay that's making the explicit assumption that we're talking about one to three strength herbs everywhere now we've spoken about this a lot one two three is the is the ratio is the strength of the herbal tinge you get one to two which is a lot stronger you get one to three which is a really good middle dose you get one to five which is kind of too weak every ailment management plan every herbal protocol we talk about we've written about we published in the rubidic mentor is is is exclusively um dealing with one to three strength herbs because they're the ones that are used most most often in practice they're kind of the gold standards okay so this is what we're talking about one two three so if you're using herbal tinctures the maximum daily dose is 20 mils a day okay but the key thing is and this is this is what we get a lot of questions about it's 20 mils collectively okay so it might be if you would say you were just using ashwin gander the maximum dose would be 20 mils of ashwinganda tincture a day but if you were using ashwin gander and ginseng it would be 10 mils of each because you can't exceed that 20 mil ceiling so if you're using two herbs then it would be ten mils of each to give you your maximum twenty if you were using four herbs if you you say you were struggling with energy and you were using ashwin gander ginseng rhodiola and shatavari it would be five mils of each herb a day because that's five times four is twenty okay so it doesn't matter if you're using one herb if you're using two herbs three herbs four herbs if you're using liquid herbs you can't exceed that 20 meals a day whether that's one herb five herbs it doesn't matter so that is your upper ceiling of herbal dosing using one to three tinctures okay so if you're using that if you're if you've had your if you're using your 20 mils a day then you don't have any capacity to add anything else in okay you can't then have you know throw in 2 000 milligrams of you know i don't know echinacea or whatever you you've used your your your daily dose of herbal medicines that doesn't that excludes herbal teas herbal teas are are off on their own a little bit i'll talk about that in a minute but that does to that that 20 mils that doesn't you it's that still gives you um room to use um herbal teas and herbal infusions okay so if you're using tinctures that's your limit 20 meals a day that's your entire herbal capacity used for that day okay what about powders capsules powdered herbs dry herbs if you're using um if you're using those and i guess more people more often use powdered herbs you know tinctures are great if you're managing something acute if you've got an acute infection um but for long-term chronic dosing often powders are a little bit better if you're using powders the upper limit is 6 000 milligrams six grams a day that's your maximum days dose rather of powdered dry herbs so again that could be six thousand milligrams or one herb you might take six thousand milligrams of ashwagandha a day and that's that's that's you that you've done or if you say you want to use ashwin gander in triphala that would be three thousand three thousand milligrams of ashwagandha and three thousand milligrams of triphala because that gives you your six thousand that's your maximum dose um or say you were using ashwin gander triphala and shatavari obviously you could only take two thousand milligrams of each because two times three is your six you're six thousand milligrams um so your you that that's your maximum dose you consumed by those powdered herbs but remember that you know that's not it's not the tincture and the powder it's either 20 mils of the tincture and nothing else or six grams of your powder and nothing else okay so they're they're not that it's either it's one or the other okay so that's the so if you're using multiple herbs you have to make sure you're you're you're you're you're consuming them within that upper ceiling okay that's so that's really really important because remember these are things you're using you know month in month out you've got to make sure you're not going too high on those because if you are it can tax the body particularly the liver it can make the liver work quite hard it can put your liver enzymes up and you know there's obviously you know a good degree of safety built into those guidelines it's not right on the wire obviously because that would be irresponsible in the same way it is for any medicine no medicine you know the guidelines are never absolutely bang on the safety limit um so the big takeaway there if you're using herbs on a daily basis long term to prevent an illness or treat an illness if you're using tinctures your maximum dose is 20 meals a day inclusive of all herbs if you're using powders then your maximum daily dose is six sat six thousand milligrams okay um so that kind of take that takes care of the chronic long-term herbs okay everyone everyone happy with that everyone if i explain that in a way that makes sense that that's your upper ceiling and that's a lot you know that's a that's a that's a really strong therapeutic dose if you think about that you know if 20 meals of a one to three tincture is a really hefty dose of herbal medicines you know if you're using ashwin gander because you're stressed or anxious or feeling tense or can't sleep that's gonna give you all your body needs or six thousand milligrams likewise and it's a really really good dose i'm not saying you have to use that much you know like i say i take 2 000 milligrams of ashwagandha which is only a third of the maximum dose just because for me that's a dose that i know works well if i'm really busy or stressed out i might increase it to three or four but i'm not saying you have to go to that dose that's just the ceiling okay um so laura did you say you can't use tinctures and powders you can you can you can use tinctures and powders but obviously you have to then so if the the upper limit still counts so say you're using um if you're using so if the if the maximum dose of a tincture is 20 mils say you're using 10 mils you've used 50 of your daily allowance so that means you can then use 3 000 milligrams of your powdered herbs okay because you're using the other 50 does that make um does that make sense laura so yeah so you can you can definitely you can definitely use tinctures and powders together but you can't use the maximum dose of both you can't use 20 mls of tincture and then 6 000 milligrams of powder because it's too much it's one or the other or a combination of so you have to work out the ratio so if you're using 15 mil uh if you're using 15 mils of tincture that's 75 of your daily allowance which means you're allowed 15 of your um powdered dose okay so you can use them um rachel fresh herbs in addition are okay yeah so if we go for herbal teas there you can add those in additionally i'm going to talk about that obviously herbs in cooking um culinary herbs herbal teas they're they're above and beyond this is in this context at the moment we're talking about concentrated isolated you know strong medicinal herbs okay so chronic dosing that's they that's your safe upper limit when it comes to acute dosing it changes again because if you've got an acute problem if you've got a really bad you know sinus infection or you've got a really bad urinary infection or you've got a really bad headache or anything acute you need to the the for herbal medicines to be effective the dose you're using needs to be significantly higher significantly higher because you it's not going to work otherwise you know if if you're you've got a urinary infection and you're using a herb like uber ursi or angiographics as a replacement for antibiotics you know which has been tested that's that's a very viable option if you're going in at 2 000 milligrams it's no it's not going to be anywhere near enough it's not going to give your body the volume of herbal antibiotics it needs to actually be effective so the dosing for acute treatments is a lot higher but with that increase in dose comes a shorter duration so generally speaking if you're using acute herbal treatments it's for an upper limit of 14 days okay 14 days if you if you think back to the cold flu and covered management series that was obviously an incredibly aggressive protocol that that protocol was um the the most aggressive herbal protocol i've ever seen even in the cancer research you know and because i guess because of the severity of covin and the and the the virulence of the virus um but obviously in that we stipulated that you could use it for a maximum of 14 you know 16 maybe 18 days so if you're going high dose you can only do it for a shorter period of time so for tinctures for liquid herbs again one two three always one two three during an acute episode your maximum upper limit is 40 meals so double okay double your daily the double the chronic daily dose chronic daily dose is 20 mils in acute instances you can go up to 40 mils a day okay so that gives you a massive volume a really really aggressive acute you know treatment profile for using herbal medicines but the big thing to emphasize is if you're using that kind of dose that high dose you don't get that into your body by using a bigger dose four times a day you wouldn't have ten meals four times a day you would have you know five 2.5 meals every two hours or five meals every three hours or something like that you you need to have a smaller amount you know more often so you're drip feeding your body these really high levels of herbs okay so the upper limit so if you look if you look at the element management plans if you go to the website if you look at the ailment management plans any of the acute problems in their headaches urinary infections you know things like that we say on the dough in the in the dosing instructions we say 2.5 meals every two hours that's a standard prescribing ratio for acute herbal medicines okay so 40 meals is your upper daily limit for acute your acute instances likewise if you're using powders and dry herbs your upper you know your upper daily limit for you know for that is 20 at 20 grams 20 000 milligrams so again a really significant hike if you think about chronic dosing chronic dosing the powder the dry herbs upper limit was six thousand milligrams six grams for acute problems it suddenly increased to 20 grams so a lot you know a lot more okay a lot you know a signal a significant increase in the volume you're taking again but you're only doing it for 14 days but likewise if you're taking 20 grams you don't want to be taking you know seven grams three times a day to give you a little bit gives also gives you 21 grams you want to be taking two grams you know multiple times a day so you need to be having a small volume really regularly that's the if i think about the single biggest thing that is predictive of herbal medicines being effective at replacing antibiotics and things like that is is how quickly you intervene at the first sign of symptoms and getting the dosing right a little bit you know really often is the is the beyond endle okay in the context of of prescribing and using um acute medicines the other things to emphasize is um that is really important is that you can't you can't use both at the same time so again using me as an example today i've probably had two thousand i haven't yet cuz i have my the last set might have a thousand milligrams of aspirin gunner in the morning thousand milligrams in the evening but just say i've had that say i've had my 2 000 milligrams of ashwin gander i've had probably at least 2 000 milligrams of turmeric that gives me my 4 that gives me 4 000 milligrams of dried herbs today for me um but say tomorrow i woke up with a stinking cold a really bad infection and i move on to an acute treatment plan for managing that cold what i can't do is i can't use my chronic dose and then add in an acute dose because suddenly you're going to be well over your limit so if you're using herbs chronically day in day out like we you know like we should be like we advocate um then you use that but as soon as you come down with an infection that necessitates the need to move to an acute dosing you stop your chronic treatment so you stop your chronic dosing and you implement your acute treatment and then once your acute your acute treatment ends in 14 days you stop it and then you move back onto your chronic dosing okay so what you can't do is you can't continue with your chronic dosing when you whilst adding in your acute dosing because suddenly you're going to be having you know where the fifth you're well over your upper limit so you can't you can't do both okay you have to you have to move from one to the other um the other important things um is that all of the dosing you know everything we speak about in the ru vedic mentor every ailment plan um everything we cover in these sessions are all for people you know who are 18 years of old of age and older okay because when you're treating children it becomes a lot more complex it's almost always bespoke because you have to take into account the child's age their body size you know if you're treating an 11 year old you know who weighs 9 stone or you're treating a 14 year old who weighs nine stone one is gross one is significantly overweight one is significantly underweight the dosing is is less dependent upon their age and more upon their body size and their weight and we can't in on the con in the capacity of something like the mentor we can't generalize to children okay so none of this dosing applies to people under 18. and the other thing like we say in all of the ailment guides yeah if you're taking prescription medicines if you're pregnant if you're breastfeeding if you've got any kind of liver or kidney disorders then obviously check with us you know and people do that all the time we get you know lots and lots of messages every day saying i'm taking an antidepressant can i use ashwin gander or you know i'm taking i'm on a sedative can i use chamomile or whatever it is you know but you know check with us you know check with us if you want to if you go to an element plan or you go onto the herb profiles and you think oh that herb would really suit me or i think i'd do really well with this and you're on a prescription medicine just message us either on the facebook page or on the email and say i'm on this drugs i want to use this for this can i do it and we'll get back to you okay um so um so that's that's kind of a you know a really really um integral you know component of using herbal medicines um because i think there's a lot of there's a lot of uncertainty around herbs there's a lot of uncertainty around you know dosing and mixing doses and things like that um and i think it i think it often um prevents a lot of people from making taking advantage of herbs because to me i've said this so many times i know i'm pretty boring everyone but i genuinely believe that if everyone in britain if we could get every adult in britain intelligently and safely using herbs on a daily basis i genuinely believe that we could transform the public health profile of this country within you know within you know a very short period of time because it had herbs have that that capacity to just transform our body our immunity our mood our hormones homostasis in the body particularly the the adaptogenic herbs your ashwin ganda your ginseng your rhodiola your your your tulsi your chatavari all these powerful tonic herbs they're just transformative and i think to not be making use of these on a daily basis i think is a real um there is a mistake i think it's a shame because it gives us it's all it's all reward for no risk if we're using it safely um so um so but it's just important we're doing it you know in in a safe way and within uh you know a set parameter of upper limits um so is this including the tonics like the vitality tonic so this is so this now is where there's where in herbal medicine there's a slight gray area okay and the two things i want to talk about is herbal teas so herbal teas um fall above and beyond all of those dosing um limits we've just spoken about okay because herbal teas they're not concentrated you know if you're taking a capsule you're taking tincture they're isolated they're standardized they're they're they're they're stronger whereas you're taking herbal teas you're not actually ingesting the herb you're not swallowing the leaves you're you're you're consuming the water transfer the water soluble compounds in the in that's transferred from the herb into the water that makes it gentler it makes it a little bit more subtle um and you know having you know so generally speaking less than five cups a day so if you're having you know herbal teas you know five sorry five cups or less a day it it it's perfectly fine to do that's not going to push you over any limits it's not going to create any problems so her herbal teas are above and beyond the dosing requirements um to you know um you know that that that that is above and beyond the upper limits we just spoken about um so and the other thing which is where it gets really tricky um and it often requires a little bit of uh interpolation i suppose is if you're using um tonics so laura you put up there yeah about the vitality tonic um so the silver becomes a little bit of a you know a grayer area because you might say you're using herbs in a chronic manner you're taking your ashvin gander and things like that and you you think okay the vitality tonic would really benefit me i'm gonna make to get the cleavers get the nettle um oh sorry there's a cat who's a bit of a pest um yeah should i um you know if i add that vitality tonic in is that going to push me over the limit and it depends the way to answer that is is unfortunately there's no kind of evidence-based consensus because obviously the tonics you're making yourself it's hard to standardize the dose we don't know the strength um but it depends upon the way i view that for me is that if you're on your upper limit if you've taken 20 if you're using 20 mils of a tincture every day or you're using six grams of dried herbs every day and you know four or five cups of herbal tea then you're you're gonna be somewhere close to your maximum level of herb intake if you then add in you know a couple of teaspoons of a vitality tonic it's probably going to push you a little bit over whereas if you're only taking half of your daily allowance like i said for me for example you know comfortably taken two thousand milligrams of ashwagandha comfortably taken two thousand milligrams of um turmeric i'm two-thirds in i've still got i've still got a third you know of my herbal allowance available to me if i add in you know if i add in a vitality tonic i've still got that capacity um whereas if i was maxed out i probably wouldn't okay um so it depends upon how close you are to that upper limit um and i think so linda yes and the syrups and oximals you know where do you where do they fall again you have to you know you have to you have to interpolate that a little bit yeah if you're again if you're on your maximum daily intake then adding in homemade remedies homemade syrups and things like that if you're right on your upper limit then you've got to be careful around what you know how much of those you're having or how long you're having them for if you're slightly lower down then you have that capacity to to use those um and obviously you know every in you know if you're if you're if you're seeing someone on a face-to-face basis this this becomes a lot more customized and more individualized but these are these are the generalized um you know guidelines for individuals okay um so i'm cutting back on junk food yeah so i'm not yeah that's a good point i'm what i'm not saying is that herbal medicines are a panacea for all ills you can't not exercise you eat rubbish food and herbal medicines aren't gonna compensate for that but if we're living if we're having living a good lifestyle eating good food et cetera et cetera herbal medicines have the capacity i think to make our health above average and take it to exceptional and the evidence you know i'm going to talk about this a little bit later in the year the research now showing how the chemicals in certain herbs are actually now being shown to affect the way our genes our genetic body is behaving and that suddenly becomes game-changing because suddenly we can see why these health medicines become so effective and so powerful um so that's really really important stuff okay it's really important to be aware of this because you know we should i think we should all be using herbs it's just making sure we're doing it within that that upper limit okay and what we've done um we've written out a a document about a two-page document which is essentially everything we've spoken about here so that you haven't tonight was important because it gave people the opportunity to ask questions um but you don't have to want to watch this every time if you've got a question or you can't remember something you know so what we're going to do is we're going to upload this document as a pdf um somewhere in the our uvenic mentor um holly's we're not quite sure we're going to put it yet we'll let you know where we're going to put it and that will just give you everything that we've just spoken about in a really clear concise format chronic dose acute dose etcetera etcetera um david norris uh hi david where does charon pressure fit into the mix so jar and crash so um herbal medicines that that fall into the food category are again above and beyond okay so char and prash is you can use above and beyond these limits okay because although it's herbal it's prepared into that food grade format when you eat it your body recognizes it as food you know because you think about you know think about um lots of concentrated you know um foods they still they still require the body to put a lot of effort into digesting it so char and prash using one or two teaspoons a day is absolutely fine above and beyond what we're speaking about because that's labeled as a herbal jam okay so that's above and beyond that's a good question actually hi sam hi paula and what about using alongside prescribed medicines i would like to take some herbs such as ashby and gun or bosque rosemary tone ginger and passion flower and tincture but i don't know what is safe alongside taking the hydro um so yeah so you so that if you start if you're using any kind of um conventional prescription um uh then you have to obviously what you have to do this is what we do you know we spend a lot of time doing this in clinic is if you want to use a two three four five you know herbal tincture or powder or prescription you have to cross-reference every single herb against every con uh conventional prescription medicine to make sure there's no interaction firstly to make sure it's not gonna you know cause an adverse reaction and two to make sure it's not gonna potentiate it because obviously if you add in um one herb that does something on the body that's the same as what a drug is doing you're gonna get a bigger effect okay um and it's just a case of cross-referencing each each herb against the the prescription medicine that you're taking and if you're and again there's you know there's very very clear um guidance on that in on um even things like um i'm really against webmd because um they're so ridiculously pedantic around um you sound silly to say it but they're they they even take theoretical concern into the equation but what they are good is they're good at creating almost the worst case scenario so if you go on to webmd and you type in ashwin ghana it will give you you know all of the drug interactions all of the contraindications even though a lot of them are a lot of the time are not recognized by government-based herbal bodies and herbal authorities but they're still really good because it'll give you an overview of can i use this herb in this context so what i would do is probably go onto webmd look at the side effects look at the interaction pages for those herbs and make sure that they're not going to be contraindicated against the hydro okay um uh holly i personally rotate through some of the remedies so i might have hawthorne one day vitality tonic and other i have ashwin gander and triphala every day yes exactly that you know and i think you know for me yeah that's a really good point that's a really good point because the way the way you're using herbs is going to depend upon season so for example um you know if we if we are in september october now moving into cold and flu season taking cobia completely out of the equation you know it makes sense to move on to a herb that is really good as a prophylaxis and a preventative for colds and flu so if i'm taking my ashwin gander one of the herbs i always start taking in october is australis you know i i make the australis chai gone to the australians her profile and the mentor you will see the australis chai recipe why because australis is clinically proven to reduce the prevalence of colds and flu we get do i want to be taking that now not really because there's no cold or flu about it's pretty much been eradicated with lockdown so that's a really good point that holly's made you might want to rotate it if you're suffering really badly with hay fever you might start moving on to a herbal antihistamine you might start using nettle and yarrow and chamomile so you can you haven't always gotta you follow the same framework 12 months of the year you might stop one thing start another and then stop that and start another one so that's a really i think that's a really key point that holly's made there you need to be fluid you need to rotate you need to change you are based around how your body's feeling what you're experiencing what's going on the time of the year okay so that's key um can we drink eight cups of herbal tea a day and glue including green tea if we're taking well below top doses of tinctures and dried herbs yeah i mean um i wouldn't i definitely wouldn't take eight cups of green tea a day because the caffeine level in that is probably going to put the heart maybe into a little bit of you know um a hyper-stimulating state that's a lot of caffeine on on heart rhythm and things like that um but other herbal teas eight cups i mean that's three of those cups i mean five five or less falls above and beyond your daily dose so you're having a three more um yeah i mean it's it's yeah if you're if you're well but if you're below the top doses you've got loads of room there marcie if you are well if you're well below the ceiling of the tinctures and dried herbs you've got the huge capacity there okay so i wouldn't that's not a problem um anything you know think about coffee which is one of the things that my old mentor at southampton you always used to laugh about this all of the you know i'm not poohing this in any way shape or form but the governing bodies for this you know you talk about echinacea you talk about angiographics you talk about turmeric and there's all these guidelines on how much you can have and how often there's complete carp blanche to do really nearly what you want with coffee four cups six cups two cups coffee is a is a is a recognized herbal medicine why is it that suddenly you can have you know six or seven grams of coffee a day and no one bats an eyelid at it whereas if you did that with another herb you know you're open for some kind of libel case um coffee green tea white tea black tea they're all herbs so um you know it is it's one of those things where there's all these there's always inconsistencies as an industry but the point there marcia is you know that you're if you're below the top dose you've got loads of capacity there um what would the acute dose of herbal teas a day when fighting a bad head cold to the flask myth i mean if you're fighting um know if you're fighting a cold um then again you've got huge capacity because one you want to be really aggressive with your with your prescribing and two you need to stay you need to stay really well hydrated there's absolute clear evidence that the more hydrated you are during your respiratory infection the quicker you clear the infection out so herbal teas you know if you think about the flask method that we've spoken about the flask method and if that flask is a liter um you know having that a day as a kind of a baseline makes a load of sense so you've got your one liter of herbal tea and then you know filling that up maybe half again with herbal tea is going to give you um you know a really good dose okay so that you know one and a half liters of herbal tea for that you know for that a cute 14 day prescribing window is absolutely fine alongside the other um yeah the ceilings we've spoken about linda how is your cold i hope you're recovering um i saw your post around what you were doing to treat your cold um and it's you know absolutely spot on there's nothing you could add to that um other than you know rest and and you know et cetera et cetera but i hope you're feeling a little bit better um uh would that be uh laura will this will probably need a one-to-one but i'm under a lyme and co-infection specialists in america i'm prescribed massive amounts of antibiotics and malaria treatment sometimes four types a day including supplements i'm also prescribed high doses of aneurysms [Music] so i want to integrate what i'm learning with you to support my healing but i'm so over the upper limit yeah so remember laura that what i'm talking about here is these is is is that the the regulatory general guidelines um when you're dealing with someone a one-to-one basis you obviously you're taking every facet of that person's life into the equation their size their body weight their diet their digestion the condition they've got okay um because you know when we're the people we're working with cancer you know the capacity to go in different in different dosage ratios is completely different um because they've got yeah because you're dealing on a one-to-one basis and if you've been prescribed that that that ratio that though that protocol there you know from a a specialist in america they've done that based upon your individual case you know i'm sure for a detailed assessment and again lyme generally speaking the more aggressive or difficult the ailment the more aggressive the protocols are the herbal protocols um so anti-lyme um i think it was you who was asking laura and it's on our list um holly and i were working on at the moment in that there's been some really you know we've worked with a lot of live people with lyme disease over the years um and it's it's an absolute enigma to manage and over the last four years there's been some really the first really really promising research i've seen almost paradigm changing research into the herbal treatments um of you know of lime you know really really um making you sit up and take notice research and we're in the process of synthesizing that and packaging it up um because lime is a really big problem uh like as you know um and once we've done that we're gonna we're gonna we will post it up but it's gonna be a little bit more detailed than the standard ailment management plan that we use for other problems because it's a little bit different um and then we'll post it up and we'll probably do a live seminar on it we'll probably do a lyme disease seminar on the mentor page where we'll talk through this stuff because um it's really it's a really exciting time um based around the new researcher and the way herbs can penetrate and destroy this this dormancy pattern of the lyme infection okay so we'll but um i don't i don't want to rush that because i want to get it 100 right i don't want to miss something i don't want to i don't want to get it even 95 right it needs to get every stone needs to be unturned with that because it's been really you know i'm immersed in reading it at the moment it's really interesting stuff um so um so laura as soon as we can i'll get that up but don't don't make the assumption that you're so far over the limit based upon what you've been describing because that's come off the back of the specialist okay for sure um uh your cat your cat really loves you this cat is an absolute pest she's a maine and she's only only had her a couple of weeks and like she's like a velcro cat wherever someone is she's on doesn't matter who it is it's definitely not me if it's human and breathing she'll sit on it um so um that's been helpful um because it's something that i just wanted to put out there just to clarify just because we get a lot of questions about this so what i'm saying herbs are you're profoundly effective i think we should all be making use of herbs the upper limit is high we don't need we don't need to kind of violate those limbs we don't need to go higher than that the reason those those levels have been set is because they're based upon the evidence if we're using that dose we're getting all of the benefits with no risk okay um so use those use the herbs use those dosing guys like i said we'll ride up we'll that we should go up this week um well all this is all these guidelines will be there so you can just quickly refer to it rather than listening to me waffle on um so that will be up soon um and then we'll go from there but obviously if you have any questions let me know um i'm pleased you're feeling better linda that's good news um laura it's amazing yeah so i'm really excited about this laura it's really it's really empowering to finally see really bulletproof research coming up around lyme disease it's it's a really it's it's the first time in my career that i've seen something that makes me really want to get my teeth into it so that's good um can i use the herbs you were suggesting on top of what i'm already taking is that what i mean um i don't know it depends on what dosing you are i'm just looking at what you've put um it would depend upon what what strength of those herbs you're taking in what form and at what dose so if you want to if you want to message me that or post that up in the facebook group so everyone can learn from it as well um and then we can talk about um what herbs might might there you go might fit into that you know you might be an add-on uh into that so it depends upon um it depends upon the the strength and the volume the dose you're using okay um is that okay laura um so i hope that's been helpful i know there's a lot down what time is it that's gone on for a bit longer than usual but this is not one to rush it was one to get right okay so um so i hope that's been good that's been helpful um use herbs use herb safety refer to the written guide other than that uh the the next installment of the swaster series is gonna be going live friday um and i hope you had a chat if you haven't check out the um check out the the food or the
