It is an in-demand procedure administered by qualified acupuncture specialists at One Source Integrative Medicine. You might find out that acupuncture is the ideal non-invasive solution to your body pain or health concern. If you understand the science and purpose behind this procedure, it may encourage you to look into it for yourself. What Is Acupuncture? During an acupuncture procedure, a specialist applies a series of tiny needles to specific areas of the skin. When the needles are inserted, they stimulate pressure points in the body and release a source of energy called \"chi\" or \"qi.\" The belief is that chi energy needs to flow properly in order to relieve discomfort in the body. The needles also cause the nerves to send signals that release pain-relieving endorphins from the brain. During the procedure the patient relaxes on a table--the only sensation is a bit of pressure as the needle is inserted, and sometimes tingling on the skin. What Problems Does Acupuncture Treat? Though acupuncture is most commonly used for pain, it also treats a wide variety of other medical problems. Here is a short list of diseases it can resolve: - Back and neck pain - Fibromyalgia - Migraines - Menstrual pain and PMS syndrome - Symptoms of menopause - Asthma - IBS, GER and other gastrointestinal disorders - Arthritic problems - Nausea caused by chemo treatments Benefits of Acupuncture Many patients are happy with the results of an acupuncture treatment. They leave the office feeling relieved, relaxed and most importantly with less pain or discomfort. The great thing about acupuncture is that it is a non-invasive way to treat certain medical problems that are otherwise treated with medication or even surgery.
