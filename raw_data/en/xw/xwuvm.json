Overview Human milk is recognized as the biological norm for infant feeding. WIC joins all major health authorities in recommending that all infants, with rare exceptions, receive no other food or drinks besides breastmilk for approximately the first six mo nths of life and continue to receive breastmilk at least through the first year. Although breastfeeding is preferred, there may be exceptions or conditions when breastfeeding is not an option or is not recommended. Infant formulas provide appropriate amounts of nutrition for adequate growth and development. Benefits of Breastmilk There are many benefits to breastfeeding, and properties of breastmilk that will never be duplicated in infant formula. Although it is desirable for all babies to be breastfed, there are a few special conditions when breastfeeding is not recommended . 1-1 12 Lesson 1-1 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module 0 You reviewed these benefits and special conditions when you completed the Breastfeeding Level 1 Online Course and the Breastfeeding Level 2 Module . Refer to these two resources to complete the following review activity. iActivit y 1. List 4 reasons why WIC recommends breastfeeding. 2. List 3 situations when breastfeeding is not recommended and formula would be used . Use of Infant Formula There are some situations when a breastfed baby may need extra nutrients or calories. This may be infant formula added to breastmilk or infant formula used in addition to breastfeeding. The purpose of the extra fortification or supplementation is often to support a specific health or growth need and is intended to be temporary. Mothers are encouraged to return to fully breastfeeding when the issue is resolved. Although the WIC Program enthusiastically promotes breastfeeding with pregnant women and new moms, WIC staff fully support mothers in their infant feeding decisions. Infant formula may be used a little or a lot, and the remainder of this module provides information on the types available, preparation, safety, and the causes of common problems associated with feeding an infant . Chapter 1 13 July 2014 Lesson Level: 1 Infant Formula Mixing and Storage Objectives After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Identify three forms of infant formulas. Instruct a caregiver on how to properly prepare infant formula. Describe the basic steps of bottle -feeding an infant. Forms of Infant Formula Infant formula is available in three forms: powdered , liquid concentrate, and ready -to-use/ready -to-feed. The different forms of a given f ormula are nearly identical in nutrient composition, but small differences may exist for technical reasons due to processing. Careful preparation and handling of infant formulas are important to ensure their safety. Ready -to-use and liquid concentrate form ulas are sterile, meaning they do not contain disease causing bacteria. Although powdered formulas are heat -treated during processing, they are not subjected to high temperatures for a sufficient amount of time to make the end product sterile. 1-2 14 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Powdered formula Liquid concentrate formula Ready -to-use formula Powdered formula Powdered formula is prepared by mixing the powder with water following the directions on the can. Usually, the directions call for mixing one scoop of powder with 2 ounces of water. Be sure to use the scoop that comes with that can of formula to measure the powder and do not substitute standard measuring spoons or scoops from other formulas. Powders from different manufacturers provide slightly different amounts of nutrients per unit of volume, and scoop sizes will vary accordingly, so it is important to closely follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions on the label. Note : The directions on each can refer to the scoop that is included in the can. Powdered formula is often the best choice for breastfed babies who need occasional formula because it is easy to make small amounts, and the powder can be stored for up to one month after opening. Once the powder is mixed with water, use the prepared formula within 24 hours, or according to the directions on the label. Liquid concentrate Liquid concentrate formula needs to be mixed with water in a 1-to-1 ratio. This means mixing one can of liquid concentrate formula with one can of water. Shake the can of l iquid concentrate before the liquid is mixed with an equal amount of water . After a Chapter 1 15 July 2014 can of liquid concentrate formula is opened, prepare, refrigerate, and use it within 48 hours. Ready- to-use formula Ready -to-use formula requires no mixing or diluting with water. It is available in bottle s and/or cans of various sizes. This type of formula is usually the most expensive choice, but it may be the best choice when the water supply is questionable or when the caregiver has difficulty correctly mixing liquid concentrate or powdered formula. Shake the container of formula before pour ing it into the baby bottle to mix in any mineral sediment that may have settled during storage. After a can of ready- to-use formula is opened, refrigerate and use within 48 hours . Note: The length of time for use of prepared liquid concentrate and ready - to-use formula vs. prepared powdered formula differs. Liquid concentrate and ready -to-use formula can be used for 48 hours after mixing, while powdered formula must be used within 24 hours of mixing. The reason for th is difference has to do with the way the formula is processed. Powdered infant formulas are heat -treated during processing but they are not subjected to high temperatures for sufficient time to make the final product sterile. Activit y 1. Ask your training supervisor about situations when you might offer ready- to-use formula to a family. Sanitation One of the most important aspects of mixing and using formula is proper sanitation. Intestinal problems in babies are often due to poor water q uality or unsafe handling of bottles or equipment rather than sensitivities to the formula itself. It is important to make sure the water comes from a safe water source and is safe for a baby . 16 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module . Be sure everything is as clean as possible , including bottles, water, hands, can openers, and anything else that comes in contact with the formula. It is also important to follow guidelines for proper storage of formula both at home and away from home. Sanitizing bottles The safest practice during the first 3 months of life is to boil bottles and bottle parts. This is especially true when the water quality is questionable. Some health care provider s (HCP) might tell parents to simply wash bottles in hot, soapy water or in the dishwasher, as this may be adequa te for healthy newborns in many situations. Still, WIC advises participants to boil bottles for the first 3 months since this is the best method for killing bacteria. To boil bottles: Wash all bottle parts with hot, soapy water and a bottlebrush. Be sure water passes through the nipple. Rinse all bottle parts in hot water. Then place all bottle parts in a large pan, cover with water, and boil for five minutes. Remove items from pan, place upside -down on a clean cloth or paper towel and air dry. Sanitizing water for mixing formula For at least the first 3 months of life, WIC recommends sanitizing water by boiling it for one minute and then allowing it to cool. Sanitize all types of water including bottled drinking water and distilled water. For h ealthy infants 3 months and older, it is not necessary to sanitize the water unless a health care provider recommends it. If the water quality is poor or questionable, as in the case of well water, continue to boil the water or use bottled water. Chapter 1 17 July 2014 0 To proper ly boil water: Run cold tap water for one to two minutes before collecting the water in a clean pot or kettle. Running the water helps reduce the amount of lead in the water in case the pipes contain lead. Never use hot water from the faucet to make b aby formula or for cooking. Bring the water to a rolling boil and boil for one minute. One minute is enough time to sanitize the water, and boiling the water for a longer time can concentrate lead in the water. Next, turn off the heat and cool the water with the lid on . Activit y 1. Why is it important to sanitize bottles and boil water for infants under 3 months of age? 2. In what circumstances might a parent or caregiver want to continue to take extra sanitation measures past 3 months ? Mixing Formula It is very important to prepare infant formula properly and follow the manufacturer's instructions about how much water to add to the formula . Changing the water to formula ratio is never recommended unless a health care p rovider prescribes a different dilution . The following tables show guidelines for mixing formula correctly and safely. 18 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Mixing Liquid Concentrate Formula Step -by-Step 1. Check the formula's expiration date on the label or lid to be sure it has not expired. Do not use cans that have dents, leaks, bulges, or rust spots. Also, check the formula's label for the proper dilution instructions. It is very important to add the right amount of water. Only a health care p rovider should prescribe a dilution that is diff erent from the directions on the can. 2. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. Using hot, soapy water, wash a pitcher, its lid, and any other utensils you will use (can opener, measuring cups, etc.). Rinse all with boiling water. 3. Before opening, shake the can and rinse off the top. Open with a clean can opener. Mix the can of liquid concentrate formula with a can of boiled and cooled water in the clean container. 4. Stir to mix thoroughly and pour into sanitized bottles 5. After formula has been prepared, refrigerate and use within 48 hours. Throw away unused formula after 48 hours . Chapter 1 19 July 2014 Mixing Powdered Formula Step -by-Step 1. Check the formula's expiration date on the label or lid to be sure it has not expired. Also, check the formula's label for the proper dilution instructions. It is very important to add theright amount of water. Only a health c are provider should prescribe a dilution that is different from the directions on the can. 2. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. 3. Follow the directions on the can for measuring the water and powder. Usually, the directions are to add one unpacked level scoop of powder to 2 ounces of water. Start by measuring the sanitized water into a clean container. 4. Next, add the correct amount of powdered formula to the water in the container. Stir or shake the mixture thoroughly. You can mix enough for a full day's supply or make smaller amounts using sanitized bottles as the mixing containers. 20 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Mixing Powdered Formula Step -by-Step 5. After adding the powder, stir or shake the mixture thoroughly. Open cans of powdered formula can be stored in the can for up to 1 month, but once the powder is mixed with water and refrigerated, the prepared formula should be used within 24 hours. 6. Throw away unused formula after 24 hours. Activit y 1. How would you explain the steps for mixing the following: A. Liquid concentrate formula: B. Powdered formula : Dilution Another key factor in formula preparation is proper dilution. It is very important to mix the liquid concentrate or powdered formula with the right amount of water. Adding either too much or not enough water can lead to serious health problem s for the infant. Chapter 1 21 July 2014 Concentrating Formula to Higher Calorie Levels Only a health care provider should prescribe a dilution or recipe that is different from the manufacturer's directions. When prepared according to the basic instructions powdered, liquid concentrate, or ready -to-use formula will yield an infant formula that is approximately 20 calories (kcal) per ounce. The HCP may prescribe a higher caloric concentration per ounce for infants with medical problems such as failure to thrive, cardiac or respiratory problems. Higher concentrations of formula at 22, 24 and up to 30 calories (kcal) per ounce can be achieved by decreasing the amount of water to for mula ratio. It is not the role of WIC staff to recommend that a parent concentrate formula unless prescribed by the HCP. Water Intoxication Water intoxication occurs when an infant is fed fluids without proper amounts of sodium and other solutes. It typica lly occurs in formula -fed infants who are given formula that has been over-diluted with water, but it has also been known to occur with feeding excess soda, juice, or tea. This preventable condition can be life-threatening to an infant. Symptoms of the condition in clude irritability, sleepiness, a drop in body temperature, fluid retention, and seizures which are caused by a rapid decrease in serum (blood) sodium levels. Also, infants fed excessive water will not receive adequate calories to meet their needs for growth and development. Supplemental water is generally not recommended for healthy infants who are not yet receiving solid foods, except possibly in hot weather for formula -fed infant. Water intoxication can result when a family is running low on formula and tries to \"stretch\" the formula by adding extra water. Water intoxication is serious, so always add the right amount of water to formula. WIC staff can help parents understand the dangers of giving excess water. 22 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Activit y 1. Why is it important t o prepare infant formula correctly? Feeding a Bottle of Expressed Breastmilk or Formula Guidelines for Bottle -feeding Parents may need to learn how to bottle -feed in a way that respects their baby's natural feeding rhythm. Parents will feel more successful if they understand normal infant growth and development, such as baby behaviors or the size of their infant's stomach at different ages. For more information on infant cues, refer to the Baby Behaviors Online Course. Warmi ng Expressed Breastmilk or Formula Babies can drink breastmilk or formula that is either room temperature, slightly cooler, or slightly warmer. If a baby prefers a warm bottle, caregivers can warm the liquid to body temperature. The best method is to set the bottle in a pan or bowl of warm water for a few minutes, or hold it under warm tap water, and then shake the bottle after warming. A few drops of formula on the inside wrist is a good test of temperature. If it feels neither warm nor cold on the wr ist, it is the right temperature for a baby. Never use a microwave to heat e xpressed breastmilk or infant formula because the liquid can get hot enough to cause serious burns. Even though the outside of the bottle or several drops on the wrist may feel co ol, the liquid can heat unevenly inside the bottle. Formula in bottles with disposable plastic liners can become so hot that the plastic liners can burst. Chapter 1 23 July 2014 Additionally, heating breastmilk in a microwave can destroy many of the beneficial components of bre astmilk. Infant stomach size Newborn infant s' stomachs are tiny and cannot take in large volumes. Until about 4 months of age, infant stomachs can hold only small amounts of breastmilk or formula. This is one of the main reasons infants need to be fed so frequently in the first few months of life . Understanding stomach sizes of infants can help caregivers understand signs of overfeeding and/or feeding problems. Paying attention to infant cues of early fullness , e.g., pulling away from the nipple, slowing or stopping of sucking, falling asleep, etc. , will help support healthy eating habits. Day 1 A full- term newborn's tummy is about the size of a small cherry and holds about \u00bc ounce (1 teaspoon). Day 5 -7 At 1 week of age a newborn's tummy has grown to the size of a walnut and holds \u00be to 1 ounce (1 -2 tablespoons) . Day 10 -21 After a few weeks a baby's tummy is around the size of an egg and can hold 2 -3 ounces. By a year of age, a baby's tummy is about the size of the baby's own fist. 24 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Hold the baby in an upright position Always hold a young baby during a feeding, rather than propping the bottle up with a pillow or blanket. Propping the bottle deprives the baby of human contact, increases the risk that the baby will inhale fluids into the lungs ( aspirate ), and can lead to tooth decay and ear infections. Holding the baby helps the parent sense behavioral cues of hunger and enriches the parent and infant bond. Hold the baby in the cradle of the arm, in an upright position so the infant's head is higher than the rest of the body. This gives the baby some control of the flow and quantity of the feeding. It also helps to prevent aspiration and can help prevent ear infections by keeping milk from backing up in the inner ear. When babies are not held upright, the bottle is in an upside -down position. In this position, as the baby swallows, more milk is drawn into their mouth by the negative pressure created , and they have no choice but to swallow again. This makes it look like the baby is hungrily gulping down the bottle when they are actually trying to protect their airway . This can be stressful for the baby , and may lead to: An unpleasant feeding experience; Respiratory issues; Colic -like symptoms/reflux ; Overfeeding ; Feeding refusal ; Frustration when back to breastfeeding ; or Damage to mother's confidence . Chapter 1 25 July 2014 Tilt of the bottle How much the bottle is tilted is important when feeding an infant. Tilt the bottle at an angle that keeps the bottle's neck and nipple filled with milk, while the baby is drinking. This helps the baby to avoid swallowing too much air, which can make the infant feel full before adequate milk has been consumed. When the ba by needs to pause, tilt the bottle such that milk does not go into baby's mouth, but don't take the bottle out of baby's mouth completely. Watch for and respond to the baby's cues. Signs of feeding stress include the following: Splayed fingers or toes ; Milk spilling from the corners of the mouth ; A worried expression on the baby's face ; The baby is trying to turn head away or push bottle away ; Baby stops gazing at parent ; or, Gulpin g, panting or gasping sounds. There is no need to count the baby's sucks, p ausing after a certain number. Baby -led bottle- feeding puts the baby in control of the feeding, which is more like breastfeeding. Burp the baby A baby will naturally swallow some air during a feeding, which can lead to discomfort and irritability. This ha ppens in both breastfed and bottle -fed infants, but it is more common when drinking from a bottle, especially if the baby is not upright. Burping the baby often during a feeding helps to release the air and keeps the baby more comfortable. Parents can try burping a bottle -fed baby during natural breaks in the infant's sucking cycle or after every 2 to 3 ounces, even if the baby does not seem uncomfortable. 26 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Do not worry about hiccups Hiccups are also very common in infants, and they usually bother the parent s more than the baby. If hiccups happen during a feeding, wait a few minutes before finishing the feeding. Sometimes it helps to burp the baby and to change the baby's position. Also, it might help to offer feedings before a baby is extremely hungry. Many babies do not seem to be bothered by hiccups. Do not put a baby to sleep with a bottle Putting a baby to sleep in a crib or playpen with a bottle can lead to choking, ear infections, tooth decay, and problems with speech later on. If the parents are puttin g an older infant to sleep with a bottle, encourage them to put a small amount of plain water in the bottle as they work on changing this habit. Other bottle -feeding tips for parents and caregivers Alternate sides when holding the baby for feeding. This encourages development of both sides of the baby's brain/body. Never coax a baby to finish a bottle. This may contribute to overfeeding. Learn what to expect in terms of feeding frequency and amounts for your baby's age. Pay attention and respond to the baby's cues. Use bottles only for breastmilk and formula. If needed, small amounts of water for older infants can be bottle -fed. Caregivers should never put juice, fruit drinks, sweetened liquids, cereal or pureed foods in a bottle. Summary of key bottle -feeding points Feed baby in an upright position. Don't force the bottle into the baby's mouth . Pay close attention to the baby during the feeding. Look for signs of stress, to know when to pause the feeding. Chapter 1 27 July 2014 Tilt the bottle down during the pause, so baby is no longer getting milk, but leave the bottle in the mouth, or in contact with the lips. Never prop a bottle! Never put juice, fruit drinks, sweetened liquids, cereal or pureed foods in a bottle . Activit y 1. What would you feel is important t o explain to caregivers about warming a bottle? 2. Demonstrate for your Training Supervisor how you would explain to a caregiver the key bottle -feeding points. Storing Formula Keep breastmilk and formula chilled when traveling If a parent plans to take a baby on an outing (shopping, clinic appointment, etc.), the liquid in the bottles should start out very cold, and then be put in an insulated bag with an ice pack, or wrapped in a thick cloth to keep cold. For longer travel times, it is a good idea to keep bottles in a small ice chest. For formula -fed babies, other options include taking sanitized water in clean bottles along with a can of powdered formula or buying ready - to-use formula. 28 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Throw out breastmilk or formula after a feeding When an infant drinks from a bottle, the baby's saliva enters the bottle and mixes with the breastmilk or formula. This is not a problem during the feeding, but if the bottle is set aside, bacteria will grow and multiply, especially at room temperature. Ov er time the bacteria in the liquid can reach a level that can make an infant sick. After a feeding, caregivers should throw out any unused breastmilk or formula and then wash the bottle with soap and hot water. Other Considerations Bisphenol A (BPA) Some plastics are made with chemicals called phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA). These chemicals can leach from everyday plastic products like bottles, toys, containers and personal care products. Scientists and doctors are learning about these chemicals and the e ffects that they may have, especially on young children. Due to these health concerns, baby bottles and sippy cups manufactured since July 2012 and infant formula manufactured since July 2013 are required to be BPA free. This means that all baby bottles and sippy cups currently on the market are BPA free and all infant formula currently manufactured is in BPA free containers. There are still other products that may contain BPA, but for infants and toddlers, BPA from bottles, sippy cups and formula should n o longer be an issue. More information is located at: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2012-07-17/html/2012 - 17366.htm What to do if the caregiver runs out of formula Since the WIC program benefits are intended to be supplemental and not intended to meet all the nutritional needs of infants, caregivers will need to obtain additional infant formula beyond what is provided by WIC. If the amount of infant formula provided by the WIC Program is insufficient to meet an infant's needs, then: Chapter 1 29 July 2014 Offer powdered infant formula instead of liquid concentrate or ready -to-use infant formula, since powdered infant formula has a higher yield. Refer the parent/caregiver to financial or fo od assistance in their community for which they may be eligible . Activit y 1. Ask your Training Supervisor about resources available in your community for helping a participant who runs out of formula. 30 Lesson 1-2 Breastmilk as the Standard Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Chapter 1 31 July 2014 Lesson Level: 1 Types of Formulas Objectives After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Identify the differences between milk -based and soy -based infant formulas. Identify three special types of formula and the reasons why they might be used. Materials Needed Job Aid: Infant Formula Decisio n Process Job Aid: Infant Medical Formulas for Qualifying Medical Conditions WIC Policy WIC Policy 730 - Bid Formula: Use and D escription Overview WIC can provide many different types of formula depending on the infant's needs. WIC maintains a contract with a formula company that requires us to provide a specific brand of standard infant formula. These are called bid formulas. For more information on bid formulas, see Policy 730. Infants who cannot tolerate the bid formula can receive a different brand of formula with medical documentation from their health 1-3 32 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module care provider. For more information on medical documentation, see Policy 76 5. Most infants do well with a standard milk -based formula. This lesson will give you the basics about the different kinds of formula parents will ask about, even though Oregon WIC does not provide every type. Nutrient Composition All formulas provide the same basic nutrients because in 1980 the Infant Formula Act established minimum levels for 29 nutrients and maximum levels for nine others. Formulas can vary somewhat in the amount and type of a particular nutrient, but all must meet the basic requirement s. Manufacturers of standard infant formulas include: Abbott Nutrition ................................ .................... Similac brand Nutritionals ................................ ............ All Store brands Note: If a family runs out of formula, store brand formulas are a high - quality alternative and less expensive than name -brand formulas. Understanding the major nutrients in infant formulas can help a WIC staff person understand the underlying cause of an adverse reaction to a formula. The major nutrients in infant formulas are: Carboh ydrate Protein Fat Formulas differ in the type of carbohydrate, protein, and fat they contain. Formulas can also vary in composition depending on whether they are powdered, concentrate, or ready -to-use. Chapter 1 33 July 2014 For example , liquid concentrate and ready -to-use form ulas such as lecithin, carrageenan, monoglycerides, or diglycerides, which prevent separation. Standard Milk -Based Formulas Standard milk -based formulas are the best choice for healthy, term infants who are not breastfed or are partially breastfed. Carbohydrate Lactose is the major carbohydrate (sugar) found in both breastmilk and standard milk -based infant formulas. Lactose is only found in the milks of mammals, such as cows, goats, and humans. Milk - based formula is derived from cow's milk which has lower lactos e content than human milk. During the manufacturing process, additional lactose is added to milk -based formulas to bring the amount closer to that of human milk. Lactose aids in the absorption of minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc and helps pr omote the growth of good bacteria. Protein The protein in standard milk -based infant formulas is derived from cow's milk protein, which has been modified to be more like breastmilk protein. Milk contains two major kinds of protein: casein and whey . Cow's m ilk is about 80 percent casein and 20 percent whey, while breastmilk is about 20 to 40 percent casein and 60 to 80 percent whey. Casein proteins form larger curds in the infant's stomach and are harder to digest. Some formulas have been manufactured to be higher in whey protein. Although this produces a formula that is more similar to breastmilk, the whey proteins in breastmilk are very different from the whey proteins in cow's milk. Lactalbumin is the major whey protein found in breastmilk, whereas lactogl obulin is the major whey protein of cow's milk. Lactoglobulin has a greater potential for causing protein allergy than lactalbumin. Some parents may think goat's milk is a good alternative if their infant is allergic to cow's milk protein, but g oat's milk also contains lactoglobulin, which makes it a poor substitute for an infant formula . 34 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Fats Cow's milk contains butterfat, which is difficult for the infant to digest. When cow's milk -based infant formulas are produced, manufacturers remove the butterfat and replace it with vegetable oils, which are easier to digest. Vegetable oils are added in a specific amount to create a formula that is more similar to human milk. Standard milk -based infant formulas may include v arious combinations of fats including palm, soy, coconut , sunflower, safflower, or essential fatty acids (Omega 3 and 6). Milk-Based Infant Formulas with Special Characteristics Many infants go through periods of fussiness as a normal part of development. In some cases the fussiness may be accompanied by brief periods of constipation, gas or spitting up. While these are normal baby behaviors, and most infants outgrow these periods fairly quickly, formula manufacturers have designed and marketed formulas to address these issues. Modifications to milk -based infant formulas include: Lactose -free or reduced -lactose formulas Formulas with added rice starch Lactose -Free and Reduced -Lactose Infant Formulas Reduced lactose formulas are milk -based infant formulas that partially or fully replace the l actose in the formula with corn maltodextrin, corn syrup and/or sucrose . According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), there is no clinical advantage to reduced lactose and lactose -free formulas as compared with standard lactose -containing formula s. Chapter 1 35 July 2014 Note: Milk-based formulas are never completely lactose- free due to the addition of prebiotics. They are approximately 99.8% percent lactose- free. Infant Formulas with Added Rice Starch Infant formulas with added rice starch are designed for infants wh o spit up due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD ). For more information on GERD, see Chapter 2, Lesson 1 Gastrointestinal Issues . A portion of the carbohydrate (lactose) in these formulas is replaced with a special rice starch. These formulas are slightly thicker than regular formula when prepared, and become even thicker when combined with stomach acid. Infants with reflux may spit up less on thickened formula. This added rice starch is different than adding rice cereal to regular formula. Infant formulas with added rice starch should not be given to preterm infants due to their immature digestive systems. Note: WIC does not recommend that parents or caregivers use cereal to thicken formula as it alters the nutrient composition . Soy-Based Formulas Soy-based infant formulas (soy formulas) contain protein derived from soy rather than cow's milk. Soy -based formulas are free of cow's milk protein and lactose. These formulas contain soy -protein with certain amino acids added to improve the quality of the protein and make it more like breastmilk . The fat content of soy formulas is from vegetable oils. The carbohydrate source of soy formula may be corn maltodextrin, corn syrup solids , or sucrose. Soy formulas have been used since 1929 for infants with intolerance to milk -based formulas. New evidence is changing the 36 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module reasons why soy formulas might be recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) has issued recommendations for the use of soy formulas in infant feeding which include: 1. In full term infants, soy- based formulas are indicated for use in place of milk -based formula in the following two situations: (a) for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency (rare) and (b) in s ituations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred. 2. For infants with documented cow milk protein allergy, extensively hydrolyzed protein formula should be considered, because 10% percent to 14% percent of these infants will also have a soy protein allergy. 3. Most previously -well infants with acute gastroenteritis can continue to use breastmilk or milk-based formulas after they are rehydrated. Soy - based formulas may be indicated if the infant has short term lactose intolerance as a result of the gastroenteritis . 4. There is no advantage to soy -based formula over milk-based formula as a supplement for a breastfed infant, unless the infant has one of the indications noted in item 1. 5. Soy-based formulas are not designed for or recommended for preterm infants. 6. The rout ine use of soy -based formula has no proven value in the prevention or management of infant colic or fussiness. 7. Infants with documented cow milk protein- induced enteropathy or enterocolitis frequently are as sensitive to soy protein and should not be given soy- based formula. They should be provided formula derived from hydrolyzed protein or synthetic amino acids. Chapter 1 37 July 2014 8. The routine use of soy -based formula has no proven value in the prevention of atopic dermatitus in healthy or high -risk infants. Activi ty Check in with your Training Supervisor. 1. What is the current bid milk -based and soy -based formula for Oregon WIC? 2. Why does WIC use bid formulas? 3. Share 2 of the recommendations for use of soy -based formula. Note: Non-bid formulas are considered medical formulas and require medical documentation to be issued. Refer to the Food Package Module for information on medical documentation and issuing medical formulas. Proteins in Infant Formulas While most infants do just fine on standard formulas, some have problems with the proteins in formula. Milk -based and soy -based formula s are made with intact proteins , meaning the protein is a long chain of amino acids . These intact proteins are harder for some infants to digest and are more likely to trigger allergic reactions. Some formulas have proteins that have been modified t o make them easier to digest and less likely to produce an allergic reaction. Hydrolysis is the process by which proteins are modified to produce smaller protein particles called peptides and fr ee amino acids . These are hydrolyzed or protein hydrolysate formulas 38 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Protein hydrolysate formulas break the protein chain into shorter pieces called peptides . Amino acid -based elemental formulas are made from individual synthetic non-allerg enic amino acids. The smaller the protein particle, the easier it will be to digest and therefore less likely to cause an allergic reaction. For this reason, you may hear of them described as hypoallergenic formulas. All standard infant formulas (milk - based and soy - based) are made of intact protein chains that can trigger allergic reactions. Protein hydrolysate formulas break the protein chain into pieces, peptides. Helps with tolerance, may still trigger an allergic reaction. Amino acid - based elemental formulas are made from individual non - allergenic amino acids. Protein Hydrolysate Formulas Protein hydrolysate formulas can be either extensively or partially hydrolyzed and inc lude either whey or casein protein. They are designed for infants who are unable to digest or may have an allergy to the cow's milk protein in standard infant formulas. Partially hydrolyzed formulas are available in varying proportions of casein and whey proteins. Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not recommended once an infant has developed a milk allergy because the proteins are not completely broken down and have been Chapter 1 39 July 2014 known to cause allergic reactions. Oregon WIC does not provide these formulas. The protein hydrolysate formulas that Oregon WIC provides are all extensively hydrolyzed casein formulas. Composition of Casein Hydrolysate Formulas Protein Casein hydrolysate formulas are supplemented with three amino acids to provide a complete balance of protein. Although allergic reactions to casein hydrolysate formulas are rare, there are some infants who will need the proteins broken down to single amino acids. Fat Some casein hydrolysate formulas contain medium -chain triglycerides (MCT) as the majo r fat source. \"Medium -chain\" refers to the length of the fat molecule. MCT oils are easier to digest and absorb than f ats with greater chain lengths such as corn, soy, or safflower oils. Infants and children who have a difficult time digesting and absorbin g longer chain fats in foods may benefit from formulas with MCT oil. Carbohydrate All casein hydrolysate formulas are lactose free. Carbohydrate sources include corn maltodextrin, sucrose, corn syrup solids and modified corn starch. Indications for Use of Casein Hydrolysate Formulas: 1. Allergies to cow's milk proteins and soy protein 2. Infants with documented intestinal damage due to milk allergy are often equally sensitive to soy protein and should not be given soy formula routinely. They should be provide d with casein hydrolysate formula. 3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 4. Malabsorption 40 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module 5. Casein hydrolysate formulas that contain MCT oil are appropriate for conditions such as short bowel , pancreatic insufficiency, cholestasis , and cystic fibrosis . 6. Possible prevention of milk allergy for infants with a strong family history of allergies. Note: There is no evidence to support the use of casein hydrolysate formula in the treatment of colic, sleeplessness or irritability. Disadvantages to using casein hydrolysate for mulas include poor acceptance by some infants due to the taste and higher cost to the family. Amino Acid -Based Elemental Formulas For many infants with protein allergies, hydrolysate formulas work to relieve their allergy symptoms. However, some infants with protein allergies may have an allergic response to the shorter peptide component s in hydrolysate formulas. These infants with severe allergies will do best on amino acid -based elemental formulas. The proteins in these formulas are broken dow n to elemental single amino acids so that they can be easily absorbed and digested. Composition of Amino Acid -Based Elemental Formulas The protein source is comprised of 100% single amino acids, the fat source contains appr oximately 33% medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to aid in absorption and are lactose free. Indications for Use of Amino Acid-Based Elemental Formulas: 1. Allergies to cow's milk proteins and soy protein 2. Multi ple food protein i ntolerance 3. Skin, respiratory and/o r gastrointestinal symptoms caused by food protein allergy Chapter 1 41 July 2014 4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) caused by food protein allergy 5. Short Bowel Syndrome 6. Malabsorption 7. Other GI disorders , such as Eosinophilic Esophagitis Post- Discharge Formulas for Preterm Infants Infant s who are born prematurely at 37 weeks or less gestation are at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to decreased body stores of nutrients at birth and increased demands for growth. Most of the infant's energy, protein, mineral and other nutrients reserves are stored during the last trimester . Prior to hospital discharge, premature/low birth weight infants may receive a n in-hospital premature formu la that is very high in certain nutrients, calories and protein. These formulas are designed to help the infant attain growth and bone mineralization close to what they would have, had they not been born early. In Oregon, it is uncommon for an infant to be discharged on an in - hospital premature formula. Typical ly, the infant is changed to a post-discharge or transitional formula designed for premature infants. Post -discharge formulas have a calorie, protein and nutrient content about halfway between in-hospital premature formula and standard infant formula designed for full term infants. Prema ture infants may have trouble digesting and absorbing nutrients . To help with this , post-discharge formulas have modified carbohydrates and fats that are more easil y absorbed. Because of these modifications, it is important to note that while it may be appropriate in certain situations to concentrate standard infant 42 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module formula to a higher calorie level, it is not the same as a post - discharge formula for a preterm infant . There are no definitive guidelines describing when to discontinue an infant from post -discharge formula . Birth weight, rate of weight gain, developmental status and medical conditions are considered when deciding the appropriate time to discontinue use. Your agency WIC nutritionist has access to additional resources such as the Nutrition Practice Care Guidelines for Preterm Infants in the Community and can answer your questions about formulas for premature infants . Toddler /Follow -up Formulas Parents and caregivers may ask about the use of toddler or follow - up formulas. These formulas are marketed by formula companies for infants who are at least 9 months of age and are eating solid foods. Toddler formulas are higher in calcium and protein than standa rd milk -based or soy -based formulas. These formulas are more expensive than standard formulas and are not nutritionally necessary for most infants and toddlers. It is developmentally normal for the infant to decrease the amount of formula they drink when they begin to eat solid foods. Oregon WIC does not currently allow Toddler/follow -up formula s. Activit y Use the Job aid: Infant Formula Decision Process and the Job aid : Infant Medical Formulas for Qualifying Medical Conditions to list one reason for the use and the names of the formulas Oregon WIC provides for each of the following types of formula : 1. Formula with added rice starch 2. Soy-based formula Chapter 1 43 July 2014 3. Protein hydrolysate formula 4. Post-discharge formula for preterm infants 5. Amino Acid-Based elemental formulas Talk with your local WIC Nutritionist about formulas that are on the market but Oregon WIC does not currently provide. 6. What type of formulas does this include? Other Nutrients and Additives As new things are learned about the composition and qualities of human milk, formula manufacturers strive to make these additions and changes to their products. Parents and caregivers may ask questions about some of these additives. The following are some additions that have been made t o infant formulas. DHA/ARA DHA (Omega -3) and ARA (Omega -6) are fatty acids that occur naturally in breastmilk. These fatty acids have been found to be concentrated in the brain and eye. S tudies have shown these fatty acids are important for achieving optimal mental and visual development. Preterm infants have decreased stores of DHA and ARA and are inefficient in producing their own DHA and ARA. Probiotics and Prebiotics A baby's intestines are colonized with bacteria soon after birth . Two main factors that determine the types of bacteria are the baby's diet and whether the baby is born by cesarean section or 44 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module vaginally. Studies have shown that the intestines of babies born vaginally and fed breast milk contain great er quantities and varieties of benefici al bacteria than the intestines of babies born by cesarean section and/or who are formula -fed. A complex mix of prebiotics and probiotics are transferred to the infant through breastmilk . They act to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria early in life. Some f ormula manufacturers have begun adding prebiotics and probiotics to their for mulas in order to try to mimic the effects of these naturally occurring prebiotics and probiotics. There are no current recommendations about the use of probiotics or prebi otics for infant s. Probiotics are live microorganisms, commonly known as \"good\" bacteria that help to keep the \"bad\" bacteria to a minimum in the gastrointestinal tract. They also boost immunity to fight disease by stimulating anti -inflammatory agents. Com mon types of probiotics you may read on formula labels include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Prebiotics are carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion by stomach acid and enzymes. They pass intact to the lower gastrointestinal tract, and fuel the growth of naturally occurring beneficial bacteria. Beneficial bacteria serve many health -protective functions. They ferment carbohydrates in the colon to produce acids which make the gut environment more acidic, which inhibits the growth of potentiall y harmful bacteria. This is thought to be one of the reasons why breastfed infants experience fewer occurrences of diarrhea and other types of infections than do formula -fed infants. In addition, these helpful bacteria line the intestinal wall, acting as a barrier to help prevent disease -causing bacteria and potential allergens from entering the body. Other beneficial effects include better mineral absorption and the use of vitamins, such as vitamin K and folic acid. Common types of prebiotics you may see o n formula labels include galacto -oligosaccharides (GOS) and fructo -oligosaccharide (FOS). Chapter 1 45 July 2014 Fluoride Fluoride is a mineral which is essential for tooth and bone formation. However, in excess quantities, it can cause a condition known as fluorosis . Some water systems have fluoride, others do not. Fluoride is present in only small amounts in infant formulas to prevent excess consumption of this mineral. Infants younger than 6 months do not need fluoride supplements regardless of whether they are breastfed or formula fed. After 6 months of age , fluoride supplementation is recommended for infants whose water does not contain adequate fluoride . Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is essential to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism . The recommended minimum daily intake of vitamin D is 400 IU/ day for infants beginning in the first few days of life. All formulas sold in the United States have at least 400 IU vitamin D per liter (33.8 ounces) of formula . Most formula -fed infants drink nearly one liter of formula per day after the first month of life and will achieve a vitamin D intake of 400 IU/day. H ealth care provider s may suggest a supplement of vitamin D if the infant is drinking less than a liter of formula . Vitamin D supplements are also recommended for infants who receive a mixture of breastmilk and formula , since breastmilk contains insufficient quanti ties of vitamin D . Activit y 1. Ask your training supervisor about the fluoride level of the water systems serving your area. 2. Which of the added nutrients listed above are found in the standard bid milk -based formula WIC provides? 46 Lesson 1 -3 Types of Infant Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Chapter 1 47 July 2014 Lesson Level: 1 Other Milks Objectives After completing this lesson you will be able to: Identify two reasons why cow's milk should not be given to infants. Overview The WIC program does not provide cow's milk, goat's milk, soy based beverages or any othe r grain or nut based beverages for infants. This lesson will help you understand the reasons why WIC doesn't provide them and help you answer questions you may get from parents or caregivers. Cow's Milk Cow' s milk, including whole, 2%, 1% and non-fat, is not recommended for infants during the first year of life due to a number of nutritional and medical problems that can result. Listed below are reasons why the AAP does not recommend babies be fed cow's milk during the first year of life. Cow's milk contai ns very little iron, vitamin E, vitamin C and other 1-4 48 Lesson 1-4 Other Milks Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module nutrients as compared to breastmilk or infant formula. This may result in iron deficiency anemia and other nutritional deficiencies. Iron deficiency anemia may lead to long -term changes in learning and be havior that might not be reversible with iron supplements. Cow's milk can cause blood loss from the intestinal tract. Large curds can form in the stomachs of babies who drink cow's milk. As these curds pass through the intestines, they can cause scraping a nd bleeding, leading to blood loss in the stool. Over time, this can lead to iron -deficiency anemia. Since cow's milk is three to five times higher in protein, sodium, potassium and chloride as compared to breastmilk and infant formula, the kidneys of infa nts who consume cow's milk have difficulty processing these nutrients. This places a strain on immature kidneys and can lead to serious dehydration . Cow's milk contains proteins that are more likely to cause allergic reactions in infants. Goat's Milk Goat 's milk is not a good substitute for breastmilk or infant formula. Goat's milk is deficient in a number of nutrients including iron, folate, vitamins C and D, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6 and pantothenic acid. Some brands of goat's milk are fortified with vitamin D and folate, but others are not. Like cow's milk, goat's milk contains excess amounts of sodium, protein, potassium and chloride, which are not suitable for the infant's immature kidney to process. Chapter 1 49 July 2014 The fat in goat's milk is easier to digest than the fat in cow's milk, but the lack of some nutrients and excess of other nutrients makes it inappr opriate for feeding to infants. Goat's milk is not a good substitute for infants who have an allergy to cow's milk -based infant formula. The protein in goat's milk is similar enough to cow's milk protein that infants who are allergic to cow's milk formula will likely be allergic to goat's milk as well. Soy, Grain or Nut -Based Beverages (e.g., Soy Milk, Rice Milk, Almond Milk ) While beverages such as s oy milk , rice milk, almond milk and other grain or nut -based milks are are referred to as milk, they are not milk or formula and should not be fed to infants. These beverages are usually fortified with calcium, vitamins A and D, B12 and riboflavin, however, they are very low in calories, fat and protein compared to the infant's needs. Although the soy based beverage s that are approved by WIC have more nutrients than others, they still don't have the combination of nutrients and calories that are needed by infant s. Use of these beverages can be dangerous to an infant's health. Malnutrition has been reported in infants when these beverages are consumed as their only or major source of nutrition. 50 Lesson 1-4 Other Milks Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Activit y 1.

Participant Handout: Common infant problems: diarrhea Participant Handout: Common infant problems: spitting up Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? 2-1 54 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Overview When counseling families about feeding their infants, it is common to hear concerns about gastrointestinal issues including fussiness, gas, and cha nges in stooling patterns. WIC staff can help families understand normal baby behaviors and determine when further assessment may be necessary. This lesson will provide you with information on constipation, diarrhea, colic, gastroesophagea l reflux and vomiting . Constipation Constipation is generally defined as a condition where bowel movements are hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Although some believe that constipation is related to the frequency of the passage of stools, this may not be as important as the consistency of the stools. Part of the difficulty in determining whether an infant is constipated is that each caregiver may have a different perception of how often an infant should have a bowel movement and whether an infant's stool is \"too hard.\" Constipation is not very common among breastfed infants. Formula -fed infants tend to have firmer stools, but this does not indicate constipation. Some caregivers believe iron causes their infant to be constipated, but studies have demonstrat ed no relationship between iron -fortified infant formula and constipation. Constipation can be caused by a variety of factors such as: Dietary influences Inadequate intake of breastmilk or infant formula Incorrect dilution of infant formula Chapter 2 55 July 2014 Early introduct ion of complementary foods (solids) Excessive cow's milk intake Excessive fluid loss due to vomiting or fever Lack of movement or activity Underlying Medical Conditions Stool withholding due to rectal irritation from thermometers, vigorous wiping, diaper rash, etc. Abnormal function of the digestive tract Use of certain medications A variety of medical conditions and hormonal abnormalities Abnormal muscle tone If a caregiver complains that an infant is constipated, assess the infant's diet with a focus on the dietary influences listed above and the following : The adequacy of breastmilk or infant formula intake Proper infant formula preparation and dilution if formula -fed Whether appropriate types and amounts of complementary foods are consumed Premature introduction of complementary foods if the infant is less than 4 months old Note: More information about constipation and guidance on when to refer the infant to an HCP for medical ev aluation is found on the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and Whe n to Refer ? 56 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Activit y Using the Job A id: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? and the Participant Handout Common Infant Problems: Constipation , complete the case study below: Janie is 18 years old and a mother for the first time. She is certifying her 1 month old infant today at the WIC Clinic. Janie states that one of her concerns is that her baby is constipated. She is currently on the standard milk -based bid formula. Janie is not breastfeeding at this time. Janie asks if changing formu las will help her baby's constipation. 1. What additional information would you need to know? Janie states her infant has a bowel movement every 2 to 3 days. He seems to struggle but the stools are fairly soft. 2. What recommendations could you offer to Jani e in this situation? 3. What recommendations would you offer if Janie had reported that her infant was having very hard dry stools every 4 to 5 days? Diarrhea Diarrhea is defined as the frequent passage of loose, watery stools. Diarrhea should not be confu sed with normal stools of breastfed infants. Diarr hea in infants can be caused by: Chapter 2 57 July 2014 Consum ing contaminated food or water (possibly from improper infant formula preparation or storage techniques) A reaction to food Excessive juice consumption Use of certain medications Medical conditions or infections Malabsorption of food Diarrhea, if left untreated in an infant, can rapidly lead to dehydration which can be life -threatening and is the most common cause of hospitalizations in otherwise healthy infants . Chronic diarrhea may lead to nutrient deficiencies because food that passes through the gastrointestinal tract too quickly cannot be digested and then the nutrients cannot be absorbed. Note: Use the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to R efer? for more information about diarrhea and guidance on when to refer the infant to an HCP for medical evaluation. Use of ordinary beverages to treat diarrhea may actually worsen the condition and lead to further dehydration. In most cases of acute diarrhea, when dehydration is not present, continued feeding of the infant's usual diet is the most appropriate treatment. Caregivers should talk with the infant's HCP about the recommended treatment of diarrhea and should not self -treat. The following are recommend ations during acute diarrhea without dehydration: For b reastfed infants , continue to breastfeed on demand. For f ormula -fed infants , continue offering usual amounts of infant formula. Reduced -lactose or lactose -free infant formula is usually not necess ary. 58 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Do not dilute infant formula with additional water as this alters the caloric and nutrient content . For in fants eating complementary foods , and children continue to receive their usual diet during diarrhea, emphasizing complex carbohydrates (such as r ice, wheat, and potatoes) and meats (especially chicken). Reinforce the message that i nfants should not be fed ordinary beverages such as carbonated beverages, sport drinks, fruit juice, tea, o r chicken broth. Avoid withholding food for more than 24 hours. Do not use the \"BRATT\" diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, tea and toast). It is no longer recommended due to the restriction of calories and nutrients. Depending on the infant's condition, an HCP may prescribe an appropriate oral rehydration solution (O RS) to prevent and treat dehydration resulting from diarrhea. ORS should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider . The AAP Practice Guidelines recommend that infants with diarrhea who are dehydrated should receive ORS therapy until their dehydration is resolved, and then they should be fed their age- appropriate diets, including breastmilk or full- strength milk -based formulas. Parents should be aware that the ORS replaces fluid and electrolyte losses but does not stop diarrhea and the dia rrhea is likely to continue for thre e to seven days. Activity ` Using the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? and the Participant Handout Common Infant Problems: Diarrhea , complete the case study below: Chapter 2 59 July 2014 Donna reports that she is mixing her 7 month old baby's formula at half strength due to the baby having diarrhea. She previously has been tolerating the milk -based bid formula and consuming baby foods. She has been having diarrhea since yesterday. Donna's mother told her to give the baby more juice and less formula until the diarrhea went away. Donna asks if she should switch her baby's formula today since she is in the clinic to pick up benefits. 1. What recommendations would you make to Donna regarding her infant's diarrhea? Colic Colic is described as prolonged, inconsolable crying that appears to be related to stomach pain and discomfort (infants may pull their legs up in pain) often in the late afternoon or early evening. It usually develops between 2 to 6 weeks of age and may continue until the infant is 3 to 4 months old. The cause of colic is unknown. Persistent crying is somet imes mistakenly thought of as colic. Parents are often convinced that persistent crying is related to feeding and they might give up breastfeeding or switch to a different formula to address the problem. For more information on persistent crying, see the Baby Behaviors Online Course. Colic is very common, affecting one in four newborns. The reason for the irritability is not tota lly clear but includes: An immaturity of the baby's nervous system Sleeping disruption Hypersensitivity to the environment Sensory overload Formula -fed infants seem to experience colic more often than breastfed infants 60 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Colic has been associated with in fants fed fruit juices containing sorbitol, such as apple, white grape, and pear juice . Only a small fraction of babies who have colic will actually be suffering from an identifiable medical conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or food allergie s. Recommendation s for managing colic indicate that in most cases, what is needed is a lot of patience. Other recommendations include the following: Parents and other family members can take turns with the baby's care. Infant massage, soothing music, and swaddling can help the days pass for a colicky baby. Breastfed infants may benefit from breastfeeding mothers eliminat ing dairy products and/or gas forming foods from their diet. Breast milk oversupply and/or overactive let -down is often misdiagnosed as colic in breastfed infants. If acid reflux is suspected, the HCP may prescribe medic ation. If colic persists in conjunction with food allergies, the baby's formula may be changed to one that is hypoallergenic. Colic usually resolves by the time the infant is 3 months old. Colicky infants typically continue to gain weight and grow normally. Note : Use the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? for more information abou t colic and guidance on when to refer the infant to an HCP for medical ev aluation. If symptoms worsen, such as a change in baby's behavior or body language or sudden vomiting, refer to a health -care provider. Chapter 2 61 July 2014 Activit y Using the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? and the Participant Handout Common Infant Problems: Colic , complete the case study below: Rhonda, a new mom of a 2 -week old son, is in the clinic to add him to the WIC program. She looks exhausted and informs you that the baby has had severe colic. He has been crying nonstop. She is giving him formula and breastmilk. 1. What additional information would you need to obtain? 2. What advice could you offer to Rhonda regarding her infant's colic? Gastroesophageal Reflux Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a condition in which stomach contents flows backwards into the esophagus. It is normal for babies and young children to occasionally spit -up small amounts of breastmilk or formula following a feeding, especially when being burped or when having a diaper changed. This happens because the ring of muscles that separates the top of the stomach from the esophagus is not fully developed or not working properly. In most cases, GER resolves without intervention by the age of 8 to 18 months when the infant sits upright more or walks and eats more solid foods. GER, although usually a benign condition, can range from mild spitting -up to a more severe form that may cause stomach contents to get inhaled into the lungs ( aspiration ), failur e to thrive, lung disease, or inflammation of the esophagus. Spitting -up is the mildest form of GER. Growt h and health is not affected, and symptoms improve with time. Spitting up can be a result of: 62 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Immaturity of the ring of muscles that separates the top of the stomach from the esophagus . Overfeeding: Many young infants cannot consume large volumes of milk or food at one time. If the infant's weight -for-length is at or above the 95th percentile, it ma y indicate overfeeding . Swallowing air before or during feeding: Start feeding before the infant becomes frantic and is crying; position the bottle so that the nipple is filled with milk; burp the baby frequently. Excessive stimulation: create a calm, relaxed feeding environment. In the infant who has been diagnosed with uncomplicated GER or the \"happy spitter,\" parental education and reassurance are helpful and generally no other intervention is needed . Gastroesophageal -reflux disease (GERD) is a serious problem that can lead to serious health consequences. GERD in infants is GER that is complicated by one or more of the following: Weight loss, if pain or discomfort from acid reflux causes refusal to eat or when too much of what is ea ten is lost. Inflammation or erosion of tissue in the esophagus from chronic exposure to stomach acid \u2014 if erosion is severe, blood loss resulting in anemia may occur. Inflammation can also lead to scarring and narrowing of the esophagus. Aspiration of stomach contents into the airways of the lungs \u2014 repeated aspiration can lead to chronic lung disease or pneumonia, which can result in permanent damage to the lungs. Chapter 2 63 July 2014 Very few otherwise healthy infants have GERD. GERD may happen in the following situations: Infants or children with neurological or developmental disabilities are especially prone to GERD and their condition tends to be more severe and persistent. Low muscle tone is common with conditions such as Down syndrome. Slouching can put more pressure on the stomach and forces food back up into the esophagus. Children with low muscle tone also tend to get constipated more frequently, which can make reflux worse by \"backing up\" the system. GERD can occasionally be caused by stress resulting from problems i n the relationship between the infant and caregiver or any other type of environmental stress. Emotional stress affects movement in the gastrointestinal tract. Signs of GERD may include one or more of the following symptoms: Vomiting/spitting up Irritabili ty and/or crying Refusal or aversion to feeding Weight loss Wheezing/coughing/asthma Swallowing frequently Drooling Night time awakening with unexplained irritability Arching backwards (especially during and after a feeding) Pneumonia Apnea (episodes of n ot being able to breathe) Treatment of GERD must be prescribed by a health care provider and usually consists of: 64 Lesson 2 -1 Gastrointestinal Issues Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Smaller and more frequent feedings \u2014 if smaller feedings do not help, the health care provider may prescribe a concentrated formula to give th e infant adequate nutrients with a smaller amount of formula. Tube feedings may be required in extreme cases. Positioning at night \u2014 this recommendation should be made by the baby's health care provider and not by WIC staff. Laying the infant on their stomach, with the head of the bed elevated has been shown to reduce reflux symptoms and is sometimes recommended by health care provider s. However, since the AAP recommends that all healthy infants sleep on their back to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrom e (SIDS), recommendations have been modified. Laying the baby on their stomach is acceptable while the baby is awake, particular ly after feeding . Changing formula \u2014 unless vomiting is due to an allergy, changing formula is usually not effective in reducing symptoms of GERD. W hen a cow's milk protein al lergy is present, t he incidence of vomiting can be reduced by changing to a hypoallergenic formula. Thickening formula \u2014 adding cereal to formula is a traditional treatment which is controversial because it may reduce the number of episodes of vomiting but not reflux symptoms. Cereal added to formula is not recommended as it can add unwanted calories, leading to obesity, and it can dilute the other nutrients in formula. Rice starch added formula \u2014 as you've learned in a previous chapter, these formulas thicken in the presence of stomach acid. Effectiveness may be reduced if acid reducing medications are prescribed. Chapter 2 65 July 2014 Medication \u2014 medications may be given to increase the rate of stomach emptying or to decrease or neutralize stomach acid. Surgery \u2014 an infant with neurological problems is less likely to respond to medicine and positioning, and more likely to require surgery. Psychological counseling may be needed to resolve the problems between the infant and caregiver if stress is contributing to \"nervous vomiting.\" Vomiting Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of the stomach contents, unlike the passive movement of GER. Vomiting can be related to: Illnes s \u2014 may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Allergy or intolerance \u2014 usually accompanied by diarrhea, rash, or respiratory symptoms such as wheezing or congestion. Inborn errors of metabolism \u2014 usually accompanied by failure to thrive, neurologic symptoms, seizures, or developmental delay. Structural problems in the gastrointestinal tract, such as the narrowing of the opening from the stomach into the small intestine called pyloric stenosis .

Amanda has a 2 -month- old baby and she states that she is worried that the baby spits up a lot. Amanda says she runs out of formula from WIC every month and that her baby drinks about 40 ounces of formula every day. Amanda is bouncing the baby on her knee during the class after feeding her a bottle. The baby spits up and Aman da says \"See, this is what she does all the time!\" 1. What advice could you offer Amanda regarding her baby's spitting up? Tonia is in class today as well and comments that she is also having trouble with her 4 -month- old baby spitting up. She says she has tried four different formulas and the baby continues to spit up. She has tried two milk - based formulas and a lactose -free formula but the baby is vomiting all of these. Her friend had the same problem with her baby and adding cereal to the formula helped. Tonia wants to know if she can get cereal today with her WIC benefits. 2. What advice could you offer Tonia regarding her baby's vomiting? Chapter 2 67 July 2014 Lesson Level: 1 Food Allergies and Intolerance Objectives After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Define the difference between food allergy and food intolerance. Identify differences between lactose intolerance and cow's milk protein allergy. Materials Needed Participant Handout: Common infant problems: food allergies Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? Overview An adverse food reaction is any negative physical reaction caused by eating a food. Adverse food reactions can be divided into two main groups: food allergy and food intolerance. A food allergy is an inappropriate response of the immune system that is triggered when a food is eaten by a person and that results in symptoms throughout the body involving several systems (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, nervous system, skin and mucous membranes ). Another term for an allergic reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction (a term us ed interchangeably with allergy) . Food intolerance is a n adverse reaction to food that results in physical symptoms but is not cause d by an immune system reaction. 2-2 68 Lesson 2 -2 Food Allergies and Intolerance Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Food Allergy A food allergy is the body's call to action in response to an attack on the immune system by a food. When the body recognizes that a specific substance is a threat, it produces antibodies in response t o the threat. Most food -allergy reactions happen within a few minutes to two hours after the food is eaten. Other reactions may be delayed up to 48 hours after eating the allergy- causing food. Symptoms vary tremendously between people. Differences can include the type of symptom(s) that will appear, where they appear, how severe they are, the amount of time from when the food is eate n to when the symptoms are seen, and the amount of food that triggers the reaction. Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Hives Sneezing Anaphylaxis Nausea Rashes Congestion Failure to thrive Gas Vomiting Eczema Chronic coughing without an infection Diarr hea Swelling of lips, tongue, throat, or face Asthma Bloating Itchiness Food allergies affect about 6 percent of children who are un der the age of 3 . Eight foods cause 90 percent of all allergic reactions , these include : milk, eggs, peanuts, fish, shellfish, soy, wheat, and tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans, almonds, and cashews ). A child will usually outgrow allergic reactions to the protein in eggs or cow's milk by age 5. Chapter 2 69 July 2014 Anaphylactic reaction is the most severe allergic response. It occurs when the whole body becomes overwhelmed with the response to an allergen . Even though rare, it is the most severe and dangerous symptom of an allergy, and can result in death if not treated immediately. Symp toms of anaphylactic reaction include: Difficulty in breathing Dizziness Swelling of lips, tongue, throat, fa ce, and skin Irregular heartbeat Changes in blood pressure Shock The foods that are most likely to cause an anaphylactic reaction include peanuts, shellfish, eggs, and tree nuts. Children with this severe of allergic reactions will always need to have appropriate medicine available to immediately treat these symptom s. Cow's milk allergy Cow's milk is one of the most common allergenic foods in infanc y and often gets confused with lactose intolerance. Milk allergy is caused by an immune reaction to the proteins in milk, whereas lactose intolerance is caused by the body's inability to produce sufficient quantitites of the digestive enzyme , lactase. If an infant is allergic to the proteins in milk -based infant formulas, they are most likely going to present with allergic response within the first year of life. Symptoms most commonly present in the skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. Some infants may present with breathing difficulties or asthma -like symptoms. Blood in the stool can be associated with cow's milk allergy and it may be difficult to see but can cause iron -deficiency anemia. If the milk -allergic infant cannot be breastfed, extensively hydrolyzed formulas are the best alternative. A small number of infants may still react to the protein in these formulas and may need an amino acid based, elemental formula in which the proteins are broken down in to single amino acides. Many children can out grow their cow's milk allergy by their fifth birthday. 70 Lesson 2 -2 Food Allergies and Intolerance Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Food Intolerance Food intolerance differs from a food allergy (hypersensitivity) in that it is an abnormal reaction to an ingested food not caused by an immune response. There are three types of food i ntolerance: Pharmacologic reaction \u2014 the body's response to a natural or added chemical that produces an effect resembling that of a drug. One e xample of a natural chemical is caffeine in tea or coffee. Food toxicity \u2014 reaction caused by toxins contained in the food or released by microorganisms that contaminate the food. Mercury and pesticides are chemicals that are toxic to everyone and are considered examples of chemical contamination. Metabolic reactions \u2014 the body's inability to metabolize certain components of food . Lactose intolerance is a metabolic reaction that is the most common food intolerance. Lactose Intolerance Lactose is the sugar in the milk of most mammals and in breast milk. Lactose enhances the absorption of a number of minerals including calcium, magnesium, and zinc . Lactase is the enzyme that is naturally present in breast milk and also found in the small intestine. The purpose of intestinal lactase is to break down lactose so that it can be absorbed. Full -term infants are able to dig est lactose. Lactase activity can be very low in premature infants, since lactase does not reach a peak until 34 to 38 weeks gestation. Lactose intolerance is when there is not enough lactase present to help break down the lactose that has been consumed. There are three kinds of lactose intolerance: Congenital lactase deficiency \u2014 an extremely rare genetic condition that exists when lactase is very low or absent at birth. Chapter 2 71 July 2014 Secondary lactase deficiency \u2014 temporarily low amounts of lactase as a result of: Intestinal infection or virus, Certain antibiotics, or Physical conditions that affects the cells lining the intestine. Adult (or late -onset) lactase deficiency \u2014 a genetic condition that does not occur in infants, is more common in adults and older children, especially from certain ethnic groups. Approximately 10 to 20% percent of white adults, up to 50% of North American Hispanic adults, about 80% percent of African - American adults, and 80 to 100 % of Asian adults are lactase deficient. Lactose intolerance i s very rare before the age of 2 to 3 years. Since lactase is present in breast milk, it is extremely rare for a breastfed infant to have lactose intolerance. Cow's milk protein allergy is often mistaken for lactose intolerance in breastfed babies. For a per son with lactose intolerance, even very small amounts of lactose can cause severe watery diarrhea because undigested lactose actually acts as a laxative. You may hear from fam ilies that their baby is experiencing diarrhea as a result of a gastrointestinal illness (e.g. rotovirus ), or a course of antibiotics. This is most likely a temporary situation called secondary lactase deficiency and not a cow's milk allergy. D iarrhea associated with secondary lactase deficiency is caused by injury, damage to the intestinal lining where lactase is made. When intestinal injury happens, the first enzyme to be affected and the last to recover completely is lactase. Recommendations for infants recovering from an acute episode of diarrhea include: After initial rehydration, most infants can be continued on breastmilk or standard infant formula. A lactose restricted diet is not required. 72 Lesson 2 -2 Food Allergies and Intolerance Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module If diarrhea persists, then a lactose -free formula such as a soy - based formula or a protein hydrolysate formula can be used until the dia rrhea resolves. Infants who are on a mixed diet of solid foods with formula or with breastmilk sometimes have diarrhea of shorter duration, because they are exposed to less lactose than babies who are consuming only breastmilk or standard, milk- based infa nt formula. Note: For more information on the use of protein hydrolysate formulas see Chapter 1, Lesson 3 Types of Formula . For more information on diarrhea see Chapter 2, Lesson 1 Gastrointestinal Issues. Differences between Lactose Intolerance and Cow's Milk Allergy Lactose Intolerance Cow's Milk Allergy Cause Reaction after intake of too much lactose in relation to the body's ability to break it down by the enzyme lactase Immune response to one or more cow's -milk proteins; immaturity of infant's digestive and immune processes likely contributes to this condition When does it start? After intestinal lining is injured by severe infection, medication, or disease. Infancy and early childhood, very rare, especially in adults How common is it? Uncommon before 2 to 3 years of age; considered over-diagnosed Rare: 0.3 -7.5 percent of children Chapter 2 73 July 2014 Lactose Intolerance Cow's Milk Allergy Possible symptoms Gas, abdominal bloating, pain (cramps), diarrhea Variable and broad; gastro intestinal, skin, respiratory, systemic (see list of symptoms of food allergies on page 68) Outlook Temporary depending on the extent of the intestinal damage and whether the infant was dehydrated Usually outgrown by age 5 Management Formula -Fed Infants: Usually can be continued on milk -based formula; may need a lactose -free formula temporarily until symptoms resolve Children : Limited amounts of milk and milk products can be included in the diet. Drink small amounts of milk; drink milk with food or meals; eat yogurt with active cultures and most cheeses; try lactose - reduced milk and lactase enzyme preparations Strict avoidance of cow's milk and cow's milk protein may be needed 74 Lesson 2 -2 Food Allergies and Intolerance Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Activit y Using the Job Aid: Baby Behaviors: What is Normal and When to Refer? and the Participant Handout Common Infant Problems: Food Allergies , complete the case study below: Linda states her 2 -month -old baby has a rash and occasional diarrhea on the current milk -based bid formula. Her older child had the same problems with milk-based formula as an infant. 1. Do you think Linda's baby is showing symptoms of a cow's milk allergy or lactose intolerance? 2. What are three symptoms of food allergies? Chapter 2 75 July 2019 Lesson Level: 1 Changing Formulas Objectives After completing this lesson, you will be able to: \u0001 Instruct a parent or caregiver on how to transition from one formula to another. Materials Needed \u0001 Participant Handout: Changing Your Baby to a New Formula Overview After reading this module, you know that infants ch ange to different formulas for all kinds of reasons. We hope that the change to a new formula helps the infant, but sometimes changing fo rmulas can be difficult for either the infant or the caregiver. T his lesson will offer some ideas for making the transition easier. A Transition Plan One common situation is an infant that has started on a formula WIC doesn't provide before they come for their firs t WIC appointment. This may be because the health care pr ovider recommended it or something as simple as the parent got a coupon in the mail. If a full-term infant enters the WIC p rogram using a non-bid formula, counsel the parent or caretaker on how to transition the infant to a bid formula. 2-3 76 Lesson 2-3 Changing Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module \u0001 Start by taking a formula history and decide whethe r the bid cow's milk-based formula is appropriate. \u0001 Provide instructions on blending new and old formul as to ease the infant through the transition. See the Particip ant Handout: Changing Your Baby to a New Formula. \u0001 Inform the parent or caretaker of the possible resu lts of switching formulas. For example, there may be a cha nge in feeding frequency or stool type. Most babies will drink any formula. Each one tastes a little different. Some babies notice this difference and it will help to begin using the new formula slowly. Here is one method you can suggest for changing an infant to a new formula: \u0001 Start by adding a small amount of the new formula t o the formula your baby is currently using. \u0001 Each day add more of the new formula so the infant slowly gets used to the different taste. \u0001 After a week the infant should be used to the new f ormula. Trying Out a New Formula If the parents or caregivers are trying a new formu la in order to solve one of the issues you learned about earlier i n this module, you can use the same transition process. \u0001 You may want to only issue one month of benefits fo r the new formula and encourage them to purchase only 1 or 2 cans to make sure it works. \u0001 Refer to the Food Package Module for more information on assigning and issuing trial formulas . Chapter 2 77 July 2019 Trial Back Infants who needed a change in formula due to an il lness such as a gastrointestinal illness, may be able to return to the standard infant bid formulas WIC offers once the illness is resolve d. The Participant Handout, Changing Your Baby to a New Formula can be used to assist with this transition. If the infant's initial intolerance problem was due to an allergy- related issue, a trial back would not be appropriat e. Refer to your WIC Nutritionist/Dietitian for further assessment a nd evaluation. Clinic roles for changing of formulas back to bid f ormulas Issue for the infant Type of formula Role of paraprofessional CPA's Role of RD or RN Diagnosed with GER but has since outgrown by 8 months and HCP has approved return to bid formula Formula with added rice starch for GER (e.g. Similac for Spit Up) Provide counseling and instructions for returning to bid formula Recovering from gastroenteritis and able to tolerate a milk-based formula again Hydrolyzed protein formula (e.g. Alimentum) Provide counseling and instructions for returning to bid formula Caregivers providing a reduced lactose formula but can no longer afford to pay for the formula and wants to try a milk-based formula Reduced lactose formula (e.g. Gerber Good Start) Provide counseling and instructions for returning to bid formula Refer to RD/RN if complications arise 78 Lesson 2-3 Changing Formulas Oregon WIC Training Infant Formula Module Issue for the infant Type of formula Role of paraprofessional CPA's Role of RD or RN Has been receiving a hydrolyzed protein formula due to symptoms of hives and diarrhea; Caregivers want to re-trial a milk- based formula as the other fomula is expensive Hydrolyzed protein formula (e.g. Nutramigen) Refer to RD/RN Assess status and discuss care plan with HCP; possible referral to community resources for assistance with formula Activity 1. List the basic steps in a transition plan to change to a new formula. 2. Using the table above, talk with your WIC Nutritionist or Training Supervisor about possible actions for the following situation: A family comes in requesting a change in formula fo r a 7 month old infant that had been experiencing gastroesophageal reflux and the caregiver reports t hat the infant is sitting up more and that the spitting up has improved greatly. 3.

For wo men who choose not to, or are unable to breastfeed, infant formula is available. Most infants do well on any m ilk-based formula. These infants should be issued o ur rebated milk-based formula. All formulas other than our reb ated milk-based and soy-based formulas, require the Oregon Medical Documentation form to be completed by the infant's health care provide r. \u0001 Issues of diarrhea and constipation are not include d on the Decision Process diagram. Refer to Lesson 2-1 Gastrointestinal Issues , page 53, in this module for more information on th ese topics. \u0001 If an infant comes into WIC on a soy-based formula, is tolerating it well and it is the family prefere nce to stay with a soy-based formula, that is a personal preference that WIC can provide. \u0001 This decision tree helps support the Oregon Medical Documentation form and is intended to help WIC staf f understand the connection between qualifying condit ions and requests for special medical formulas. \u0001 If you have questions regarding a formula, consult your local agency WIC Nutritionist/Dietitian or Sta te Nutrition Consultant. \u0001 WIC does not provide formula for infants while they are hospitalized. \u0001 When possible, consider short term issuance of a sp ecial medical formula and work with the health care provider and your local agency WIC Nutritionist/Dietitian to determine appropriateness of transitioning back to our rebated milk-based formula. \u0001 Refer to the Job Aids, Standard Infant Formula and Medical Formulas for more information on the curren t bid formulas.

Crying is one way a baby talks to you. As you get to know your baby, you will learn what he wants. Crying may be a sign of a problem, so it is important to respond quickly when your baby cries. A quick response also helps your baby calm down faster. Babies may cry when they are thirsty or hungry, have a wet diaper, or when they are too hot or too cold. Babies also cry when they are uncomfortable, bored, in need of attention, afraid, or hurt. Some babies may cry late in the day, when they are too tired or too excited. What can I do? Thirsty or hungry - Watch for signs of hunger, such as sucking on his lips, finger, or fist. Feed your baby before he gets too upset. Wet diaper - Change a wet or dirty diaper as soon as you know it is wet. Too cold or too hot - Take off or put on clothes or blankets to help keep your baby comfortable. Uncomfortable - Change his position in his bed or carrier. He may be stuck in an odd position, such as lying on his arm. Bored or in need of attention - Hold, rock, play with, or touch your baby. Play music, sing, talk, or read to him. Too excited or afraid - Hold, rock, and talk softly to calm your baby. If the room is noisy, try to make it quieter. Place the baby on your chest, skin to skin. Some babies like to be wrapped snugly in a blanket. Stomach pains or colic - Lay your baby on his stomach across your legs and gently pat his back or rock him. Hurt - Check for red marks or scratches. Make sure diapers and clothing are put on comfortably. Tired - He may need to sleep. Try placing him on his back and see if he settles down. This is one in a series of handouts to help parents and caregivers handle common infant problems.* What if nothing seems to help? If your baby continues to cry and you have checked for all of the above, your baby may be sick. Call your doctor or clinic for help if your baby has: A body tempera ture above 99\u00b0F Watery stools Vomiting Fewer than 6 to 8 wet diapers in a day A skin rash Crying tha t will not stop Remember: Respond quickly when your baby cries. Although crying is natural, too much crying may not be good for a baby. You cannot spoil your baby by holding him. Holding your baby will comfort him and make him feel loved and secure.

Listening to a baby cry for long periods of time can cause you stress and even anger. Babies cry for many reasons, but some cry because they have colic. What exactly is colic? The cause of colic is not known, even though it is a common problem. Babies can be fussy, but babies with colic have long periods of sudden, unexplained crying that will not stop. The crying may be due to stomach pain. Doctors often say a healthy baby is colicky if the ba by: Cries for more than three hours per day, more than three days a week, for more than threeweeks. Begins this process during the first 2 to 6 weeksof life. Stops by 3 to 4 months of age. Other signs of a colicky infant may include: Hard to calm down Stiffening of legs, pulling legs up in pain,clenching of fists Passing a lot of gas Spitting up and crying during and after a feeding Not sleeping for very long at a time Breastmilk oversupply (too much breastmilk) can cause colic in the breastfed baby. Moms with breastmilk oversupply often have constant breast fullness, leaking during and between feedings, and strong milk let-down. What can I do? Although there's no cure for colic, try the following to calm a fussy, crying infant: Play calming music or talk quietly toyour baby. Give your baby a gentle massage. Place your baby on your chest, skin toskin. Wrap your baby snugly in a blanket(swaddle). Hold your baby on his side/stomach. Gently swing or rock your baby in yourarms.
