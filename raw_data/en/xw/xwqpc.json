October 2019 To: Delegate of the Sec retary Comple mentary & OTC Medicines Branc h Therapeutic Goods Administration PO Box 100 WODEN ACT 2606 complementary.medicines@health.gov.au From: Complementary Medicines Australia PO Box 450 Mawson ACT 2606 Introduction CMA is committed to a vital and sustainable complementary medicines sector supporting domestic skilled job s, research, manufacturing and exports . CMA members include stakeholders across the value chain - including manufacturers, raw material suppliers, distributors, consultants, retailers and allied health professionals. Complementary Medicines Australia (CMA) welcomes the opportunity to make a submission in relation to proposed changes to the 26 BB Permis sible Ingredients Determin ation. Length and relevance of warning statements As a general statement relevant to all current and future consultations , we note that t he proposed warning statement s are excessively and unnecessarily lengthy . Very lengthy warning stat ements have always been strongly opposed due to pragmatic label space considerations particularly since the introduction of the TGO 92 that further introduces lab el space limit ations. The select consu mer groups that represent the genuine vie ws of everyday Australian s often report that the lengthier warning statements be come , they become increasingly less likely th ey are to be read , com prehended , or taken seriously by the consumer. In addition, propos ed warning statements are not taking into account the intended purpose of medicines for relevance . This sh ould be considered carefully so as to avoid redundant or unn ecessary regulation and avoid the nee d for future changes to the r equirements. Page 2 of 8 Boron Internal use CMA notes the alignment of the TGA's dosage recommendations on boron in children with th at of the European Medic ines Agency who have established the following limits on daily do sage: <2 years - 1 mg boron/day <12 years - 3 mg boron/day <18 years - 7 mg boron/day 18 years - 10 mg boron/day Although the princ iples are not opposed , the approach to implementing the p rinciples requires improved alignment to real world use of boron generally, to listed medicine s, and ex isting product warnings applied to listed and registered medicines . The c onsultation proposal is: When the maximum recommended daily dose of the medicine provides more than 3 mg of boron and the medicine is for internal use and/or oral application, the following warning statement is required on the label: (BORON12) 'Do not give to a child less than 12 years old as this medicine contains boron and may impair fertility in the future.'. When the maximum recommended daily dose of the medicine provides more than 1 mg of boron but less than 3 mg of boron and the medicine is for internal use and/or oral applic ation, the following warning statement is required on the label: (BORON2) 'Do not give to a child less than 2 years old as this medicine contains boron and may impair fertility in the future.' The wording of the statement above by the EMA is written in this way as it is intended for application to boron as an excip ient. A large proportion of the medicines on the ARTG that contain boron are medicines that are for an older adult population, incl uding calcium formulas, glucosamine formulas, and multivita mins for adults or older adults, and are accordingly presented as large table ts or capsules. The above wa rnings are ent irely redundant for these clas ses of medicines that would never be given to youn ger children , and these large dosage forms could never be accidentally swall owed or used by children . The proposed statements are not consistent with the longstanding TGA approach to warning statements, which is to remain succi nct and avoid raising und ue fear and distress, even where the l ink is w ell established in humans, let alone where the link is based only animal studies or other secondary sources of evidence : Page 3 of 8 For the above rea sons, CMA provides that the proposal requires amendm ent to: Remove both proposed requirements and replace with: \u00ad When the maximum recommended daily dose of the medicine provides more than 1 mg of boron , the following warning statement is required on the label: 'Not to be used in children' or 'Not to be used in children under 12 ' (at spons or discretion). Should o nly be applied to dosage forms that are accessible to children under 12, including liquids, pow ders, chewable tablets , pastilles . We do not agree with t he a pplication of lengthy warning s tatement s describing particular issues in children for me dicines that are not indicated for children. In regards to the specific reference to the boron ferti lity t heory, listed medicin es are a n insig nificant risk as they are produc ed in controlled GMP facilities with extremel y conservative quantities of boron (relative to the nutrient reference values) . The re is a fa r larger risk to children from large boron exposure via common household routes, theref ore any corresponding advice from a public health perspective is there fore far more appro priate through Government ad visory websites for consumers. Sources other than TGA medicines include : - The common trend to use borax in making slime or putty with young children . - Use of pow dered pure borax as a pesticide, as a household clea ner on floors and kitchen surfaces , as a laundry washing aid, as a pesticide in vegetable gardens, or even as a 'folk remedy ' style anti-microbial or skin healing dietary * addition (*not from TGA listed medicines). Therefore it is far more relevant and appropriate fo r the Depart ment of Health to provide general public health information about reducing children 's total exposure to boron th rough household , recrea tional , or other off -label unapproved means , than a warning statement on labels for low dose and GMP controlled medicines that are unlikely to be indicated for use in children . Page 4 of 8 External use - boron When the medicine is for topical use for dermal application, t he following warning statement is required on the label: (EXTRNL) 'For external use on unbroken skin only.' (label warning or directions for use). The term 'For external ' is redu ndant when the requirement is that it is applicable for topical use. In th e princi ple of keeping wa rnings short and relevant, 'Use on unbroken sk in only' is su fficient. Withania somn ifera The consultation propose s the label claim: 'Consult a health care professional prior to use if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.' Pregnancy ACCM provided that there is insufficient anecdotal and clinical evidence to establish that Withani a somnifera is either safe in pregnancy or is used as an a bortifacient . The rationale for this proposal is based on seven traditional texts and ethnobotanical surveys . Five refer ences suggest that its use to aid conception, pregnancy and lactation, to treat infertility and menstrual irregularities . Two references suggest from limited size e thnobotanical surveys that Withania somnif era may have been used f or abortifacient a ction, although it is not clear whether th is is used in respect of viable pregnanc y or non -viable pregnancy. Other h erbs , but not With ania, mentioned in the in the surve ys refer specifically to \"anti-fertility \" actions rather than abortifacient information alone. Herbs that have uter ine tonic actions are used in traditional herbal medicines for a variety of female c omplai nts requir ing female tonicity, including menorrheal complaints , post -partum uterine toni city and health , etc. Without access to safe surgical methods to treat non-viable pregnancy, uterine tonic herbs were also used in high doses to aid eva cuat ion of non -viable pregnancies . This context ual consideration of herbal traditions should be considered when reviewing traditional / ethnob otan ical information for herb s. Regarding the evidence : 1. The evidence selected for review is primarily tradition in nature, at the exclusion of the typically applicable experimental models used to establish risk to maternal and foetal health, such as animal toxicity studies ; 2. Of the evidence published in the consultation , the majority suggested that Withania is safe in pregnancy and lactation ; 3. The book by Sahu (1982) is very limited in relevant inform ation ; 4. Mahmood is narrative on the diversity of medicinal plants used in the Gujrawala District in Pakistan and does not discuss toxicity ; 5. Moteetee (2016) is a study an ethnobotanical survey of hundreds of plants in an area. It does not describe the interview methods or the search method performed . It concludes that 87 plants were used for several reproductive problems, and lists WS as one example for removi ng contents of concept ion, which suggests any abortif acient use i s used only for Page 5 of 8 traditional tr eatment of non -viable pregnancy and for the removal of pla centa post -partum , whereas it is also used to induce pregnancy as a uterine tonic. It does not weight WS as more dangerous than any of the other plants mentioned in the survey. 6. The following 2015 toxicity study was not included in the evidence, which1 delivered rats delivered 3g/kg/day of WS extract during org anogenesis and histogenesis and observed no evidence of fo etal toxicity, or maternal toxicity. The paper concludes that 'With ania somnifera extract caused no changes in the body weight of parental females, number of corpora lutea, implantations, viable foetuses, external , visceral malformations\". 7. The 2018 review by Azgomi on female and make reproductive health found positive effects on both reproductive systems . The search strategy included in vivo and in vitro models and included pregnancy in the search terms. No negative findings regarding pregnancy were reported. 8. The studies cited in relation to abortif acient activity would not satis fy the TGA's evidence guideline requirements for traditional evidence, which says that \"t o substantiat e the use, action o r indication of an ingredient with traditional based evidence, t he TGA Evidence Guidelines require documented evidence that the medicine has been used for at least 75years in the tradition to which it belongs. \" The evidence guidelines go on to state that 'this will establish that it belongs to that tradition and that there is an accumulated repository of observations in humans that underpins the use of the medicine. ' Whilst this discussion is not about an indication, it still relates to a proposed physi ological action of With ania . As traditional use is the majority of the evide nce cited to support this concern, the CMA suggested that the evidence listed does not suffic iently establish and a ssociated observations of the medicine in a single tradition of medicine. 9. Many couple s and women are prescribed Withania during fertility treatment by healthc are practitioners at typical doses , an indication which is supported by the traditional information available. 10. The references to the mouse study refer to the use of a \"very high \" dose . Although the traditional information is extremely scant, other Ayurvedic references also suggest that normal doses have no effect and are sa fe compared to very high doses: \"Large dosage of WS is abortifacient (Ability to cause abortion). The normal dosage is generally safe and we use it in India along with other herbs even during pregnancy .\"2 The evidence cited in support of the proposed concerns about With ania are inadequate to apply to all listed medici nes containing this ingredient , and not supported by available data. Withania somnifera is a commonly used herb for women o f child bearing age . Herbalists in Australia and around the wor ld have commonly used Withania somnife ra at standard doses as a supportive tonic for stress and other conditions, inc luding female health , for deca des. The herbal practi tioner communi ty have not developed any pa rticular concerns with Withani a in respect to pregnan cy over this time at usual dosages , similarl y, the Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN ) does not include any gynaecological reactions despite widespread use in listed medi cines for women of childbearing age. 1 Prabu 2015. Prenatal developmental toxicity evaluation of Withania somnifera root extract in FORMULATION OF HEALTH FOODS\" (2007) https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e12c/05f9d21c4890afb745e8ee278ad1d6733115.pdf Page 6 of 8 Label warning statement s regarding pregnancy and lactation are being recommended with greater frequency for listed medicine ingredients. Whilst CMA appreciates due caution be applied in these groups, in this instance, the label warning statem ent appears to contradict the traditional indications for use mentioned in the literature that support use for fer tility and preg nancy , particularly a t standard doses. In regards to the proposed wording, it's quite possible they could be taking Withania before they know they are pregnant. Consultation 'prior to' would not be possible and may results in undue distress in pregnancy women , which is not appropriate considering there is limi ted evidence relating to pre gnancy and th at which is ava ilable refers to \"very \" high do ses. Lactation There is no evidence of any kind to suggest that Withania somni fera has any adverse effe cts on women or babies during lactation. There is no known to xic compounds identified for Withania that would suggest there would be any co ncern of trans ference to brea st milk. Withania in gene ral is recognised as a widely studied , widely used herb with out t oxicity issues . There is evidence that W ithani a has been safely used for long periods of time , including Ayurvedic use, as a galacto gogue ( helps to induce milk supply) and as a uter ine tonic to he lp with post -partum recovery . In short, a warning statement in lactat ion is not only not supported, such a warning is strongly contrad icted by a vailable information and traditional use. Sum mary: There is extremely limited evidence that Withania somnifera has any adverse effect upon pregnancy. Withania is a he rb that has been very widely used by herbalists for women for deca des and has been used widely in listed herbal medicines for many years indi cated for stress in women. Desp ite this lengthy and widespread use in Australia, no conc erns with pregnancy have arisen at usual doses . There are no gynaecologic al events on the DAEN data base. The limited evidence based on the s tudy in mice is reported to only have occurred in very high do ses, and the limited traditiona l information also suggest s that any s uch action is also in relation to very hi gh do ses, although it is not clear wh ether it is used for viable pregnanc ies or only for non -viable pregnancy. Other than the limited suggestion around very hi gh dose s. Therefore the evidence available, although limited, is quite clear that there is a dose -dependent relation ship that is based on \"very \" high doses, whereas other use is recognised as safe and even indicated in pregnancy at normal dos ages . Therefore it is clearly not applica ble to apply a pregnancy warning to m edicines that do not include very high do sages of W ithania , of which there are many on the ARTG . The proposed term 'prior to' would induce unwarranted distress if a woman becomes pregnan t unexpectedl y. There is no provided evidence to contradict use in lactation. Co nver sely, there is a long history of use as a brea st milk st imul ant a nd a post partum uterine tonic. There doesn 't appear to be any valid justification fo r requiring a warning for lactation . Page 7 of claim: 'Vitex agnus -castus can affect hormones in the body and may interact with prescription medicines such as oral contraceptives. Consult your health care professional before use .' The TGA substantiates the proposed warning statement with the following e vidence, of which only one item is considered to be primary evidence. Health Canada. (2018, 03/06/2019).

Health Canada monograph contains a similar suggested warning statement, with all references for this statement being secondary and published at 2000, 2006 and 2010. No primary resources citing known mechanisms of action or actual adverse reactions regarding the or al contraceptive pill are used on the monograph to support the warning statement. 2. The EMA monograph of 2010 and which, was revised and adopted again in 2018, states no known adverse reactions under section 4.5, but also states \"Because of the possible dopaminergic and oestrogenic effects of agnus castus fruit interactions with dopamine agonists, dopamine antagonists, oestrogens and antioestrogens cannot be excluded.\" Yet under 5.1 Pharmacological effects, the same monograph says that the action is unknown. The EMA monograph does not include miscarriage or any other pregnancy complica tions under 4.8 Undesirable effects sub -heading. 3. The referenced NIH monograph warns against the use of V itex alongside the oral contraceptive pill amongst other hormonal treatments but provides no reference for this remark. Page 8 of 8 4. The reference that 'the i mpact of Vitex agnus -castu s on estrogen and progesterone metabolism is also scientifically recognise d; isn't supported by the reference (6) which refers to a wide number of herbs and their use in treating menopause , rather than ef fecti ng horm extent that OCPs are effe cted. The relevance of the statement and the reference to the proposal is not clear . The evidence does not include a 2006 systematic review of the safety of Vitex3 which also reports on adver se international adverse event data , and finds no unplanned pregnancies or interactions with women on the OCP. The single reported adverse event reg arding the progest ogen only pill, commonly known as the \"mini pill\" is not conclusive or information as th is pil l is repor ted to have a failu re rate of 9% under typical circumstances . Vitex agnus -castus has been used widely and popularly in female fertility treatment, and normalising menstr ual cycles . As noted on the TGA website it may be used at the same time as the oral contraceptive pill. However the available evidence does not document any effects on these medications . The proposed label warning statement is not supportabl e given the evidence to support it is limited and theoretical at best. Consultation Proposals The consultations are presented a lmost as if they are pre -determined, which appears as an in flexi ble appr oach , rather than fol lowing recommend ed Government guidelines , for example, present ing 4 different regulatory optio ns. We support the application of BPR for all TGA consultation s relating to listed medicines. 3 Daniele C et al. Vitex Agnus Castus: A systematic Review of Adverse Events. "}
