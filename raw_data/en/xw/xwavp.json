Recommend for meditation - Soy wax blended with premium fragrance oil - Hand poured - Non-toxic - No dyes - Approximately 40 hours burn time (as long as you do not burn your candle for more than 4 hours at a time as recommended) BURNING INSTRUCTIONS: We recommend burning for 3-4 hours at a time. Allow the melted wax to reach the edges of the jar to prevent wax from building along the sides of the jar and tunneling. Warning: Never leave a candle burning unattended or within reach of wind, pets, or small children. Cautions: The candle jar will be hot after burning, so allow the wax to cool completely before handling. "}
