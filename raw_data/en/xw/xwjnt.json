Care during the antenatal period has been the focus of improving maternal health and reproductive outcomes. Yet, evidences have shown that antenatal care alone is not enough. Initiating care before conception or preconception care could be pote ntially effective to further improve maternal health and reproductive outcomes. Preconception care encompasses a range of health promotion, risk assessment, preventative and curative interventions for women of reproductive age to reduce risks that potent ially affect reproductive outcomes. It aims to provide prospective parents information and support with regards to preconception interventions that are beneficial for the parents and future children. Primary care providers are often being urged to provide preconception care as part of primary care services. In support of preconception interventions, there has been increasing evidences for such interventions. However, existing reviews or studies of preconception interventions have been limited by being risk specific, for example; focussing on folate supplementation or women with diabetes. Adding to this, interventions were reported mainly carried out in the secondary care settings. There is still paucity of evidence that comprehensively evaluate the impact o f providing preconception care as a systematic approach involving multifactorial risk factors and, in particular, in primary care. Preconception care involved a range of risk assessment; assessment of genetic risk is no exception. The aim of preconcepti on care for genetic risks is to allow women or prospective parents the opportunity to have informed reproductive decisions of future pregnancies. However, ii experience of offering preconception care in addressi ng genetic risks is yet less explored. This the sis specifically sought to evaluate the potential impact of preconception care involving assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Further, this thesis also aims to provide evidence for effectiveness of preconception interventions on multifactorial risk fa ctors in the primary care settings. As primary care providers especially GPs are increasingly being recognised to provide such care, it was thus important to explore their views. For this, this thesis aimed to explore the opinions and attitudes of GPs in the United Kingdom towards providing preconception care that involved assessment of reproductive genetic risk in current general practice. This study took place within the Primary Care Trusts of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The finding s from this th esis are expected to help inform a strategy for the implementation of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the general practice in the United Kingdom. The aim of this th esis was achieved by carrying out three components of work. These components of work involve three domains that could assist in the implementation ; the interventions; the settings; and explor ing attitudes and opinions. 1. The first component involved carrying out a systematic review of literatures on the effectiveness of preconception care interventions in the primary care settings. 2. The second component involved carrying out a systematic review of literatures on the effectiveness of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. 3. The third component involved a pos tal questionnaire survey of GPs practicing in the Nottinghamshire, Nottingham City, Derbyshire and Derby City Prim ary Care Trusts, exploring iii their attitudes and opinions. A new questionnaire was developed as the study instrument for this study. The first component of work has synthesized the evidence of the effectiveness of preconception interventions in the areas of maternal knowledge of pregnancy -related risks; self -efficacy and health locus of control; risk behaviour modification (for example, folate an d alcohol consumption); adverse pregnancy outcomes (for example, congenital anomalies and preterm birth); and psychological consequences. The review has identified that both risk specific interventions or interventions involved multifactorial risks, both demonstrated significant improvement in maternal knowledge, self -efficacy and health locus of control. There was positive evidence for risk specific interventions in the areas involving risk behaviour modification. Howe ver, the effects for adverse pregnancy outcomes and psychological outcomes remained unclear. The second component of work sought to find evidence the effects of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. The scope of literature search included family history and ancestry assessment, pre - carrier test education or consultation and carrier testing or screening. It was not possible to draw clear conclusion regarding its effectiveness as only two studies involving assessment of cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies were identified. Nevertheless, the studies have provided information on potential benefits of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risks on reproductive decisions, knowledge and understanding of carrier risk as well as psycho logical benefits. The third component of work involved self -administered postal questionnaire survey. The impact of this survey is restricted due to low response rates. Nevertheless, the results of this survey indicated that a substantial proportion of GPs were already offering or providing preconception assessment on reproductive genetic risk opportunistically, in particular, with women planning pregnancy and women with known family history of genetic conditions. Even if they are iv not offering of providing preconception assessment on reproductive genetic risk at present, majority of the m indicated that they are prepared to offer and provide the service, especially when consulting women planning a pregnanc y or women at -risk. T heir primary concern was how to reach these women as not many would come to consult GPs for preconception advice. This study has demonstrated that family planning clinic was the most preferred primary care setting to offer preconception assessment on repro ductive genetic risk . In the United Kingdom, f amily planning clinic s serve a large proportion of women of reproductive age group, thus, this setting may provide opportunities to introduce preconception care and reproductive risk assessment including geneti cs. While there is paucity of evidence from the systematic reviews in my thesis that could impact on the direction or implementation of offering preconception care addressing g enetic risks , many factors other than scientific evidence can influence the implementation process . Observational studies have demonstrated potential benefits of preconception care specifically preconception assessment of genetic risk interventions such as early antenatal diagnosis to informed reproductive decisions. Broad interes ts from the international organization such as in the United States and Netherlands have a role in the implementation . Similarly, interest from the stakeholders in particular individuals of reproductive age groups and the primary care providers also may in fluence the development of the interventions. In this context, the GPs that participated in the survey have provided important information on opportunities and barriers, and potential ways to facilitate its development. Nevertheless, analysis of the data has identified s ome areas that were not fully addressed in this thesis and this is discussed in the final chapter. v Published paper from this thesis Intervention protocol (2013) Preconception risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay -Sachs disease .

Care during the antenatal period has been the focus of improving maternal health and its pregnancy consequences. Yet, evidences have shown that antenatal care alone is not enough. There are risks that affect pregnancy outcomes which can be modifie d or prevented before women planning to conceive. The aim of this thesis is to examine the effectiveness of preconception interv entions in primary care focussing specifically on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. This thesis also aims to explore the attitude s and opinion s of general practitioners (GPs) as primary care providers on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. In this introductory chapter, a n overview of the potentials of preconception care in general and specifically addressing reproductive genetic risk will be discussed. This chapter will further describe the direction of this thesis and place the studies undertaken in appropriate context. 1.2 Background Improving maternal health is pivotal to reduce rates of poor health outcomes in mother and child. Traditionally, this has involved antenatal care which comprised of an organised and comprehensive health care received by the women throughout the course of a pregnancy (Tambor et al., 1994 ). Merkatz (1990) reported that organised antenatal care services was first introduced in the United States by nurses in the early 1900s leading to improved pregnancy outcomes particularly in 2 maternal and infant mortality (Durfy et al., 1994 ). Further, report by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrated a decline in maternal and infant mortality rate throughout 1915 to 1997. Maternal mortality rate declined almost 99%; from every 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy -related complications in the early 1900, to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births reported in 1997. The infant mortality r ate declined greater than 90%; approximately 100 infants died before the age of one year before 1915 to 7. 2 per 1000 live births in 1997 (Delatycki, 2008 , Levenkron et al., 1997 ). However, thi s progress has slowed down during the last two decades and in some cases, pregnancy outco mes deteriorated. Hoyert (2006) reported, in the United States, despite more women received early antenatal care, the infant mortality rate was 7.0 per 1000 live birt hs in 2002 compared with 6.8 per 1000 live births in 2001. Rates of preterm birth rose significantly to 12.5 percent in 2004 from 10.6 percent in 1990 as well as low birth weight births also increased to 8.1 percent in 2004 from 6.7 percent in 1984 (Levenkron et al., 1997 ). Although the proportion of women receiving antenatal care has increased, most organogenesis or development of foetal organs is already underway at the time of first antenatal visit (Cefalo et al., 1995 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) compilation reports on coverage of maternity care, also documented that majority of women receiving antenatal care particularly in the developi ng countries, they either present after the first trimester or late in pregnancy (Henneman et al., 2001a , Myer and Harrison, 2003 , Honnor et al., 2000 ). Thus, the initiation of intervention during antenatal period is perhaps too late to affect pregnancy outcomes. This may be implied that antenatal care alone is not sufficient to improve maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. Realising this has led to national organizations such as the House of Commons Health Committee (1992 ), the March of Dimes (2002) , and the American College of Obstetricians and Gyn aecologists (ACOG) (2002) to recommend preconception care (House of Commons 1992 , 3 March of Dimes 2002, Amer ican College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) 2002), where interventions are delivered before the women conceive and identified as one of a 'key area' in maternal healt h care. The United States Public Health Service (1991) recommended that preconception care be offered to women by primary care providers ( United States Public Health Service 1991) . In 2006, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended nati onal guidelines for improving preconception health and to incorporate into practice in the United States (Rowley et al., 1997 ). The main goal of preconception care is to provide health promotion, risk assessment and interventions for women of reproductive age to reduce risk factors that might affect future pregnancy outcomes (Cefalo et al., 1995 ). According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (2006), the Select Panel of Preconception Care (SPPC) defined preconception care as \"a series of intervent ions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioural and social risks to women of reproductive age group prior to conception to improve the outcome of future pregnancies and the health of women, infants and families\" (Rowley et al., 1997 ). Health risks such as infections, anaemia, existing medical conditions; for example, hypertension and diabetes, and risk behaviours such as smoking and folate deficiency , which can affect pregnancy outcomes and foetal development are best modified or prevented before the women conceive (Atrash et al., 2006 ). Several documented preventative measures of these modifiable risk factors before pregnancy have shown to improve adverse events in mothers and foetal development. The introduction of routine rubella vaccination implemented in adolescents and young women h as significantly reduced the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome from 20 -70 annual cases in the 1970s to only two cases in 1985 (Garrard, 2006 ). Initiation of folate suppleme ntation taken before conception has also shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects such as spina 4 bifida and anencephaly (Wald, 1991 , Czeizel, 1993 ). In addition, a recent systematic review also confirmed that folate taken before and during early pregnancy can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (Dixon et al., 2011 ). Previous studies on women with diabetes have also reported that proper management of diabetes before women conceive has im proved glucose control during pregnancy and reduced incidence of congenital malformations in their offspring (Dunne et al., 1999 ). Maternal infections, folate supplementation and medical conditions as described above are modifiable reproductive risk factors. The studies had demonstrated benefits of improving the modifiable risks before women conceive. There are also non -modifiable reproductive ri sks which include maternal age, carriers of genetic conditions or family history of genetic conditions. The effects of identifying reproductive risk factors, in particular, carriers of genetic conditions or family history of genetic conditions, before conception are less documented. The following section gives an overview of the importance of identifying car riers of genetic conditions or family history of genetic conditions as one of the components of preconception assessment. The term 'preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk' will be used throughout this thesis to indicate this. 5 1.3 An overview of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Genetic medicine is rapidly expanding into almost every aspect of health care. Reproductive genetic risk assessment is an example. The importance of reproductive genetic risk assessment as an integral part of preconception care is gaining recognition and has constitute one of the mai n preconception care evaluation (Rowley et al., 1997 ). Genetic conditions affect millions of families. According to the population statistics, globally, about five per cent of all pregnancies result in the birth of a child with congenital or genetic disorders (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). A couple has a baseline risk of two to three per cent of having a child with congenital or genetic disorder (Watson et al., 1992b ). The probability of affected child further increases when there is a familial ris k (Shapira et al., 2006 , Watson et al., 1992b ). Assessing genetic risk allows affected individuals or couples to be aware about their genetic predisposition, and, to be informed of the possibility of their future children having genetic conditions. This gives them the opportunity to make more inf ormed reproductive decisions of future pregnancies (Borry et al., 2011 ). Worldwide experiences of assessment of reproductive genetic risk before women conceive, were mainly documented on autosomal recessive conditions such as haemoglobinopathies and 2009 ); cystic fibrosis (Christie et al., 2009, Massie et al., 2009) and Tay Sachs disease (Mitchell et al., 1996, Zeesman et al., 1984). The discussion of genetic conditions in this thesis will be confined to autosomal recessive namely, haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia an d sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay -Sachs disease. In these conditions carrier detection is feasible (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). Autosomal recessive conditions have implications on women o r prospective parents with regards to future reproduction 6 decisions. Carrier couples or prospective parents are usually asymptomatic; however, their future offspring will be affected if he or she inherits both affected genes from their prospective parents . All carrier couples have a 25 per cent chance of having an affected child. These genetic conditions have a high morbidity risk, potentially life - threatening and have significant psychological impact on the affected child, as well as on the families or ca rers. These diseases are also more prevalent in individuals of particular ethnic or ancestry backgrounds (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). Thalassaemia In Haemoglobin disorders , it is estimated that between two to five per cent of the world's population are carriers and this is more prevalent in the Mediterranean and Southern Asian ancestry (Modell et al., 2001 ). According to the WHO, every year, 300,000 infants are born with major haemoglobin disorders, the most common being thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). It is characterised by defects or absence of synthesis of one of the two globin chains ( or ) that forms the normal adult human haemoglobin molecule and this leads to haemolytic anaemia (Peters et al., 2012 ). Thalassaemia can be diagnosed by measuring fractions of haemoglobin A and haemoglobin F with high perform ance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or electrophoresis. In addition, DNA analysis is required to detect or globin chain mutation. Morbidity is related to severe anaemia and an affected child will require life -long blood transfusion. Multiple blood transf usions may eventually result in iron overload and potentially causes heart failure, infection, hypogonadism and infertility, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. Unless given optimal medical management, affected individuals can die prematurely. In indivi duals with thalassaemia and their families or carers, psychosocial problems have also been reported, for example stigmatisation, isolation, family adjustment, coping with school and education, and social interaction (Ratip and Modell, 1996 , Telfer et al., 2005 , Gharaibeh et al., 2009 ). 7 Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease affects mainly individuals of African origin, but this is also recognised in Indian and some Mediterranean populations. The reported prevalence of carrier frequency ranges from 1 to 40 per cent, depending on the population group. The WH O estimates that sickle cell disease affects 275,000 conceptions each year globally (Modell and Darlison, 2008 , Yusuf et al., 2011 ). The condition is caused by a mutation in the haemoglobin gene (S) which individuals inherit from both parents. Diagnosis is confirmed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or electrophoresis with detection of haemoglobin S and C fraction. This condition causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, which results in prem ature haemolysis, hence, can lead to life -threatening acute and chronic vaso -occlusion; including renal and cardiovascular complications. Individuals with this condition are also susceptible to serious septicaemia. Like thalassaemia, individuals and famili es are also confronted with psychosocial challenges which include disruption of school and work, social isolation and loneliness, stigmatisation, teasing, and rejection by peers (Barbarin et al., 1999 ). Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is most common among people of European ancestry; having the carrier frequency of one in 25 (Murray et al., 1999 ). It is caused by mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR); more than 1500 CFTR mutations have been identified. Diagnosis is in dicated by phenotypic features (chronic sino-pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal and nutritional abnormalities, obstructive azoospermia and salt -loss syndromes), family history of cystic fibrosis, or a positive newborn screening test, together with laborat ory evidence of a CFTR abnormality as documented by elevated sweat chloride concentrations (sweat test), identification of two CFTR mutations associated with CF, or in vivo demonstration of characteristic abnormalities in ion transport across the nasal epi thelium. Carriers are confirmed by identification of CFTR mutation from the blood or saliva 8 (Grosse et al., 2004 ). This condition commonly associated with recurrent pulmonary infections, which potentially leads to bronchiectasis and atelectasis and also pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. There is currently no cure for the disease, with treatment mainly aimed at improving quality of life. Major psychosocial consequence s of concern mainly related to emotional and social adjustment, adherence to treatment and quality of life (Glasscoe and Quittner, 2008 ). Tay Sachs disease Tay Sachs disease is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with carrier frequency of around one in 30 (Petersen et al., 1983 ). It is caused by genetic mutation in the c hains of the hexosaminidase A (Hex A) isozyme in the gangliosides in nerve cells of the brain (Bach et al., 2001 ) which leads to progressive deterioration of mental and physical disabilities. It is diagnosed by measuring the activity of hexosaminidase A and further identification of genetic mutation in Hex A (2005 ). Death usually results before five years of age. At present, there is no cure or treatment available. 9 1.4 Potential benefits of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Generally, these autosomal recessive conditions have significant physically, socially and emotionally impact on the affected individuals and families or carers. The need for medical care as well as psychological intervention for behavioural and emotional s upport also imposes a potentially high economic and public health burden. Realising the magnitude of these conditions and their implications, there have been considerable efforts to identify reproductive genetic risk for the four specified conditions and o ffer support for prospective parents before the birth of an affected child. To date, practical experience of assessing reproductive genetic risk focuses mainly on the antenatal period (Qureshi et al., 2004). In the United Kingdom, the NHS guidelines sta ted that the antenatal genetic screening should be completed before the end of the first trimester; ideally before 10 weeks' of gestation, and that prenatal diagnosis or any subsequent action should take place before the end of 12 weeks' gestation (NHS Sic kle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme Centre). Similarly in the United States and Canada as well as other developing countries such as Malaysia, India and Pakistan, genetic assessment and screening in pregnant women are offered within the first tri mester of pregnancy (Tambor et al., 1994 , Witt et al., 1996 ). If either couples or prospective paren ts are found to be carriers of a particular genetic condition, prenatal diagnosis is then offered. If the child is found to be affected, options are termination of pregnancy (if permissible in the countries) or decision to continue with the pregnancy . However, many women were reported delayed in seeking antenatal care; only after the first trimester when prenatal diagnosis is already relatively late ( Lemke et al., 1998 , Hoyert et al., 2006,). An observational study in the United Kingdom reported that t he mean gestational age at uptake of screening was around 16 weeks, despite systematic guidelines to perform antenatal genetic screening; of about 10 74% of women consulted before 10 weeks' gestation, only 4.4% were screened before the target time of 10 weeks (Dormandy et al., 2008). The United Kingdom National Confidential Enquiry into Counselling of Genetic Disorders has also reported that from 1990 to 1994, only 67 percent of couples at risk of thalassaemia pregnancies were informed and offered prenatal dia gnosis during their antenatal visits ( (Modell et al., 2000 ). Reproductive genetic screening requires a significant amount of time for counselling before as well as after the test results. Counselling involves explanation of the purpose of screening, explanation about the conditions being tested such as the clinical manifestation and management of the conditions, and offering options to couples or prospective parents if they are at risk of having an affected child (Solomon et al., 2008). This process is important before the couples are able to decide on subsequent actions. Screening during antenatal or at the time of pregnancy may only offers prenatal diagnosi s to determine at risk pregnancy and subsequent termination of pregnancy. In countries were termination of pregnancy are not allowed or due to religious non -permissibility, the only choice is to continue with the pregnancy and caring for the affected child . Timing is important for the couples or prospective parents to prepare themselves clinically and emotionally before the birth of an affected child or choose to terminate the pregnancy. Screening at the time or during the pregnancy certainly adds a signifi cant stress because of the specific time limits and restricted options (Modell et al., 1980b ). Realising the issues of antenatal genetic screening, assessment of reproductive genetic risk before pregnancy may confer additional benefits. Potentially, it allows the couples or prospective parents greater time to be counselled before deciding on future pregnancy. The primary aim of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk is to enhance informed reproductive decisions (Denayer et al., 1992 ). Preconceptio n assessment offers the opportunity of a wider range of 11 reproductive options besides early prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy (Morgan et al., 2004). These include avoiding pregnancy, adoption of another child, use of healthy donor gametes, an d pre - implantation genetic diagnosis and in -vitro fertilization ( Jones and Fallon, 2002 , Wille et al., 2004). Preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk involves taking family and ancestry history, and carrying out genetic carrier testing or screening and genetic counselling. Taking family history is the first step in identifying individual with genetic risk. It is described as the \"gateway to recognise inherited disorders in a patient\" (Bennett, 2012). An ideal family history collects information on at least three generations. Ancestry history also forms an essential component when taking family history (Johnson et al., 2006 ). Positive family history can inform decisions about genetic carrier testing. There is often confusion between genetic carrier testing and screening (Nuffield Council on, 2003 ). Genetic carrier testing refers to testing of individuals to determine the presence or absence of the carrier status (Denayer et al., 1992 ). This testing could, for e xample, be in the context of family history of the autosomal recessive condition or relevant ancestry or ethnicity . On the other hand, genetic carrier screening involves offering or testing the whole population groups irrespective of individual risk (Castellani et al., 2010 ). Both genetic carrier testing and screening involve the analysis of blood, tissue or bodily fluid sa mples. Genetic counselling offers information about the risk to help women or prospective parents to make informed decisions. Primary care providers may ideally positioned to discuss family and ancestry or ethnicity history as well as carrying out genetic carrier testing or screening. It is thus important to explore the opinions of primary care providers in providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. In addition, it is also useful to consider the women or couples' interest in such prec onception assessment as they are the target population. The subsequent section presents an overview 12 of primary care providers ' and the target population's opinions on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. 1.5 Opinions of primary care provide rs Primary care is the first point of contact between the general population and the specialised health services. Every women of reproductive age presenting to the primary care settings are candidates for preconception care. Primary care providers; the GPs, midwives and practice nurses, have a critical role to play in educating, counselling, identifying and managing women with reproductive risks before conception. Traditionally, women consulted secondary care providers; obstetricians and gynaecologists, for established medical conditions which could affect pregnancy, for example, diabetes and epilepsy, or genetic clinics for established genetic conditions. They usually may not be attending secondary care for regular follow -up or for other complaints or i ssues such as for prescription of medications, vaccination, contraception or minor illnesses. In these circumstances, they will usually seek for advice from the primary care providers. This is where the opp ortunity for primary care providers to be involved in the healthcare of women in providing preconception assessment and information. Realising this, national organizations have recommended that preconception care to be an essential part of primary care and encouraged primary care providers to offer prec onception care for every potential health encounters ( Cefalo et al., 1995, Johnson et al., 20 06, Frey, 2006). Furthermore, the United Kingdom Human Genetics Commission has also emphasized that preconception genetic screening should be within the framework of a population screening programme (Denayer et al., 1992 ). There have been several literatures on primary care providers' opinions on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. An earlier 13 survey of GPs in the United Kingdom, two -thirds of the respondents indicated that identifying carrier couples to of fer genetic counselling before conception as a very important benefit and believed that general practice is the most appropriate setting to carry it out (Boulton et al., 1996). In another survey, Mennie et.al. (1998) explored GPs' views about screening for cystic fibrosis, 78 percent of the respondents felt that it should be introduced to women seeking advice before pregnancy (Mennie et al., 1998). A Dutch study looking at the attitudes of GPs towards preconception cystic fibrosis screening, found more than half of the respondents have a positive attitude towards the screening while only a small proportion of the respondents were not willing to offer screening as they were afraid of psychological consequences on the carriers and family members (Poppelaars et al., 2004a). 1.6 Opinions of target population Women also expressed their opinions on the benefits of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk and the involvement of primary care. In the South Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, Rose et.al. reported their experiences on setting up a special clinic with an emphasis on family history problems, genetic and preconception issues; the most common reason for patients' attendance to the clinic was, they were planning a pregnancy and concerned about genetic d iseases. Fifteen percent of patients who attended were because they were concerned of disease s that could be passed on to their future children (Rose et al., 1999 ). With regards to cystic fibrosis, a Dutch study, reported that 97 percent of the couples that participated wanted to find out wh ether they were at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis (Henneman et al., 2001b ). This reflected the expectation of the couples to make informed decisions about having future children. In a n interview where the participants were those who had experienced carrier identification through antenatal and newborn screening for sickle cell, thalassa emia and other haemoglobin variants diseases, indicated that they would have preferred to know their genetic risk status before pregnancy. One 14 of the reasons was it would help potential partners of the affected women be screened and thus enable the decisio ns on future reproduction, for example; opt not to get pregnant or would have had prenatal diagnosis (Locock and Kai, 2008 ). Further, in a Dutch study, women's interest of having preconception counselling and advice in health c are system was explored and reported that about 60 percent of women who responded, were interested if such clinic did exist. The study also found that about 70 percent of the respondents would consider preconception counselling and advice if this was offer ed by their own GPs (Poppelaars et al., 2004b). All the studies described above suggest that women are positive about preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk and general practitioners' role in offering preconception counselling and advice. 15 1.7 Rationale for this thesis Primary care is acknowledged to provide preconception risk assessment and care. Primary care providers recognised the importance of recommending reproductive genetic risk before conception. Women of reproductive age also realised the potential advantages o f knowing genetic risk before pregnancy and favoured delivering it in the primary care settings. There is however gaps in the evidence about the effects of preconception care intervention carried out in the primary care settings. In particular, the evidenc e for preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk currently, is also limited. While primary care is recognised as an ideal setting to provide preconception care, it is not clear whether it is acceptable to the GPs, which in this context, the GPs in the United Kingdom. Firstly, t his the sis seeks to examine the effectiveness of preconception care interventions in primary care and s pecifically examine the effectiveness of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in clinical practice. T his thesis also explore s the attitudes and opinions of GPs as one of the pr imary care providers in the United Kingdom in providing preconception assessme nt of reproductive genetic risk . The thesis hopes to identify potential preconception care intervention s in primary care addressing specifically preconception assessme nt of reproductive genetic risk. This thesis hopes to elicit the opinions of GPs' regarding its development in the United Kingdom health infrastructure. Further, this thesis also hopes to expl ore the GPs' attitudes of preparedness in providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. 1.8 Thesis aim and objectives The aim of this thesis is to help inform a strategy for the implementation of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care in the United Kingdom health infrastructure . 16 To achieve this aim, the objectives are; 1.

The objective of this chapter is to explore preconception care, in general and specific to reproductive genetic risk through reviewing relevant literatures as we ll as policy -related documents . Through this process, the approaches , potential opportunities and challenges related to the development of preconception care interventions in health care or other settings will be discussed . 2.2 Development of preconception care Preconception care addresses women's health before conception that will enable women to enter pregnancy in optimal health and minimises health problems in future children for example; in folate supplementation and lifestyle modification such as smoking and alcohol moderation. Preconception care may be a promising approach to support informed reproductive decisions for future pregnancies in the case of genetic risk and maternal infections such as viral hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection (Rowley et al., 1997 ). By 1980s, documented evidences from earliest studies that demonstrated relationship between women's health risks during pregnancy and the adv erse pregnancy outcomes; for example; rubella infection (Miller et al., 1982 ), inadequate folate intake before pregnancy (Wake et al., 1996 ), maternal smoking and chronic illnesses (diabetes, hypertension) (Institute of Medicine, 1985 ) have fuelled the interest in setting up preconception care . There is opportunity that these health 19 risks can be identified, addressed and modified before pregnancy to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. One of the earliest preconception care activity described in the literature was by Chamberlain in t he United Kingdom in 1980. Chamberlain (1980) described preconception care a specialty service for women. The aim of this clinic is to provide counselling to women about health risk that could affect future reproductive outcomes. It was run by one consulta nt obstetrician and he was the only one providing advice and counselling . The preconception setting was known as pre -pregnancy clinic and was based in a hospital in London. Women with genetic risk were however excluded from the pre -pregnancy clinic as the hospital was already providing a weekly genetic clinic for them. This study reported that 56 women had attended the clinic in the first 18 months and majority of women who attend ed had existing maternal risks such as epilepsy and previous pregnancy -induced hypertension or previous poor reproductive outcomes such as congenital abnormalities . It demonstrated that women who attended were those actually concerned of future pregnancies due to existing reproductive risks. The most concerned risk reported were previous premature labour and its association with low birth weight (Chamberlain, 1980 ). The pre - pregnancy clinic may be potential approach to improve the women's future reproductive outcomes . The fact that it was run by a consultant who may already have interest and knowledge, a consistent and informative preconception counselling is expected. This study however has several limitations. Firstly, the clinic was set up only within 18 months; thus, the outcome of the women who had preconception counselling at the clinic was not known . Secondly, the clinic was based in the hospital; the question is whether this is practical to attract all women of reproductive age. It would be helpful if similar s etting was placed in a primary care setting such as the general practice, however on the other hand, it could be easier to refer to the speciality concerned if identified maternal risks, if clinic is based at the hospital. Thirdly, this clinic did not prov ide counselling to those with genetic risk. Ideally, 20 genetics should also constitute preconception care counselling as it contributes to informed decisions on reproduction. Finally, this clinic was run by only one specialist. It would seem feasible if the patients were not of great load. Furthermore, there would be a break in the continuity of care if the specialist is away or not available. An ideal setting providing preconception counselling should also involve primary care providers. In Hungary, a more integrated preconception initiative was carried out in 1984. This was a 27 -year observational study, established in Budapest as a research project to assess the feasibility of preconception care . The project was called the Hungarian Preco nception Service (HPS) which was established in 32 health care centres. The main aim of this initiative was to prepare prospective parents for a better pregnancy and reduce the occurrence of unfavourable pregnancy outcomes; for example; congenital abnormal (Czeizel, 2012 ). The Hungarian Preconception Service was given free to women of reproductive age who were not pregnant at the time, no infertility and decision to participate has to be voluntary. The i ntervention described involved three essential components ; 1. Screening for reproductive risk factors before conception for example; fam ily history of genetic conditions, previous adverse pregnancy outcomes, existing or previous medical conditions, previous or current sexually transmitted diseases and vaccinations. 2. A three -month preparation before conception for example; lifestyle and beha vioural modification and education courses of smoking, alcohol and drugs consumption, healthy diet and folate supplementation. At this point, any identified reproductive risks were treated or referred to appropriate specialities for example, genetic counse lling clinic and special outpatient clinics for medical conditions. 21 3. Management of reproductive health issues and e valuation of the pregnancy outcomes of all women with confirmed pregnancy. The first two components; screening for reproductive risk and advi sing on the three -month preparation before conception was carried out by qualified community nurses and midwives in the designated primary care centres. Following screening, the m anagement of identified reproductive health issues was further carried out by the specialists in the respective specialities. With regards to the outcomes, the Hungarian Preconception Service reported an improvement in the rate of women planning pregnancy. Following the intervention, there was significant reduction in the birth prevalence of neural tube defects (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.04 -0.13) and cardiovascular malformations (OR 0.42 95% 0.19 -0.98) after f olate - containing multivitamin supplementation as compared to no -folate - containing multivitamin folate The proportion of female smokers also decreased approximately 27 percent at three months preparation of smoking cessation counselling (Czeizel, 1999 ). Almost all women who participated went for rubella and hepatitis B screening and they were vaccinated if fo und seronegative. Genetic risk screening in the Hungarian Preconception Service was based on the pedigree obtained from couples. This includes previous child with congenital abnormalities or hereditary conditions. This service reported that the number of identified individuals has risen from eight percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 2000. All of them were referred to genetic counselling clinic. Among all who planned for pregnancy, half of them had early pr enatal diagnosis whereby about five percent had future children with inherited genetic conditions. Affected couples decided to terminate pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis (Czeizel et al., 1992 , Czeizel, 1992 , Czeizel, 2012 ). The Hungarian Preconception Service has demonstrated a comprehensive preconception care intervention that encompassed 22 assessment or screening of mu ltiple reproductive health risk , education and counselling as well as management of the risks to secondary ca re. The intervention carried out by qualified nurses has improved the identification of reproductive risk. In addition, proper preparation before conception, such as folate supplementation and smoking, has reduced the prevalence of congenital abnormalities (Czeizel, 1999 ). This strategy at primary care level is promising however limited due to unavail able controlled data and evaluation of cost effectiveness of the intervention. In the United States, one of the earliest preconception care intervention has focus sed on health risks scree ning, counselling and treatment (Moos Moos (1987) had developed a preconceptio n health checklist in 1985 to help health care providers to conduct comprehensive preconception screening with the aim for appropriate counselling to take place with the women in a time - efficient manner . The checklist was a self -administered assessment screening questionnaire of reproduc tive health risks which includes medical history, family history of genetic conditions, nutrition, lifestyle, drugs or medication, a nd previous pregnancy history. The checklist has also a built -in educational feedback ser ved as a reminder of actions for the women on how to improve pregnancy outcomes. This approach was initially introduced in the family planning clinics. Women were introduced and made aware of preconception care concepts during routine family planning visi ts. As a result, women with reproductive health risks were identified , counselled and managed appropriately earlier (Moos and Cefalo, 1987 ). Cefalo and Moos (1995 ) also reported an increased in planned pregnancy rate following the introduction of preconception care intervention (Cefalo et al., 1995 ). This initiative has moved public health organizations in the United States such as the Centers for Disea se Control and Preve ntion (CDC) , the March of Dimes and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to be committed to promote preconception care (Freda et al., 2006 ). In 2006, these organizations, through their collaborative efforts had led to 23 publish a national guidelines on preconception care (Johnson et al., 2006 ). The United States approach to preconception care is notably escalating. This is stimulated by earlier research findings which underscored the limitations of antenatal care alone on improving reproductive outcomes . In addition, they recognized the importance to reach women of reproductive age to receive preventive measures before conception especially since almost 50 percent of the pregnancies are unplanned (Jones et al., 1988 , Johnson et al., 2006 ). Neverthele ss, the success of this intervention depends on the country's health infrastructure, socioeconomic and insurance systems (Van der Zee, 2013 ). There should also be comparative studies to demonstrate the quality of the interventions. In the Netherlands, the earliest expe rience of preconception care was reported in the 1990s in clinic settings held within the gynaecologic or genetics department . Here , the care was mainly on gynaecological such as previous complicated obstetric history and genetic risk factors (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2007 ). Since then , the awareness and demand for more forms of preconception care has increased . In 2004 the Dutch Foundation for Preconception Care was developed with the aim to \"promote easily accessible preconception consultation in the Netherlands\" . Organizations involved with this foundation ha ve piloted more than 20 clinics in the primary care setting to offer preconception care. These clinics were run by trained midwives to assess preconception risks in couples who are then referred to respective specialists or secondary centres if risks are identified (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2007 ). In 2009, further preconception initiatives were carried out by the municipal council of Rotterdam and the Erasmus University Medical Centre. This preconception intervention has focussed on relatively low socioeconomic population in two districts in the Netherlands usin g 24 campaigns on preconception care with specific modalities such as multi -lingual posters, leaflets, advertisements, and columns in the local media; followed by preconception education programme in groups and further emphasis on preconception care through individual preconception counselling by a midwife or a GP. This intervention also includes providing social services for prospective parents (van der Zee et al., 2011 ). From 1996, earlier interventions have demonstrated preconception care has helped to minimise risk factor in women at increased risk for a less favourable pregnancy outcome in the country . There was reduction in the rate of neural tube defects following increase in folate supplementation from 12.3 per 10000 children in 1997 to 6.3 per 10000 children in 2004 identified (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2007 ). The primary care approach to preconception care reported in Netherland appears integrated highlighting the involvement of public modalities such posters and advertisements, preconceptio n education and counselling by GPs and midwives as well as involvement of secondary or specialist care. It would seem feasible to carry out this strategy in the primary care setting. However, it is reported difficult to gauge the coverage and evidence for ef fectiveness as it still delivered in a small scale and not in a uniform manner (Temel et al., 2015 ). Summary Earliest experiences of intervening women of reproductive age before they conceive were directed to specific reproductive risks such as rubella vaccination, folate supplementation and diabetes 1993 , Kitzmiller et al., 1998 ). Realising the importance of practical approach to preconception care in the primary care setting, preconception care intervention has to be more integrated and comprehensive encompass ing assessment of multiple reproductive health risks, education and counselling as w ell as management of the risks. 25 The Hungarian Preconception Service, the national orga nizations in the United States such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the March of Dimes and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; and the Health Council of Netherlands have adopted a comprehensive preconception ri sk assessment which involved physical assessmen t, risk screening, education, counselling and management of the risk. Genetics and reproductive awareness are highlighted as one of the important areas in preconception risk screening (Johnson et al., 2006 , Czeizel, 2012 ). The Hungarian Preconception Service is one of the earliest interventions to report on the outcomes of preconception care that was carried out in relation to preconception genetics. With regards to evidence of effectiveness in the applicati on of genetics in preconception care, it is still limited as o ther organizations were mainly reports on national recommendations . There are earlier documented experiences of population -based and school -based genetic screening program s targeting on reproductive - aged individuals which includes women and men . Some of the programs were carried out entirely as a prevention programme on its own and not as a package of preconception care. There are also recent observational studies exploring reproductive decisions following assessment of reproductive genetic risk on women or couples considering pregnancy . The f ollowing section will discuss on earlier experiences of geneti c screening program s internationally and also recent observational studies that addressed specifically on assessme nt of reproductive genetic risk in the preconception period. 26 2.3 Preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk 2.3.1 Aim of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Most national organizations have recognised the importance of incorporating genetics i nto preconception care practice (Rowley et al., 1997 , March of Dimes, 2008 , Denayer et al., 1992 ). The need to provide preconception genetics interventions; that is, the assessment of reproductive genetic risk before conception, is realised because of its potential important benefits of future reproductive decisions and counselling to prospective parent s (Hartley et al., 1997 , Lafayette et al., 1999b , Fanos and Johnson, 1995b ). In this instance, at -risk status for having an affected child can be identified early and this enables prospective parents to make informed reproductive decisions before pregnancy . Acquiring this information before pregnancy as compared to during antenata l period has the advantage of more reproductive options and couples are not pressed for time to make the decision. These options include not only prenatal diagnosis, which either followed by termination of pregnancy or continuing the pregnancy in the case of an affected child, but also options such as to make use of healthy donor gametes, adoption of another child, pre -implantation genetic diagnosis and in -vitro fertilization or even avoiding pregnancy (Jones et al., 2002 , Wille et al., 2004a ). In some culture s practicing consanguineous marriage s, it could possibly result in adapting the choice of a partner (Lakeman et al., 2009 , Teeuw et al., 2014 ) 2.3.2 International g enetic screening programme s The earliest population -based genetic screening program reported for autosomal recessive conditions was developed for Tay -Sachs disease in the United States in the 1970s (Kaback, 2000 , ACOG, 2004 ). The screening was carried out among reproductive -aged women and men of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . The program reported reduction in the incidence of Tay -Sachs disease in the Jewish popul ation by more than 27 90% within thirty years of its introduction. This was largely due to early prenatal diagnosis and termination of affected pregnancies (Kaback, 2000 ). About the same time, a genetic screening program, the Cyprus Thalassaemia Control Program was developed for tha lassaemia in Cyprus . Other Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Sardinia, Italy, which have high prevalence of thalassaemia, also adopted prevention programs. These countries reported significant reduction of children born with thalassaemia following the screening program (Angastiniotis and Hadjiminas, 1981 , Cao and Kan, 2013 ). The prevention programs described in these countries were through premarital and preconception carrier assessment. In countries that have religious and cultural reservations towards termination of pregnancy also have developed a nationwide pogramme. In 1997, the Regional Office of Eastern Mediterranean of WHO has supported carrying out preconception genetic risk assessment for haemoglobinopathies before marriage or premarital. The countries involved include Iran, Egypt and Bahrain (Alwan A, 1997 ). In Iran for example, the genetic assessment is carried out in premarital clinics where other preconception health care is also offered and discussed (Samavat and Modell, 2004 ). In the Netherlands, the Health Council has considered preconception genetic risk assessment in particular for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies in view of the seriousness of both conditions in the country (Health Council of Netherlands , 2007). Currently, the assessment are offerred opportunistically among the high risk groups , individuals with positive family history and ethnicity or couples planning pregnancy (Health Council of Netherlands 2007). The United Kingdom Human Genetics Commission a cknowledged the importance of preconception genetic assessment would facilitate wider 28 reproductive choices and thus supporting reproductive decision -making in the prospective parents. It is being recommended within the framework of a population screening p rogramme (Human Genetics Commission, 2011), however, not yet implemented nationally. In the South E ast Asia, thalassaemia is the commonest autosomal recessive genetic conditions. To date, nationwide reproductive genetic risk assessment is reported mainly d uring antenatal period (Banta, 2003 , Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 2011 ). Observational studies involving school -based genetic screening programs for Tay -Sachs disease and thalassaemia, also demonstrated encouraging results. The countries involved were Montreal in Canada and Marsei lle in France (Scriver and Mitchell, 2001 , Lena -Russo et al., 2002 ). In Marseille, t he participants were high school students (aged 16 years old) who volunteered and not confined to specific ethnicity, and the program consisted of education, carrier testing and reproductive counselling. Participants were followed up within twenty years and has reported early request for prenatal diagnosis from participants at risk and increased rate of early termination of affected pregnancies. This has resulted in a decrease in number of new cases of the conditions during the 20 years of follow -up (Lena -Russo et al., 2002 ). However, school -based genetic screening programs have not been implemented as school setting could raise concerns whether screening is well informed and voluntary as adolescent have limited ability to give true informed consent (Shoemaker et al., 2004 ). In addition, peer pressure might also influence one's decision (Ross, 2006). Further issues reported were whether confidentiality is maintained as this may involve parental decision and peers; the issues of stigmatisation and whether appropriate counselling is carried out before and after genetic screening (Denzin, 1970 ). With regards to outcomes of genetic assessment in women or couples considering pregnancy, two recent studies demonstrated encouraging results. A study in Australia involving offering cystic fibrosis carrier 29 testing to 10 00 individuals has resulted in 153 individuals being identified carriers and three carrier couples. All three reported to change their reproductive plans following the results; with two planned for in - vitro fertilization (IVF) and pre -implantation genetic diagnosis (PIGD) and one had an early prenatal diagnosis with termination of pregnancy of the affected foetus (Christie et al., 2009 ). Further larger study which involved 3200 individuals included women before pregnancy as well as in early trimester of pregnancy has also identified substantial number of carriers (106 individuals) and nine carrier couples; which three of the couples were preparing for pregnancy. Two couples requested for early prenatal diagnoses which resulted in one termination of affected pregnancy whereas the other two couples had planned for in -vitro fertilization (IVF) and pre -implantation genetic diagnosis (PIGD) in future (Massie et al., 2009 ). The following section will discuss existing or potential challenges to the implementation of preconception care in general and specifically for preconception assessment of genetic risks. Two main challenges are regarding the target population and the primary care providers. Both will be discussed i n the context of preconception care in general and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk . 2.4 Challenges of preconception care in general and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk 2.4.1 The target population The inadequate interest of the target population to engage in preconception care may pose as a potential barrier. Earlier surveys of women demonstrated lack of awareness and interest to seek advice before pregnancy. A survey in the United Kingdom found that only less than 40% of the respondents considered preconception care essential and about more than 10% believed it to be of no importance (Wallace and Hurwitz, 1998 ). Further, in Netherlands, a survey of recently 30 married couples and planning for pregnancy, found that only 22% of the respondents agreed that they will consult their general practitioners f or advice before they are pregnant (Poppelaars et al., 2004d ). Even in the Hungarian Preconception Service (HPS) where preconception care was already offered , only 10% of all women with planned pregnancy took part in the program (Czeizel et al., 199 2). With regards to preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, in earlier studies, inadequate understanding and awareness of women or couples of its importance and consequences of the risk with genetic conditions were reported to contribute to them not participating in the preconception genetic screening programmes (Lemke et al., 1998 , Henneman et al., 2002 ). When exploring women or couples about their opinion on p reconception cystic fibrosis screening, fear of psychological consequences such as stigmatisat ions and relationships problems on affected individuals and their family members were reported as their negative intention to participate in the screening (Poppelaars et al., 2004e ). These factors potentially pose barrier s to the dissemination of preconception care. In the next section the role o f primary care providers to deliver preconception care and diffic ulties faced will be discussed. 2.4.2 Primary care providers As preconception care gained momentum over the past three decades, primary care providers are increasingly being urged to provide su ch care. In 1991, the House of Commons Health Committee (1992) proposed that preconception care be 'identified as one of a 'key area' in maternal health care . The Centres for Disease and Control and Prevention (2006) has recommended to incorporate preconception care into practice in the United States and further published national guidelines to help primary care providers to deliver preconception health screening (Rowley et al., 1997 ). 31 In general, primary care providers were aware that a thorough health assessment prior to conception helps identify potential reproductive risks. One of earlier studies in the Netherlands, reported that majority (93%) of the respondents already considered providing preconcept ion advice as part of their responsibilities as general practitioners (Gaytant et al., 1998 ). A survey of general practitioners and nurses in 42 general practices in the United Kingdom, reported that majority of the respondents recognised that preconception care is import ant to enhance better outcome for both mothers and future children (Wallace and Hurwitz, 1 998). Furthermore, they agreed that preconception care should be offered opportunistically in the primary care settings (Wallace and Hurwitz, 1998 , Heyes et al., 2004 ). Although the importance of preconception care is well realised among primary car e providers, implementation of this form of preventative program is still lacking. The difficulty of the primary care providers to reach or deliver preconception care to the targeted group posed an issue to the implementation of the services. Morgan (2004 ) reported that only about ten percent of pregnant patients came for preconception care before they become pregnant (Morgan et al., 2004 ). Heyes (2004) reported that getting the patients with already having reproductive risk to come to the preconception clinic is an obstacle (Heyes et al., 2004 ). The general practitioners believed that women did not perceive themselves to be at risk for a poor pregnancy outcome and, therefore, would not seek consultation before becoming pregnant (Van Der Pal -de Bruin et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, the subject of high occurrence of unplanned pregnancy contribut ed to difficulty in successfully implementing the programme (Czeizel, 1999 ). Lack of consultation time and inadequate appropriate knowledge and training among the primary care providers were also addressed as hindering factors in the delivery of the service (Gaytant et al., 1998 , Heyes et al., 2004 , Morgan et al., 2004 ). General practitioners also expressed dilemma that whether preconception care interventions truly linked with improved pregnancy outcomes if provided in the primary care settings (Heyes et al., 20 04). 32 There were also conflicting views on who is the most appropriate to provide the care. Results of surveys on primary care providers and even women reported that general practitioners, practice nurses and community midwives were most preferred to del iver preconception care (Wallace and Hurwitz, 1998 , Heyes 2004 , Poppelaars et al., 2004b ). 2.4.3 Ethical, legal and social issue s When discussing in the area of genetics it is almost always impossible to avoid ethical, legal and social implications. The health care providers and community at large are worried about the effects of knowing genetic risk on a healthy individuals or famili es. These issues may vary for specific communities and countries because of cultural and religious background. (Clayton, 2003 , WHO, 2006 ). There are few concerns with regards to earlier experiences of the programs described. One, addressing specific population screening, for example; Ashkenazi Jewish communities for Tay -Sachs disease may have social or ethical implication such as stigmatisati on and discrimination (Kaback, 2000 ). Secondly, a nother concern was the voluntariness of participation. Haemoglobinopathies s creening in Cyprus and Iran was reported to be carried out premarital and was made mandatory (Angastiniotis and Hadjiminas, 1981 , Samavat and Modell, 2004 ). World Health Organization (1998) has outlined that that reproductive -related genetic screening should be provided on a voluntary basis (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). Thirdly, the genetic screening pro grams were aimed to prevent further children born with Tay-Sachs disease and thalassaemia, hence, reduction in the incidence of the conditions (Angastiniotis and Hadjiminas, 1981, Samavat and Modell, 2004). Wert (2012) argued that when preconception assess ment of reproductive genetic risk is concerned, the aim is to enhance well -informed reproductive decision rather than prevention (Wert et al., 2012 ). However, it would seem a greeable for countries with 33 high population frequency, and the conditions are associated with high morbidity and mortality (Wert et al., 2012). Disclosing information to partners and also leaving them with possible reproductive options afterwards is seen as a potential confidentiality and social issues . In some countries where termination of pregnancy has legal or religious restriction also pose potential ethical and legal problems (Khoury et al., 2003 , Fulda and Lykens, 2006 ). 2.5 Opportunities for preconception care in general and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Nevertheless, few studies reported that women would be motivated to participate if preconception care services are readily provided or offered. In a Dutch study, although women do not actively seek preconception advice, about 60% of the respondents demons trated interest if there is specific preconception clinic in current health care system (Poppelaars et al., 2004b). In another survey, about 70% of women participated would consider preconception advice if actively offered by own general practitioner (Jones et al., 1988 ). In a recent study, most women have believed that optimizing the heal th of a mother prior to conception would benefit the overall health of the pregnancy despite pregnancy is planned or not (Frey and Files, 2006 ). Women or couples have also begun to acknowledge the importance of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. A study in the United Kingdom reported that the participants realised that family history recording allowed knowing risk of genetic con ditions in future children and more importantly enabled pregnancy planning (Rose et al., 1999 ) and early identification of couples at genetic risk offered early genetic counselling (Czeizel, 1999a). In Netherlands, a survey carried out on a population with high genetic risk, the Dutch Turks and Moroccan who practised consanguineous 34 marriages, m ore than half of the respondents thought that the best time to inform people about these risks was before marriage, and one -fifth thought this should happen before the first pregnancy (Teeuw et al., 2014 ). 2.6 Conclusion The lite ratures offer background information in understanding the potential benefits of preconception care in general and particularly, preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. The potential challenges and opportunities to providing preconception care and precon ception assessment of reproductive genetic risk have also been highlighted. More importantly, the literatures provide an insight of potential strategies or approaches to deliver preconception services. The evidence of these approaches, particularly in prim ary care, has not been systematically examined. It was imperative to systematically examine evidences of both preconception care and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. The following two chapters, Chapter 3 and 4 will report on systema tic review on the e ffectiveness of preconception care interventions in the primary care setting and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk respectively . Considering this thesis is focussing on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, GPs' views and preparedness to providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk will be explored and this will be discussed in the later chapters. 35 CHAPTER 3 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECTS OF PRECONCEPTION CARE INTERVENTIONS ON IMPROVING PREGNANCY AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PRIMARY CARE SETTING 3.1 Introduction Previous chapters have highlighted that preconception care could be an opportunity to improve the health of women and future children . Involvement of primary care in the delivery of preconception care is emphasized by policymakers. Women have also expressed interest in discussing preconception issues with primary care practitioners. Yet, the evidence remains limited or unclear. Thus, there is a need for reviewing preconception care interventions in the primary care settings. The objective of this chapter is to present a systematic review carried out to provide an up -to-date evidence of the effectiveness of preconception car e interventions in primary care. Although the thesis focusses on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, the nature of interventions identified in this review will potentially help to inform the provision of preconception care of reproductiv e genetic risk as it is relevant to preconception risk assessment in the primary care settings . 3.2 Background Earlier, in Chapter 2, preconception care interventions directed on specific reproductive risk such as rubella vaccination, folate supplementation and diabetes control have reduced rate of major congenital abnormalities. Further, a preconception intervention involving a comprehensive preconception care assessment and management in a community -based setting by Czeizel et.al of over a 20 year period, also reported reduced rate of neural tube defects and cardiac malformations, improved maternal risk behaviour such as smoking , and 36 improved detection of genetic risk (Czeizel, 2012 ). However, earlier assessment was limite d to observational methods. An earlier systematic review published in 2002 examining the studies carried out b etween 1990 till 1999 to find evidence of preconception care interventions (Korenbrot et al., 2002 ). This review included all women of reproductive age whether planned or unplanne d pregnancy, with no previous risk factors or already has existing risks such as diabetes or epilepsy. In addition, preconception care interventions carried out in all health care settings were included. This review has identified reduced prevalence of con genital anomalies with folate supplementation before and in early pregnancy, with dietary control of maternal phenylketonuria and with early management of hyperglycaemia (Korenbrot et al., 2002 ). The identified studies were mainly on specific reproductive risk and carried out in the secondary care settings. A further Cochrane review in 2009 assessed the effectiveness of pre -pregnancy health promotion which contained advice and education on health a nd lifestyle. This review reported encouraging evidence that these interventions promoted women to have healthier lifestyle but little evidence on improving pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, women in this review were limited to those with no pre-existing medic al, obstetric or genetic risks (Whitworth and Dowswell, 2009 ). In order to address comprehe nsiveness of preconception care interventions encompassing general or multifactorial reproduct ive risks in the primary care settings with a wider spectrum of women of reproductive age group, this systematic review was carried out to examine the evidences on improving reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes. In addition, this review may provide information on potential intervention strategies in particular addressing preconception care in genetics. 37 3.3 Objective The objective of thi s review is to examine the effectiveness of preconception interventions on improving reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes in primary care. 3.4 Methods The process for conducting this review was adapted from Cochrane Systematic Review of Interventions (Clayton et al., 1996 ). 3.4.1 Search strategy Studies were systematically searched following four databases; MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO from July 1999 to end of 23 January 2013. The start dates for databases searches were set from July 1999 which ensued review carried out by Korenbrot (2002) . The search strategies was generated following consideration of previous reviews (Poppelaars et al., 2004c , Whitworth and Dowswell, 2009 ) and relevant literatures, as well as consultation with a medical librarian. The detailed s earch is available in Appendix 3.1 . A manual search of reference lists from included studies was also carried out for eligible records. This review was restricted to publi shed articles and whose full texts were available in English. 38 3.4.2 Eligibility criteria Intervention studies considered eligible for this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi -randomised studies. Only studies that clearly stated the interventions and had comparator arm were included. The comparator arm included 'usual care' or 'alternative care' or 'not involving preconception care.' Included subjects were women of reproductive aged between 18 to 45 years old, irrespective of their established medical, obstetric and genetic risk in primary care settings. The settings included were family or general practices, community health centres, community health services, community or outpatient clinics and ambulatory care services . Intervention s encompassed both primary and secondary prevention before pregnancy; the former inc luded such as, advice on nutrition, lifestyle, folate intake, smoking cessation and alcohol moderation; and the latter included such as, screening for genetic disorders and gestational diabetes. Any reported outcomes, for examples; maternal risk behaviour, adverse pregnancy outcomes and measures of psychological distress were included. 3.4.3 Study identification All retrieved records from the four databases were e ntered into the Endnote X6 , the Endnote reference managing software. Any duplicates were initially removed. Every titles and abstracts identified were screened by the researcher (NH) and checked independently by a second author (NQ) . These titles and abstracts were la belled 'include' or 'exclude'. Full texts of studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria, labelled as 'include' were assessed independently by two authors (researcher and second author) for relevance and inclusion. The researcher (NH) also hand sear ched the reference lists of all retrieved papers. Where disagreement existed, consensus was resolved through discussion. 39 3.4.4 Data extraction Data extraction was carried out by the researcher (NH) and verified by the second author (NQ) . Any disagreement was resolved through discussion. The data extraction form for the study description was informed by previous reviews. Where possible, the following descriptions of studies were documented: 1. study designs 2. characteristics of study participants (age, planning preg nancy) 3. inclusion and exclusion criteria 4. details of interventions (duration, follow -up, provided by whom) 5. details of comparator 6. settings of interventions 7. outcomes investigated 8. results of findings 3.4.5 Assessment of quality of studies Assessment of quality of studies was carried out by the researcher and verified by the second author. Quality of studies checklist was constructed as outlined for the quality assessment for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Handbook for Systemat ic Reviews of Intervention (Clayton et al., 1996 ). Five domains were used in the criteria assessed. They were: 1. sequence generation 2. allocation concealment 3. blinding of participants, study personnel and outcome assessors 4. incomplete outcome data 5. selective reporting For every included study, each domain was classified as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' risk of bias to dete rmine the quality of studies. Studies were 40 considered as highly susceptible of bias if 2 or more were classified as 'high' risk or 3 or more as 'unclear' risk of bias. 3.4.6 Data synthesis Due to the heterogeneity in the nature of interventions and outcomes, the data was not pooled in a meta -analysis. Results of studies were reported separately as presented in each study; for dichotomous data, risk ratio or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals; and continuous data was reported either as absolute difference (total or proportion of outcome in the intervention minus control group), change in mean score (before and after intervention in the intervention and control group) or change in total score (before and after intervention in the intervention and control gro up). P value or 95% confidence intervals were used to indicate effects of interventions. 3.5 Results 3.5.1 Description of included studies 4458 references were retrieved and screened. 1166 duplicates were removed. 3292 references were screened for eligible titles and abstracts. 23 full papers were retrieved; only nine studies met the inclusion criteria and wer e critically appraised (Figure 3 ). References for included studies are presented in Appendix 3.2 . 41 Figure 3 : Study flow of papers through review Both the nature of interventions and the outcome measures varied across the nine studies. The intervention; is divided into two main groups; involving multifactorial reproductive health risks, as addressing nutrition, lifestyle, vaccination, infection prevention and genetic conditions in five studies ; (Van der Zee, 2013 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ) and single reproductive health risk, specifically folate supplementation and alcohol consumption in remaining four studies (Robbins et al., 2005 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Cena et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). The component of intervention included preconception health assessment, education and counselling. These interventions were delivered by various primary care -based health professionals; general practitioners (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ), gynaecologists 42 (Robbins et al., 2005 ), nurses (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Floyd et al., 2007 ), nutrition educators (Cena et al., 2008 ) and trained facilitators (Floyd et al., 2007 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ) with computer -assisted counselling applied in one study (Schwarz et al., 2008 ). Period of interventions was grouped into two categories; brief, which involved a single session within a day and intensive; which involved more than one session and in some cases, over several weeks. The interventions were bri ef in five studies; from 30 to 60 seconds (Robbins et al., 2005 ), 15 minutes (Schwarz et al., 2008 ), to two hours of education and counselling over a single day (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Cena et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ). In four studies interventions were more intensive with two studies involved risk assessment questionnaire followed by general practitioners' consultation a nd advice based on risk assessment and general risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ); a 2 -hour group sessions on preconception health services, stress management, physical activity, smoking, gynaecologic infection, nutrition, and healthy eating demonstration over a 12 -week period in one study (Hillemeier et al., 2008 ), and counselling and motivation sessions on alcohol moderation over a 14 -week period (Floyd et al., 2007 ). In five studies, the interventions involved one to one counselling sessions whilst the other studies involved group intervention (Robbins et al., 2005 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , de Jong -Potjer 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ) whilst the other studi es involved group intervention (Floyd et al., 2007 , Cena et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ). The follow -up interval varied between two weeks to nine months (Robbins et al., 2005 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Cena et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ) or follow -up ended on the birth of subsequent pregnancy (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ). The primary care settings included were in primary care practices (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ), gynaecology outpatient clinics (Robbins et al., 2005 ), premarital clinics 43 (Bastani et al., 2010 ), community -based health centres, such as Women -Infant -Children clinics (Cena et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ) and one study was home visit (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 ). In six studies, participants recruited were limited to women planning pregnancy (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ) and the remaining included any reproductive women aged between 18 to 45 years old (Robbins et al., 2005 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Cena et al., 2008 ). Five broad categories of reproductive health outcomes were identified; improvement in maternal knowledge; improvement in self -efficacy and health locus of control; improvement in maternal risk behaviour; improvement in adverse pregnancy outcomes; and improvement in psychological outcomes. 44 3.5.2 Main findings 3.5.2.1. Improvement in maternal knowledge Two studies reported an improvement in knowledge as a result of the intervention (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). The intervention used in the Schwarz study was brief and focussed on single health risk; a 15 -minute computerised assisted counselling session of p reconception folate supplementation combined with providing a bottle of free folate tablets to participants. This led to improved women's knowledge that folate can prevent birth defects (RR 1.72, 95%CI 1.32 to 2.23) (Schwarz et al., 2008 ). In the second study the intervention was intensive and involved preconception counselling on multifactorial health risks (Elsinga et al., 2008 ). In this study knowledge of pregnancy -related risk factors and preventive measures was evaluated in two group s; women who has never been pregnant and those who has been pregnant. The study reported significant improvement in total knowledge score between the intervention and control group in both women who has never been pregnant (difference in score: 11.3 (95%CI 4.6 to 18.0, p<0.05) and those who has been pregnant (difference in score 3.0; 95%CI 1.2 to 4.84, p<0.05) (Elsinga et al., 3.5.2.2. Improvement in self -efficacy and health locus of control Two studies reported on self -efficacy and health locus of control (Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 )(21, 23). Interventions in both studies involved preconception health education addressing multifactorial reproductive health risks. The Hillemeier study, an intensive intervention led to significant improvement on self -efficacy towards eati ng healthier food (OR 1.757, p=0.008), physically active (OR 2.185, p=0.0001) and perceived higher preconception control of birth outcomes (OR 1.916, p=0.031) (Hillemeier et al., 2008 ). In the 45 Bastani study , which was a brief intervention also demonstrated significant improvement in exercise self -efficacy (p<0.001) and health locus of control scores (p<0.001 in internal health locus of control (internal HLOC) and p= 0.003 in external health locus of control (external HLOC)) (Bastani et al., 2010 ). 3.5.2.3. Improvement in maternal risk behaviour Six studies reported improvement in self -reported maternal risk behaviour; three were brief interventions (Robbins et al., 2005 , Cena et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ) and the remaining studies were intensive (Floyd et al., 2007 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ). All brief interventions focussed on single health risk; preconception folate supplemen tation. In the intensive group, two studies involved multifactorial reproductive health risks intervention (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ) whilst another study focussed on single health risk of alcohol consumption (Floyd et al., 2007 ). There was statistically significant improvement in se lf-reported folate intake before pregnancy in three studies that adopted single health risk intervention (Robbins et al., 2005 , Cena et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ) and t wo studies involving multifactorial reproductive health risks interventions (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ). Maternal alcohol self -reported consumption appeared improve d in one study that only focused on an intervention to reduce alcohol intake (Floyd et al., 2007 ). This was following five counselling sessions over a fourteen week period (Floyd et al., 2007 )(28). Reduced risky drinking was reported at three time points: three months OR 1.79 (95%CI 1.28 to 2.51), six months, OR 1.64 (95%CI 1.15 to 2.33) and nine months, OR 1.54 (95%CI 1.09 to 2.18). 46 More women who received an intensive preconception risk ass essment and counselling by general practitioners on multifactorial reproductive health risks in the Elsinga study also stopped smoking before pregnancy but this was not statistically significant (OR 3.04, 95%CI 0.95 to 9.69) (Elsinga et al., 2008 ). 3.5.2.4. Improvement in adverse pregnanc y outcomes Reported adverse pregnancy outcomes in the studies included were low birth weight, preterm delivery, congenital anomalies and prenatal death. Two studies, the Elsinga and the Lumley study, both involving multifactorial reproductive health risks interventio n, reported adverse pregnancy outcomes (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ). In the Elsinga study which involved an intensive intervention, women were followed -up until two months after subsequent delivery, and reported fewer total adverse pregnancy outcomes in the intervention group; 16.2% compared to the control group, 20.2% (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.22) (Elsinga et al., 2008 ). The Lumley study, involving brief intervention of preconception counselling by an experienced midwife during home visit to women after first delivery, did not produce statistically significant findings but reported more infants born in subsequent pregnancy in the intervention group were low birth weight (less than 2500g: OR 1.14; 95%CI 0.55 to 2.38) 3.5.2.5. Psychological outcomes due to receiving information Only one study reported psychological outcome which was anxiety following intervention (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 ). This study involved preconception education and counselling intervention of multifactorial reproductive health risks and delivered by general practitioners. A nxiety level was assessed using Spielberger State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score and reported as mean score measured; before 47 intervention (STAI -1), immediately following intervention (STAI -2) and at first trimeste r of subsequent pregnancy (STAI -3). The results were, the mean STAI -1 score was 36.4. Following intervention, the mean STAI -2 score was lower, 32.8, a decrease of 3.6 points in anxiety -levels (95% CI, 2.4 - 4.8). Women were further followed -up after delive ry of subsequent pregnancy and mean anxiety scores based on their memory of the first trimester of their pregnancy (STAI -3) score, was recorded. The mean STAI -3 score in the intervention group however, appeared higher, 38.7 (95%CI 37.9 -39.5) , when compared to baseline. Table 3.1 summarised the characteristics of included studies. This is categorised into multifactorial reproductive health risk interventions and single reproductive health risk interventions . Table 3.2 summarised the results of included studies. 48 Table 3.1 : Characteristics of included studies A: MULTIFACTORIAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RISK INTERVENTIONS STUDY DESIGN PARTICIPANTS NUMBER OF WOMEN RECRUITED DURATION AND FOLLOW -UP INTERVENTION ELEMENTS COMPARATOR ELEMENTS SETTINGS OUTCOME MEASURES Bastani 2010 Iran RCT Women 18 -35 years old planning to conceive in the first year of marriage Intervention group: 120 Control group: 120 one day; follow -up two weeks Preconception health education: individual followed by group session of 8 to 12 women on healthy lifestyle and physical activity by researcher qualified in women's health.

In general, the studies involving multifactorial reproductive health risks intervention had higher risk of bias as compared to studies of single reproductive heal th risk intervention. Allocation concealment was only described in two studies (Floyd et al., 2007 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). Blinding of the participants and personnel who delivered the intervention was not possible in majority of studies as interventions involved educati on and counselling. Documentation of participants who were lost to follow -up or refused follow -up was generally incomplete in studies involving multifactorial reprodu ctive health intervention. O ne study reported 47% of women from the intervention group an d 50% from the control group, who did not attend the follow -up assessment, were excluded from analyses (Hillemeier et al., 2008 ). In a further study, 43% of women from the intervention group who were lost to follow -up or did not become pregnant were also excluded from the analyses (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 ). In one study, only two to three percent of women recruited for preconception counselling actually attended within the study period (Elsinga et al., 2008 ). Attrition wa s not clear ly described in studies involving single reproductive health risk (Robbins et al., 2005 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Cena et al., 2008 ). Results of studies with high levels of attrition should be interp reted with caution. Selective reporting was minimal in studies involving single reproductive health risk intervention; most data for pre -specified outcomes was reported (Robbins et al., 2005 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). Results was clearly reported for the intervention group but insufficient data on the control group in one study involving multifactorial reproductive health risks intervention (Hillemeier et al., 2008 ). In addition, there may be reporting bias by the participants in studies where outcome measures were self - reported such as anxiety score (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 ) and studies indicating maternal risk behaviour outcomes (Robbins et al., 2005 , 54 Floyd et al., 2007 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). Assessment of risk of bias is summarised in Table 3.3. For detail ed data extraction and quality assessment of each included studies are presented in Appendix 3.3. 55 Table 3.3 : Risk of bias of included studies MULTIFACTORIAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RISKS INTERVENTION SINGLE REPRODUCTIVE HEALT H RISK INTERVENTION Bastani Elsinga Hillemeier Lumley De Jong - Potjer Schwarz Cena Floyd Robbins Sequence generation Low risk Unclear Unclear Low risk Low risk Low risk Unclear Low risk Unclear Allocation concealment Unclear Unclear Unclear Unclear Unclear Low risk Unclear Low risk Unclear Blinding High risk High risk High risk High risk High risk Low risk High High risk High risk Incomplete outcome data Unclear High risk High risk High risk High risk Low risk Unclear Unclear Unclear Selective reporting Low risk Unclear Unclear Unclear Unclear Low risk Low risk Low risk Low risk 56 3.7 Discussion 3.7.1 Summary of main findings This review identified nine recent randomised controlled trials in primary care or community -based settings. However, there was variation in the characteristics of interventions evaluated in this review and results were heterogeneous. Five studies involvin g multifactorial reproductive health risk interventions (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ) and these assessed maternal knowled ge (Elsinga et al., 2008 ), self - efficacy and health locus of control (Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ), risk behaviour (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ) adverse pregnancy (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ) and psychological outcomes (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 ). Further, there were four studies involving single reproductive health risk intervention reported on maternal knowledge (Schwarz et al., 2008 ) and risk behaviour (Robbins et al., 2005 , Floyd et al., 2007 , Cena et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). Considering the duration and nature of the nine interventions, four interventions were intensive and prolonged (Floyd et al., 2007 , de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 2008 ) and five were brief (Robbins et al., 2005 , Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Cena et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ). Irrespective of the nature of the interventions whether involved multifactorial or single reproductive risk, as well as intensity and duration of intervention, all demonstrated an improvement in maternal knowledge (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ), self -efficacy and health locus of control (Hillemeier et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ). With r egards to maternal risk behaviour, there was evidence for improvement in folate intake and alcohol consumption, however less convincing for smoking cessation (Elsinga et al., 2008 , Hillemeier et al., 57 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 ). The evidence for the impact of multifactorial risk interventions on adverse pregnancy outcomes was inconclusive (Lumley and Donohue, 2006 , Elsinga et al., 2008 ). One study reported impact on psychological wellbeing involving multifactorial health risks intervention and demonstrated no untoward short term anxiety but the evidence is less clear for a longer term effect (de Jong - Potjer e t al., 2006 ). 3.7.2 Comparison with existing literature Our review has added to the evidence by including recent relevant trials. Compared to a systematic review published in 1999 (Poppelaars et al., 2004c ), a further nine randomised controlled studies were identified. Furthermore, compared to a more recent Cochrane review (Whitworth and Dowswell, 2009 ) that excluded women with pre -existing medical illnesses or genetic risk, this review has identified an additional five studies (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006 , Cena et al., 2008 , Elsinga et al., 2008 , Schwarz et al., 2008 , Bastani et al., 2010 ). Unlike the previous reviews, this review focus ed on primary care or community - based settings . Although the studies in this review are too heterogeneous in terms of interventions involved, they indicate improved maternal knowledge and improved risk behaviour following interventions . Previous interventional studies that was carried out in hospital settings has demonstrated improved rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as reducing neural tube defect and congenital anomalies, following single reproductive health risk intervention of folate supplementation (Wake et al., 1996 , Czeizel, 1993 ). Further, preconception control of hyperglycaemia was also associated with reduced risk of congenital anomalies in women with pre -existing diabetes (Kitzmiller et al., 1998 ) in similar hospital setting . In addition, observational studies, comprising health promotion and education to improve folate intake in women of childbearing age have also demonstrated improved awareness and reduced risk of neural tube defects (Berry et al., 1999 , Watson et al., 2001 ). Another community - 58 based observational study, comprising a comprehensive preconception assessment and counselling on multifactorial reproductive health risks, demonstrated improved rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, reduced infectious disease, and im proved detection of genetic risk (Czeizel, 2012 ). 3.7.3 Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this is the first review to examine the effect iveness of preco nception interventions in women in the primary care or community -based settings. Previous reviews have not focused on this setting and have excluded individuals with pre -existing medical conditions (Poppelaars et al., 200 4c, Whitworth and Dowswell, 2009 ). However, there are some limitations related to the included studies for this review. In two-thirds of the studies, participants were restricted to women planning pregnancy (de Jong -Potjer et al., 2006, Floyd et al., 2007, Elsinga et al., 2008, Hillemeier et al., 2008b, Schwarz et al., 2008, Bastani et al., 2010). Women planning pregnancy are potentially more motivated to change any risk behaviour in order to have uncomplica ted pregnancies and healthy infant. This could contribute to the improvement of maternal behaviour. Thus, it is necessary to extend the study population to those even with unplanned pregnancy to evaluate the benefits of preconception care. This is crucial as unplanned pregnancies contribute to at least half of all pregnancies in England and Wales (Williamson et al., 1989 , Lafayette et al., 1999a ) and in the United States (Mitchell et al., 1993 ). The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to poor, particularly in studies involving multifactorial health risks intervention requiring caution in interpreting the effectiveness of preconcepti on interventions. Methodological flaws included lack of allocation concealment and missing outcome data due to attrition. 59 Furthermore, evidence from maternal risk behaviour and anxiety assessment relied on self -reported information which may not be reliab le. 3.7.4 Implications for future practice National and international policy document, such as UK Human Genetics Commission, NICE Maternity Guidelines, March of Dimes Foundation and Health Council of Netherlands, have highlighted the benefits of preconceptio n risk assessment (Rowley et al., 1997 , Denayer et al., 1992 ). With the introduction of the revised General Practitioner contract in 2004, each general practice was incentivised to produce a preconception risk assessm ent policy and incorporate preconception enquiry as part of certain disease domains, such as in diabetes management (Quality and Outcome Framework , 2004). Although the interventions of preconception education and counselling in this review were not support ed by strong evidence, they seem plausible strategy for improving reproductive health and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The information would be useful to help planning to provide preconception care in primary care practice in future. 3.7.5 Implications for futu re research For realistic implementation, preconception risk assessment in primary care for single risk factor interventions, and prolonged and intensive intervention would not be viable. Hence, future research needs to be pragmatic, integrating within t he structure of current general practice or primary care setting comprising multifactorial risk assessment and interventions. Furthermore, appropriately developed interventions need to be evaluated in a controlled trial environment and future studies shoul d recruit all eligible women, not merely those planning pregnancy in the forthcoming months. In this way this assessment would be accessible to all at -risk couples. 60 3.8 Conclusion Overall, there is relatively limited evidence for the effectiveness of preconception interventions in primary care. Lack of evidence should not preclude recommending preconception intervention as a component of improving reproductive health. This review ha s synthesized potential key findings specifically in the areas of knowledge and risk behaviour modification. Despite possible sources of bias, this review also has identified possible opportunities from the nature of interventions that could inform future studies. The following chapter will discuss systematic review carried out to examine specifically the effectiveness of preconception assessmen t of reproductive genetic risk in any health care setting. 61 CHAPTER 4 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECTS OF PREC ONCEPTION RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THALASSAEMIA, SICKLE CELL DISEASE, CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND TAY -SACHS DISEASE 4.1 Introduction Previously, Chapter 3 discussed on systematic review of preconception care interventions in the primary care setting and found encouraging findings in improving maternal knowledge, self -efficacy and health locus of control, as well as maternal risk behaviour. Further to this, as highlighted in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, reproductive genetic risk assessment has constituted one of th e main preconception care evaluation. The potential benefits of preconception assessment of genetic risk are also increasingly recognised, yet there is still limited evidence on its effectiveness in the health care settings. In line with the aim of this th esis and its focus on preconception assessment of genetic risk in primary care , it was important to address this issue. The objective of this chapter is to present a systematic review carried out to examine the effects of preconception assessment of genetic risk. Because of limited studies in this area, particularly in primary care, the scope of this review included all health care settings. This review was also developed with the Cochrane Collaboration of Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group. 4.2 Background As mentioned earlier in Chapter 1 of Introduction, the discussion of genetic conditions in this thesis will be confined to autosomal recessive conditions, namely, haemoglobinopathies such as Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Disease, Cystic Fibros is and Tay -Sachs disease. This is because of several reasons. Firstly, autosomal recessive conditions 62 bear carrier state property where only carries one copy of affected gene. Carriers are usually asymptomatic, they do not manifest clinically. However, fut ure offspring can be affected if he or she inherits both affected genes from carrier couples of prospective parents. Thus, detecting carrier state before conception would allow informed decisions and offer a range of reproductive options (Denayer et al., 1992 ). Secondly, these conditions were more described in the literatures with regards to genetic screening services or programmes, for examples; thalassaemia (Angastiniotis cystic fibrosis (Christie et al., 2009, Massie et al., 2009) and Tay Sachs disease (Zeesman et al., 1984, Mitchell et al., 1996). And thirdly, these conditions are recognised to cause significant p ublic health burden (Buhi and Goodson, 2007 ). Chapter 2 of Literature Review has discussed the benefits of preconception genetic carrier screening carried out in secondary schools ( Zeesman et al., 1984 ; Mitchell et al., 1996 ; Lena -Russo et al., 2002 ), before marriage (Angastiniotis and Modell, 1998, Samavat and Modell, 2004, Alswaidi and O'Brien, 2009) and before couples conceive (Czeizel , 1999, Christie et al., 2009 , Massie et al., 2009 ). Further, the benefits of family history recording as one of the components of the preconception health checks have been reported in previous obse rvational community -based studies for a broader range of genetic conditions, in both the United Kingdom (Rose et al., 1999), and Hungary (Czeizel , 2012). The participants acknowledged that this intervention enabled pregnancy planning (Rose et al., 1999) an d early identification of couples at reproductive genetic risk (Czeizel , 2012). However, these were observational studies and they are subjected to bias. While a number of observational studies have reported the potential benefits of preconception genetic carrier screening, as with other screening programmes, assessment of genetic risk has potential 63 adverse effects. Genetic assessment for reproductive risk has been linked to psychological distress such as anxiety; however, the raised anxiety was reported a s a transient phenomenon (Bekker et al., 1994 , Archibald and Wilford, 2011 ). Further, it has been reported that carrier status may be associated with a poor perception of health ( Henneman et al., 2002 ) and may have an impact on the carrier's relationships with their partner (Fanos and Johnson, 1995a ). Social impacts such as stigmatisation and discrimination have also been reported (Kennen and Schmidt, 1978 , Bonham et al., 2010 ). Despite these reported adverse effects, there are numerous psychological benefits including the support of informed decision -making and reproductive autonomy in prospective parents (Anido et al., 2005 , Archibald and Wilford, 2011 , Lewis et al., 2011 ). With regards to the economic impli cations, as for other screening programmes, there is an opportunity cost for redistributing resources from medical care to preconception screening (WHO, 1968 ). Several economic appraisals of haemoglobinopathies screening in the antenatal and neonatal settings have indicated that these strategies are cost - effective (Zeuner et al., 1999 , Davies et al., 2000 ). At a policy level, preconception genetic risk assessment has also been recommended in the Netherlands, the United States of America and the United Kingdom (Health Council of Netherlands, 2007 , March of Dimes, 2008 , Denayer et al., 1992 ). This review aims to provide concrete evidence for preconception genetic risk assessment before widespread routine implementation in current health care settings. 64 4.3 Objective The objective of this review is to examine the effectiveness of systematic preconception assessment of genetic risk in people of childbearing age for the identification of reproductive genetic risk of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or Tay -Sachs disease. 4.4 Methods The process in conducting this review followed the key steps as outlined in the Cochrane Systematic Review of Intervention Studies (Clayton et al., 1996 ). A protocol to conduct this review within the Cochrane Collaboration has also been developed and accepted by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group. The protocol is currently being reviewed by the Editor of Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group. 4.4.1 Search strategy Studies were systematically searched following four databases; MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO from 1970 to end of August 2013. The start dates for database searches were set to when carrier screening or testing was first available. Based on WHO reports, earliest carrier status assessment was introduced for Tay -Sachs disease and haemoglobinopathies from the early 1970s (Angastiniotis et al., 1995 , Kaback, 2000 ). Thus, relevant studies were searched in the databases from 1970 or the date of th e database was first available if after 1970. The detailed search is available in Appendix 4.1. The databases and the start dates of relevant studies: 1. Ovid MEDLINE (1970 until date); 2. Ovid EMBASE ((1974 until date); 3. CINAHL (1970 until date); 4. Ovid PsycINFO (1970 until date). 65 The search strategies was generated based on the guidelines in the Cochrane Systematic Review of Intervention Studies (Higgins and Green, 2011) , relevant previous reviews published fo r Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group , relevant literatures on the subject of preconception genetic risk assessment and consultation with information specialists of the Kleijnen Systematic Review as well as a medical librarian of the Unive rsity of Nottingham. A manual search from reference lists of eligible published studies was also examined to identify further relevant and potential studies. Language was not restricted in the primary searching. However, no potentially eligible non - English language study was identified. 4.4.2 Eligibility criteria Studies considered eligible for this review were intervention studies, randomised controlled and non -randomised. Before -and-after studies were also considered for inclusion. Types of participants included in this review were a ll women of reproductive age between 16 to 50 years old with or without partners, accessing any health care services which include primary, secondary and tertiary care, in hospitals and community -based settings. Any health car e services were included to anticipate limited number of retrieved studies if studies only focus on one setting for example, primary care. Community -based settings considered eligible encompassed family or general practices, community health centres, commu nity health services, community or outpatient clinics and ambulatory care services . However, i nterventions implemented in school were not included. This is because in school -based studies the true effect of the intervention possibly could not be isolated d ue to the outcomes being assessed years down the line, and school -based studies may not be appropriate to identify at-risk individuals before pregnancy. 66 The study included any types of interventions concerning genetic risk assessment performed or offered at any time prior to conception . Here, the intervention was defined as a package of risk assessment including one or more of these components: family history assessment; assessment of ethnicity background; pre-carrier test counselling or education; genetic carrier testing; genetic carrier screening The interventions involved four pre -specified conditions namely; thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or Tay -Sachs disease. Types of outcomes assessed in this review were divided into primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes 1. Reproductive outcomes in at -risk individuals or couples identified during or after pregnancy: i. Number of infants born with genetic conditions ii. Number of infants born with congenital anomalies iii. Number of infants born w ith low birth weight iv. Number of infants born prematurely 2. Decisions about future conception and pregnancy in at -risk individuals or couples at any point after intervention : i. Number of women or couples who would make use of prenatal diagnosis ii. Number of women or couples who would make use of prenatal diagnosis and consider termination of pregnancy if the child is affected iii. Number of women or couples who would consider pre - implantation genetic diagnosis and in vitro fertilization iv. Number of women or couples who would conceive using donated gametes 67 v. Number of women or couples who would consider adoption vi. Number of women or couples who would refrain from having any children Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes are divided into two; measured during pregnancy following intervention and measured at the time of intervention. 1. During pregnancy following intervention: i. Gestational date of prenatal diagnosis in at -risk women ii. Gestational date of prenatal counselling in at -risk women or couples 2. At the time of int ervention: i. Any objective measures of health -related quality of life resulting from preconception genetic risk assessment, using validated tools such as Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF36) and Health Questionnaire EQ -5D ii. Number of carrier women identified iii. Num ber of carrier women and partners, or couples identified iv. Any objective measures of quantifying psychological or social outcomes or both resulting from preconception genetic risk assessment using validated tools such as Spielberger State - Trait Anxiety Inven tory (STAI), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) v. Knowledge: Any measures of the women's or couples' or both, knowledge of reproductive genetic risk associated with carrier status for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or Tay -Sachs disease using validated self -reported questionnaire vi. Satisfaction: Any measures of the women's or couples' or both, satisfaction with the intervention using validated self - reported questionnaire 68 3. Cost of the intervention Outcomes that measured the cost and effectiveness of the interventions were also considered during undertaking this review. 4.4.3 Study identification All retrieved records from the four databases were entered into the Endnote X3, the Endnote reference managing software. Any duplicates were ini tially removed. Every titles and abstracts identified were screened by the researcher and checked independently by a second author. These titles and abstracts were labelled 'include' or 'exclude'. Full texts of studies potentially meeting the inclusion cri teria, labelled as 'include' were assessed independently by two authors (researcher (NH) and second author (NQ) ) for relevance and inclusion. The researcher (NH) also hand searched the reference lists of all retrieved papers. Where disagreement existed, co nsensus was resolved through discussion. An a uthor of the included titles and abstract were contacted for further information and clarification before including studies in the review. 69 4.4.4 Data extraction Data extraction was carried out by the researcher (NH) and verified by the second author (NQ) . Any disagreement was resolved through discussion. The data extraction form for the study description was developed based on the guidelines in the Cochrane Systematic Review of Intervention Studies (Higgins and Green, 2011) , however customised to the objective of this review. Where possible, the following descriptions of studies were documented: 1. study designs 2. characteristics of study participants (age, planning pregnancy, ethnicity, cultural characteristics, geog raphic locations) 3. inclusion and exclusion criteria 4. details of interventions (duration, follow -up, provided by whom) 5. details of comparator (if applicable) 6. settings of interventions 7. outcomes investigated 8. results of findings 4.4.5 Assessment of quality of studie s Assessment of quality of studies was carried out by the researcher and verified by the second author. Primary investigators were contacted to clarify uncertainties in data reported in the included studies or any missing data which has a potential impact on the quality of studies. According to the Cochrane guideline, for randomised control studies, criteria to assess the quality of eligible studies involved the following five domains: 1. sequence generation 2. allocation concealment 3. blinding of participants, study personnel and outcome assessors 4. incomplete outcome data 5. selective outcome reporting 70 For every included study, each domain was classified as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' risk of bias to determine the quality of studies. Studies were consi dered as highly susceptible of bias if 2 or more were classified as 'high' risk or 3 or more as 'unclear' risk of bias. As this review also considered non -randomised studies, two methodological quality checklists of non -randomised studies of interventions as outlined in the Cochrane Guideline, have been evaluated; Downs and Black instrument and the Newcastle -Ottawa scale (Deeks et al., 2003 ). For this systematic review, Downs a nd Black instrument was preferred as the tool was easy to use and items in the checklist were in agreement with this review to synthesize the evidence. The Downs and Black instrument contains 27 'yes' -or-'no' questions across five sections. The five sectio ns include questions about: 1. Overall quality of the study (10 items) 2. External validity; the ability to generalize findings of the study (3 items) 3. Study bias; to assess bias in the intervention and outcome measure(s) (7 items) 4. Confounding and selection bias; to determine bias from sampling or group assignment (6 items) 5. Power of the study; to determine if findings are due to chance (1 item) 4.4.6 Data synthesis Due to the differences in the study designs, nature of interventions and outcomes, the data was not pooled in a meta -analysis. Outcome measures were reported separately for the two included studies. Results were presented as reported in each study. Outcome measures for knowledge and anxiety were presented as mean score of all the participants or change in mean score as reported in the two studies. P value of < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results on outcomes such as uptake of screening, feeling worri ed, recall of test -results, 71 understanding of test -results, reproductive intentions and satisfaction were reported as proportion.

The details of the two included studies are presented in the Appendix 4.3. 72 Table 4.1 : Characteristics of included studies Henneman 2002 Netherlands Lakeman 2008 Netherlands Aim of study To assess the impact of offering preconception cystic fibrosis carrier couple screening To study psychological outcomes, knowledge, recall and understanding of test-results, satisfaction and reproductive intentions in preconception carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies in a multi -ethnic population in Netherlands, in which a couple's eligibility for cystic fibrosis and/or haemoglobinopathie s was based on both partners' ancestry Study design Non-randomised study involving two different approaches in the interventions; firstly, looking at the mode of invitation for screening and the other was comparing three modes of information giving Non-randomised, before -and after study Eligibility criteria Age: 20 - 35 years old Individual who had a partner with whom they were planning a pregnancy, irrespective of whether this would be in the near future or at a later date Age: 20 - 35 years old Individual who had a partner with whom they were planning a pregnancy, irrespective of whether this would be in the near future or at a later date Exclusion criteria Pregnancy, positive family history of cystic fibrosis, age younger than 18 years o ld, having fertility and psychosocial problems Pregnancy, inability to read and write in Dutch, positive family history of cystic fibrosis and/or haemoglobinopathies Recruitment procedure Names and addresses of potential participants were obtained fro m the practice register and population register and either invited by own general practitioners and Municipal Health Service. Recruitment period: May 1997 to December 2000 Names and addresses of potential participants were obtained from the practice register and population register and either invited by own general practitioners and Municipal Health Service. Recruitment period: January to December 2005 Setting Community -based Community -based Intervention First approach of intervention invol ved mode of invitation, individuals were sent either invitation letters by the Municipal Health Service (MHS) or by their general practitioners. Both letters were identical, but signed by the Director of Municipal Health Service and the latter written and signed by the general practitioners respectively. In this intervention, the primary outcome was uptake of screening. The second approach involved three types of information giving regarding carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis; pre - carrier test edu cation provided during a group session, individual pre -carrier test consultation by the general practitioner and the third group was sent a brochure about cystic fibrosis and carrier testing. No face-to-face session involved with the third group. The group session was provided by the researcher (L.H).The interventions were then followed by the actual carrier testing. Target individuals were sent invitation for screening, information leaflet and decisional questionnaire which have a question on individual's ancestry, to screen for eligibility. Decisional questionnaire were self -reported. Eligible participants with their partner were required to visit their general practitioner for pre -carrier test consultation followed by offering carrier testing. Samples were taken and actual testing of the samples only carried out after receiving signed informed consent form. A brochur e on information about clinical and genetic aspects of the conditions, test procedure, test sensitivity was provided to take home. *step -wise cystic fibrosis carrier testing; one partner tested first and the second was tested only if the first partner's result was positive. For haemoglobinopathies carrier testing, both partners were tested. 73 Henneman 2002 Netherlands Lakeman 2008 Netherlands Main outcomes Main outcomes were reported by participants using a validated structured questionnaire completed at three different measurement points; 1: before pre -carrier test education or consultation 2: within one week after consultation but before test -results 3: six months after receiving carrier test - results Main outcomes were reported by participants using a validated structured questionnaire completed at four different measurement points; 1: 30 min before pre -carrier test consultation 2:within one week after consultation but before test -results 3: one week after receiving carrier test - results 4: three months after receiving carrier test - results Psychologic al outcomes (anxiety level feeling worried ) Not applicable Measured at 3 Measured at 1,2,3,4 Measured at 3,4 Knowledge outcomes Measured at 1,2,3 Measured at 1,2,3 Recall of test-results Measured at 3 Measured at 3,4 Understandi ng of test - results Measured at 3 Measured at 2,3,4 Reproductive intentions Measured at 2,3 Measured at 2,4 Satisfaction Measured at 3 Measured at 3,4 Study population Invitation n=38291 Response n=1160 (580 couples) Eligible n=1118 (559 couples) Tested n= 1118 (559 couples) Invitation n=9453 Response n=1566 Eligible n=556 Tested n=87 individuals and providing 72 couple for testing 47 couples eligible for testing of cys tic fibrosis only, 6 for haemoglobinopathies only, and 19 for both Both, the Henneman and the Lakeman studies were diverse in their study design, methodology and intervention. They were non - randomised; in one study, there were two different approaches in the interventions; firstly, looked at the mode of invitation for scr eening and the other was comparing three modes of information giving (Henneman et al., 2002 ) and the other was before -and-after intervention study (Lakeman et al., 2008 ). Both studies were community -based and conducted in the Netherlands. In both studies, participants recruited were individuals aged 20 to 35 years old, with a steady partner with whom they were planning a pregnancy irrespective of whether it is in 74 near future or later. In other words, eligible participants involved both couples. Henneman (2002) assessed the accept ability and effects of offering preconception cystic fibrosis carrier couple screening. In this study, two different approaches in the interventions were described; one looked at the mode of invitation for screening and the next, compared three types of in formation giving regarding carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis. With regards to the mode of invitations, individuals were sent either invitation letters by the Municipal Health Service (MHS) or by their general practitioners. Both letters were ide ntical, but signed by the Director of Municipal Health Service and the latter written and signed by the general practitioners respectively. In this intervention, the primary outcome was uptake of screening. The second approach in volved three types of information giving regarding carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis; pre -carrier test education provided during a group session, individual pre -carrier test consultation by the general practitioner and the third group was sent a brochure about cystic fibrosis and carrier testing. No face -to-face session involved with the third group. The group session was provided by the researcher (L.H).The interventions were then followed by the actual carrier testing. The primary outcomes eval uated for these interventions were psychological outcome, knowledge regarding cystic fibrosis, recall and understanding of test -results, reproductive intentions, and satisfaction. All outcomes were obtained from a self -reported questionnaire which was comp leted at three different measurement points; before pre -carrier test education or individual consultation (1), within one week after the consultation but before the results (2), and six months after receiving the test -results (3). The self -reported questio nnaire was previously validated (Henneman et al., 2001b ). 75 Figure 4 : Illustrates the different approaches in the interventions (Henneman 2002) MODE OF PRE -CARRIER TEST INFORMATION GIVINGMODE OF INVITATIONAPPROACH INVITATION BY MUNICIPAL HEALTH SERVICES (MHS) invitation letters signed by the Director GROUP EDUCATION BY RESEARCHER GENERAL PRACTITIONER CONSULTATIONBROCHURE GIVENINVITATION BY OWN GENERAL PRACTITIONER GROUP EDUCATION BY RESEARCHERGENERAL PRACTITIONER CONSULTATIONBROCHURE GIVEN 76 The Lakeman study involved offering preconception ancestry -based carrier couple screening for both cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies. This unique targeted ancestry approach was based on a validated decisional instrument (Lakeman et al., 2006). The nature of the screening was participant -driven, where couples' eligibility to do screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies were based on self -reported ancestry enquired in the decisional instrument. Eligible couples had individual pre -carrier test consultation by their general practitioners followed by the actual carrier testing. Primary outcomes evaluated in this study were psychological outcome and kno wledge about inheritance. These outcomes were measured before -and-after the introduction of the intervention. There were also other outcomes assessed; recall of test -results, understanding of test -results, reproductive intentions and satisfaction. However, these were measured only after intervention. All outcomes were obtained from a self-reported questionnaire which were completed at four different measurement points; about 30 minutes before pre -carrier test consultation by their general practitioners (1) , within one week after the consultation but before the results (2), one week (3) and three months (4) after receiving the test -results. The questionnaire was pr eviously validated (Lakeman et al., 2006 ). 4.5.2 Main findings 4.5.2.1. Uptake of screening Only the Henneman study reported this outcome. Response rate of participants offered for group education was higher when invited by the general practitioners (11.9% 95%CI 10.2 -13.8) as compared to invitation by the Municipal Health Service (9.2% 95%CI 8.4 -10.0). For participants offered consultation by general practitioners, response rate was similar irrespective of the mode of invitation; MHS 24.7% 95%CI 77 4.5.2.2. Psychological outcomes In the Henneman study, participants were asked to indicate whether they felt worried while waiting for their test -results which were asked at six months follow -up. The study reported that overall, only 8 out of 826 participants (<1%) reported worry; 4 of whom were carriers. Participants who attended educational group session and those who received brochure were likely to be more worried than those who attended a general practitioner's consultation (p<0.04). In the Lakeman study, anxiety level was assessed before -and-after the intervention at four measurement points as described earlier, by using a 6-item short form of Spielberger Strait -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) on a 4-point scale. In this scale, a score of 1 indicated low level of anxiety and a score of 4 indicated high level of anxiety. Here, the results of STAI were reported as mean scores. This study reported no further worsening of anxiety level following intervention; the mean scores at four measure ment points were 1.6, 1.5, 1.3 and 1.3 respectively, (p<0.001). The participants were also asked to indicate whether they felt worried while waiting for their test -results; only 31 out of 116 participants (27%) reported worry. 4.5.2.3. Knowledge outcomes The He nneman study compared knowledge outcome of participants following the three preconception interventions on information giving as mentioned previously. This was assessed using five multiple choice questions on cystic fibrosis and carrier inheritance at thre e measurement points; before (1) and after (2) pre -carrier test group education or individual general practitioner consultation, and six month after the receipt of test -results (3). The study reported that, at all three 78 measurement points, the knowledge sc ore were significantly higher for participants who attended the group education session than those who received general practitioners' consultation (p<0.001). The increase in knowledge score within one week following group education was significantly highe r than after general practitioner consultation (p=0.001). When compared at 6 months after test -results, knowledge score of participants who attended the general practitioners' consultation was similar to those who did not have personal education while thos e who had the group education were higher. Lakeman (2008) assessed participants' knowledge using five item questionnaire about inheritance of cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies, measured at three measurement points as described earlier. This study r eported that the knowledge score significantly increased from before pre -carrier test consultation (knowledge score=2.8) to after consultation (knowledge score=3.7), (P<0.05). However decreased at one week after receiving test results (knowledge score=2.8, p<0.001). 4.5.2.4. Recall of test -results Recall of test results was assessed at six -month follow -up in the Henneman study while the Lakeman (2008) study assessed at three - month follow -up. In both studies majority of the participants were able to recall their te st-results. 771 out of 826 (93%) participants in the Henneman study and the Lakeman study was 113 out of 120 (94%) participants. 79 4.5.2.5. Understanding of test -results To assess understanding of test -results, participants were asked on their residual risks foll owing their own test -results, for example; risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis or haemoglobinopathies. In the Henneman (2002) study, understanding of test -results were measured at six months follow -up and reported that overall more than half of the participants had a correct understanding of residual risk; 536 out of 826 participants (64%). The participants who attended the grou p education (72%) were more likely than those who attended the general practitioners' consultation (47%), or those who received brochures (58%), to correctly understand their test results (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 - 2.6). In the Lakeman (2008) study, understandin g of test -results was measured at one week and three months following test results. The proportion of participants who correctly understood their residual risk was 53% and 39% respectively. 4.5.2.6. Reproductive intentions Participants' reproductive intentions in the Henneman (2002) study were obtained following the information giving interventions and at six months follow -up. Results were reported as following all interventions. When asked in situation if both partners were found to be carriers, overall, 36% of the participants thought they wou ld refrain from having children; 87% would make use of prenatal diagnosis if pregnant; and of those who opt for prenatal diagnosis, 68% would consider termination of pregnancy if the child i s found to have cystic fibrosis. There were still a small proportion that was undecided; 28%, 9% and 25% respectively, in all three situations. At six months follow -up, those identified carriers reported no impact of the test -results on their reproductive plans. 80 The Lakeman (2008) study also reported about the same results; 27% of the participants thought they would refrain from having children; 89% would make use of prenatal diagnosis if pregnant; and 68% would consider termination of pregnancy if the child is found to have cystic fibrosis . 4.5.2.7. Satisfaction The Henneman (2002) study reported high satisfaction rate; overall, majority would recommend carrier assessment to others (88%) and 95% would have the test if they decide to test again. The Lakeman (2008) study also reported simil ar results; 75% and 91% respectively . Table 4.2 summarizes the results reported for both included studies . 81 Table 4.2 : Results of included studies Outcomes Henneman 2002 Lakeman 2008 Uptake of screening Outcome: Response rate of participants Results: Response rate of participants offered for group education was higher when invited by the general practitioners (11.9% 95%CI 10.2 - 13.8) as compared to invitation by the Municipal Health Service (9.2% 95%CI 8.4 -10.0). For participants offered consultation by general practitioners, response rate was similar irrespective of the mode of invitation; MHS 24.7% 95%CI 22.1 -27.4); general practitioner (24.7% 95%CI 19.1 - 30.9).

In general, both studies were liable to high risk of bias as both studies were non -randomised. However, there are certain research questions which may not necessarily always be answered by randomised controlled trials, for example, studies involving genetic screening as they potentially have ethical implications. The overall quality of both studies were good; aim of s tudy as well as interventions, participants and main outcomes were explicitly described. External validity of study was also good. However, the studies were subjected to methodological bias; non randomised, blinding was not possible and difficulties of con trolling confounding factors such as differences in the care of the participants. In addition, both studies were also at risk of response bias as the outcom es measured were self -reported. 84 Table 4.3 : Quality a ssessment of included studi es (Downs and Black checklist) Henneman 2002 Lakeman 2008 1.

The interventions involved assessment of two autosomal genetic conditions, cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies. H owever, there was a considerable variation in the nature of the interventions. In the Henneman (2002) study, the focus was looking at the uptake of screening based on different mode of invitations and also examine the outcomes of different modes of informa tion giving; pre -carrier test group education, individual general practitioner consultation and giving a brochure. Whereas the focus in the Lakeman (2008) study was to assess the effects of offering preconception carrier couple screening based on ancestry. With regards to uptake of screening, there was no difference in the response rate of participants invited by the Municipal Health Service (MHS) or by their own general practitioners. Previous study about cervical cancer screening reported higher respon se rate in the group invited by own general practitioners (Hermens et al., 2000 ). The Henneman study has demonstrated an added important finding; an invitation by the MHS could reduce the extra workload of general practitioners to invite (Henneman et al., 2002). Furthermore, the response rate of participants for pre -carrier test general practitioners' consultation were more than those offered group education. The reason for this may be that couples preferred to consult and discuss with their 86 own general practitioner individually and not during group discussion where there were bound to have other couples. This could indicate that the general practitioners potentially ideal t o assess and screen as well as provide genetic information to the target population. This finding potentially has an implication to extend the role of general practitioners and primary care. Genetic assessment for reproductive risk has been previously lin ked to psychological distress such as anxiety and worry (Bekker et al., 1994 , Archibald and Wilford, 2011 ), however, in both studies, only a small proportion of participants reported worriedness while waiting for test - results following pre -carrier test education or consultatio n (Henneman et al., 2002 , Lakeman et al., 2008). Further the Lakeman (2008) study reported no worsening of anxiety level following preconception ancestry -based carrier couple screening. The reason for this may be that both couples had pre -carrier test educ ation or counselling together, sharing the information together likely to reduce problems in relationships (Watson et al., 1 992a ). With regards to knowledge, both studies reported significant improvement from before and just after pre -carrier test education or counselling. The importance of s ufficient knowledge was reported to help in informed decision -making when undergoin g genetic screening (Marteau et al., 2001 , Stefansdottir et al., 2010 ). The Henneman (2002) study reported the increase within one week following group education was significantly higher than after general practitioner consultation (p=0.001). This may be due to the differences between the education session de livered, person providing the education or the difference among the participants. The group sessions potentially have protected time to carry out, not like the general practitioners where counselling was carried out during their practice, thus may have mor e time to explain and discuss. The researcher who provided the group education may have a special interest in this subject and research thus contribute to the content of information given. Finally, the participants who 87 attended the group session may be mot ivated and supported by o ther participants in the group. However, the increase in knowledge was not sustained following three or six months of intervention. In both studies, majority of the participants could recall their test -results. With regards to und erstanding their residual risk, both studies reported satisfactory results. In the Henneman (2002) study, overall more than half of the participants had a correct understanding of residual risk; 536 out of 826 participants (64%). The participants who attended the group education (72%) were more likely than those who attended the general practitioners' consultation (47%), or those who received brochures (58%), to correctly understand their test results (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 - 2.6). These results could be re lated to the results of knowledge. With regards to reproductive intentions if both partners have positive test-results, both studies demonstrated that the participants would make use of available reproductive options. This has implication that the interventions potentially could facilitate informed reproductive decision. Overall, satisfaction reported in both studies was high. Participants acknowledged the importance of reproductive genetic risk assessed before conception and would recommend to oth ers. 4.7.2 Strengths and limitations This is the first review to examine the effects of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the four specified autosomal recessive genetic conditions. However, evidence to support the benefits of preconcep tion assessment of reproductive genetic risk is restricted. There were only two studies eligible for this rev iew and the nature of both studies was different. The limitations to interpret the direct effect of interventions were also related to methodologic al bias; both studies were non randomised studies, and confounders were not clearly reported. Furthermore, participants recruited in both studies were those 88 planning pregnancy. It is important to include those with unplanned pregnancies as unplanned pregna ncies contribute to at least half of all pregnancies reported in the United States (Finer and Zolna, 2011 ) and England and Wales (Lafayette et al., 199 9a). There were also potential limitations with regards to the outcomes reported. In the Henneman (2002) study as, not all outcomes were reported individually for each intervention. Some were reported as overall; for example, recall of test -results, understanding of residual risk, reproductive intentions and satisfaction; following all intervention but only at certain time of measurement . In addition, these outcomes were reported only after interventions. Similarly, In the Lakeman (2008) study only knowledge and anxiety score were reported before -and-after interventions. The rest were reported only after inte rvention, however different in the time of measurement (Lakeman et al., 2008) . On the other hand, recall of test -results, understanding of residual risk, reproductive intentions and satisfaction inevitably appropriate to be asked only following pre -carrier test consultation or education. 4.7.3 Implications for future practice The national and international organizations, such as UK Human Genetics Commission and the Health Council of Netherlands, have acknowledged and recommended preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk (Health Council of Netherlands, 2007 , Denayer et al., 1992 ). However, this is not carried out routinely and there is still existing uncertainties of the benefits of assessing reproductive genetic risk preconception as reported previously (Bekker et al., 1994 , Archibald and Wilford, 2011 , Wert et al., 2012 ). This review may provide an insight into the beneficial aspects of assessing reproductive genetic risk preconception. In fact, the preferred mode of invitation for offering screening was also highlighted. The review has demonstrated that preconception asses sment and education have positive benefits and implications on the target populations' emotion, knowledge, recall and 89 understanding of test -results and satisfaction. These would potentially support informed reproductive decision -making. The information gathered would be useful to help health care providers planning to provide preconception screening and counselling in future. 4.7.4 Implications for future research The preliminary findings of both studies have demonstrated promising results. However, further pr ospective cohort studies would help assess the actual effect of pre -carrier test group education or counselling and carrier testing; particularly its effect on reproductive decisions. Furthermore, there is a need for broader d efinitions of target populatio n, not only on women planning pregnancy. Future interventions should involve currently practiced health care providers such as general practitioners and nurses in providing pre -carrier test information giving rather than a researcher as described in this s tudy. Pre -carrier test education and counselling should also include other common reproductive genetic risk conditions such as sickle cell disease and Tay - Sachs disease. 4.8 Conclusion This review highlights the paucity of research examining the effects of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, thus it is difficult to conclude concrete evidence addressing the effects of preconception assessment of genetic risk in people of childbearing age. Nevertheless, this review has highlighted encouragin g outcomes. More research is needed to explore further the long term effects, and interventions should involve broader range of health care professionals such as nurses and public health staffs, and also define participants to include also those with unpla nned pregnancy. 90 CHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT OF PRECONCEPTION ASSESSMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE GENETIC RISK IN PRIMARY CARE QUESTIONNAIRE 5.1 Introduction The conclusions in systematic reviews in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 have highlighted a range of approaches and encouraging outcomes which resulted from preconception care interventions in general such as ; improvement in maternal knowledge and self -efficacy as well as maternal risk behaviour , and specific to preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk for example ; making use of expanded reproductive options, increased understanding of test -results and satisfaction. Clearly, there is still lack of evidence to support the implementation of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the p rimary c are setting. However, t he seriousness of the autosomal recessive conditions such as; haemoglobinopathies and cystic fibrosis, and their relatively high prevalence has prompted the United Kingdom Human Genetics Commission to recommend preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care health system. I n line with objective 4 of this thesis, exploring the attitudes and opinio ns of GPs in the United Kingdom t o preconception assessm ent of reproduct ive genetic ris k was considered important to improve the impact of this thesis . A questionnaire survey was carried out to achieve this objective. It is hoped that the results of the survey and the positive benefits highlighted from the systematic reviews would be useful to provide an understanding to developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the UK health infrastructure . There are three phases of work in relation to questionnaire survey discussed in this thesis . They are; 1. Developing the questionnaire 2. Implementing the questionnaire survey 3. Analysis and results of questionnaire survey 91 The objective of this chapter, Chapter 5 is to describe the development of the new questionnaire as the survey instrument. A new questionnaire was developed as there was lack of existing questionnaire as indicated while carrying out literature reviews, which fully addressed GPs' opinions and attitudes on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. The following phases of work which are implementi ng the questionnaire survey and; analysis and results of questionnaire survey will be discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 respectively. 5.2 Background The assessment of reproductive genetic risk, to date, focuses mainly on the antenatal and newborn periods (Qureshi et al., 2004 ). In particular, reproductive genetic screening or testing, which often occurs during pregnancy leaves the couple or prospective parents with restricted reproductive options (Dormandy et al., 2008 ). As highlighted in previous chapters, identifying carriers or risk of carrier state before pregnancy can provide a more appropria te timeframe for informed decision -making and expands reproductive options (Jones and Fallon, 2002 , Wille et al., 2004b ). Realising this, there is growing interest to offer preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk within the healthcare infrastructure (Czeizel, 1992 ). In particular, the importance of primary care or general practice involvement is increasingly highlighted (Heyes et al., 2004 , Morgan et al., 2004 , Denayer et al., 1992 ).The GPs are the gatekeeper to secondary care, thus, their possible roles are identifying individuals at genetic risk, providing support and counselling, and referring to specialists when appropriate (Qureshi and Raeburn, 1993 ). Before a formal program of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk is introduced or implemented in the primary care setting, it is essential that studies are undertaken to explore the GPs' readiness to 92 run the program, identify re sources a nd needs to facilitate the delivery of the program and also to understand their experiences and potential barriers to providing the service. To address this, a questionnaire survey was undertaken aimed to explore GPs' opinions and attitudes to providing reproductive genetic risk assessment to women or couples of reproductive age before conception, in the existing primary care practice. 5.3 Objective This s urvey has six specific objectives. The objectives are; 1. To explo re GPs' current experiences on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. 2. To explore potential approach on how to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. 3. To explore potential setting within primary care to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. 4. To identify potential resources ne eded to support the delivery o f preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in prim ary care. 5. To explore potential barriers to providing preconcepti on assessment of reproductive genetic risk in current practice. 6. To explore the attitudes of GPs about their preparedness to providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk assessment in current practice. 93 5.4 Methods A questionnaire was devised to address the six objectives of this survey study. The developme nt of questionnaire consists of generating items or statements for the questionnaire, and determining the format of questionnaire. This involves ; 1. A review of liter atures that addressed the six objectives specified to help generate items for questionnaire. 2. Focus group data to complement the literature review in generating items for questionnaire. 3. Experts' review for face and content validity. 4. Pilot testing; questionn aire sent to a group of GPs for them to complete and comment for face and content validity. The term 'questionnaire item ' will be used in the discussion throughout this thesis to indicate items or statements in the questionnaire. 5.4.1 Generating questionnaire items from literature review Jaeger (1984) described the use of literature review is \"almost inevitable in developing questionnaire \". Literature review aimed to identify key issues and gaps in current topic being studied (Jaeger, 1984 ). For this study, the literature r eview has provided a starting point in the initial development of the questionnaire. Information from published literatures was used to generate specific questionnaire items. The literatures reviewed have involved studies not just specifically on preconcep tion assessment of reproductive genetic risk but also on preconception care in general, population -based carrier screening programs, and assessment of common genetic co nditions in general for example, breast cancer. All the studies have focussed on aspects of opinions and a ttitude s of a range of primary care providers where 94 majority were GPs, and also included practice nurses, health visitors, midwive s as well as obstetricians and gynaecologis t that were based in outpatient clinics. It was necessary to broaden the range of literatures to inform the questionnaire items as existing literatures on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care settings alone were still limited. Where possible, the act ual questionnaires of the studies were obtained for references. For this study, t wo actual questionnaires were retrieved; one from the author himself (Poppelaars et al., 2004a ) and the other was accessed online (Heyes et al., 2004 ). During the literature review , a number of studies were identified that addressed the opinions and attitudes of primary care providers towards providing either preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, genetic screening for common g enetic conditions and providing preconception care. Certain questionnaire items that were used in the previous studies have also helped to inform the questionnaire items for my survey. The following are themes for the questionnaire identified from the literatures and in relation to the objectives of this study. The questionnaire items developed are grouped into th ese themes : 1. GPs' current experiences 2. Approac h on how to deliver the service 3. Potential setting s in primary care 4. Potential resources 5. Potential b arriers 6. Attitudes of GPs on their preparedness Table 5.1 shows relevant studies from literature r eview that had helped in the generation of questionnaire items . 95 Table 5.1 : Relevant studies from literature review considered for generating questionnaire items LITERATURES THEMES: QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS Author Year of publication Journal Title of study Current experiences Approach to deliver Primary care settings Resources Barriers Attitudes of preparedness Watson et.al. 1991 British Journal of General Practice Attitudes to carrier screening for cystic fibrosis: a survey of health care professionals, relatives of sufferers and other members of the public Boulton et.al. 1996 British Journal of General Practice The views of general practitioners on community carrie r screening for cystic fibrosis Mennie et.al. 1998 J Med Screen Attitudes of general practitioners t o screening for cystic fibrosis Suchard et.al. 1999 British Journal of General Practice General practitioners' views on genetic screening for common diseases Acheson et.al. 2000 Genetics in Medicine Family history -taking in community family practice: Implications for genetic screening Poppelaars et.al. 2004 Family Practice Current practice and future interest of GPs and prospective parents in pre -conception care in The Netherlands Morgan et.al. 2004 Genetics in Medicine Practice patterns of obstetrician -gynecologists regarding preconception and prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis Heyes et.al. 2004 Family Practice Preconception care: practice and beliefs of primary care workers McCahon et.al. 2009 Clinical Genetics General practitioners' attitudes to assessment of genetic risk of common disorders in routine primary care 96 Current experiences Morgan (2004) explored obstetricians and gynaecologists' experiences on practicing on preconception screening for cystic fibrosis. There were two types of practices described; took family genetic history routinely when taking full medical history and took family genetic history routinely if the woman is planning pregnancy (Morgan et al., 2004 ). Heyes (2004) explored primary care providers' experiences about providing preconception care in general. The respondents reported have provided opportunistically in routine clinic, family planning and well women clini cs. A small proportion of the respondents reported having written policy on preconception care at their practice (Heyes et al., 2004 ). Approach on how to deliver Boulton (1996) explored the GPs' views on potential approach to offer carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and reported that majority agreed to offer screening when the individuals seek family planning advice (Boulton et al., 1996 ). In another study, Acheson (2000) reported that the family history was mainly discussed by the GPs at patients' first visits and also during well care rather than illness visits (Acheson et al., 2000 ). Primary care settings Heyes (2004) surveyed primary care providers' experiences of providing preconception care in the clinic settings. The respondents reported that they have provided in routine clinics, dedicated preconception clinics, family plann ing and well woman clinic (Heyes et al., 2004 ). These replies given by the respondents informed the potential settings to provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. 97 Resources Mennie (1998) reported potential support mentioned by GPs include information giving before and after carrier testing and training (Mennie et al., 1998 ). In a study by Heyes (2004) , refresher courses and evidence -based guidelines were suggested as resources to assist in the general practices (Heyes et al., 2004 ). Barriers In a study by Mennie (1998) , screening for carrier was perceived to do more harm than good (Mennie et al., 1998 ). Heyes (2004) reported that barriers to provi ding preconception care include poor contact or difficult to capture women planning to conceive, lack of resources and lack of training (Heyes et al., 2004 ) Attitudes of GPs focussing on their preparedness to provide the service Five studies were identified that reported GPs' attitudes on preparedness of offering screening for reproductive genetic risk. All studies were on carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (Watson et al., 1991 , Boulton et al., 1996 , Mennie et al., 1998 , Morgan et al., 2004 , Poppelaars et al., 2004d ). There was a range of questions pertaining to GPs' preparedness. T hey were asked on willingness to provide carrier screening routinely (Watson et al., 1991 , Boulton et al., 1996 , Mennie et al., Poppelaars et al., 2004d ); pre-carrier test counselling post - carrier test counselling and disclosure of test -results In addition , the two stu dies reported preparedness to offer screening only in specific situations such as, when is requested by the patients, couples planning pregnancy, positive family inheritance of genetic conditions, if the partners are known carriers or has cystic fibrosis a nd patients or her partners are in high risk ethnic group ( (Morgan et al., 2004 , Poppelaars et al., 2004d ) Further, in two studies exploring GPs' attitude about providing screening for common genetic conditions, reported that they were 98 willing to take family history and offer counselling if given necessary training and information of assessing genetic risk ( (Suchard et al., 1999b , McCahon et al., 2009 ). To further inform the content of the questionnaire, focus group was carried out with groups of primary care provider s and women of reproductive age . Focus group data was analysed using a framework approach. 5.4.2 Using focus group data to inform questionnaire items on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care 5.4.2.1. Introduction Focus group is defined as ''a group of individuals selected and assembled by researchers to discuss and comment on, from personal experience, the topic that is the subject of the research'' (Powell and Single, 1996 ). It is ''a method to gather information and to obtain an understanding or insight of a specific subject from a range of views from different groups of people'' (Morgan and Kreuge r, 1993 ). Kruger (1994) also described focus groups as ''a carefully planned discussion designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a permissive, non -threatening environment'' (Kreuger, 1994 ). Interaction, which is its unique characteristic, allows participants to explore and discuss the topic in great detail a s well as clarify their views (Liamputtong, 2011 ). Focus groups can offer an avenue for work at various steps of the research process, for example, obtaining information, generating hypothesis, generating new concepts to hypothesis testing and refining already known concepts (Kreuger, 1994 ). 99 Focus group has been used for devel oping surveys, in particular to generate questionnaire i tems as well as improving the contents of questionnaire items in surveys (O'Brien, 1993 ). O' Brien (1993) described his accounts of using focus groups to develop questionnaire items. His study involved exploring gays and bisexual men about their experiences and views regarding Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) to develop items for questionnaire survey, which later became a community project (O'Brien, 1993 ). In this study, the primary aim of the focus group was to elicit participants' attitudes and ideas about pr econception care particularly on the topic of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. The themes gathered from focus group analysis using a framework approach were then mapped to the themes identified from literature review. Following this, questionnaire items were derived. 5.4.2.2. Methods In this study , the focus groups were made up of one group of primary care pro vider s involving three GPs, a midwife and two health visitors; and six groups of women in the reproductive age group. The responses from primary care providers unfortunately were limited; there were only one group involved in the focus group. The demographic details of the participants will be presented later in this chapter. It was important to have both the perspectives of primary care pro viders and the women to inform the contents of the questionnaire. This is because i nformation provided by the GPs, health visitors and midwif e are important as they are potentially involve in the management of women's health i n primary care. This has helped provide understanding in the management of issues of interest from a different angle. Focus groups data of women was necessary to explore their opinion on preconception assessment of genetic risk who may take up the service . Results from the analysis are used to inform questionnaire items. 100 5.4.2.3. Data collection The preliminary process of planning and recruitment for the focus groups was initiated by the members of Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care - Nottingha mshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire - Action Before Conception (CLAHRC -NDL-ABC) study; Exploratory study of acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of preconception health assessment intervention in primary care. The initial activity of the CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study was already taken place before I began my PhD. The main aim of exploratory phase of CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study was to explore the feasibility of preconception health assessment as an intervention for preconception care assessment. For this process , focus groups were involved. The objectives were to explore and identify current practice, attitudes, beliefs and information needs concerning preconception care in general and assessment among women and primary care providers . In this CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study, p reconception care assessment encompassed a variety of risks such as medical conditions, drugs abuse, infections and lifestyle risk such as smoking and alcohol. Reproductive gen etic risk assessment constitutes one of preconception care assessment in the CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study. I first obtained a Research Passport or an Honorary Research Contract to qualify to undertake research activities within the National Health Service (NHS), before getting involved in the exploratory phase of the study. With timing of Research Passport, it allowed me to take the role of an assistant moderator. During the focus group s, I have made field notes and captured as much information on the topic of interest, particularly on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. I also observed the group dynamics and the terminologies and words used in the discussion. Written n otes were summarised and distributed among other involved members of CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study, to help give input and improve on the qualitative data. The disadvantage was I had no control in the discussion of the focus groups. Besides assistant 101 moderator, I had helped to improve the interview guide for the focus group as well as helped to refine preconception health assessment as an intervention for the CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study. The focus groups were audio taped and transcribed by the CLAHRC - NDL-ABC study members. Transcripts were cross -chec ked by the assigned CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study members to ensure their reliability. I was given permission by the lead researcher the study to review the transcripts. I reviewed and analysed the transcripts independently in line with the objectives of my thesis . This was really important to ensure the authenticity of the analyses. At this point, no involvement or input from the members of the CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study as it was necessary to extract the data based on the objectives o f my study and particularly focussed on the issues of interest. 5.4.2.4. Data analysis Focus group data analysis was guided by framework analysis methodology. Framework analysis was chosen for a range of reasons. First, it is suitable to analyse a cross -sectional data, in particular, for this study that has specific research objectives (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003 ). Secondly , interpretations of participants' experiences are transparent (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003 ), thus, allows me to understand and interpret directly. Finally , it is better adapted to a study that has a limited time frame (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003 ). The management and analysis of data was carried out manually on paper . The initial framework was derived from research objectives and prior literature review that addressed the objectives of the survey . To recap, the themes identified from research objectives (relevant to preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk ) and literature review are: 102 1. GPs' current experiences . 2. Approach on how to deliver the service . 3. Potential settings in primary care to carry out the service . 4. Potential resources . 5. Potential barriers. 6. Attitudes of GPs on their preparedness to offer the servic e. The first step was the data familiarisation. T he transcripts were read two to three times to get familiarised with the information . During this process, focus group data was collated and assigned to themes; this is demonstrated in Appendix 5.1 and Appendix 5.2. These themes which derived were guided by the initial framework . Guided by the themes in the framework, chunks of data that have meaningful descriptions were highlighted. Follo wing this, the data was organised and mapped to the themes in the framework. These were adjusted accordingly when goin g through the transcripts again. I re-examined to ensure the clarity of the original data reflects the themes. Adjustment was made accordi ngly if needed. For the purpose of this chapter to describe the development of the questionnaire, the results of focus group data in accordance with the objectives of this questionnaire survey are presented . Relevant findings from the focus gr oups of primary care providers were incorporated with the findings from the six focus groups of women. Further, w ith regards to analysis, all themes were able to be retrieved from focus group except, the a ttitudes of GPs on their preparedness to offer the servic e. This is because there was insufficient focus group data that address ed or discussed on preparedness of the GPs. The following section presents the results of focus groups; first is the characteristics of the participants, and secondly is the thematic analysis. 103 5.4.2.5. Results of focus groups Characteristics of the participants Focus group of primary care provider s There were six primary care provider s involved in this focus group. There were three GPs, with aged ranged between 40 to 50 years old. Two of them were practicing in rural, Chesterfield and North West Derbyshire while one GP was practicing in Derby City. The remaining participants involved were a midwife and two health visitors, aged ranged between 30 to 50 years old and all were working in North West Derbyshi re practice. Focus group of women There were six focus groups of women with a total of 26 involved in the analysis. The women were from a mixture of different ethnic background for example; Indians, Pakistani, Af rican and European Whites. Age of the participants ranged between 18 to 45 years old with majority already had children. One participant was pregnant and seven have not conceived at the time of the interview. Six participants reported graduate degrees, thi rteen had vocational qualifications or advanced education, and five had secondary education. The remaining reported elementary education. The focus groups were conducted at community or public centres and general practice. The summary of the participants i s shown in Table 5.2 . 104 Table 5.2 : Summary of participants Focus group (FG) Characteristics of Participants Location Age Parity Ethnicity Education level FG1 College canteen, Nottingham 5 participants 26-45 years 3 women have 2 children . 2 women have 3 children. 5 Sikh 1 Degree 2 NVQ/equivalent 2 GCSE/equivalent FG2 General practice, Derby Lane 6 participants 26-35 years 1 woman was pregnant . 4 women have no children . 4 Pakistani 1 Indian 1 Degree 3 NVQ/equivalent 1 GCSE FG3 Nottingham Women's Community Centre 3 participants 18-35 years 2 women have 1 child . 1 woman has 2 children . 2 European White 1 African Elementary FG4 General practice, New Mills 4 participants 17-35 years 3 women have 1 child . 1 woman has 2 children . 4 European White 1 Degree 2 NVQ/equivalent 1GCSE FG5 General practice, New Mills 5 participants 18-35 years 1 woman has 1 child. 4 women have 2 children . 5 European White 1 Degree 4NVQ/equivalent FG6 Sherwood Community Centre 4 participants 18-45 years 1 woman has 2 children . 3 women have no children . 4 Pakistani 2 Degree 2 NVQ/equivalent *GCSE: General Certificate of Secondary Education *NVQ: National Vocational Qualifications 105 Thematic a nalysis Theme 1 Experiences of preconception practices During the focus group with the primary care provider s, the participants stated that preconception advice in general, was being offered opportunistically. One GP expressed that it was uncommon to offer routinely unless requested specifically for preconception advice by patients. In addition, family planning clinic was mentioned as the setting where he had offered preconception care. With regards to preconception genetic assessment and advice , one GP stated that they took the oppo rtunity when seeing patient in the high risk group. The midwife experienced that women who had a family history of genetic conditions would have been informed through genetic counselling or told by their family members. In the focus group of women, one pa rticipant mentioned that the GPs' consultations were usually guided by the patients' requests. She had expressed that she would prefer the GPs to have a proactive role rather just providing preconception advice and care only when requested by patients. GP 2, Chesterfield \"I don't think that it is something that we advertise but we will see anyone...\" \"....things that is badged as preconception, I often used to do in family planning, if they were an ethnic minority you would do the haemoglobin screening....\" \"...... I can think of two in the last couple of years who specifically made an appointment and consulted me about that......\" 106 Midwife, North West Derbyshire \"Ones that have got issues and the genetic problems in the family, they could have had genetic counse lling or famili es pass on that information\" Woman (focus group 4), white, Derbyshire \"I don't think they should wait either to be approached by someone for it, it should automatically be offered. Because sometimes you'll go into a GP for information and you don't get it unless you ask for it, it's not always there at hand...\" Theme 2 Potential approaches , settings and resources to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in practice All the p rimary care providers recognised the importance of offering preconception genetic risk assessment in the practice. Women also acknowledged that knowing genetic risk before conceive would help in deciding options for having future children. One GP mentioned that preconception assessment of genetic risk could be offered during family planning visits or rather opportunistically, when consulting with women enquiring about matters related to pregnancy or reproduction. Similarly, the women also express ed their opinion that preconception assessment and advice could be offered in general practice particularly during visits for contraception and family planning clinics. The women acknowledged that this has an advantage to capture women in the younger age g roup. 107 One woman suggested sending out information sheet routinely when women reach certain age; which in this case, at reproductive age. GP 2, Chesterfield things that is badged as preconception, I often used to do in family planning....\" Woman (focus g roup 4), White, Derbyshire \"I think approaching GPs and family planning clinics and maybe hospitals where people are having, you know, are wanting children and are having to go for testing or whatever, I think doing it that way might work\" Woman (focus g roup 5), White, Derbyshire \"You could do when you're going for contraception, that's good, actually, that would be a good way of ... \" Woman (focus group 3), African, Nottingham \"...as a routine procedure to send information sheet at certain age group...\" Theme 3 Barriers to developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk In the context of preconception advice in general, the GPs agreed that it is regarded as a rare encounter and believed that women are not forthcoming to discuss about preconception issues, thus, only few coming to seek advice before conceive. GP 1, Northwest Derbyshire \" ..... I don't think I remember many people coming and asking me for advice before trying to get pregnant.....\" 108 GP 2, Chesterfield \" ..... Perhaps they don't want to be so public about it as to discuss it with a professional, before embarking on trying to ge t pregnant....\" Further barriers mentioned by the participants were potential negative implications generated by genetic risk assessment. This includes psychosocial harm, stigmatisation and relationship issues. One of the GPs was concerned about his rappo rt with his patients if starting to discuss about hereditary conditions. One participant in the women focus group actually was worried with potential stigmatisation and stress in family relationships. GP 2, Chesterfield \"...... nobody wants to think that som ething bad might happen to them.....\" \"..... I would be worried about my relationship with those people in the future if I started talking a lot about congenital abnormalities, hereditary diseases. Well, we're already married. We are going to try for a baby a nyway.....\" GP 3, Derby City \"....if you provide this as a universal approach used for everyone, there is going to be some background harm that could happen if you tap some anxiety that was underneath the surface....\" Woman (focus group 4), white, Derbyshire \"It just causes so m any problems, though, you know...\" \"...like, if you think, if you've been in a long term relationship with someone and you think, right, let's plan to have a child but, you know, if you go and test and see if someone's a carrier, either you or your partner's a carrier of something and you have a child 109 and then that child's got whatever you carried, then it's going to be, you know, a blame game, well it's your fault, you carried it, you know, you carried that faulty gene so it's your fault that he turned out like that, so I don't think I would, I think I'd leave it so that we couldn't blame\" There was some resistance to adding preconception ca re in the current primary care system. One GP mentioned that it is possibly going to add to their existing workload and there should be a balance among ot her health areas. GP 1, Northwest Derbyshire \"Do we need to be doing this as a national thing? \" \"...Which I guess is where you are heading with this. I can see how that would work but I think in terms of what you were saying about what happens next - if you raise the expectation, there has got to be a way to meet the expectation without too much sacrific e to other health areas that are currently there\". The following section describes the process of generating questionnaire items from literature review and focus group data. 110 5.5 Generation of questionnaire items from incorporation of literature review a nd focus group qualitative data This stage involved incorporating the themes and information from the literatures and focus group data to inform the contents of each questionnaire item. Referring to the themes as below which were described earlier, questionnaire items were derived: 1. GPs' current experiences . 2. Approac h on how to deliver the service 3. Potential setting in primary care 4. Potential resources 5. Potential barriers 6. Attitudes of GPs on their preparedness The following section below describes the themes and the questionnaire items generated for each theme. Segments or aspects from the literatures reviewed and focus groups data in relation to the appropriate themes are presented. Variables in questionnaire i tems that derived from the literatures and focus group were indicated in bold. The rationale for deciding on the variables is described. Theme 1: GPs' current experiences . Here, the GPs were asked about their experi ences of assessing reproductive genetic risk before conception. Two important aspects of assessment that were asked are discussing family history and discussing genetic carrier testing with women of childbearing age group. In addition, in this domain, GPs were ask ed about their practices within the last three months to indicate their recent experiences. Rationale : This information would help identify potential settings or situations that the GPs are likely to offer preconception assessment of 111 reproductive genetic risk with women of childbearing age before they conceive. Table 5.3 : GPs' current experiences THEME 1 EXPERIENCES (in the last three months) a. Discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk b. Discussing preconception advice about genetic carrier testing Literature Review Focus Group Questionnaire Items Morgan 2004 Respondents described \" took family genetic history routinely when taking full medical history \" and \"took family genetic history routinely if the woman is planning pregnancy \" Heyes 2004 Respondents reported \"have provided preconception care opportunistically in routine clinic, family planning and well women clinics\". General Practitioner 2, Chesterfield \"....things that is badged as preconcepti on, I often used to do in family planning , if they were an ethnic minority you would do the haemoglobin screening ....\" Discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk 1.

I have discussed this to women planning a pregnancy 3. I have discussed this during visit for contraception 4. I have discussed this during visit for family planning 5. I have discussed to this women with known family history of genetic conditions 6. I have discuss ed this with women of certain ethnicity background (e.g. African, Asian, European Both studies Morgan (2004) and Heyes (2004) described respondents have experienced providing either preconception genetic assessment or preconception care in general, in routine clinic, either when taking full medical history or when the women were planning to conceive. Further, the focus group of primary care professionals revealed had experienced 112 discussing preconception genetic screening in family planning clinics and when encountered an ethnic minority patients. Theme 2 : Potential approaches Rationale : Before preconception reproductive genetic risk assessment is to be developed formally in primary care practice, it is essential that we consider an appropriate and reasonable approach to carry out the assessment. Two important aspect s of assessment that w ere asked are approaches to obtain family history and to offer genetic carrier testing with women of childbearing age grou p in the primary care practice. Table 5.4 : Potential approaches THEME 2 APPROACHES a. To obtain family history of reproductive genetic risk b. To offer genetic carrier testing Literature Review Focus Group Questionnaire Items Boulton 1996) explored the general practitioners' views on potential approach to offer carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and reported that majority agreed of offering screening when the individuals seek family planning advice Acheson 2000 This study reported tha t family history was discussed by during patients' first visits at a primary care clinic. Woman (focus group 5), White, Derbyshire \"You could do when you're going for contraception , that's good, actually, that would be a good way of ...\" Woman (focus grou p 4), White, Derbyshire \"I think approaching GPs and family planning clinics and maybe hospitals where people are having, you know, are wanting children and are having to go for testing or whatever, I think doing it that way might work\" To obtain family history of reproductive genetic risk 1. From all women of childbearing at registration by means of self-completed family history questionnaire 2. From women enquiring about preconception advice 3. From women enquiring family planning advice To offer genetic carrier testing 1. To offer all women of childbearing at registration 2. From women enquiring about preconception advice 3. From women enquiring family planning advice The focus groups suggested offering preconception assessment when women come for family planning advice such as contraception and 113 women wanting to conceive. The study by Acheson mentioned family history was discussed at patients ' first visits. At this point, t he statement \"by means of self -completed family history questionnaire\" was added in the item as self -completed family history screening questionnaires potentially could help identify those patients at risk to allow a more detailed assessment and counsellin g when consulting the general practitioner. Theme 3 : Potential settings Rationale: It is important to elicit primary care providers' and the women's views regarding the settings in the practice appropriate to provide preconception reproductive genetic risk assessment Table 5.5 : Potential settings THEME 3 SETTINGS Literature Review Focus Group Questionnaire Items Heyes 2004 Respondents reported \"have provided opportunistically in routine clinic, also in more focussed settings such as dedicated preconception clinics, family planning and well women clinics\". Woman (focus group 4), White, Derbyshire \"I think approaching general practitioners and family planning clinics and maybe hospitals where people are having, you know, are wanting children and are having to go for testing or whatever, I think doing it that way might work\" Potential setting appropriate to provide preconception assessment of genetic risk 1. A dedicated clinic 2. Well woman clinic 3. Family planning clinic 4. During routine consultation Family planning clinic was mentioned in both literature and focus group. Other settings ment ioned w ere dedicated preconception clinic, well women and in routine clinic. 114 Theme 4: Potential resources Rationale: It is imp ortant to elicit potential resources that could improve the delivery of preconception reproductive genetic assessment in primary care. This will help to inform future strategies to implement preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. Table 5.6 : Potential resources THEME 4 RESOURCES Literature Review Focus Group Questionnaire Items Mennie 1998 This study assessed potential support that the general practitioners would need to offer cystic fibrosis screening in the general practice, most indicated that information giving support before and after testing would be necessary and others were administr ative and training support. Heyes 2004 The respondents stated that they would appreciate refresher courses and suggested evidence -based guidelines to assist them in their practice. Woman (focus group 3), African, Nottingham \"...As a 'routine' procedure to send information sheet at certain age group...\" \"You can actually go and pick up a leaflet beforehand or say when you are a certain age they would just send it out to you as standard or something, I don't know. I know it would cost a bit but you know... I was thinking a lot of the information that would serve.... I mean I did -- I read it. I like to know these things. I read it all pretty much straight away. and I was thinking -- I wish I'd known about that before, I wish I'd known about that...\" Woman (f ocus group 4), White, Derbyshire \"I think they should just make it a leaflet, you know, like when you go into your GP , there's a wall of leaflets and there should be something that you can pick up of it, it would make it easier because you might not want the world to know that you're planning a pregnancy, but just to slip by and pull out a leaflet, nobody needs to know. \" Potential resources that will improve the delivery of preconception assessment genetic risk in your practice. 1. Appropriate training for the general practitioners 2. National guidelines for general practitioners 3. Information leaflets on preconception genetic risk assessment given at registration to all women of childbearing age 115 Both the literatures and focus groups indicated that informat ion giving supports are needed such as information leaflets. Other resources needed were training support and practice guidelines. Theme 5: Potential barriers Rationale : It is important to identify potential barriers to offering or providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the general practice. The rationale is t o elicit factors that c ould impede the delivery of preconception assessment of reprodu ctive genetic risk if it is introduced formally in the general practice. This information would help to identify difficulties which would help to consider range of approaches to overcome the barriers of the delivery of preconception reproductive genetic ri sk assessment in primary care in future. 116 Table 5.7 : Potential barriers THEME 5 POTENTIAL BARRIERS Literature Review Focus Group Questionnaire Items Mennie 1998 In this study, a small proportion of respondents believed that screening for carrier will do more harm than good Heyes 2004 Barrier reported in this study were difficulties to capture women planning to conceive, lack of resources (e.g. money) and lack of training . General Practitioner 1, Northwest Derbyshire \"..... I don't think I remember many people coming and asking me for advice before trying to get pregnant.....\" \"Do we need to be doing this as a national thing? Which I guess is where you are heading with this. I can see how that would work but I think in terms of what you were saying about what happens next - if you raise the expectation, there has got to be a way to meet the expectation without too much sacrifice to other health areas that are curren tly there \" General Practitioner 2, Chesterfield \"..... I would be worried about my relationship with those people in the future if I started talking a lot about congenital abnormalities, hereditary diseases. Well, we're already married. We are going to tr y for a baby anyway.....\" Woman (focus group 4), White, Derbyshire \"...if you go and test and see if someone's a carrier...whatever you carried...it's going to be a blame game ... \" Potential barriers for developing preconception genetic risk assessment in your practice. 1. Very few women coming for advice before trying to conceive 2. It is difficult to capture the target group 3. I am worried about ethical implication of preconception genetic risk assessment eg. stigmatisation of carriers 4. I am concerned that discussing hereditary diseases to couples who are trying for a baby will cause more harm (e.g. affect doctor -patient relationship , emotional disturbances to couples) 5. I do not have adequate training to provide preconception reproductive genetic assessment 6. Setting up a service will require substantial time and work Barrie rs in carrier screening and prov iding preconception care described in both Morgan (2004) and Heyes (2004) studies were : more harm; difficult to cap ture women planning to conceive; lack of resources and lack of training. With regards to focus groups, the GPs expressed that they had not encountered that many women seeking for 117 preconception advice whereas the women expressed concerns over relationships and stigmatisation. Theme 6: GPs' Preparedness In 2009, the National Screening Committee of United Kingdom (NSC) has commission ed the Human Genetics Commission to explore the need for preconception genetics screening . As a result, the Human Genetics Commission recommended that precon ception genetic screening should be in the framework of screening programmes in primary care ( Human Genetics Commission 2011). Hence, it was importa nt to explore primary care providers' perception of their role and in this context, the GPs. GPs' preparedness towards this recommendation is important to help motivate the introduction and deliver the practice of assessing genetic risk in primary care . Rationale : Theme 6 was added as it was necessary to increase the scope of the questionn aire to eli cit how prepared are the GP s to offer and counsel about preconception reproductive genetic risk assessment before incorporating into their practice. This information would help to give an idea the component of genetic consultation that the GPs are more con fident dealing with, together finding the gaps that could limit them from offering. This is also important to inform the strategy of a formal preconception assessment in the primary care practice. The questionnaire items were mainly informed by studies in the literature review. 118 Table 5.8 : GPs' Preparedness THEME 6 PREPAREDNESS Literature Review Questionnaire Items Mennie 1998 Respondents reported they were prepared to carry out pre-test counselling and disclosure of results in their primary care practice; and also, to undertake counselling of positive results. Suchard 1999 Respondents were reported that they felt sufficiently prepared to take family histories and draw pedigrees, to counsel about the genetic test results and if given the necessary training and information, they were willing to take family histories and to counsel about the results respectively Poppelaars 2004 Respondents reported they were willing to offer preconception cystic fibrosis screening, routinely to couples planning pregnancy. Morgan 2004 Respondents reported that they were willing to offer screening only in specific situations such as, when is requested by the patients, positive family inheritance of genetic conditions, if the partners are known carriers or has cystic fibrosis and patients or her partners are in high risk ethnic group . Mc Cahon 2009 The respondents were willing to take family history routinely and some reported they were willing to take family history if given necessary training . Your preparedness to offer preconception assessment of genetic risk in your practice. 1. I am prepared to take family history of genetic conditions from all women of childbearing age routinely when taking medical history 2. I am prepared to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women of childbearing age 3. If appropriate to the consultation, I am prepared to offer genetic carrier testing to women of childbearing age 4. Given the necessary training and information, I am prepared to counsel about genetic carrier testing results Besides the questionnaire items, the demog raphic items were also devised. 119 5.6 Demographic items Demographic items were included in the questionnaire as this helped in describing the participants' characteristics. The variables included in the demographic section were age, gender, years of experience, description of practice, practice lis t size and whether practice has a preconception care protocol. Th ese variables were based from literature review for examples: age, years of experiences, practice list size and whether have local guidelines on genetic assessment; these variables were t ested for predictors of general practitioners' attitudes of preparedn ess et al., 2004d , McCahon et al., 2009 ). The following section describes the designing of the format of questio nnaire. 5.7 Deciding the questionnaire format In general the questionnaire comprised of three main components. The first component is the introduction, secondly is the actual questionnaire items and the third component is the demographic items. Please refer to Appendix 5.3 for full description of the questionnaire. Component 1: Introduction The introduction is on the first page of the questionnaire aimed to highlight the purpose and the import ance of carrying out the survey . This component also described the instructions on how to reply to the questions and approximate time to complete the questionnaire. Component 2: Actual questionnaire items The questionn aire items components are divided into four main parts. Every part has headings which gives brief ex planation on how to address t he following questionnaire items . The four main headings are : 1. Participants' experiences of discussing preconception assessment on reproductive genetic risk. This includes 120 discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk a nd genetic carrier testing. 2. Participants' opinions on potential barriers to developing preconception reproductive genetic risk assessment in current practice. 3. Participants' opinions on potential approaches to deliver and resources required to improve on t he delivery of preconception reproductive genetic risk assessment in current practice. 4. Participants' attitudes on preparedness to providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in current practice. All the questionnaire items were closed -response type. This format of closed -response type was preferred due to two factors; the time taken for the participants to complete the questionnaire will be less as compared to responding to open -ended question (Polgar and Thomas, 2000 , Buckingham and Saunders, 2004 ) and responses could be easily coded and analysed (Polgar and Thomas, 2000 ). The response format for each item was a 5 -point scale of agreement ranging from 'strongly agree' on one end to 'strongly disagree' on the other with 'don't know' in the middle. Each level on the scale was assigned a numeric value starting at 1 and incremented by one for each level. This format is useful to determine the responses' opinions and attitudes (Bourque and Fielder, 1995 , Buckingham and Saunders, 2004 ). Further, free text response was included in this questionnaire to give opportunities to the participants to express their opinions or suggestions on preconception assessment of genetic risk . This allowed gathering important information or helped identifying new issues which was not covered in the questionnaire items. Component 3: Demographic items The demographic items component consisted of a categorical format for categorical variables a nd free spaces for continuous variables. 121 Appreciation statement and the researcher's contact detail concluded the questionnaire. The following section described the layout of the questionnaire. 5.8 Deciding the questionnaire layout Careful attention was given to the details of the layout, for example; question ordering, spacing, and font size. This was to ensure that the questionnaire was easy to read, understand and to complete. This was crucial to maintain the respondents' compliance and interest (Lydeard, 1991 ). Generally, the questionnaire items of the same topic were grouped together for each four parts. This is to ensure that questionnaire items were listed in a logical manner. Further, later responses to questionnaire items were checked not to be biased by ear lier questions. The main headings were in capital letters, bolded and font size 14. Brief explanations following each heading were bolded and font size 12. The questionnaire items were typed in font size 12 and not bolded. This is to distinguish the headin gs and explanations from the questions itself. All the questionnaire and demographic items were numbered. The 5 -point scales were arranged horizontally for every question. With regards to the wordings, words with double meaning, double negatives and jargon s were avoided. The whole questionnaire was an 8 -page questionnaire and every page was numbered. The number of pages was limited to emphasize that it could be completed within a short time. This was important as to avoid sense of disinterest the first inst ance of receiving the questionnaire. At this juncture, the draft questionnaire was ready for assessment of validity. 122 5.9 Assessing the validity of the questionnaire It is essential to establish accuracy and applicability to relevant target participants when developing new questionnaire (Polgar and Thomas, 2000 , Lydeard, 1991 ). For this questionnaire , assessment of face and content validity was undertaken. Face validity refers to whether the study instrument, which in this case, the questionnaire, represents the proposed concept or theme the questionnai re intended to measure (Litwin, 1995 ). Content validity is the extent to which the items of the study instrument adequately cover areas of importance and interest with no irrelevant content (Litwin, 1995 ). In the initial step, the draft questionnaire was sent to two academic personnel and experts in primary care genetics from the University of Nottingham. Both were also practicing GPs. In addition, the questionnaire was also sent to a GP who was a research fellow at the University of Oxford. The experts were consulted to address and comment on the validity of every questionnaire items and to assess the clarity of the wordings of the questionnaire items. Where required, new questionnaire items were added as suggested by the experts. The GP from the University of Oxford emailed her responses while face to face discussion with the experts from the University of Nottingham was made to review the questionnaire. Following discussion with the experts, the questionnaire items were revised or added appropriately. 5.10 Revision of draft after experts' review Following experts' review and feedback, r evision was advised for the following. The table below ( Table 5.9 ) summa rized the revision described. 1. Practice patterns: The questionnaire item, \"I have discussed this during visit for contraception\" and \"I have discussed this during visit for family planning\" was considered confusing. To avoid 123 confusion, it was decided to p ut \"I have discussed this during visit for contraception\" and to omit the other as this term was more focused. 2. Potential approaches: The expert recommended adding the questionnaire item \"Women enquiring about menstrual problems\" in the part. This was to add to options for opportunistic consultation to women in childbearing age group with regards to preconception assessment. 3. Potential resources: In the questionnaire item \"National guideline for GPs\" the expert recommended to add example, in the case, NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline was suggested. 124 Table 5.9 : Revision of draft after experts' review Theme Questionnaire Items Draft 1 (before experts' review) Draft 2 (after experts' review) Experiences 1. I have discussed this during routine consultation 2. I have discussed this to women planning a pregnancy 3. I have discussed this during visit for contraception 4.

National guidelines for gene ral practitioners eg. NICE 3. Information leaflets on preconception genetic risk assessment given at registration to all women of childbearing age 125 Next, the second draft of the questionnaire was piloted with a group of seven GPs who were practicing in the United Kingdom. The questionnaire had to be mailed to two GPs and written comment was obtained. The other five completed the questionnaire individually, in my presence, and the questionnaire was reviewed for content and comprehension of every questionn aire items, as well as presentation of the questionnaire items taking into consideration its readability and format. The time to complete the questionnaire was also assessed. Following suggestions by the GPs, o nly minor amendment to the layout was made to improve on the presentation between the headings and the brief explanation. The layout was revised to ; the main headings in capital l etters, bolded and font size 12; and the questionnaire items were typed in font size 12 and not bolded . There was n o addition al suggestion or amendment to questionnaire item s at this stage. 5.11 Strengths and limitations of research methods used Relevant i nformation and questionnaire items gathered from the literature review and focus group enhances the comprehension of the questionnaire being developed. The focus group data was considered appropriate to generate questionnaire items. It provides opportunity to get wider opinion from different groups of people. Nonetheless, the richness of the data could be improved if the following actions are taken. Firstly, taking the role as the main moderator would help me to be involve d actively in the focus group discussion. I could take control of the discussion and tailored to the objectives of my study . Focus group provides a wealth of information, but it could be improved if one to one interview is carried out on issues around reproductive genetic conditions . There are possi bilities that the presence of others in the 126 focus group may make it difficult to disclose information of a personal experience involving et hical, legal and social aspects related to genetic conditions. Secondly , there was only one group of primary care providers involved where only three GPs participated. The reason for only three GPs was attributed to poor response to participate. Although, they provide a breadth of information, the quality of the data could be i mproved if there was more than one focus group of GPs which preferably more diverse in demographic , considering that the study population for the survey is GPs. It would also be helpful to get the views of other primary care providers such as the health vi sitors and mid wives who may be involved in women's health and this focus group could be conducted separately. It could be argued that discussion can be dominated by the GPs if not carried out separately, whereby, this was observed during this study. In the analysis of focus group, it is noted that most coded data is identified as GP participant. This was because the discussion was mainly domi nated by the GPs. Nevertheless, the aim of focus group was to inform questionnaire survey of GPs, thus findings most of the data extracted from focus group originated from GPs is an advantage . With regards to focus group of women, there was considerable number of groups. The ethnicity in eac h group was more or less homogenous. This has allowed the discussion on explorin g the opinions and problems about reproductive genetic conditions faced by specific ethnic group without causing any harm or stigmatization . The groups appeared heterogeneous especially in age, parity and education level and this has provided better understanding of the issues across the diverse in the participants. However, i ssues on genetics can be personal, some of the participants may not disclose their real feelings towards the topic, or they refuse to share their experience either because they f elt hindered by other participants who have higher education level or by older participants. This was observed during the focus group. However, on the other hand, it could be argued that every group was more or less 127 homogenous in ethnicity; it did not port ray or provide much perspective on ethnicity sensitivity. 5.12 Conclusion This chapter gives an account of the systematic process in deve loping the questionnaire. It was important to ensure that the contents of the questionnaire addressed the objectives of th is study. The following chapter will discuss the methodology; recruitment and data collection, carried out for the questionnaire survey study. 128 CHAPTER 6 METHODS IN QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY 6.1 Introduction The objective of Chapter 6 is to describe the met hods used in the questionnaire survey . This includes identifying participants, data collection, improving participan ts' response rate and methods to analyse the data. 6.2 The sampling frame and study population This survey was carried out within the National Health Service (NHS) of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, United Kingdom. The sampling frame was drawn from databases of general practices within the Primary Care Trusts of Nottinghamshire County, Nottingham City, Derbyshire County and Derby City. The most updated list was retrieved in July 2012 from the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre website. The four PCTs were chosen as sampling frame because of easy accessibility. These PCTs were already involved in the CLAHRC -NDL-ABC study. The study population are the GPs working in general practices within the Primary Care Trusts of Nottinghamshire County, Nottingham City, Derbyshire County and Derby City. 129 6.3 Ethical consideration Approval to carry out this study was sought form three main bodies; 1. Research Governance of the University of Nottingham 2. National Health Service (NHS) Research and Development (R&D) department 3. Medical School Ethics Committee of the University Of Nottingham The proposal of the study was initially entered into The Integrated Research Application System (IRAS), a single online system for applying fo r permissions and approvals for health and social c are or community research in the United Kingdom. The approval bodies were contacted approximately at the time of completing the IRAS to seek for advice on how to proceed. I was informed by the NHS Research and Development (R&D) department that the study do es not require Research Ethics Committee review as it was a survey and not involving patients . The protocol was reviewed by the Research Governance and the Medical School Ethics Committee of the University of Nottingham. First, the research protocol and relevant documents such as cover letter, participant information sheet and reminder letter as well as the draft questionnaire were submitted to the Research Governance of the University of Nottingham . All of the documents were reviewed thoroughly and underwent three amendments before the study could be approved. Further, the approved protocol was reviewed by the NHS Research and Development (R&D) department and Medical School Ethics Committee of the Unive rsity Of Nottingham. Only one revision was made to the questionnaire following recommendations by the Ethics Committee. The whole process took approximately eight months before approval to commence the study. 130 6.4 Methods 6.4.1 Study design The study design was a cross -sectional survey using self -administered postal questionnaire . Cross -sectional surveys have been used for descriptive studies primarily aim to \"gather reliable and unbiased data from a representative of respondents\" (McColl et al., 2001 ). Surveys intend to \"explore aspects of situation, seek explanation and provide data for testing hypotheses from selection of a sample of people from a pre - determined population or population of interest, fol lowed by collection of information from those individuals and making quantitative inferences in relation to the population of interest\" (McColl et al., 2001 , Kelley et al., 2003 ). They are preferred to collect quantitative information on peoples' knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions (Fink, 2002 ). Also, surveys have been described as \"real life snapshots of the population\" where data was gathered (Kelley et al., 2003 ). In the context of this study, the survey aims to capture information or data on the opinions and attitudes of the GPs towards preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Further, it also allows testing of hypothesis that the GPs, who are the population of interest; were prepared to offering preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care practices. Although postal questionnaires are widely used to collect data in health research, there was a general consensus that postal questionnaires of GPs may have low response rates (McColl et al., 2001 , Kelley et al., 2003 , Thorpe et al., 2009 ) and it was reported a significant problem in the United Kingdom (Sibbald et al., 1994 ). Thus, improving response rate was important to ensure the quality of the data collected. The following section describes the methods to structure and disseminate 131 the questionnaire survey incorporating strategies to enhance responses from the target population. 6.4.2 Questionnaire survey composition The questionnaire survey package was composed of: 1. Cover letter 2. Participant Information Sheet 3. Questionnaire 4. Returned -stamped self -addressed envelope 6.4.2.1. Cover letter A cover letter is a formal introductory letter accompanying a document. The cover letter accompanying the questionnaire should explain the purpose of the study and emphasised the importance of a response from the targeted individuals as well as providing a n assurance of confidentiality and expressing gratitude to the participants for their assistance (Dillman, 1978 , Buckingham and Saunders, 2004 ). A number of studies have explored specific characteristics of a cover letter that could enhance response rates as well as credibility of the questionnaire. To achieve success of the survey, the objective of the study and the reason why responses are import ant should be stated (McColl et al., 2001 , Turocy, 2002 ). The cover letter should also provide an estimate time required to complete to encourage participation (McColl et al., 2001 , Turocy, 2002 ). To enhance credib ility and further enhance participation, the cover letter should be printed on departmental -letterhead (Burns et al., 2008 ) with the researchers' signature (Edwards et al., 2002 ). The response to survey increased when each cover letter was signed (Edwards et al., 2002 ). In addition, Paxson (19 95) also stated that a reasonably high response rate may be 132 achieved when the name of the researcher is used on the correspondence (Paxson et al., 1995 ). For this study, the cover letter (Appendix 6. 1) was designed as outli ned stating the following : 1. Objectives of the study 2. Reason why the participants' responses are important in the study 3. Emphasis on confidentiality of the participants 4. Estimate d time required to complete the questionnaire 5. Researcher's contact details 6. Thanking the participants for completing the questionnaire and stating that incentive will be given at the end of cover letter The objectives and the reason for participation was clearly stated in the cover letter to emphasize that the GPs participation was important to the achieve success of the survey. In addition, the cover letter provided an estimate time required to complete as well mentioned incentive to be given to the first 100 respondents, to encourage participation. The cover letters was signed by the academic advisor who is also a GP (Nadeem Qureshi) and me as researcher. The cover letters were print ed on University letterhead . 6.4.2.2. Participant Information Sheet Sudman (1983) suggested that in surveys involving professionals, a cove r letter could be accompanied by more extensive supporting document to provide more detailed information about the study (Sudman, 1983 ). Participant information sheet was used in addition to cover letter to provide more detail on the objectives of the study, to emphasise the importance of obtaining responses from the general practitioners and contact details of the researchers in case, th e participants needed further information and clarification with regards to the questionnaire ( Appendix 6.2) 133 6.4.2.3. Questionnaire Besides the format (Chapter 5), to further improve the presentation of the questionnaire, several important steps were adopted to en courage responses. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of colour and brightness in the visual presentation of questionnaires (Edwards et al., 2002 , Burns et al., 2008 ).The questionnaires for this study were printed on A4 -sized coloured paper (green) to enhance visual appeal. It was an 8 -page; printed on both sides and stapled together to facilitate use and completion (Burns et al., 2008 ). 6.4.2.4. Return -stamped self -addressed envelope The use of return -stamped self -addressed envelope has been demonstrated to gain response rate (Edwards et al., 2002 ). For this, each participant was provided a return -stamped self -addressed envelope in which to return the completed questionnaire to the researcher. 6.4.2.5. Questionnaire survey package The cover letter, participant information sheet, return -stamped self - addressed envelope and the questionnaire were arranged in that order and fit in a 25\u00d735cm -sized envelope. This constituted the questionnaire survey package. 6.4.2.6. Other measures to enhance responses Incentives Edwards (2009 ) and. has reported that using incentives versus no incentives has shown to have positive impact on response rates . There was a significant increase in response rate when using monetary 134 incentive (Edwards et al., 2009 ). The incentive offered in this study was a \u00a35 voucher to the first 100 general practitioners who completed and returned the questionnaire, and this was stated in the cover letter and participant information sheet. The offering of incentives in this study was approved by the Medical School Ethics Committee of the University of Nottingham. Face -to-face invitation to participate In addition, I took the opportunity to attend tw o Protected Learning Time (PLT) events in December , 2012. These events were Continui ng Professional Development (CPD) learning activities that were held for general practices' staffs , including GPs in Nottingham. During these events, I introduced to the GPs about the concept of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk and fu rther invited them to participate in the questionnaire survey. Timing of disseminating the questionnaire In order to improve on participation, specific issues for example, the timing of the second mailing was chosen after the Christmas and New Year vacations to avoid clashing with the GPs' busy periods. 6.5 The decision to choose type of survey administration method The reason for choosing self-administered postal survey for this study was to gather information from a large group of GPs using most economical approach, importantly taking into consideration budget and time. In general, there are three types of administering questionnaire survey; self-administered via postal, interviewer -admi nistered via face -to-face or telephone and self -administered via internet. I will discuss the advantages and disadva ntages of each approach in the following 135 section. I will then summarise my reasons for choosing self- administered postal survey . Self-administered postal survey When conducting survey, one must function within the constraint of budget, time and experience. The decision to choose self-administered postal questionnaire for this study was due to several advantages (McColl et al., 2001 , Kelley et al., 2003 ): 1. This method has allowed coveri ng a wider geographic coverage; which is all the general practices in the PCTs of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. 2. Data can be collect ed within short periods of time. This is particular important as the duration of my PhD is limited. 3. It is relatively inexpensive when compared to other types of survey, such as face -to-face su rvey and easier to implement considering limited availability of research budget to conduct this study . 4. Postal q uestionnaire survey allowed GPs to complete the questionnaires at their own convenient time, thus, protected time for the questionnaire was not necessary. 5. There was little chance for personal bias as there was no contact between the researcher and the participants . Interviewer -administered questionnaire (face to face, telephone) Interviewer -administered questionnaire with physicians have been reported to have higher response rates; 65% to 80% as compared to postal questionnaire. This approach also enables data to be collected rapidly as well as minimise potential missing data (Shosteck and Fairweather, 1979 , Dillman, 2000 ). Hence, this improves the quality of data. Nevertheless, this approach has been associated with substantial time such as for travelling and cost incurred. 136 Even though i nterviewer -administered questionnaire has better response rates, s elf-administered questionnaire was still preferred as it is easier to implement . The time and cost needed to implemen t are relatively less (McColl et al., 2001 ). All the questionnaires can be sent within the same day and practically received by the participants within four to five days period. Furthermore, the cost of travelling to every general practices is negligible. The advantage to the participants is self-administered questionnaire can be completed at the their convenience without being bothered by the researcher; thus avoiding potential interviewer -bias (McColl et al., 2001 ). The participants' responses to the questionnaire are also not influenced by the researcher. Furthermore, the participants are free from any commitment for an a ppointment as interviewer -administered questionnaire uses a considerable length of time. Internet -based questionnaire Internet -based questionnaire was introduced as a survey technique in the late 1990s as an additional approach to data collection (Janssens et al., 2014 ). There is no doubt that this approach is gaining popularity nowadays especially when most GPs have access to internet. There are several advantages related to this approach. Firstly, inte rnet-based questionnaire allows automatic transfer of data into a database, and hence, eliminates the need for manual inputting and avoid potential error on data entry (van Gelder et al., 2010 ). As data entry is performed by the participants , this approach may offer potential cost saving for staff. Furthermore, it reduces cost of stationary and postage (Sinclair et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, creating survey on -line required specialized knowledge (Shannon and Bradshaw, 2002 ) and hence, poss ible more time as well as skills is required. There are methodological issues 137 reported with creating internet -based questionnaire for example; the designing and formatting an on -line questionnaire to simplify data collection and data entry (Janssens et al., 2014 ). There is also a variation in individual respondents' computer hardware and software, thus, one has to design accordingly and compatible with the participants ' computer program (Janssens et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, there may be a possibility of losing of data through a brief server failure (Shannon and Bradshaw, 2002 ) or problems in downloading the whole questionnaire (Janssens et al., 2014 ). With regards to response rate, internet -based questionnaire was reported to have a variable response rates ranging from 9% to 94% (Janssens et al., 2014 ). In fact, few studies involving questionnaire survey among physicians demonstrated more responses to postal questionnaire as compared to in ternet -based questionnaire (Kim et al., 2000 , Raziano et al., 2001 ). Although, internet -based questionnaire may offer advantages, indeed, there is a compromise in deciding between self -administered postal questionnaire and internet -based questionnaire. I had to balance the pros and cons before making a decision considering my time constraint and limited manpower. One of the factor s that has led to the decision of self-administered postal questionnaire and not internet -based, is because of the reason of ensuring that one GP to represent a practice. I may have difficulty to disseminate questionnaire via internet because any GP is elig ible to participate. If use internet -based, I might have to pre-select a particular GP to represent the practice. This may lead to selection bias. Adding to this, I was unaware of any available method that is confidential to process an internet -based quest ionna ire if send through a third person for example the practice manager before distri buting to a GP of that practice. 138 6.6 Selection of study population There were a total of 285 practices in the sampling frame. The entire general practices within the PCTs of Nottinghamshire County, Nottingham City, Derbyshire County and Derby City were retrieved from the National Health Service (N HS) Information Centre website and any duplicated names of the practices were checked and removed before carrying out the survey. In the UK, the implementation of preconception screening in the general practice could be incentivised by the Quality Outcome Framework (QOF). Because of this, it is crucial to ensure maximal response as possible from practices across th e counties for this survey study . Thus, it was agreed that at least one GP from every practice is needed to participate. This would potentially reduce response bias of GPs who may have special interest in the topic being studied. The questionnaires were sent to all 285 practices. Any one GP from every practice was invited to represent their practice . This would encourage voluntary involvement of any GPs in the practice to respond to the survey. Each practice received a single quest ionnaire survey package ensuring that the practices would have equal opportunity to participate . 6.7 Commencing the questionnaire survey The standard approach for data collection in postal surveys as described in the Dillman method was used as a guide. The Dillman method is often regarded as the standard for many postal surveys (Thorpe et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, it was reported that the method appeared to help obtain high survey response rate (Hoddinott and Bass, 1986 ). The Dillman method involves five components (Dillman, 2000 ): 139 1. Appropriate development of questionnaire 2. The use of four contacts by, with an additional 'special' contact (e.g. certified mail, telephone call) and recommended by first - class mail 3. The use of return envelopes with real first -class stamps 4. A personalized correspondence 5. A token of financial incentive that is sent with the survey request. With regards to the first, the development of questionnaire, thi s was already discussed earlier in Chapter 5. Although the Dillman method was used to enhance participation from GP there were however, few revisions to the method of disseminating the questionnaire following review from the Research Governance of the University of Nottingham as wel l as due to budget constraint. The use of four contacts in the mailings, which was proposed in the original protocol, was revised to three contacts following protocol review from Research Governance o f the University of Nottingham. Further, due to budget constraint, the use of first -class mail and return envelopes with real first -class stamps was revised to using second class mail. In addition, incentive was also decided to send only when participants returned completed questionnaire instead of se nding with the survey package . Follow -up is another essential component to that has positive influence on response rates (Dillman, 2000 , Edwards et al., 2009 ). It was reported that the best predictor of response in surveys of the public was the number of follow -up mailings (Barclay et al., 2002 ). In particular, postal questionnaire survey of general practitioners, reminders and follow -up m ailings have been reported to be effective (Barclay et al., 2002 ). In this study, follow -ups following the first mail -out took the form of letter reminders and second mailings with duplicate cover letter, participant information sheet and questionnaire with return -stamped 140 envelope; which will be mentioned in detail in the data collection section. 6.7.1 Data collection The data collection took place between October 2012 and February 2013. It involved: 1. Mailing out the first batch of questionnaire survey packages 2. Follow -up with letters of reminder to non -responders 3. Mailing out the second batch of questionnaire survey packages to non -responders following reminders The first batch of survey packages was sent to all the 285 practices in the four counties mentioned earlier. The questionnaire survey package was addressed to the general practice in the first batch of mailing. The return of completed questionnaires indicated the GPs' consent to participate which was stated clearly in the cover letter (Appendix 6 .1). To give the GPs adequate time to rep ly, reminder letters (Appendix 6.3) were sent approximately six weeks after the first mailing . The second mailing of the survey packages was sent in mid -January 2013. The timing of the second mailing was chosen after the Christmas and New Year vacations to avoid clashing with the GPs' busy periods. This was specifically chosen to improve on particip ation. In addition, before mailing out the second batch, telephone calls were made to the practices to encourage more responses (Dillman, 1978 ). Attempts to speak personally to the practice managers were made before the final mailing to notify about the questionnaire survey and emphasized on participation from the GPs. Practice managers are preferred as they are the prime person that organised the practices and they may be appropriate to disseminate the questionnaire to the GPs in the practice. Only 88 practice managers were able to be contacted. 141 For this batch, an additional c over letter addressed to the Practice Manag er was also attached (Appendix 6.4). The cover letter provided brief information about the study and requested assistance to hand o ver the questionnaire to any one GP in the practice. A photocopied \u00a35 voucher was also stapled to the cover letter. The aim was to attract the Practice Managers and hence, the GPs. A 'Thank You' card and a \u00a35 voucher were sent to the GPs who had participated in the survey. 6.8 Methods of ana lysis All data collected were entered in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 database and double checked by the researcher (NH) to avoid any errors. Before carrying out the analyses, the data were checked again. Statistical adv ice was sought before conducting the analyses to ensure the appropriateness of the statistical tests applied. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all categorical variables whilst contin uous variables were analysed for means and standard deviations (SD). Chi-squared test and independent t -test was used to assess whether differences existed between two variables for categorical and continuous data respectively . The following describes the methods of analysis with regards to each objective of the questionnaire survey. 142 Objective 1 : To explore GPs' experiences on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Each questionnaire item was initially explored independently. This involved straight description of the proportion of the each scale of agreement; however, to facilitate interpretation of results, 5 point were collapsed to 3 point scale; agree (from strongly agree and agree), don't know, and disagree (from disagree and s trongly disagree), resulting in 3 categorical variables. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all e nquired experiences of discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk and discussing preconception advice on genetic carrier testing in wo men of childbearing age. Further, Chi -squared tests were computed to assess whether differences existed between GPs' experiences and their preparedness to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in their practice. Objective 2 : To explore GPs' opinions on potential approach to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care Each questionnaire item was initially explored independently. This involved straight description of the proportio n of the each scale of agreement; however, to facilitate interpretation of results, 5 point were collapsed to 3 point scale; agree (from strongly agree and agree), don't know, and disagree (from disagree and strongly disagree), resulting in 3 categorical variables. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all inquired approach to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. 143 Objective 3 : To explore GPs' opinions on appropriate settings in primary care practice to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk Each questionnaire item was initially explored independently. This involved straight description of the proportion of the each scale of agreement; however, to facilitate interpretation of resu lts, 5 point were collapsed to 3 point scale; agree (from strongly agree and agree), don't know, and disagree (from disagree and strongly disagree), resulting in 3 categorical variables. Frequencies and perce ntages were calculated for all e nquired setting s in primary care practice to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Objective 4 : To identify potential resources needed to improve the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care Each questi onnaire item was initially explored independently. This involved straight description of the proportion of the each scale of agreement; however, to facilitate interpretation of results, 5 point were collapsed to 3 point scale; agree (from strongly agree an d agree), don't know, and disagree (from disagree and strongly disagree), resulting in 3 categorical variables. Frequencies and perce ntages were calculated for all e nquired resources needed to improve the delivery of preconception assessment of reproducti ve genetic risk in primary care practice. Objective 5 : To explore potential barriers to developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care Each questionnaire item was initially explored independently. This involved straight description of the proportion of the each scale of agreement; however, to facilitate interpretation of results, 5 -point were 144 collapsed to 3 -point scale; agree (from strongly agree and agree), don't know, and disagree (from disagree and strongly disagree), resulting in 3 categorical variables. Frequencies and perce ntages were calculated for all e nquired barriers to developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care practice. Objective 6 : To explore GPs' preparedness to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care These variables of preparedness were treated as the outcomes of interest. The 5 -point scales of agreement for preparedness were collapsed to 2 -point scale; and were recoded as prepared and less prepared. Here, 'Strongly agree' perce ntages were calculated for all enquired questionnaire it ems for preparedness to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care practice. For univariate analyses, chi-squared test and independent t -test was used for categorical a nd continuous data respectively to assess whether differences existed between every questionnaire items for preparedness and demographic variables. Chi-squared test was computed to assess differences between GPs' preparedness and their experiences on preconception assessment of reproductive geneti c risk. Binary logistic regression was used to study the association between GPs' responses to preparedness (offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk ) and demographic variables . Demographic variables are age, gender, number of years of experience as GP, practice list size and whether practice has a preconception protocol . 145 Guided by the literatures, the following variables; location of practice (urban/rural/inner -city), type of practice (group/solo) and availability of preconception care protocol that covered family history taking and genetic carrier testing are regarded as predictor variables (Poppelaars et.al., 2004c, McCahon et.al., 2009). A ge, gender, number of years of experience as GP and practice list size are regarded as confounding variables . In building the models, the p redictor variables were tested to determine association with GPs' preparedness. Results are presented as unadjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. These were then adjusted for age, gender, number of years of experience as GP and practice list size as confounders and presented as adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. For all univariate analysis and logistic regression the level of statis tical significance, p<0.05 was used as the criteria for statistical significance. Analysing free text -response type questions Free text -response type questions offer insights or issues not captured in the closed -response type. Here, the free text -response type w as put in two main themes related to facilitators and barriers. The analyses are presented descriptively in the results section. 6.9 Strength s and li mitation s Research and Development approval The review process for approval from Research and Development was relatively long, thus there was a time constraint in completing the PhD. During the process, t he original protocol to carry out the study was required to be revised to accommodate the recommendations made by the approval b odies. In the original protocol, it was proposed to carry out piloting the fieldwork or data collection to a group of GPs before the actual data collection as this was deemed neces sary in actual research methods. The reason was to anticipate problems of th e actual mailing, 146 so that this could be revised before carrying out the actual survey. However, contacting GPs n umerous times was considered coercive by the Research Governance and Research and Development department. Hence, piloting the fieldwork was not carried out. Adding to this, the mailing was also reduced to three contacts: first mail -out; reminder and second mail -out. Study population Inviting one GP to represent each practice within the PCTs in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire allows equal opportunity of every practice in to participate . More importantly, it is to ensure maximal responses of practices are achieved. As a result, this would have an impact if preconception assessme nt of genetic risk services is to be introduced at practice level. Further, if allowing any GP from the sampling frame would have a skewed result to specific PCT and the GP who responded may have an interest on the topic. However, i t could be argued that allowing only one GP to represent a practice may have a potential to limit generalisability of this study. Response rate Self-administered postal questionnaire survey was relatively easy to administer. Nevertheless, poor questionnaire response rate was a disadvantage. Several measures were planned such as; cover letters, providing return -stamped self -addressed envelope and incentives; at the outset to anticipate poor response, and were carried out to enhance participation from the GPs. The second batch of questionnaire survey package was add ressed to the prac tice managers of the non -responded practice s with a cover letter to the practice manager (Appendix 6.4) , along with other documents. Attempts to contact the practice managers personally were also made to improve participation. Methods of analysis The logistic regression model allows one to study on the association of the outcome variables to a set of possible predictor variables with the 147 adjustment of confounders. Hence, the use of logistic regression was applied as par t of the statistical analysis in this survey. However, if the study size is small as a result of poor response , this potentially has limited value; small study size would result in a wide confidence interval. 6.10 Conclusion A high response rate was important to ensure the success of the study; whether the results of the survey is reflect ive those of the target population (Burns et al., 2008 ). Several measures were planned and carried out to ensure participation from the GPs at the outset. This includes from meticulously developing the questionnaire to disseminating the questionnaire. There was however challenges faced during the process which resulted in suboptimal response. The following chapter presents the analyses and results of the questionnaire survey study. 148 CHAPTER 7 RESULTS OF SURVEY 7.1 Introduction This chapter present s the results of the questionnaire survey. The results are presented in four sections. In general, Section 1 present s the response rates and descriptive analysis. Cross tabulations were used to assess the association between location of practice areas and the availability of preconception protocol that covered family history or genetic carrier testing in the practice. Section 2 present s the association between the four outcomes of preparedness with the respondents' experiences of discussing family history and preconception adv ice on genetic carrier testing. The four outcomes of preparedness are; preparedness to take fam ily history of genetic conditions from all women of childbearing age group routinely, preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women, preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing if appropriate to the consultation and preparedness to couns el genetic carrier testing results if given training and information. Section 3 present s the association between preparedness of the participated GPs in offering and providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk across all demographic va riables. Logistic regression analysis, assessing the effects of the predictor variables on the four outcomes of preparedness in offering and providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk is presented. 149 The final Section 4 presents the analysis of free text responses. The following (Table 7 .1) is the summary of the survey results chapter . Table 7 .1 : Summary of the survey results chapter. Structure of the survey results chapter Section 1 Response rates. Descriptive analysis of demographic variables. Descriptive analysis of all variables in questionnaire items. Association between location of practice areas and the availability of preconception protocol that covered family history or genetic carrier testing.

Section 4 Analysis of free text responses 7.2 Results of survey Section 1 7.2.1 Response rate A total of 285 questionnaires were sent to 285 general practices. In total 95 (33.3%) general practitioners; who represented 95 practices responded to the survey and returned completed questionnaires. 150 Table 7.2 summarised the response rates. In the first batch of mail -out, 48 completed the questionnaires (16.8%). Following reminder letters to 237 of non -responders to the first mail -out, 10 (3.5%) returned completed questionnaire. Finally, additional 37 (13.0%) general practitioners returned completed questionnaires following the second batch of mail -out.

The proportion indicates the proportion of respondents from each Primary Care Trust. 151 7.2.2 Demographic characteristics of GPs and general practices Table 7.4 shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The mean age of GP was 45.7 (SD 8.9) years old; a higher proportion was female (57.4%). They had practised as GPs for a mean of 15.6 (SD 8.5) years. About 58% of the respondents described their pr actice as urban. 23.2% described their practice as inner city and 16.8% as rural. The mean practice list size was 8529.2 (SD 7439.2) Sixteen (17%) of the respondents reported having protocol on preconception care in their practice. Of the practices which have the protocol, ten practices has preconception care protocol covering family history of reproductive risk and only two practices covering genetic carrier testing. The practices were predominantly urban and inner city, five and three respectively, and t wo from rural practice. Six other practices have protocol on preconception care however did not cover either family history of reproductive risk or genetic carrier testing. 152 Table 7.4 : Demographics Characteristics Value (N=95)* N (%) Gender Male Female Missing 40 (42.1) 54 (56.8) 1 (1.1) Location of practice Rural Urban Inner city Missing 16 (16.8) 55 (57.9) 22 (23.2) 7 (2.1) Type of practice Solo Group Missing 8 (8.4) 86 (90.5) 1 (1.1) Preconception care protocol available, Covered family history, n (%) ** Rural # Urban# Inner city# Covered genetic carrier testing, n (%) ** Rural# Urban# Inner city# 16 (17.0) 10 (62.5) 2 (20.0) 5 (50.0) 3 (30.0) 2 (12.5) 0 0 2 (100.0) Mean (SD) Age, mean Missing 45.7 (8.9) 3 (3.2%) Number of years as a general practitioner, mean Missing 15.6 (8.5) 3 (3.2%) Practice list size per 1000, mean Missing 8529.2 (7439.2) 2 (2.1%) * 95 GPs representing 95 practices ** number (n) is based on whether preconception care protocol is available # The proportion indicates the proportion of each area of practices that has preconception protocol covering family history of reproductive risk or genetic carrier testing 153 7.2.3 GPs' experiences on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk GPs were asked about their experiences of discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk and discussing preconception advice on genetic carrier testing in women of child bearing age in the last three months. Table 7.5 shows the proportion of respondents who had experienced or not, of discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk and discussing preconception advice on genetic carrier testing in women of child beari ng age in the last three months . With regards to discussing family history, over half of the GPs that responded (55.8%) indicated that they had discussed family history of reproductive genetic risk with women planning a pregnancy and approximately one th ird (37.6%) had discussed during routine consultation. Discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk with women during visit for contraception was the least practiced (17.0%). About a quarter (25.8%) of the respondents reported not discussing in any consultation in the last three months. In discussing preconception advice about genetic carrier testing within the last three months, 44.1% indicated that they had discussed with women known to have family history of genetic conditions, whereas approxi mately a third had discussed with women of certain ethnicity background (30.5%) and with women planning a pregnancy (33.3%), respectively. 20.2% of the respondents indicated they had discussed preconception advice about genetic carrier testing during routi ne consultation. Only 11.6% of the respondents discussed during women's visit for contraception. The proportion of respondents who had not discussed in any consultation in the last three months was 26%, which was approximately similar to the experiences of not discussing family history. 154 Nevertheless, in both situations about 70% of the respondents actually disagreed to the statement that they never discussed during any other consultations within the last three months. This may indicate that they had discussed but perhaps during other consultations not mentioned in the questionnaire items. Only a small proportion of the respondents, between 1.1% till 6.5%, indicated that they were uncertain of their experi ences in the last three months in all the situations. 155 Table 7.5 : Experiences Questionnaire Items Yes No Don't know Experiences of discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk During routine consultation Missing 35 (37.6) 2 (2.1) 54 (58.1) 4 (4.3) With women planning a pregnancy Missing 53 (55.8) 0 40 (42.1) 2 (2.1) With women during visit for contraception Missing 16 (17.0) 1 (1.1) 76 (80.9) 2 (2.1) Never discussed during any consultations Missing 24 (25.8) 2 (2.1) 67 (72.0) 2 (2.2) Experiences of discussing preconception advice on genetic carrier testing During routine consultation Missing 19 (20.2) 2 (2.1) 72 (76.6) 3 (3.2) With women planning a pregnancy Missing 31 (33.3) 1 (1.1) 61 (64.9) 2 (2.1) With women during visit for contraception Missing 11 (11.6) 0 83 (87.4) 1 (1.1) With women with known family history of genetic conditions Missing 41 (44.1) 2 (2.1) 46 (49.5) 6 (6.5) With women of certain ethnicity (Asian, African, European) Missing 29 (30.5) 0 60 (63.2) 6 (6.3) Never discussed during any consultations Missing 25 (26.6) 1 (1.1) 66 (70.2) 3 (3.2) 156 7.2.4 GPs' opinions on potential approach to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting The GPs were asked to indicate their opinions on two components of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk; firstly on approach to obtain family history and secondly, on approach to offer genetic carrier testing in general practice. Table 7.6 (1) and Table 7.6 (2) show the proportion of respondents who agreed on the potential approaches to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting. Majority of the respondents agre ed that obtaining family history (95.8%) and offering genetic carrier testing (77.7%) from women seeking preconception advice would be a preferred approach to carry out preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting. Majo rity also favoured obtaining family history from all women of childbearing age at registration by means of self -completed family history questionnaire (81.9%). However, this was not the case in offering genetic carrier testing, where only a third indicated that it was appropriate to offer to all women of childbearing age at registration (34%). Approximately half of the respondents preferred taking family history of reproductive genetic risk from women enquiring family planning advice (54.7%). Only 35.1% co nsidered that offering carrier testing was appropriate when women seek for family planning advice. Assessing reproductive genetic risk in women enquiring about menstrual problems is the least agreed (15.8% and 8.5% respectively). 157 Table 7.6 (1): Potential approach to obtain family history Obtaining family history of reproductive genetic risk from; Agree, N (%)* Women seeking preconception advice Missing 91 (95.8) 0 All women of childbearing age at registration by means of self - completed family history questionnaire Missing 77 (81.9) 1 (1.1) Women enquiring family planning advice Missing 52 (54.7) 0 Women enquiring about menstrual problems Missing 15 (15.8) 0 Table 7.6 (2) : Potential approach to offer genetic testing Offering genetic carrier testing to: Agree, N (%)* Women seeking preconception advice Missing 73 (77.7) 1 (1.1) Women enquiring family planning advice Missing 33 (35.1) 1 (1.1) All women of childbearing age at registration Missing 32 (34.0) 1 (1.1) Women enquiring about menstrual problems Missing 8 (8.5) 1 (1.1) * The denominator depends on the total number of respondents who completed each questionnaire item. 158 7.2.5 GPs' opinions on appropriate settings in primary care practice to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk The GPs were asked to indicate which settings in primary care practice would be suitable to deliver or provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Four suggested primary care setting were listed. Table 7.7 shows the proportion of respondents who agreed on the settings listed. The results indicate that family planning clinic (69.6%) was the most preferred setting to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Thi s is followed by a dedicated preconception clinic, where about half indicated that (52.2%) it would be suitable. Approximately only one -third agreed on providing the assessment in well woman clinic (43.5%) or during routine clinic con sultation (34.4%) resp ectively.

Six suggested barriers were listed. Table 7 .8 demonstrates the proportion of respondents who agreed whether these barriers play a role in developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting. Majority of the respondents indicated, the potential challenges wou ld be that very few women coming for advice before conceive (90.5%) and also difficult to engage these women as target group for preconception advice (76.8%). Further, approximately two -thirds of the respondents considered that not adequately trained to pr ovide preconception reproductive genetic assessment (64.2%) as a barrier. 63.2% also believed that an additional service would involve substantial time and work. Interestingly, only less than half considered that preconception genetic risk assessment has p otential ethical implications (46.3%) and can cause more harm (12.6%). 160 Table 7.8 : Barriers Barriers Agree, N (%)* Very few women coming for advice before trying to conceive 86 (90.5) It is difficult to capture the target group 73 (76.8) I do not have adequate training to provide preconception reproductive genetic assessment 61 (64.2) Setting up a service will require substantial time and work 60 (63.2) There is potential ethical implications of preconception genetic risk assessment (e.g. stigmatisation of carriers) 44 (46.3) Discussing hereditary diseases with couples who are trying for a baby will cause more harm (e.g. emotional disturbances to couples) 12 (12.6) * No missing data * The denominator depends on the total number of respondents who completed each questionnaire item. 7.2.7 GPs' opinions on resources to improve the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting The GPs were asked to indicate resources that could facilitate the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting. Three suggested resources were listed. Ta ble 7 .9 shows the proportion of respondents who agreed whether the resources have a role to improve the d elivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the primary care setting. Overall, majority of the respondents agreed that further resources were required to improve the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic ris k. The respondents believed that training program for GPs was essential (92.6%). In addition, the respondents agreed that national guideline documents for GPs (82.1%) as well as information leaflets on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk for the women given at registration (88.4%) were required 161 to facilitate the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk if it were implemented in the primary care setting.

Table 7.10 provides the proportion of respondents who were prepared and less prepared in the four specified situations. Majority of the respondents ag reed that if appropriate to the consultation , they would be prepared to of fer genetic carrier testing to women of childbearing age (74.2%). About two thirds (62.8%) were prepared to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women of childbearing age group. 65% of the respondents were willing to counsel about genetic carrier testi ng results if given the necessary training and information. Additionally, approximately half of the respondents were 162 prepared to take family history of genetic conditions routinely during obtaining medical history (55.9%). Generally, in all four situations of preparedness the proportion of respondents who were prepared was higher than the less prepared indicating that the majority of the respondents were prepared to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Further, the result indicates that a higher proportion were prepared if there is an indication, for example, assessment of women prior to their planning for a pregnancy and if the GPs have undergone appropriate training with regards to genetic assessment.

Section 2 7.2.9 Association between GPs' prepa redness to take family history of genetic conditions routinely when taking medical history with their experiences of discussing family history and preconception advice on genetic carrier testing Respondents who had discussed family history of reproductive genetic risk during routine consultation in were significantly more prepared as compared to those who had not in the previous three months (p=0.04). Those who had experienced discussing preconcept ion advice on genetic carrier testing with women during visit for contraception were also significantly more prepared to take family history of genetic conditions routinely from all women of childbearing age when taking medical history (p=0.008). Table 7. 11 shows the results of analyses between respondents who were prepared and less prepared with their experiences in providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the last three months. 164 Table 7.11 : Association between GPs' preparedness to take family history of genetic conditions routinely when taking medical history with their experiences of discussing family history and preconception advice on genetic carrier testing GPs' experiences Prepared N (%) Less prepared N (%) p value (Chi-square) Discussing family history of reproductive genetic risk During routine consultation, N (%) Yes No 26 (51.0) 25 (49.0) 12 (30.0) 28 (70.0) 0.04* Missing, n (%) 4 (4.2) With women planning a pregnancy, N (%) Yes No 31 (59.6) 21 (40.4) 21 (51.2) 20 (48.8) 0.42 Missing, n (%) 2 (2.1) With women during visit for contraception N (%) Yes No 12 (23.1) 40 (76.9) 6 (15.0) 34 (85.0) 0.33 Missing, n (%) 3 (3.2) Experiences of discussing preconception advice on genetic carrier testing During routine consultation N (%) Yes No 13 (25.0) 39 (75.0) 9 (22.5) 31 (77.5) 0.78 Missing, n (%) 3 (3.2) With women planning a pregnancy N (%) Yes No 18 (34.6) 34 (65.4) 14 (35.0) 36 (65.0) 0.97 Missing, n (%) 3 (3.2) With women during visit for contraception N (%) Yes No 11 (21.2) 41 (78.8) 1 (2.4) 40 (97.6) 0.008* Missing, n (%) 2 (2.1) With women with known family history of genetic conditions N (%) Yes No 29 (56.9) 22 (43.1) 17 (42.5) 23 (57.5) 0.18 Missing, n (%) 4 (4.2) With women of certain ethnicity (Asian, African, European) N (%) Yes No 18 (34.6) 34 (65.4) 16 (39.0) 25 (61.0) 0.66 Missing, n (%) 2 (2.1) *P< 0.05 165 7.2.10 Association between GPs' preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women of childbearing age with their experiences of discussing family history and preconception advice on genetic carrier testing The results indicate that there is significant difference between respondents who had discussed family history of reproductive genetic risk during routine consultation (p=0.001) and with women planning a pregnancy (p=0.014) in the last three months than who had not. Those who had discussed were significantly more prepared to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women of childbearing age than those who had not discussed during the previous three months.

Logistic regression analyse s, assessing the effects of the demographic variables on the four outcomes of preparedness in offering and providing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk are presented. Section 3 7.2.13 Logistic regression analysis; Univariate and Multivariate analysis Logistic regression analyses were used to predict the outcome variables; which are GPs' preparedness to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in women of child bearing age group in the four specified situations , according to demographic variables . To recap, the four outcome variables are; preparedness to take family history of genetic conditions from all women of childbearing age group routinely, preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women, preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing if appropriate to the consultation and preparedness to counsel genetic carrier testing results if given training and information . The demographic variables are age, gender, years of experience as a GP, location of practice, type of practice, practice list size, availability of protocol on preconception care in the practice that covered taking family history of reproductive genetic r isk or protocol on preconception genetic carrier testing. Univariate analyses were performed individually for all demographic variables, with each four outcome variable s. The analys es demonstrate 172 that all independent variables are statistically insignificant to predict respondents ' preparedness. The variables age, gender, years of experience as a GP and practice list size were regarded as confounders. The variables location of practice, type of practice and availability of preconception care protocol that covered family history and genetic carrier testing were regarded as predictive variables (Poppelaars et.al., 2004c, McCahon et.al., 2 009). The confounders were entered into the model to get the adjusted odds ratio. T he variable, \"Availability of preconception care protocol that covered genetic carrier testing\" was not included in the logistic regression analyses as the numbers were extr emely small and has resulted in a very wide confidence interval. Results are presented separately for each outcome variable . 7.2.14 Logistic regression analyses between preparedness to take family history of genetic conditions routinely from all women of childbearing age when taking medical history routinely with demographic variables Table 7.15 shows the results of the analyses. The proportion of female GPs (55.8%) who were prepared appeared more than the male GPs (44.2%) although not statistically significant. With regards to location of practice, the highest proportion of GPs who were prepared was from urban practice (55.8%), follo wed by inner city (27.5%) and rural practice (13.7%). G Ps that had preconception protocol on family history of reproductive risk, a high proportion, 71.4% were more prepared as compared to only 28.6% who did not have the protocol. Nevertheless, both result s did not reach statistical significant . There was no significant difference between the GPs' age, years of experience and practice list size, between those who were prepared and less prepared. 173 Table 7.15 : Logistic regress ion analyses between preparedness to take family history of genetic conditions routinely from all women of childbearing age when taking medical history routinely with demographic variables Factors Prepared Less Prepared Unadjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI) Adjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI) p value Age, mean (SD) 45.9 (8.9) 45.1 (8.5) 1.01(0.96 -1.06) 1.11 (0.98 -1.26) 0.67 Missing, n (%) 4 (4.2) Gender, N (%) Female Male 29 (55.8) 23 (44.2) 24 (58.5) 17 (41.5) reference 1.12 (0.49 -2.56) Reference 1.23 (0.52 -2.95) 0.79 Missing, n (%) 2 (2.1) Number of years as a GP, mean (SD) 15.4 (8.8) 15.7 (8.5) 0.99 (0.95 -1.05) 0.90 (0.79 -1.03) 0.87 Missing, n (%) 4 (4.2) Location of practice, N (%) Rural Urban Inner city 7 (13.7) 30 (58.8) 14 (27.5) 9 (22.0) 25 (61.0) 7 0.27 Missing, n (%) 3 (3.2) Type of practice, N (%) Group Solo 47 (90.4) 5 (9.6) 39 (95.1) 2 (4.9) reference 2.07 (0.38 -11.29) Reference 2.01 (0.34 -11.78) 0.39 Missing, n (%) 2 (2.1) Practice list size per 1000, mean (SD) 8103.7 (8196.5) 9236.2 (6400.9) 1.00 (1.00 -1.00) 0.48 Missing, n (%) 3 (3.2) 174 Factors Prepared Less Prepared Unadjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI) Adjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI) p value *Preconception care protocol that covered family history taking available No Yes 4 (28.6) 5 (71.4) 2 (44.4) 5 (55.6) Reference 2.00 (0.24 -16.36) Reference 1.37 (0.04 -51.28) 0.63 Fischer's exact test *Preconception care protocol that covered genetic carrier testing available No Yes 6 (85.7) 1 (14.3) 8 (88.9) 1 (11.1) Not available as sample is too small 0.85 Fischer's exact test * Based on availability of preconception care protocol OR = odds ratio CI = confidence interval **Adjusted for age, gender, years of experience as a GP, practice list siz 175 7.2.15 Logistic regression analyses between preparedness to offer genetic carrier testing to at -risk women of childbearing age with demographic variables Table 7.16 shows the results respondents who were prepared and less prepared and demographic variables.

The following Section 4 present s the analyses of free text responses that were written by the respondents to indicate suggestions or additional views of the questionnaire items. Section 4 7.3 Analysis of free text responses Free texts from respondents offered at every questionnaire items were considered as free text responses, and were analysed . Two major themes were derived from the free text responses; facilitators and barriers. Facilitators Incentives were repeatedly mentioned to motivate general practitioners when introducing new health care service in the practice. The respondents also suggested enhanced health care services to help in the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Further, the respondents also suggested the nurses to take char ge of 185 preconception services, besides the GPs, as strategy to facilitate the service . Barriers Time factor was consistently mentioned in the free text response, particularly time with regards to the consultation of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. In addition, one of the respondents was also concerned of time taken for genetic test results to return which may potentially affect the management of the patie nt. The respondents also cited that introducing new services would imply additional cost and funding. Table 7.19 summarizes the analysis of the free text response and examples of the free texts . 186 Table 7.19 : Analysis of the free text response Themes Categories Free text -response Facilitators Incentives \" ....will there be funding to lost opportunity time\" \"It's not all about financial incentives and although unfortunately that seems to be what the GPs want\" Enhanced health care organization \"May need to be enhanced service...\" Delegate task \"Nurse led clinic would be most effective use of resources\" \"Midwife preconception clinic\" \"...practice nurse discusses preconceptual risk..\" Barriers Consultation time \"Time within the consultation, even with adequate training, it is not a discussion that can be had in ten minutes\" \"...genetic risk assessment can take as long as 30 minutes with preconception advice\" \"Genetic testing of blood only via g enetics service which incurs a wait and fee\" Cost/Funding \"Possibility of additional cost to NHS when we really need cost cutting\" \"Not too sure of genetic testing, funds? 187 7.4 Discussion 7.4.1 Strength s and limitation s Response rates Despite this study incorporated several strategies that potentially would have an impact on the return of the questionnaire, t he response ra te was poor, 34%. This was lower than the mean response rate reported in a recent review of published primary care journals looking at GPs' response to postal questionnaire survey, which was 47% (Creavin et al., 2011 ). A number of factors may have influenced the outcome; it may be the lev el of interest to this topic was still low and the GPs may not consider the issue of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk relevant to their practice. Adding to this, the sampling was from at least one GP in each practice, thus, the issue o f 'passing the responsibility to others' to complete the survey may end up to not completing it. Poor response may also be due to the GPs' busy schedule. As a result , the quality of this study may have been affected by the poor response rate. Firstly, it has led to small sample size, thus it was difficult to interpret the results, in particular the calculation of logistic regression models which resulted in wide confidence intervals . Secondly, it potentially limits the generali sability of colle cted data due to non -response bias. Non-response bias occurs when the answers of respondents may differ from potential answers of those who did not respond to the survey ; GPs who replied may have interest or motivated in genetic me dicine , the results potentially is skewed to positive replies. Ideally , every non respondent should be contacted; however, this was not always possible. Although this study has been limited by the small sample size, some information gathered in this survey have nonetheless, offer an insight 188 for potential future interventions in preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Demographic characteristics The demographic profiles of the respondents were approximately similar to the profile of the GPs in the United Kingdom as a whole, with the exception, the proportion of male and female GPs. According to the National Survey of General Practitioners, in 2006, 60% of the GPs were male compared with 42.6% in this study. Nationally, the mean age of GPs was 47.0 years (SD 9.3 ), compared with the mean age of 45.7 years (SD 8.9 ) in this study. The mean number of years working as GPs reported in N ational Survey of General Pra ctitioners was 16.0 years (SD 9.2 ) compared with 15.6 years (SD 8.5) in this study. T he proportion of solo practitioners was 5% nationally; approximately similar to this study 8%. The mean practice list size across all respondents in this study was 8,530 as compared to 8,653 as reported nationally in 2006. Although the demographic profile were about similar to the profile of GPs in the United Kingdom, the findings may not be broadly generalise as this study was only limited to general practices within PCTs of Nottinghamshire, Nottingham City, Derby City and Derbyshire. This may be due to t he geographic settings (urb an, inner city, rural) that may differ with other PCTs. Majority of general practices which participated were located in the urban and inner city areas. Firstly, the population of reproductive age group in the United Kingdom , aged 20 -45 years old , majority lived in urban and the inner city areas whereas, the rural population is predominantly aged between 45 and 64 years old (DEFRA, 2012). Secondly, populations of ethnic minority groups from the South East Asian, Mediterranean a nd the Africans , recognised to inherit autosomal recessive genetic conditions in were concentrated in the inner cities (Modell and Kuliev, 1993 , Hickman et al., 1999 ). Adding to this, very few of the practices have a written protocol on preconception care and particularly covering family history and ge netic carrier testing (10% of all practices). The practices which had both family history and genetic 189 carrier testing components in the preconception care protocol were predominantly inner city practices. These results may suggest that assessment of reproductive genetic risk in women before conception is still not widely recognised or practised. It could be argued that the GPs working in urban and inner city areas are more aware of the issues around reproductive genetic assessment such as preconception and antenatal screening because these areas have higher proportion of population at risk. Analysis of preparedness The univariate analyses demonstrates that generally, majority of the respondents were more prepared to offer preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk if there is an appropriate indication such as with women planning a pregnancy (74.2%) and with women at reproductive genetic risk (62.8%), or if GPs were given adequate training and in formation (65%). In addition, the respondents' preparedness was reflected by their previous experiences. The respondents' preparedness to offer and provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk however, was not significantly associated with their age, gender, years of experience as a general practitioner, the location of practice area, practice description whether solo o r group and practice list size. The availability of preconception protocol on family history and genetic carrier testing al so did not significantly have association with the respondents' preparedness. These findings may suggest that the GPs realised the potential benefits of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk and were prepared to deliver in primary care. It is likely that they were more prepared if preconception risk assessment is relevant to the women. The logistic regression models did not demonstrate the association between predictor variables and the outcomes of preparedness. Predictor variables would he lp researchers to understand GPs preparedness to engage with preconception assessment of 190 reproductive genetic risk interventions. The statistically insignificant results are possibly due to inadequate power of the study. It would be desirable to investiga te other variables or predictors which were not asked in the survey that could have an impact on the outcomes of preparedness; for example, previous training in genetics or reproductive genetics, and previous CME (Continuous Medical Education) attendance on genetics or reproductive genetics; level of knowledge, level of confidence, place of training, clinical genetic services facilities and ethnicity of the GPs (Suchard et al., 1999a ). These factors would give additional information on how to facilitate GPs preparedness to engage with preconception assessment of reproduct ive genetic risk interventions. Adding to this, p erhaps a larger study is worthwhile to generate more precise estimate of effect. Free text analyses The free text responses have provided additional important information on issues to consider when recommending preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in general practice, in particular, the suggestion on enhanced health care services, an independent organization to help improve the delivery of future interventions. Financial incentives through Quality and Outcomes Framework could be one of the ways to facilitate GPs when pr omoting new health care service. However, preconception consultation of genetic risk is considered requiring a longer time in the clinic. Introducing new health care program would incur additional cost to the NHS. 7.4.2 Comparison with existing literatures Previous studies have reported GPs' experiences of providing consultation on preconception care in general (Heyes et al., 2004 , Mennie et al., 1993 ) but not specifically to preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Further, a substantial number of them actually had initiated the consultation on preconception care in routine clinics (Heyes et al., 2004 , Janz et al., 2002 ). When reported specifically on 191 preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, this study has highlighted encouraging respondents ' experiences. Fifty-six percent of the respondents reported doing family history consultations mainly with women planning a pregnancy , whereas, when discussing genetic carrier testing , the highest proportion was with women known family history of genetic conditions (44%) , followed by women planning pregnancy (33%) and those with certain ethnicity background (30.5%) . This seems plausible as women planning pregnancy are the target population to be offered any form of preconception care, and this includes assessment of reprod uctive genetic risk. Women with known family history of genetic conditions and of certain ethnicity , for examples, Asians and Mediterranean , are in the at -risk group. Family and ethnicity history are an expected component in genetic assessment (Bennett, 2012 ), thus, discussing genetic carrier testing is almost inevitable in this at -risk group . Interestingly , there were a small proportion o f respondents who had discussed family history (37.6%) and giving preconception advice on genetic carrier testing (20.2%) during routine consultation. This proportion is lower than previous study which reported about 56% of the participated GPs had provided opportunistically during clinic, but on general preconception advice (Heyes et al., 2004 ). As a substantial proportion of respondents had discussed family history and giving preconception advice on genetic carrier testing mainly to women planning pregnancy, it was not a surprise that majority of the respondents, their preferred approach to obtain family history and offer genetic testing are to women who are seeking preconception advice, 96% and 78% respectively. This certainly offers an opportunistic approach. N evertheless, women were reported not actively coming for preconception advice, whether for general advice (Heyes et al., 2004 ) or specific for reproductive genetic risk assessment (Poppelaars et al., 2003 ). This study demonstrated s imilar findings that majority , 91% of 192 the respondents still believed that accessing this target group of women, a major obstacle. Another important finding was about 82% of the respondents favoured the suggestion of self -completed family history questionnaire to be given to all women of childbearing age in the practice . This could be obtained at first registration or from existing patients who have not had family history taken before. This approach could be an a venue to capture women who are at re productive genetic risk, even if they do not plan to conceive. In this approach, following information gathered from the self-completed family history questionnaire, women can then be offered information about genetic risk in detail and also genetic testin g during consultation with the ir GPs. Information leaflets on preconception risk can be offered in the general practice to enhance awareness about the importance preconception assessment as agreed by 88% of the respondents. With regards to preferred prim ary care setting to provide preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, the highest proportion, 70% of the respondents had indicated that family planning clinic as the appropriate setting. In the United Kingdom, family planning clinics serve as a contraception clinic where they provide advice and information on contraception to women (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception - guide [accessed 5 December 2013]). Although, majority favoured family planning clinics, only a small proportion of the re spondents reported discussing family history (17%) and preconception advice about genetic carrier testing (11.6%) during women's visits for contraception . This result was about similar to previous survey on preconception care in general, where only about 10% of participated GPs had provided preconception ad vice in the clinics (Heyes et al., 2004 ). In addition, only about h alf (54%) of the respondents preferred the approach to obtain family history and 35% to offer genetic carrier testing from women enquiring family planning advice. 193 There may be few possible explanations for this. Firstly, the proportion of at-risk women who consulted for contraceptio n during the time of this study may be low and hence, only small percentages of GPs had discussed family history and genetic carrier testing. Secondly , contraception advice may be provided by other primary care providers such as the nurses. Thirdly , women rarely visit for contraception in routine general practice consultation. Furthermore, having to discuss solely on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk during this visits may be seen as irrelevant by the women. Finally , it may simply due to inadequate attention to preconcep tion care by the GPs during family p lanning or contraceptive visits. With regards to barriers, the most widely acknowledged by the respondents are very few women come for preconception advice before pregnancy (90.5%) and the difficulty to reach these women ( 76.8%). Lack of time (63.2%) and inadequate training (64.2%) still con tribute the main barriers when introducing new services in a health care system, similar to pr evious other studies on preconception care and genetic conditions (Heyes et al., 2004 , McCahon et al., 2009 ). About half (46.3%) still believed that genetic assessment is associated with ethical implication such as stigmatisation. Nevertheless, interestingly only a small proportion of the respondents (12%) believed that genetic assessment could cause more harm. This finding was similar to previous study where 13% (Poppelaars et al., 2004a ) and 3% (Mennie et al., 1998 ) respectively, of participated GPs were concerned of the cystic fibrosis screening to cause more harm. Stigmatisation and discrimination has been consistently mentioned in the national policies as the main concern when recommending any genetic risk assessment programs (Nuffield Council on, 2003 , Health Council of the Netherlands, 2007 , Human Genetics Commission, 2011 ). This may remain as a continuing issue with regards to screening for reproductive genetic risk. Nonetheless , preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk is seen to do more good than harm . This may indicate that women or prospective parents are more aware of the benefits of kno wing 194 reproductive genetic risk before having any children (Wert et al., 2012 ). Henneman (2003) reported , preconception assessment of reproductive genet ic risk for cystic fibrosis did not cause further anxiety (Henneman et al., 2003 ). The at titudes of preparedness from the survey reflects earlier studies that the vast majority of participated GPs recognised the importance of providing preconception care assessment and education (Gaytant et al., 1998, Wallace and Hurwitz, 1998 , Heyes et al., 2004 ) and GPs agreed that primary care setting is most appropriate to offer the service (Wallace and Hurwitz, 1998 , Heyes et al., 2004 ). 7.5 Conclusion The findings from the survey study has provided an understanding of GPs' attitudes, potential facilitators and gaps in the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. However, it is limited due to small study size. The credibility of this study could be enhanced by improving the study design, questionnaire as the survey instrument and carrying out in a larger scale. The following chapter, the final chapter presents the conclusions of this thesis. This chapter will discuss the main findings of thesis; strength and limitations of this thesis ; implications for future practice ; and implications for future research in the United Kingdom. In addition, international applicability of this thesis will also be discussed, with Malaysia as an example . 195 CHAPTER 8 CONCLUSION 8.1 Introduction Improving preconception care can result in improved maternal health and pregnancy outcomes (Rowley et al., 1997 , Atrash et al., 2006 ). Preconception care can offer a window of opportunity to prov ide information for women or prospective parents allowing informed decisions on a broader range of reproductive options (Solomon et al., 2008b ) Enhancing reproductive decision making is regarded as the primary aim of preconception care for reproductive genetic risk (Wert et al., 2012 ). The existing antenatal assessment is seen as suboptimal in terms of enabling full reproductive decision making (Jans et al., 2012 , Solomon et al., 2008 b). The aim of this thesis is to identify the opportunity for preconception care with assessment of reproductive genetic risk as the main focus in the primary care setting. The role of primary care in delivering preconception care is increasingly recognised (March of Dimes, 2002, Health Council of th e Netherlands, 2007). The views of primary care providers are clearly important to understand potential gaps in delivering preconception care, specifically in reproductive genetic risk. Two systematic reviews examining evidences of effectiveness of interve ntions for preconception care and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk were carried out to achieve the aim. A questionnaire survey study involving GPs was carried out to explore their views and attitudes. It is hoped that the results of th e survey and the positive benefits highlighted from the systematic reviews would be useful to provide an understanding to developing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the United Kingdom health infrastructure. 196 In this concluding cha pter, I will present the aim and key findings of each chapter of the thesis. I will futher discuss the strengths and limitations, and will conclude by providing recommendations for future research and discussing clinical implications for practice in the Un ited Kingdom based on results of this thesis. In addition, I will also discuss opportunities to deliver preconception care and specifically preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in Malaysia. 8.2 Main findings of thesis Chapter 1 provides the general introduction of this thesis, aim and objectives, and background rationale to carrying out the work for this thesis. Chapter 2 discusses the potential opportunities and challenges of preconception care in general and specifically in reproductive genetic risk, from review of existing literatures as well as policy -related documents. This chapter has offered information and understa nding to the challenges related to its implementation in the United Kingdom and other countries like the Hungary, Netherlands and the United States, as well as the Mediterranean countries such as Cyprus and Greece. Chapter 3 presents the systematic revie w examining the effectiveness for preconception care strategies to improve pregnancy and reproductive outcomes in primary care. In line with the aim of this thesis, this review was carried out to assess preconception intervention strategies that incorporat e genetic assessment of reproductive risk as part of comprehensive preconception care assessment. The aim of this review is also to explore interventions with practical and systematic approach that can be utilised in primary care. This review concluded t hat there is still limited robust evidence for the effectiveness of preconception care interventions in primary care. 197 There was variation in the characteristics of interventions evaluated and the results were heterogeneous. The results of this review indi cated that both multifactorial and single reproductive health risk interventions improved maternal knowledge, self -efficacy towards healthy lifestyle and risk behaviour, irrespective of the duration of intervention. However, there was no clear indication o f improvement in adverse pregnancy outcomes. In two -thirds of the included studies, participants were restricted only to women planning pregnancy. Reaching out only to women who are planning pregnancy would result in missed opportunities for preventative s trategy. Chapter 4 presents the systematic review, using Cochrane methodology, examining the evidence of effectiveness for preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. As there is little research in this area particularly in primary care, the sc ope of this review has included any health care settings instead of only primary care settings. The scope of diseases for this review was confined to autosomal recessive genetic conditions, namely; haemoglobinopathies which include thalassemia and sickle c ell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease; as these diseases are common and high prevalent worldwide. It was not possible to draw clear conclusions regarding the effectiveness of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, as this rev iew identified only two interventional studies and only on two specific genetic conditions, haemoglobinopathies and cystic fibrosis. Furthermore both studies were of different methodological design and of limited quality. Nevertheless, these studies have d emonstrated that preconception assessment (carrier testing) and education have positive benefits and implications on the target populations' knowledge, psychological wellbeing, recall and understanding of test -results and satisfaction. With regards to know ledge, both studies reported significant improvement from before and just after pre -carrier test education or counselling. 198 Chapter 5, 6 and 7 presents the questionnaire survey exploring the attitudes and opinions of GPs in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshi re. It is encouraging to discover that the present GPs in my study were already offering or providing preconception advice on reproductive genetic risk opportunistically particularly, with women planning pregnancy, with positive family history of genetic conditions or with women of certain ethnicity background. Even if they are not offering or providing preconception advice on reproductive genetic risk, majority of them indicated that they are prepared to offer and provide the advice or service, especially to women at -risk or women planning a pregnancy. In addition, the GPs indicated that they are also prepared to provide genetic counselling if they are given appropriate training and information. This indicates that the GPs are willing to take an active rol e to introduce the service in their practice. Certainly this is a positive indicator in the initial step to recommending preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care. It was agreed by most GPs in my study that family planning clin ic is the preferred setting in primary care to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. There is a need to re -emphasize the role of family planning clinic to the GPs as well as other primary care providers and to all women of reproduc tive age in the United Kingdom. Since the GPs' primary concern is difficulty to capture women to go for preconception care assessment, thus, it would seem feasible to reach them through family planning clinics. 8.3 Strengths and limitations of thesis The rev iews in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 examined the evidence for effectiveness of interventions in preconception care focussing on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in primary care setting. Systematic reviews aim to \"collect and synthesize relevant evidence to inform real -world health care decisions for patients, health 199 care providers, and policymakers, as well as to identify future research needs\" (Higgins and Green, 2011 ). Evidently, strong methodologic approaches increase the transparency, consistency and scientific rigor of these reports (Higgins and Green, 2011 ). This is the key strength of systematic reviews. However, the use of robust methodol ogy has led to limited number of eligible studies being identified for these reviews. Systematic review may not always provide the evidence to developing preconception genetic interventions within the health care systems, but what I've learnt is looking at within the context of the settings, situations and community targeted in each intervention as well as potential outcomes and benefits that each intervention is able to demonstrate. Adding to this, the reviews have highlighted positive benefits in the improvement of maternal knowledge on preconception care and preconception genetics. The importance of sufficient knowledge would potentially help to support women or prospective parents informed decision -making when undergoing genetic screening (Marteau and Lerman, 2001 , Stefansdottir et al., 2010 ). This is important when informed decision -making is regarded as the primary aim and focus of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. Although there is lack of robust evidence, these revi ews could inform future research in preconception interventions. It also helps to inform potential strategy for developing preconception assessment of genetic risk in primary care such as potential target population and potential setting to implement it. The survey was carried out to explore the GPs' attitudes and opinions on preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk if this intervention is to be introduced in the general practices in the United Kingdom. This survey has been limited by poor re sponse rate. Although the demographic profiles are approximately similar to the profiles of GPs, there is a concern about generalising the findings to the entire GPs in the United Kingdom as it only involved two counties, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Ad ding to this, the questionnaire was 200 replied by only one GP for each practice. Nonetheless, the findings gathered in this survey have offered invaluable information for potential future interventions in preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. It is hoped these findings could be translated into primary care practice in the United Kingdom in future. This will be discussed in subsequent section; the 'Implications for future practice'. 8.4 Implications for future practice in primary care in the United Kingdom I acknowledged that the impact of this thesis is limited due to poor trial evidence in the systematic reviews as well as poor response in the questionnaire survey. Nevertheless, the findings have generated some insights how this might be us ed to inform or translated into primary care practice. Furthermore, preconception care has already taken place in some parts of the world based on evidences from large observational studies, especially in the developed countries such as the United States and the Netherlands. There is a possibility to recommend it in the NHS United Kingdom. 8.4.1 Recommending family planning clinic One of the key findings in my survey is recommending utilizing family planning clinic to reach women prior to pregnancy. Family pla nning clinic could be used as a potential starting point to introduce and implement preconception care. In the United Kingdom, family planning clinic seems to be a feasible setting to capture women of childbearing age, especially when we consider that pre conception interventions should be offered and accessible to all or at risk women. There is a need to re -emphasize and delineate the role of family planning clinics within the health infrastructure in the United Kingdom. According to the National Health Service, a family planning clinic provides reproductive health services 201 which involve fertility, preparing for pregnancy and preventing pregnancy or contraception, and prevention of gynaecologic malignancy and infection (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contrac eption - guide/Pages/contraception -clinic -services.aspx). This allows family planning clinic a unique ability to reach any women of childbearing age. It also often attracts younger women who primarily come for contraception advice, thus, this setting may pot entially offer opportunity for reproductive advice (Gold, 2005 ). A routine health risk assessment could be proposed as part of preconception care package in this setting to identify women at reproductive genetic risk when they come for any reproductive health advice or treatment at this clinic. A self - administered fa mily history questionnaire, given to women at registration could be recommended to assist in the assessment process. In addition, as time especially during routine consultation is a problem that is commonly voiced by the GPs in the survey, family planning clinic may provide a protected time and opportunity to discuss preconception risk and reproductive issues, along with other women's health issues. 8.4.2 GPs' preparedness Optimizing the delivery of preconception care practices in primary care will require int egration across the various groups of primary care providers (Ross, 2012 ) and strong commitment of the primary care team to carry out and to sustain adherence to the service. GPs are the main gatekeepers in the primary care setting, and they could be supported by other primary care providers such as, practice nurses a nd midwives (Roland et al., 2012 ). Are the GPs prepared to deliver if implemented nationally or at a population level? According to my st udy, the GPs appear to have positive attitude to preparedness to offering and providing the service. This may suggests GPs' acceptance of the service in primary care. In this context, improving their awareness 202 and knowledge would be the logical initial ste p when recommending the intervention. This includes education and training on the importance of addressing preconception health in general and specific in reproductive genetic risk among all women of childbearing age and risk screening. Nevertheless, GPs e xpressed that lack of training in this area is a limitation. It is essential that continuous medical education for the GPs or other primary care providers that covers the assessment and counselling of reproductive genetic risk be developed to improve and sustain their knowledge and practices. Education and training module such as the PEGASUS ( Professional Education for Genetic Assessment and Screening) should include issues such as family history, consanguinity, the timing for preconception risk assessment, genetic carrier screening and interpretation of results. In the case of haemoglobinopathies, cystic fibrosis and Tay -Sach disease, possible reproductive options and detection of signs of possible genetic conditions should be added in the module. 8.4.3 Facilita ting service provision Besides enhancing the role of GPs, service provision in general, needs to be addressed. Primary care providers including GPs need appropriate resources. In the context of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, the re commendation would be to develop of consolidate the existing clinical professional guidelines, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, such as that covers fertility, pregnancy and childbirth, which most GPs in the survey acknowledged. The women and prospective parents need to be aware and understand of the importance of preconception care in general and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk (Solomon et al., 2008a , Jans et al., 2012 ). Information leaflets and electronic media on preconception care incorporating reproductive genetic risk would help to achieve their awareness. Another possible sugge stion is to deliver general education 203 about timing of conception and pregnancy -related health risks in family planning clinics or even in schools. Integrating reproductive health messages into the existing health promotion campaign in the clinic for exampl e, the campaigns for cervical screening or breast cancer screening campaigns could be beneficial. With regards to the delivery of preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, it should not be regarded as a separate entity but should incorporate into the existing reproductive health infrastructure in primary care practice. These could either be linked to a specific preconception care package, maternity package which would include preconception, antenatal and postnatal, or women's care package for example, Pap smear and breast -self-examination. In fact, in the latest WHO policy report 2012, the WHO has outlined reproductive genetic conditions as one of the areas to be addressed in preconception care package (WHO, 2012 ) Funding and incentives are two important resources to consider when introducing new health care service in the primary care settings. The introduction of Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in the United Kingdom has incentivised general practices to engag e in management of diseases and preventative activities (Dixon et al., 2011 ). With regards to preconception screening, only preconception screening for diabetes and epilepsy have taken place in the Unit ed Kingdom (www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/QOFbrief0908 ). In addition, one of the Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) also includes enhanced health care services, in which case could help to prov ide and improve the delivery of preconception care interventions in general practice. The systematic reviews have highlighted that majority of the target population in the primary studies was women planning pregnancy. It is possible that women who are pla nning pregnancy are more likely to be interested in preconception care and motivated to achieve improved knowledge and risk behaviour change. Possibly to the women, this is 204 seen as important to achieve improved preconception health and ultimately would ben efit informed decisions and their pregnancy outcomes. One might argue that is it worthwhile to address preconception interventions only to women planning pregnancy? After all, they are motivated and potentially would have better outcome in reproductive hea lth. On the other hand, this may not be fair. Interventions should be offered and accessible to all or at risk women. Nevertheless, targeting women planning pregnancy in the intervention at the initial development might be a logical and desirable idea. 8.5 Potential challenges of delivering preconception care and specifically reproductive genetic risk in the United Kingdom There is opportunity that working preconception care into the existing family planning clinic services would create a platform for improved reproductive health care. This family planning clinic setting is potentially capable to capture women of reproductiv e age group. However, critical challenges to working this out need to be addressed. Firstly, the challenge would be to establish what a preconception care package should consist of, so that it is more applicable and realistic to women who use family plan ning clinic services. This is important because traditionally family planning clinic services offer contraceptive services to avoid becoming pregnant. Although women come to family planning clinics for contraceptive services, this could be an opportunity to inform and educate them about preconception care. Adding to this, there should be a method to inform these women of the role of family planning clinic such as through electronic media, advertisement on public transport or free pamphlet from clinics or ev en superstores. With regards to the implementation of this service, there should be a protocol for providing preconception care in the family planning clinic setting so that so that it is offered universally in the NHS infrastructure. The challenge at t his point is that, there is still paucity of strong 205 evidence to recommend at policy level. Implementation could be based on existing large observational studies that have demonstrated positive impact of preconception care such as reduction in the prevalen ce of neural tube defects (Czeizel, 1993 ). Next, the challenge would be to have suf ficient professional human resources to run preconception health. This is important because at any point GPs would also have to handle other clinical services. One possible suggestion is to extend the role of other primary care providers besides the GPs to provide preconception care. If this is run in the family planning clinic, midwives and practice nurses could be involved in the assessment of reproductive risk as well as giving information on preconception care. Further to this, there should be addition al training for primary care providers both in clinical such as like the PEGASUS (Professional Education for Genetic Assessment and Screening) as well as administration training. There should be coordination and access with other specialists such as gynaec ologist, geneticist or genetic counsellors to refer women who are at health risk. An expansion to include preconception care would mean potential additional cost. Thus, securing adequate funding is necessary to facilitate successful integration of precon ception care into family planning clinic settings. The development of such intervention not just relies on adequate financial allocation but also, appropriate mobilization of financial resources for that matter. Local primary care organizations such as the Primary Care Trust (PCT) should explore the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of providing preconception care to the population, directing appropriate resources and funding into general practices. When introducing preconception care and preconception on reproductive genetic risk nationally, there will also be potential challenges on sustainability of the intervention. This would mean that there should be a body within the NHS infrastructure such as the National Screening Committee to organize and sustain its 206 implementation. They could be in charge of quality control, make plans to evaluate and to monitor effectiveness of the intervention. One possible suggestion with regards to evaluating effectiveness is to develop key indicators for example, number of a dverse pregnancy outcomes or congenital abnormality with regards to preconception care; and number of preconception genetic testing, number of carrier detected and number of referrals for genetic counselling to demonstrate the results of this intervention in particular on preconception care of genetics. Above all, the government as policy maker has vital role to approve, ensure enforcement and to sustain this intervention nationally. It is hoped that with better resources, organization, manpower and training could provide a valued preconception care service to any women of reproductive age. When discussing genetics it usually raises ethical, legal and social implications. They are still considered as the key concern when developing genetic risk asses sment at national or population level (Clayton, 2003 , Fulda and Lykens, 2006 ) even if the benefits of the intervention are maximised. Generally, the health care providers and community at large are worried about the effects of knowing genetic risk on a healthy individuals or families. These issues may vary for specific communities and countries because of cultural and religious background (Clayton, 2003 , WHO, 2006 ). Across the countries, WHO (2006) reported p ossible detrimental effects of genetic assessment in general which are (WHO, 2006 ): 1. Anxiety raised by information that cannot be used to make positive personal choices about treatment measures or limited choices for preventive measures. 2. Social stigmatization of people with genetic risk or genetic conditions. 3. Undue pressure on individual choices. 207 4. Confidentiality issues whereby disclosing information to the partner or family members may conflict the affected person's confidentiality. 5. Misuse of the information and discriminatio n based on the test results after disclosure to third parties, such as insurers and employers. 6. Health disparities such as poor access to genetic services for example genetic counselling or genetic education, in general and specific to genetic screening o r testing or early antenatal diagnosis. 7. Health disparities due to limited health professionals with adequate genetic training. 8. Legal or religious restrictions for the termination of pregnancies affected with genetic conditions. These possible effects coul d be relevant in the United Kingdom. In relation to preconception genetic assessment, confidentiality issues especially disclosing information to partners and also leaving them with possible reproductive options afterwards has been recognised as a potenti al social implications. Disparities with the health services following reproductive screening, for example, availability of early antenatal diagnosis, as well as legal or religious restriction to termination of pregnancy are also potential problems (Khoury et al., 2003 , Fulda and Lykens, 2006 ). 8.6 Implications for future research in the United Kingdom The conclusion from systematic reviews shows that there is a need for more interventional studies and trials on preconception care, especially in primary care applying more pragmatic approach based on current structure of primary care and available resourc es. It seems appropriate to suggest studies of intervention that involves multifactorial risk assessment incorporating all women of reproductive age. One 208 suggestion is to test on the effectiveness of a preconception care package consists of multifactorial risk assessment in a family planning clinic and targeting on all women of reproductive age over usual consultation in the common general practice. Taking into consideration the limitation of GPs, for example; understaff and time; future studies should also recruit other potential primary care providers for example, practice nurses or midwives to offer preconception care. With regards to preconception genetics, suggested studies would be to examine strategies for preconception genetic risk assessment which include education, counselling and screening or testing as the intervention for the target population. One possible suggestion is to test the effectiveness with regards to different nature of delivery, different primary care settings and who can most effe ctively delivers the interventions. With regards to effectiveness of these interventions, possible outcome measures should include uptake of the intervention, number of referrals for carrier testing, reproductive decisions (eg. number of infants born with hereditary genetic conditions), psychological outcomes (eg. anxiety, depression) and social outcomes (eg. stigmatisation) and possibly understanding of carrier status. The questionnaire survey also has several methodological limitations. To optimize the impact of the survey, it should be implemented on a larger scale, not just confined to two counties, so that the results potentially would be generalisable. The survey in strument should be improved with additional variables that are hypothesized to have effect on the GPs' preparedness such as number of continuous medical training or courses on preconception care or genetics (Suchard et al., 1999a ) and number of consultation on preconception genetics in the last three months (Suchard et al., 1999a ). 209 Adding to this the survey which originally was administered to GPs should also involve other primary care providers such as the nurses and midwives. This is because they are also potentially involve in delivering preconception care. Cost-benefit and cost -effectiveness should also be carried out as part of outcomes of studies on preconception interventions. To enhance the impact of the intervention on preconception care and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, qualit ative studies should be carried out involving women and primary care providers to explore intervention feasibility and acceptability. It would be helpful to explore their views on the benefits and limitations of the intervention as they are the main stakeh olders. 8.7 Opportunities in Primary Care in Malaysia Having explored the implications for recommending practice of preconception care focussing in the assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the United Kingdom, I will now look at the applicability of the recommendations in my practice in Malaysia. There is opportunity to introduce preconception care and in particular, preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in Malaysia. In Malaysia, thalassaemia is considered the most prevalent autosomal recessive condition and it poses an increasing public health problems (George, 2001 ). Approximately 3.5 -4% of Malaysians are carriers of - thalassemia (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2009 , George and Ann, 2010 ). In 2009, there were about 4,700 register ed thalassaemia patients with majority were -thalassemia major (Hishamshah, 2012 ). The Malaysian National Thalassaemia Prevention and Control Programme gained the Ministry of Health approval in the late 2004 (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2009 ). At present, screening for 210 reproductive genetic risk is carried out antenatally, nationwide. Opportunistic screening is either carried out throu gh positive family history or voluntary (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2009 ). The implication of carrying out screening for thalassaemia antenatally, gives the women or prospective parents limited reproductive options. The options include doing prenatal diagnosis and prepare oneself antenatally and, or postnatally if the future child is found to have thalassaemia major. They could also cont inue with the pregnancy without prenatal diagnosis. In Malaysia, termination of pregnancy has legal consequence. In 1989, according to the penal code, it is only allowed to terminate pregnancy within 120 days of conception if the pregnancy poses a threat t o the women's life or to her physical and mental health greater than would the termination of pregnancy (The Penal Code (Amendment) Act 1989 (Act A727). Apart from legal issues, termination of pregnancy is not permissible by the most Malaysians due to reli gious and cultural concerns (Wong et al., 2011 ). With the increasing number of thalassaemia in Malaysia, there is a place that identification of carriers should take place before women conceive. It gives prospective parents more reproduction options where termination of pregnancy is not permissable. A re cent study carried out locally reported that majority of the participants expressed positive attitude towards premarital genetic screening (Wong et al., 2011 ). 211 8.8 How to develop preconception care within the primary care infrastructure in Malaysia 8.8.1 Introduction The primary care in Malaysia is provided by an integrated system of health clinics and community clinics in the public sector. Both health clinics and community clinics cover maternal, whic h include antenatal and postnatal and also child health. Some of the community clinics are managed by midwives in rural areas. According to a recent report by Mohamed Noh (2011), the number of health clinics is 812 and 1919 community clinics nationally in 2010. This organization of public sector is under the directive of Ministry of Health of Malaysia (Mohamad Noh, 2011 ), so any interventions or programmes developed by the gove rnment will be implemented systematically in all health clinics and community clinics. There is also considerable number of private clinics that offers primary care facilities. Most women also go to private clinics to seek advice on reproductive issues. The policies of private clinics are managed individually by private organization. 8.8.2 Opportunities and challenges The role of family planning services to improve reproductive and women's health in Malaysia is as similar as in the United Kingdom. It could be a potential setting to introduce preconception health assessment as part of reproductive health care. Preconception health assessment should include identifying women at reproductive genetic risk. With regards to the implementation of preconception assessment of genetic risk, one important suggestion highlighted by a local study (Wong et al., 2011 ) is to introduce the intervention before marriage or 212 premarital intervention. Implementation of national premarital screening has been extensively reported in many countries where autosomal recessive genetic conditions, namely thalassaemia, is most prevalent Hadjiminas, 1981 , Samavat and Modell, 2004 ). It is reported that the driving force for the acceptance of this programme is public awareness specifically knowing the importance and role of premarital screening, availability of effective genetic education and counselling, high consanguinous marriage, availability of genetic services and supports by religious organizations and policy makers or government (WHO, 2006 ). This could be pertinent in Malaysia who has high prevalent of thalassaemia and evidence of consanguinous marriage in certain ethnic group (Wong et al., 2011 ). In Malaysia, there are two types of legal marriage, civil and Muslim marriages. Under the Malaysian law, in any types, couples who are going to wed will need to register formally with appointed government or religious Registrar (www.malaysianbar.org.my ). This may be a potential setting to introduce premarital genetic screening as part of preconception health assessment. There are potential limitations; the appointed government or religious authorities has to agree to undertake this intervention; the public's acceptance of carrying genetic screening before marriage may have social implications such as stigmatisation, individual's religion an d cultural constraint may contribute as barriers. Inadequate efficient funding and inefficient access or network to health facilities for testing, genetic education and counselling may limit the running of the intervention. However, it seems possible to l ink preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk through family planning services or through premarital screening in Malaysia. Foremost, is to formulate a strategy appropriate to the local epidemiology, current service infrastructure and available funding and resources. There is a need to collaborate the policy makers or respective authorities in the government. The government could take the primary role to arrange a thalassaemia 213 carrier screening programme to create awareness and help organise screening through either family planning services or premarital registration. The empowerment of women and family members through education is an important facet of this intervention, thus information can be conveyed to the public by electronic media, advert isements, pamphlets, posters or public forum. There should be a network of family planning and premarital services with the primary care facilities for example, the health clinics and community clinics or even hospitals. A constant effort has to be made to educate and train primary care providers to emphasize on the continuing burden of thalassaemia, to improve the genetic education or counselling and to understand the application of genetics to public health and its associated ethical, religion, legal and social issues. However, there is concern over public and private sector where variation in practice, inequality in the distribution of health resources and workload might exist. This may lead to standard of care may not be uniform throughout. There is al so concern over continuity of care of the target population. Nevertheless, this should not be the barrier to implement preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk. With respect to this, the first logical step would be to introduce to the Ministry of Health and implement it in the public sector. Another possible suggestion is to introduce intervention through linkage with other relevant programmes. Relevant to reproductive health, existing programme in Malaysia is Adolescent Health which is commu nity based and covers sexual and reproductive health as documented in the 10th Malaysian Plan (10th Malaysian Plan, 2011 ). It would seem beneficial for the adolescent to be aware of genetic risk as they are in the reproductive age group and majority may not yet conceived, however, the downside is this programme mainly involved 214 school -age individuals and there will be issues on informed consent and stigmatization among peers. 8.8.3 Future research in Malaysia It will be my interest to explore the perspectives of primary care providers in the public and private sector as well as women of childbearing age in Malaysia with regards to introducing preconception care involving reproductive genetic risk as the main focus. My study, the questionnaire survey, could be replicated to explore the attitudes and opinions of GPs as well as other primary care providers that managed the health cl inics or community clinics for example, nurses and midwives. The questionnaire items and methodology will need to adapt to the structure of primary care in Malaysia. As the first step, the content of the questionnaire could be improved with prior qualitat ive studies such as qualitative interview or focus groups with primary care providers exploring their views on barriers and facilitators to the developing preconception care involving reproductive genetic risk. This would help to understand the pathway of health services and how preconception care could be provided. Interviewing about the issues around referrals and counselling would help to understand the available resources and service provision following identified women who are at risk. With regards to target population, conducting focus group of women of childbearing age in Malaysia would help to understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in the community. 215 8.9 Learning points through this PhD thesis The whole process has been a learning experience and hard work, but the overall satisfaction has been the knowledge and research skills that I have acquired. The PhD programme has given me the opportunity to develop and carry out a robust systematic review and also practical experience in mixed research methods. During this thesis, I have discovered substantially interesting issues related to my research and this has opened up to realise the depth of the knowledge that would be very useful and applicable in future health care management. The findings in my thesis has offered valuable information on the potential benefits of preconception care and preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk, however, strong evidence on its effecti veness is still limited. This needs to be addressed in future research. Despite the continuing challenges to develop this intervention in primary care, it is encouraging to discover that GPs are prepared to deliver preconception assessment of reproductive genetic risk in their practice. This offers an opportunity to implement intervention in primary care. 216 REFERENCES 2005. ACOG Committee opinion, number 318, October 2005. Screening for Tay-Sachs disease.

The sessions also include routine clinic premarital sessions. Control: Routine clinic premarital sessions, no special healthy lifestyle training. *Premarital session covers reproductive health issues; family planning, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted disease and screening of genetic conditions and drug abuse. Outcomes Health locus of control - internal and external (HLOC) using Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales and physical exercise self -efficacy using Health - Specific Self -Efficacy scales. Both scales were already tested for reliability and validity in previous Iranian studies. These variables were measured before and 2 weeks post interven tion for both groups of women. 235 Risk of bias Item Review authors' judgement Description Adequate sequence generation? Yes Described as block randomisation method. Allocation concealment? Unclear Insufficient information given to determine concealment. Blinding? No It was not feasible to blind the participants and health educators. Incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Unclear 240 participants randomised, 210 (87%) of whom were included in the analyses (intervention group = 109, control group = 101). 30 women did not complete the post - intervention questionnaires; it was reported that data were missing in some categories in the excluded women. Free from selective reporting? Yes Data have been provided for all outcomes proposed in the methods/outcomes section. Free from other bias? Yes Baseline comparability: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of both groups. Similarly, with the non-respondents were also not statistically significant. Valida tion of measures: The scales used has been previously tested for reliability and validity in Iranian studies 236 Elsinga 2008 Methods Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial, Randomisation occurred at the GPs level. Randomisation: randomisation stratified Follow -up: Trial was followed three times within a 3 - year period Participants Women aged 18 -40 years old attending for care with 67 GPs which were randomised; 30 (intervention) and 37 (control). Inclusion criteria: All women planning pregnancy. Exclusion criteria: GPs reviewed the selected women and excluded for the following reasons: completed family, subfertility or infertility, sterilisation, insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, pregnancy and adverse social circums tances. A total of 27,226 women over the 3 -year study period were invited for PCC, however, 12,306 women were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Of 14,915 women eligible, only 6,782 responded to the offer. Of interested responders, 725 intended to get pregnant within one year and 1095 within one to five years. Eligible women who responded were sent risk assessment questionnaire and only 491 returned. Of these only 348 (2.3%) actually attended PCC within the 3-year period. For the first year, partici pants were all eligible women. For the second year, participants were lim ited to new eligible women, non -responders from the first year and responders who had shown interest but contemplating pregnancy between one in five years. For the third year, partici pants were lim ited to new eligible women, non -responders from the second year and responders who had shown interest in the second year but contemplating pregnancy between one in five years and interested in the first year but did not specified the time to conceive. Insufficient information on women in the control group. Interventions Intervention: Nature: A 3 -year study whereby annual PCC is offered to eligible women in the year 2000, 2001 and 2002. Brochures (VSOP) on general information were also given Delivered by: GPs participated in PCC project 'Parents to Be'. Setting: Primary health care centres in Netherlands Details: Annual invitation for PCC to women aged 18 - 40 years old. Risk assessment questionnaire were sent to those eligible and interested for PCC and those contemplating pregnancy within a year. Participants and partners were scheduled appointments for PCC after completed questionnaires. GP discussed risk factors to woman and partner, individually based on risk assessment and provide inform ation on general risk factors for adverse 237 pregnancy outcome. These include infection prevention, medication use, folate intake, alcohol, smoking, nutrition, occupational hazards and genetic risk assessment. Couples also receive brochures (VSOP) on general information. Control: Standard care by GPs (no routine invitation for PCC) Outcomes Assessment of knowledge of pregnancy -related risk factors and preventive measures, behavioural changes before and during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Asse ssment of knowledge - assessed among a randomisation of half of women eligible prior to PCC, post intervention, knowledge was assessed in all women who attended PCC and random selection of half of women receiving standard care. Insufficient information on the actual timing of knowledge assessment. Knowledge assessed consists of 20 essential items covering hazardous substances, prevention of infection, folate and timing of conception. Assessment of behavioural changes and pregnancy outcomes were assessed wit hin two months after delivery. Adverse pregnancy outcomes analysed were miscarriage, extrauterine pregnancy, stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight and congenital anomalies. 238 Risk of bias Item Review authors' judgement Description Adequate sequence generation? Yes Described as stratified cluster randomisation. Allocation concealment? Unclear Insufficient information given to determine concealment. Blinding? No It is not possible to blind the participating GPs and women; they were aware of the assignments. Incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? No Intention -to -treat analysis could not be performed as actual PCC attendance was lower than expected. Free from selective reporting? Yes Data have been provided for assessment of knowledge. With regards to behavioural changes and pregnancy outcome measures, there were only 150 pregnancies after receiving PCC, of these only 114 participants completed the questionnaires and included in the analyses. Free from other bias? No Baseline compa rability: Groups differed at baseline characteristics. The difference in country of birth and educational level could have affected the results . 239 Hillemeier 2008 Methods Design: Randomised controlled trial Randomisation: stratified randomisation Follow -up: 14 weeks after baseline risk assessment Participants 692 women aged 18 -35 years old were recruited from 15 low -income, rural communities 473 assigned to intervention group and 219 in control.

Of the 580 couples who responded, 559 couples gave written consent to have the test. 262 Intervention 1 Nature of intervention Pre-carrier test educational group session followed by carrier testing Delivered by One study researcher Description of intervention 1. An invitation letter with an information leaflet was sent to eligible couple. Information leaflet described clinical and genetic aspects of cystic fibrosis, carrier prevalence , implication of a positive carrier testing, methods of carrier testing and information on test sensitivity 2. Participants attended educational session; session consist more detailed education eg. reproductive choices, advantages and disadvantages of screeni ng 3. Couples were offered testing at the end of the session; mouthwash sample for mutation analysis. One partner was tested first, if positive only the second partner was tested 4. A brochure about cystic fibrosis was given further 5. Test results were sent to cou ples by mail within 8 weeks 6. Duration of session was 45 min. Held on 2 -3 evenings in one week Study instrument All participants were asked to complete individually a questionnaire at three different measurement; Q1: before pre -carrier test education or c onsultation Q2: within one week after consultation but before test result Q3: six months after receipt of carrier test result Integrity of intervention Validity of information leaflet Described the clinical and genetic aspects of cystic fibrosis, carrier prevalence in the population, implication of positive carrier screening test, how testing take place and sensitivity of the test. Validity of questionnaire Questionnaire was developed and tested for homogeneity specifically for this study. Contents included socio - demographics, familiarity with the disease, knowledge of the disease, health locus of control, perceptions and attitudes on carrier testing which derived from Health Belief Model. Reliability analysis was performed. 263 Intervention 2 Nature of intervention Pre-carrier test individual consultation delivered by general practitioners. Delivered by 18 general practitioners were involved. A manual for cystic fibrosis consultation was given to participating general practitioners to use as guide during consultation. Description of intervention 1. An invitation letter with an information leaflet was sent to eligible couple. Information leaflet described clinical and genetic aspects of cystic fibrosis, carrier prevalence, implication of a positive carrier testing, methods of carrier testing and information on test sensitivity 2. Couples attended general practitioner consultation. This session specifically for preconception cystic fibrosis carrier screening. The ses sion consist more detailed education eg. reproductive choices, advantages and disadvantages of screening 3. Couples were offered testing at the end of the consultation; mouthwash sample for mutation analysis. One partner was tested first, if positive only the second partner was tested 4. A brochure about cystic fibrosis was given further 5. Test results were sent to couples by mail within 8 weeks unless objected by couples, copies of positive results were sent to their general practitioner. 6. Positive result were conf irmed by second testing. Intervention 3 Nature of intervention No personal education. Participants were sent a brochure on information on cystic fibrosis and carrier testing 264 Lakeman study : Three -month follow -up of Western and non- Western participants in a study on preconceptional ancestry - based carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies in the Netherlands General information Date of data extraction 14 May 2013 Study title Three -month follow -up of Western and non -Western participants in a study on preconceptional ancestry -based carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies in the Netherlands Country of origin Netherlands Study characteristics Aim of the study To study psychological outcomes, knowledge, recall and understanding of test -results, satisfaction and reproductive intentions in preconception carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies in a multi -ethnic population in Netherlands, in which a cou ple's eligibility for cystic fibrosis and/or haemoglobinopathies was based on both partners' ancestry Study design Non-randomised, before -and after study Study inclusion Individual who had a partner with whom they were planning a pregnancy, irrespective of whether this would be in the near future or at a later date Study exclusion Pregnancy, inability to read and write in Dutch, positive family history of cystic fibrosis and/or haemoglobinopathies Recruitment procedure Names and addresses of potential participants were obtained from the practice register and population register and invited by own general practitioners and Municipal Health Service respectively Duration of study January to December 2005 265 Participant characteristics Characteristics of participants at the beginning of the study Age 20 - 35 years old Ancestry Western (European, North American, Australian) and non - western (Turkey, Surinam, Morocco, South -east Asian) participants Married 50 individuals married Parity 34 individuals with children Number of participants pre - intervention 490 participants eligible for participation Number of participants post - intervention 72 couples (N=143 individuals); 47 couples eligible for testing of cystic fibrosis only, 6 for haemoglobinopathies only, and 19 for both Number of participants - Q4 Number of withdrawals, lost to follow -up 33 individuals (23%) lost to follow -up. No information about reasons in this group. Intervention and setting Description of intervention Participants with their partner were required to visit their general practitioner for pre -carrier testing consultation. During this consultation, the general practitioner assessed the couple's eligibility for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies testing based on a decisional instrument already developed. Advantages and disadvantages of screening wer e discussed. The general practitioner then offered testing. Samples were taken if the couples agreed. A brochure on information about clinical and genetic aspects of the conditions, test procedure, test sensitivity was provided to take home, accompanied b y an informed consent form which had to be returned within one week to the researcher to consent to analyses of the samples. Cystic fibrosis carrier testing was carried out step -wise: one partner was tested first and the second was tested only if the first partner's test result was positive. For haemoglobinopathies carrier testing, both partners were tested. Study instrument All participants were asked to complete individually a questionnaire at four different measurement; Q1: 30 min before pre -carrier test consultation Q2:within one week after consultation Q3: one week after receiving carrier test results Q4: three months after receiving carrier test results Integrity of intervention Validated of decisional instrument 266 Appendix 5.1 : Thematic a nalysis of focus group of primary care providers Themes Subthemes Codes Conceptualising preconception care Defining preconception care Educating women before they enter into pregnancy (GP1) Making sure they are going into it knowing they are fit and well (GP1) Reducing the problems that they may have before pregnancy (GP2) Unclear about roles; Family planning and pre - pregnancy planning is seen as two different entities It's a gap between family planning and pre - pregnancy planning (GP2) You would be talking family planning but you would also be talking pre - pregnancy planning and it didn't work.

This survey is about exploring your opinion of assessing reproductive genetic risk before pregnancy. Identifying women and partners at reproductive risk of having children with genetic conditions is important information for Genera l Practitioners. Assessing genetic risk before pregnancy includes exploring family history and ethnicity and genetic carrier testing.
