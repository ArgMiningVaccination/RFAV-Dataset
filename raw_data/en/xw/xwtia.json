The decision has been made on the basis of short -term efficacy and safety data. Continued approval of this indication depends on the efficacy and safety data from ongoing clinical trials and post -market assessment. Paxlovid\u00ae is not intended to b e used as a substitute for vaccination again COVID -19.The National Clinical Evidence Taskforce provides a conditional recommendation for use of Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir oral antiviral therapy within 5 days of symptom onset in unvaccinated adults with COVID -19 who do not require oxygen and who have one or more risk factors for disease progression. This recommendation is based on the recently NEJM published trial Oral Nirmatrelvir for High -Risk, Non -hospitalised Adults with COVID -19 which is a single Phase 2/3, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in non - hospitalised symptomatic adult participants with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection, comparing nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir with placebo in 2246 unvaccinated adults with PCR -confirmed COVID -19 and mild illness. Within this trial participants were treated with oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 30 0 mg/100 mg twice daily for 5 days. As per the PBS Listing , adults (18 years and over) are eligible for treatment if the patient: has received a positive PCR or RAT result; AND has at least one sign or symptom* attributable to mild to moderate COVID -19 (i.e. do not require oxygen) and do not require hospitalization at the time of prescribing; AND is within five (5)* days of symptom onset; AND is aged 70 years or older* is aged 50 years of age or older, with at least one additional risk factor for developing severe disease is aged 30 years of age or older, identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, with one additional risk factors for developing severe disease; and is aged 18 years of age or older, with moderate to severe immunocompromise had a past COVID -19 infection episode resulting in hospitalisation *As of 11th July 2022, asymptomatic patients aged 70 years or over are eligible fo r treatment after a positive test. Where a RAT is used to confirm diagnosis, available information about the test result, testing date, location and test provider (where relevant) should be recorded on the patient record. The National Clinical Evidence Taskforce has provided conditional recommendation for Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir on the 9 May 2022 to include people older than 12 years old, weighing more than 40 kg, who have mild to moderate COVID -19, and who are at high risk of progression to severe symptoms, hospital admission, or death. (As per Paxlovid\u00ae FDA Fact Sheet for Health Professionals ) This m edication is also available via the National Medical Stockpile (NMS) for cases where a prescriber considers treatment is clinically indicated but the patient is not eligible under the PBS . Access to NMS stock requires referral to a n Infectious Disease Physician if patient is not treated within a WA public hospital. Ongoing supply of COVID -19 therapeutics via the NMS is uncertain and availability is expected to fluctuate with demand and constraints in the supply chain. To ensure equi ty of access and conserve Paxlovid\u00ae therapy for those patients at the highest risk of disease progression, a tiered access criterion is in place to allocate stock taking into account current supply. This guideline should be used in conjunction with the Pax lovid\u00ae resources available: Paxlovid\u00ae Patient Consent Form and further infor regarding consent, and Paxlovid \u00ae Patient Information Leaflet . WA Health Paxlovid Patient Information Leaflet 2 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Drug Class1,2: Nirmatrelvir is a SARS maintain nirmatrelvir plasma levels during treatment . Ritonavir alone has no activity against SARS -CoV-2 Clinical Criteria : Within the patient population for which nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) is recommended for use, decisions about the appropriateness of treatment should be based on the patient's individual risk of severe disease on the basis of age and multiple ris k factors .COVID -19 vaccination status and time since vaccination. As per the PBS eligibility criteria , adults (18 years and over) are eligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) if the patient: has received a positive PCR or RAT result; AND has at least one sign or symptom * attributable to mild to moderate COVID -19 (i.e. do not require oxygen) and do not require hospitali sation at the time of prescribing; AND is within five (5) * days of symptom onset; AND is aged 70 years or older* is aged 50 years of age or older, with at least one additional risk factor for developing severe disease is aged 30 years of age or older, identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, with one additional risk factors for developing severe disease; and is aged 18 years of age or older, with moderate to severe immunocompromise had a past COVID -19 infection episode resulting in hospitalisation *As of 11th July 2022, asymptomatic patients aged 70 years or over are eligible for treatment after a positive test. Where a RAT is used to confirm diagnosis, available information about the test result, testing date, location and test provider (where relevant) sho uld be recorded on the patient record. The following is a list of risk factors (conditions) contributing to the PBS definition of high risk for development of severe disease : The patient is in residential aged care, The patient has disability with multiple comorbidities and/or fragility Neurological conditions, including stroke and dementia, and demyelinating conditions e.g. multiple sclerosis, Guillain -Barre Syndrome Respiratory compromise, including COPD, moderate or severe asthma (required inhale d steroids), and bronchiectasis, or caused by neurological or musculoskeletal disease, Heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies Obesity (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2) Diabetes Types I and II, requiring medication for glycaemic control Renal fa ilure (eGFR less than 60mL/min), Cirrhosis, or 3 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health The patient has reduced, or lack of, access to higher level healthcare and lives in an area of geographic remoteness classified by the Modified Monash Model as Category 5 or above. For the purpose of PBS eligibility, \"moderately to severely immunocompromise\" patients are those with: 1. Any ot plasma cell disorders, b. Post-transplant: solid organ (on immunosuppressive therapy), haematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 24 months), c. Immunocompromised due to primary or acquired (HIV/AIDS) immunodeficiency; OR 2. Any significantly immunocomprom ising condition(s) where, in the last 3 months the patient has received: a. Chemotherapy or whole body radiotherapy, b. High-dose corticosteroids (at least 20 mg of prednisone per day, or equivalent) for at least 14 days in a month, or pulse corticosteroid thera py, c. Biological agents and other treatments that deplete or inhibit B cell or T cell function (abatacept, anti -CD20 antibodies, BTK inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, sphingosine 1 - phosphate receptor modulators, anti -CD52 antibodies, anti -complement antibodies, anti - thymocyte globulin), d. Selected conventional synthetic disease -modifying anti (csDMARDs) orambucil), and systemic calcineurin (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus); OR 3. Any significantly immunocompromising condition(s) where, in the last 12 months the patient has received an anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment, but criterion 2c abov e is not met; OR 4. Others with very high -risk conditions including Down Syndrome, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease, thalassemia, sickle cell disease and other haemoglobinopathies; OR 5. People with disability with multiple comorbidities and/or f railty. For patients not meeting PBS eligibility the National Clinical Evidence Taskforce Guidelines , people older than 12 years old, weighing more than 40 kg, who have mild to moderate COVID - 19, and who are at high risk of progression to severe symptoms, hospital admission, or death. are eligible for Paxlovid\u00ae if they are : Unvaccinated within five (5) days of symptom onset; AND who have mild to moderate COVID -19 disease (i.e. do not require oxygen ); AND who have one or more of the following risk factors for disease progression; Adults: 4 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Based on the population included within the trial, evidence demonstrates a reduction in hospitalisation when used in individuals with one or more of the following risk factors for disease progression: Age 60 years Diabetes (requiring medication) BMI 25 kg/m2 Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Chronic lung disease There were insufficient numbers of participants with the following risk factors to determine the extent to which nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir impacts hospitalisation or death, however as these conditions frequently result in poorer outcomes for patients following SARS -CoV-2 infection, they will likely benefit from treatment: Chronic kidney disease (where the eGFR 30 mL/min ute, dose adjust ment is required 30-60mL/min) Immunosuppressed (e.g. bone marrow or organ transplantation, primary immune deficiencies, prolonged use of immune -weakening medications) Medical related technological dependence (e.g. CPAP not related to COVID -19) HIV positive (viral load < 400 copies/mL) Neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy, Down syndrome) Cancer (other than localised skin cancer) Sickle cell disease Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients > 35 years old. Immunocompromised or multiple risk factors In addition to at -risk unvaccinated adults, also consider using nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset in adults with COVID -19 who do not require oxygen AND : are immunosuppressed or not immunocompetent regardless of vaccination status; OR have received one or two doses of vaccine and who are at high risk of severe disease on the basis of age and multiple risk factors. There is no evidence evaluating the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir in partially or fully vaccinated patients. Given this and the lower risk of deterioration in these patients, it is unlikely that nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir will be particularly valuable in patients who have received three doses of vaccine, unless the patient is immunosuppresse d. 5 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir in immunosuppressed patients. However, given the likely higher risk of deterioration in these patients, and the absence of reasons to believe otherwise, it is likely that nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir will be beneficial for immunosuppressed patients . Severe i mmunocompromising conditions include : Patients who are within 1 year of receiving B -cell depleting therapies antigen receptor T cell recipients Post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who have chronic graft versus host disease or who are taking immunosuppressive medications for another indicati on Patients with hematologic malignancies who are on active therapy Lung transplant recipients Patients who are within 1 year of receiving a solid -organ transplant (other than lung transplant) or haematopoietic stem cell transplant Solid -organ transplant r ecipients with recent treatment for acute rejection with T or B cell depleting agents Patients with certain primary immunodeficiencies o PIDs affecting cellular and humoral immunity (severe and combined immunodeficiencies ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875 -019-00737 -x ) o PIDs with profoundly decreased or absent B cell number or function o PIDs with impaired interferon responses Patients with untreated HIV who have a CD4 T ly mphocyte cell count <50 cells/mm3 Patients on any of the following agents not already listed o Anti-CD20 antibodies alemtuzumab o Anti-complement antibodies eculizumab o Anti-thymocyte globulin 6 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Contraindications: Hypersensitivity: Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to , or Severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C) Drug interactions that are associated with serious and/or life -threatening reactions and interactions that result in decrease in nirmatrelvir + ritonavir concentrations which may cause loss of virologic response and possibl e resistance. Table 1: Medicinal products that are contraindicated or not recommended for concomitant use with P axlovid\u00ae Class of Medication Medicinal products within class Interactions that result in an increase or decrease in concentrations of concomitant medicine Alpha | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Interactions that result in decrease in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir concentrations with associated potential loss of virologic response and ) Special Warnings and Precautions for Use : Hepatotoxicity - Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Paxlovid\u00ae to patients with pre -existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis . Moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60mL/min) - Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients. In patients with moderate renal impairment the d ose of nirmatrelvir should be reduced from 300mg twice daily to 150mg twice daily (see 'Dose' section below) . Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30mL/min) - Use with caution. Appropriate dosage for patients with eGFR <30mL/min has not yet been determined by manufacturer. Dose in severe renal impairment has been calculated from pharmacokinetics but use with great caution as very little information available.10 (see 'Dose' section below) Pregnancy and breastfeeding: nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir is pregnancy category B 31. Paxlovid\u00ae is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. There are no human studies of the effects of Paxlovid\u00ae during pregnancy and w omen of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment and for at least 7 days after stopping Paxlovid\u00ae. There are also no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects o n the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breast feeding should be discontinued during treatment and f or 7 days after the last dose of Paxlovid\u00ae. Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has not been established in children <12 years of age or weighing <40 kg. 8 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Drug Interactions: Paxlovid\u00ae is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that are extensively metabolised by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptibl e to large increases in exposure when co -administered with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Thus, co - administration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with medicinal products highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life - threatening events is contraindicated. (See Table 1) See Appendix 1 for list of potentially significant drug interact ions with other medicines. This list also includes drug combination s that are not absolute contraindicat ions but require consideration. The University of Liverpool COVID -19 Drug Interactions checker can also be used to check for specific interactions between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and other medications/medication classes. https://www.covid19 -druginteractions.org/checker Presentation and Storage: Store below 25\u00b0C. Nirmatrelvir are oval, pink immediate -release, film -coated tablets debossed with \"PFE\" on one side and \"3CL\" on the other side. Ritonavir Ritonavir tablets are white to off -white coated, oval tablets marked with the Abbott logo and \"NK\". 9 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Dose: Nirmatrelvir must be taken together with ritonavir. Failure to correctly take nirmatrelvir with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of nirmatrelvir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed. The recommended dosage is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days. No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with either mild (Child -Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child -Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment in moderate renal failure (30 to <60 mL/min) In patients with moderate renal impairment, the dose should be reduced to nirmatrelvir + ritonavir 150mg/100 mg (one 150mg tablet and one 100mg tablet) every 12 hours for 5 days to avoid increased toxicity due to over -exposure (this dose adjustment has not been clinically tested). eGFR Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) Dose Greater than 60 mL/min ute (Normal renal function or mild renal impairment) 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one tablet) , taken twice daily for 5 days 30 to < 60 mL/min ute (Moderate renal impairment) 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one tablet ) with 100 mg ritonavir (one tablet) , taken twice daily for 5 days < 30mL/min ute (Severe renal impairment) Day 1: 300 mg nirmatrelvir ( two tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir ( one tablet) orally, ONCE daily. Day 2 to 5: 150 mg nirmatrelvir ( one tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir ( one tablet) orally, ONCE daily10,11 As a healthcare provider, you should: Determine the appropriate Paxlovid\u00ae dose for your patient Specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) in the Paxlovid\u00ae prescription Counsel patients with moderate or severe renal impairment about renal dosing instructions and inform them that the blister cards will be altered by the pharmacist to remove unneeded tablets 10 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health Adverse Effects1: It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse effects of Paxlovid\u00ae and signs and symptoms of COVID -19. Adverse effects related to clinical hepatitis and jaundice Refer to the product information for a complete list of possible adverse effects. Reporting of Adverse Effects : As Paxlovid\u00ae is a TGA provisionally approved medicine which has no relevant post -marketing data, it is important to document and report all (from possible to confirmed) adverse effects experienced by the patient during treatment to inform its safety profile and future use. Healthcare professionals should report any suspected adverse events to the TGA at http://www.tga.gov.au/reporting -problems . The prescribing clinician and any health professional administering nirma trelvir/ritonavir is responsible for reporting medication errors and adverse events related to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment . Any clinical incidents related to treatment with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) that occur within the WA public healt h system should also be notified into the Datix CIMS and investigated appropriately. 11 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health APPENDIX 1: Established and potentially significant interactions with other medicines1,6 Paxlovid\u00ae is an inhibitor of a glycoprotein (PGP) and organic anion (OAT) transporters, which may increase plasma concentrations of drugs metabolised by these pathways. Paxlovid\u00ae is also an inducer of a range of CYP enzymes which may reduce plasma concentrations of drugs metabolised by these pathways. In addition to this, Paxlovid\u00ae is itself a substrate of CYP3A, 2D6 and PGP so the concentration of Paxlovid\u00ae can be impacted by other medicines that are inhibito rs/inducers. Interactions can be checked using the Liverpool website (link below). These interactions may lead to: Clinically significant adverse reactions, including fatal events, from greater exposures of concomitant medications. Loss of therapeutic effe ct of Paxlovid\u00ae and possible viral resistance from decreased antiviral exposures. As a healthcare provider, you should: Inform patients that Paxlovid\u00ae may interact with medications and is contraindicated for use with some medications . Obtain a complete medication list from your patient (including non -prescription drugs and herbals) . Check for clinically significant drug interactions before prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae). Based on the drug interactions identified , decide if: Paxlovid\u00ae use is appropriate versus an alternative authori sed treatment If appropriate, whether your patient should hold, change, or reduce the dose of other medications while taking Paxlovid\u00ae or if additional monitoring may be needed .

Alternative corticosteroids including beclomethasone and prednisolone should be considered. Nirmatrelvir + ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation affinity for P -glycoprotein (P -gp) a nd may inhibit this transporter. and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. This increases the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and may result in decreased systemic e xposure to such medicinal products. This could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect. Co-administration of other CYP3A4 substrates that may lead to potentially significant drug interactions should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks . 20 | P a g e Version 9 June 2023 Medicines and Technology Unit, Department of Health References: 1.
