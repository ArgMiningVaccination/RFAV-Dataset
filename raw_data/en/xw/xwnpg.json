He was educated at The University of Melbourne and completed his PhD with Professor Bruce E. Kemp, St Vincent's Institute, Melbourne, before pursuing post-doctoral training with Professor Nicholas K. Tonks, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY. He established an independent laboratory at Monash University in 2000. He is a National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Principal Research Fellow and an Editor for FEBS Journal and Molecular & Cellular Biology. In addition to his Adjunct position at Yale University, Professor Tiganis holds joint appointments at Monash University's Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia and currently heads the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute Metabolism, Diabetes and Obesity Program and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Cancer Metabolism Program. His laboratories are focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of obesity and diabetes and determining how obesity and metabolism affect tumour cells and the immune system to promote the development of cancer. Professor Tiganis' laboratory takes an integrative approach that stems the fields of metabolism, immunology and cancer to address fundamental questions in biology and disease. "}
