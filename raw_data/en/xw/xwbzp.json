What is the difference between food allergies and food intolerances? - Elaine - Food intolerances, such as [lactose intolerance](/en/parents/lactose.html)and [celiac disease](/en/parents/celiac-disease.html), can make someone feel ill. - Food allergies also can make someone feel ill. But some some also can cause a [life-threatening reaction](/en/parents/anaphylaxis.html)(called anaphylaxis). A food intolerance means either the body can't properly digest the food that is eaten, or that a particular food might irritate the digestive system. Symptoms of food intolerance can include nausea, gas, cramps, belly pain, diarrhea, irritability, or headaches. A food allergy happens when the body's immune system, which normally fights infections, sees the food as an invader. This leads to an allergic reaction \u2014 an immune system response in which chemicals like histamine are released in the body. The reaction can cause symptoms like [hives](/en/parents/hives.html), vomiting, belly pain, throat tightness, hoarseness, coughing, breathing problems, or a drop in blood pressure. Even if previous reactions have been mild, someone with a food allergy is always at risk for the next reaction being life-threatening. Eating a microscopic amount of the food could lead to anaphylaxis. So anyone with a food allergy must avoid the problem food(s) entirely and always carry emergency injectable epinephrine. People with food sensitivities, on the other hand, might be able to ingest a small amount of the bothersome food without a problem. "}
