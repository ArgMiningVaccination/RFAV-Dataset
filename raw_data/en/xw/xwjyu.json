Reduce coffee intake. Reduce your intake of media stories and social media, Eat unprocessed foods and lots of organic vegetables and finally try some therapy. Whatever you feel drawn too; hypnotherapy, cranial sacral etc. Make sure to go for a walk and get some vitamin D. And consider good talk therapy if that appeals. With this the connection between you and your therapist is paramount. Slowing down and having the opportunity to tell your story in your own way can be very healing for some people. It is quiet different then being told what to do, or talked at....Feel free to check out my page. And be gentle with yourself. I would also recommend to meditate. Start with 1-2 min per day and increase up to 20 min. The best is to obtain these nutrients from your diet, I have expected that it is important to address anxiety from different perspectives, clean eating is one and looking into patterns that you might be perpetuating definitely helps. For example looking into the archetypes and see which one you resonate the most with right now. Also I would take a look in the environment, the people you surrender yourself with, how do you feel about yourself? What do you feed your eyes, ears and mouth are very important too... how big are you on self care? Have you tried floral essences ? Are you sleeping enough? Do you have obvious reasons to be anxious?

Start with 1-2 min per day and increase up to 20 min. I hate to recommend supplements if there is a whole food option. Try a clean and whole food diet that focuses on a more plant based concept. That doesn't necessarily mean vegetarian or vegan. Just less meat and when you do eat meat make sure it's of good quality. Also, anxiety can also be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. Try adding spirulina and barley green powder to your diet. Meditation and breathing techniques are also a huge factor in managing anxiety. Anxiety management can take continued work but can be managed with many different avenues. I would recommend to get to the root cause of the anxiety.Whether it is emotional/physical/spiritual/ inherited and any or combination of the ones mentioned Even though you may never know the root cause-I can help you identify when it got started. There are many methods for working toward this. Emotion Code and Body Code is just one. If it is physical then there may need to be other interventions such as diet change, perhaps even some supplements --for example--if your body is reacting to substances --it could be creating imbalances that are leading to anxiety etc. My personal and professional opinion is that supplements are not the first option. For those who do experience anxiety --after we've identified the root cause --some of the supplements I've suggested are: GABA, Passion Flower, Valerian, and or Rhodiola. (Note: through testing your body tells me what supplements would be best for you.) Anxiety emerges in so many forms. What works for me one day may not anther. I have been exploring the use of L-Theanine. Ashwaganda actually made me feel worse while natural Gaba supported me in moving through my day with clarity and calm. Breathwork (alternative nostril yoga breathing) is also an excellent technique to unify the right and left side of the brain. I think a holistic approach to anxiety is vital. As others have stated, looking at physical factors such as diet, exercise, nutritional imbalance and the like are important. I agree that psychological factors, such as looking at one's anxious thoughts and reframing them, is also key. As an occupational therapist, I would add: How do you feel about, and think about, your overall life daily activities? Are you satisfied with your life? Are your activities and interactions meaningful, purposeful and fulfilling? If one is not feeling confident, inspired and connected emotionally and socially to others, that can lead to significant underlying anxiety, as well. I believe a holistic exploration of all these issues is a key to uncovering possible multiple factors. Thus, your approach to improvement might entail various modalities, working synergistically. I would suggest that you take a look at the cause of anxiety -sometimes it can be physical --for example I had a client who had extreme anxiety and I discovered that her thyroid was out of balance. Another client it was stress in his life. Another client it was an intake of too much caffeine in product she was using. There are many natural supplements that will help --but looking at the long term solution-means finding the root cause. Feel free to contact me via my profile here --or via my website.
