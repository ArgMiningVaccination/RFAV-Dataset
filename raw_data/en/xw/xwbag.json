ABOUT TERESA SIENKIEWICZ New Body \u2014 New Mind was founded by Teresa Sienkiewicz. Born and raised in Poland, Teresa studied bioengineering, music, and theater in college. She later received graduate degrees in theoretical physics, education, and music. In 1988, she moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to attend the New England Conservatory of Music. After graduating, Teresa performed as a musician and also began working at Harvard University as a researcher in mathematics education. Even though Teresa was successful in both careers, she realized that neither science nor music fulfilled her need to help others in a tangible way. In 1994 Teresa enrolled in the physical therapy program at Simmons Graduate School of Health Sciences in Boston and earned the degree of Masters of Science in Physical Therapy in 1997. That's when her clinical journey began. SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT 617-969-8995 ALL INITIAL APPOINTMENTS ARE SCHEDULED BY PHONE To request an appointment please call 617-969-8995 and leave us a message.
