You may be affected by seasonal depression if you find yourself cycling through your emotions as the seasons change. What is often simply considered the \"winter blues\" might actually be a form of depression. Seasonal Affective Disorder is often connected to the lack of sunlight as it affects our biological clock (circadian rhythm). It can affect children, adolescents and adults. Similar to other forms of depression it can be hereditary. Most people who are affected by SAD begin having symptoms in the fall and start of winter and fade away in the summer. Some people may also have some depressive episodes during spring or early summer. Symptoms may begin mild and become more severe as the months proceed. Symptoms of season affective disorder include having low energy, feeling depressed daily and for a large duration of the day, losing interest in activities and hobbies, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating and a general feeling of sluggishness, hopelessness or agitation. Symptoms specific to winter depression include lack of energy, oversleeping, weight gain, and changes in appetite, including cravings for food high in carbohydrates. It is normal to have bad days and feel down for moments at a time, however if you are regularly experiencing any of these symptoms it is important to seek naturopathic help. In some cases, SAD can also be linked to underlying physical health problems. In order for our naturopathic doctor to properly diagnose your condition, an assessment may include physical examination and appropriate laboratory testing. As with other types of depression signs of seasonal affective disorder should be taken seriously. These symptoms may become worse or lead to other complications such as social withdrawal, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts and behaviours and other mental health disorders such as anxiety or eating disorders. You may be affected by SAD for multiple reasons and naturopathic treatments offered at our clinic offers you a chance to find the true causes of these symptoms and aid in healing without the use of life long harsh medications that may cause side effects.

Also known as phototherapy, it is one of the most common natural treatments used for seasonal affective disorder. It involves sitting a few feet from a special light box so that you're exposed to bright artificial light within the first hour of waking up each day. The light box is used to mimic natural light which will support healthy brain chemistry linked to mood. This form of treatment can be very effective for SAD under the care of a health care professional.

[Eczema](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/eczema/eczema-overview.html) or atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry skin. It is common in children but can occur at any age and it can negatively impact quality of life. Living with eczema can be downright challenging sometimes. For example; stress and anxiety are one of the many triggers that causes inflammation which in turn can cause more stress and anxiety, making it a very difficult cycle to break. With all of the itching, aggravation and redness, eczema can be very uncomfortable and cause worrying but it doesn't have to take over your life. There are many natural methods available to prevent flare-ups, deal with symptoms and help you live comfortably. Eczema is frequently seen in infants or children and often clears up by the age of six, however it may also persist into adolescence and adulthood. For most adults' flare-ups occur periodically thus making it a chronic condition but there are cases where it can clear up for years and come back. Any region of the body can be affected by eczema. Commonly it is found on the sensitive skin in the bends of the arms and legs as well as on the face, eyelids, neck, wrists and ankles. In infants the eczema flare-ups typically occur on the forehead, cheeks, scalp, neck, forearms, and legs. Eczema often recurs in the same affected areas, but it can migrate to various parts of the body and just as one patch may clear up another may develop. It is not a contagious condition and there is no exact cause for it, but years of study show that for most types of eczema it is related to a combination of genes and triggers. People with eczema tend to have a highly reactive immune system that when triggered by specific substances such as food and environmental allergens causes inflammation. Inflammation is the body's natural reaction to triggers which then causes the raw, dry and itchy sensitive skin. These \"triggers\" include stress, asthma, hay fever, dry skin, environmental or food allergies, climate, certain drugs and irritants such as metals, detergents, fabrics, lotions etc. Eczema may also be caused by and/or worsened by digestive disorders, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acid deficiencies, celiac disease and certain physical or psychological disorders. There are various types of eczema as \"eczema\" is the general term applied to many persistent skin conditions. Eczema can be hereditary. Healthy skin has the ability to retain moisture and protect you from bacteria and irritants. Some eczema is related to a genetic variation that affects the skin's ability to perform its protective role. A common type of eczema is allergic contact dermatitis caused by allergens and often leads to long-term inflammation. Similarly, there is irritant contact dermatitis which is a direct result to an irritant such as soap, yet this is quite curable by avoiding the cause. Seborrheic dermatitis mainly affects the scalp and presents as dandruff, dry skin with red lesions and large silvery scales which may be traced to the less common psoriasis of the scalp. In infants this dermatitis is known as \"cradle cap\". Symptoms of eczema can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. It appears as patches of dry, rough and itchy skin, often becoming red, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, and welling. In more severe conditions these areas may bleed or ooze. Scratching of these rashes and raised bumps will worsen these symptoms and may cause pain. The chronic itch and scratch cycle that is very common with eczema leads to further complications of the ailment such as neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus), where long-term scratching and irritation of these patches can cause the dry skin to thicken, become scaly and have a texture similar to that of leather. Discoloration may also occur. You should seek immediate medical attention for you, or your child develop a skin infection - look for red streaks, yellow scabbing and pus. Eczema can become very disruptive for some people. The constant flare-ups can become so uncomfortable that it may affect daily activities and sleep. Listed below are some naturopathic tips to prevent eczema, dry skin and flare-ups: Understanding your skin and how it reacts to environmental substances and what you put inside your body is important in order to prevent flare-ups and damage to your skin. Eczema is a chronic condition that requires chronic care. Living with eczema can be difficult for many but it does not have to hinder you and your lifestyle. Our naturopathic doctor has a lot of experience in [treating eczema with natural and effective remedies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/eczema/naturopathic-approach-to-treating-eczema.html).

[Osteoarthritis](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/arthritis/toronto-arthritis-centre.html) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is a progressive disease that is often seen in middle-age to elderly people for both men and women. Osteoarthritis is an ailment that occurs from the when the cartilage between joints becomes worn down. It could be developed from other joint malfunctions or complications. In the human body the regions where two bones connect is called a joint. The ends of these bones are covered with protective tissue called cartilage, it holds the joint together and connects muscle to bone. Cartilage is a tough, firm, rubbery and slippery tissue that's flexible and softer than bone. Healthy cartilage allows nearly friction-less joint motion as the bones can glide over one another, while the cartilage absorbs energy from the physical movement. Osteoarthritis is referred to as a \"wear and tear\" disease that affects the whole joint as well as cartilage. It occurs gradually as this cushioning substance deteriorates. When the cartilage in the joints wears down over time the bone surfaces become pitted and rough and when completely broken-down causes bone to rub on bone. This can cause pain within the joint, irritation in surrounding tissues, and inflammation of the joint lining. This disorder most commonly affects joints in your hands, knees, hips and spine but it can affect other joints in the body. Symptoms tend to develop slowly and worsen over time. The first signs of arthritis are a frequent cracking and stiffness of joints often experienced in the morning. Other common signs and symptoms include: [The cause of osteoarthritis](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/arthritis/symptoms-of-arthritis.html) is unknown, but it is often associated with aging. Over-worked joints can also result in arthritis later in life (often seen in athletes). Equally metabolic, genetic, chemical, and mechanical factors can play a role in its development. There are a few risk factors that also lead to the cause of Osteoarthritis, for example: Damaged cartilage can't repair itself because cartilage doesn't contain any blood vessels. An over consumption of foods that cause inflammation in the body will make the symptoms of osteoarthritis worse in general. Yearly naturopathic physical examinations are important because health care professionals will check your affected joint for tenderness, swelling, redness and flexibility. Catching this ailment earlier on can help prevent some further damage and manage symptoms better, however, osteoarthritis cannot be reversed. [Naturopathic Medicine](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/naturopathic-medicine-overview.html) can help prevent osteoarthritis, and also help with pain management, improve range of motion of joints and improve mobility of joints once the [diagnosis of osteoarthritis](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/arthritis/diagnostic-testing-and-treatment-of-osteoarthritis.html) is made. Naturopathic Medicine is also very effective for treating inflammation in the body and the joints. Lifestyle changes, dietary changes, exercise and yoga, movement therapies, hydrotherapy, acupuncture and assistive devices are all incredibly helpful in managing osteoarthritis.
