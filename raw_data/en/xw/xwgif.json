By anticipating future trends, worksite health promotion planners will better meet the needs of individuals and society as a whole and will ensure a permanent place for wellness. What can we expect in the latter part of the 1990s? The following trends are for worksite health promotion: 1, Preventive mental health. We've always searched for ways to cnhance our mental well-being, with encounter groups in the 1960s, assertiveness training in the 70s. stress management in thc'80s. and self-esteem enhancc ment in thc 9f\\.

Assertiveness training, stress managcmcnt. and self esteem enhancement all have been suc\u20acessfully taught in this manner. Look for classes on other mental heakh issues such as clinical depression (WELCOA'S resource Downtime offers worksite training advice), anorexia, and phobias. A great dealofresearch is taking place in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. which looks at the relationship between our mental state and our ability to fight disease. In other words, can you make yourselfsick? Or well? And can altemative medicines made a differ- ence?

Spidtuel wellness\" Just as we witness wellness managers turning their ener- gies toward improving the mind. we can expect in the next dccade an increased exploration of the spirit. Spiritual issucs explore the consistency bctween behavior and values, nlomls or religious beliefs, and encouruge activi- ties ihat provide lile with meaning and purpose. More and more people today feel alienated-spiritual wellness can help people feel connected. EDrra,R's NorE: A Don R. Powell, PhD, president, Amerkan Institute Jbt PrcrentiNe Medicine.

A few arguments against a wcllncss rebate or sk rating program arc that such a program is victim blaming.

HEALTH\\, WE ALTH\\ & WrsEOnce you have a preliminary list of foui or five themes. ask people to choosc the words and storics that best fit the language of the cultuie. Using these techniques, some organiza- tions have adopted highly innovativc value sets that match the organization's vision. Conoco's health promotion program. for example. is organizing its efforls around healthy plcasure and self-understanding (for follow-up: see Conoco). TheYMCA strives to work with the whole person mind. body. and spirit. Core program values such as these provide necdcd dircction lbr cullure change.

Therefore. employees should always work latc and not takc breaks. A caution about organizational support: lf only one factor is changcd without attcnd ing 1o the others. unforeseen and fre- quently undesired consequences can result. For example, if the CEO is the onlyjogger. the CEO may beconle isolated from others. lf smoking is confronted without providing smoking cessation classes, smokers may quit the company before quitting smoking.

A shared vision: When people have a sharcd vision, they arc cnthusiastic about the organization's goals and havc a com mon view about how to achieve them. When no sharcd vision cxists, people approachcs with thosc of thc organization, program, or projcct. This is particularly important in hcalth promotion bccausc people are working with a and organiza- tional floals. 62A positive culture: In a positive culture, people look for opportunities rathei than obstacles and for strengths rather than weaknesses in one another. In health promotion. it is our strengths, not our weaknesses, that cnablc us to move for- A positive culture plays an important role in health promotion programs.

How many retumed questionnaires are enough? AT&T experienced a 62 of 14 percent, thereby increasing the reliability of the results. (AT&T even speculated about those who did not respond, saying they may have some attitudinal differences from those who responded or were less exposed to health messages at work.) So far, the Health Audit has been used for three purposes. First, the data are summarized in a writtcn reporl. Groups are compared against the company norms. and individual health issues for work groups are identified. The TLCI staff usc the information 1() plan programs with top management and with the employee leadership commiltec. Recommendations are thcn based on responses to the Health Audit. Hcrc are some recommendations that cvolvcd frorr the Health Audit: . Worl wilh the food services rcnrlor t improve the availability of healthy foods offered at the worksite. during company functions, and in the vending machines, . Deliver a cancer awareness program that covers the recommendations for screening and the skills necessary for both sexes to practice self-examination for canc\u20acr, . Maintain a constant health prcscncc in organization publications and other media to reinforce the company's commitment to employee well-being. Second, health information is viewed as a process rather than an event. By readministering the Health Audit, staff can determine if the process is on track andwhat changes or additions are needed to meel lhe organization s objeclives. Hor often to give the survey? Usually every one to two yea$. Third. the Health Audit data provide important inlormation to the company for lolg-term planning of employee risk management.

Whrt Do the Results Mean?

Baun Needs assessments are designed to provide information about the employees' health needs, interests, and preferred scheduling. Tn [acr. one of rhe [ir\\r stcp. in designing a successful health promotion program is to pcrform a needs assessment. These asscssments will help answer two important questions that must be ad- dressed in the planning process: . What wellness topics and activities are the employees and their families interested in? . What are the health pnctices and needs of the employee population? The first qucstion addresses the interest of lhe polenlial f'arlicildnts and is impor - tant because dilferent wellness lonics hased on probablc partici- pation. The second question provides a picture of the health pructices of the population and helps decide potential program priority by need. What cmployees wrnt and what employees n\u20aced may be two far different pr{)grams! tsy linking these two importanl pieccs of information, the promotion man ag<r can drcrJ( whar pro8ramr anJ hctiv' ties should be offered. By tollowing a needs assessmenl process, you will increase the probability ol your program being successful. William B.

He has worked at helping others understand this concept ewr since.Employee interest surveys are important tor many reasons: . They are a geat way to get employces excited about the potenlialofa wellness prugram. . They provide employees a way to build ownership for the program. . They help provide initial infomation necessary for the design ofthe program. . Th() can ofa . 'l-hey have educational value for the respondents. . They provide information which can be uscd to cvaluate impact ofthe piogram. Many companies dcsign their own interesl surveys to fit specific company needs or to answer managemenl questlons or concerns. You can design your own survey or use one of the sufveys presentcd herc. How dctailed the questionndrre nccds intor- mation rcquircd by therefore. it is imporlant to your short but tailor you should try lbr morc. lncrease your return rates by having a bonus (low-cost pam- phlets, headbands) for each person who Llropr J into a hox .rr a granJ priuc drawing fbr a more substantial prize (day off with pay, T shirt, gym bag, dinner ior two). Othcr stratcgics to increase survey participation would be to distribute the survey in the company newslcttcr (have remote sites tally their surveys and fax their results to you). or usc it as a payroll stuffer. Many companies have electronic bulletin boards which arc wcll dcsigned for short sulveys. '74He,llrnv, em- ployee interest survey: . Design the survey so the results can be easily tallied lo provide the necessaD feedback to the committee, manage- ment, and the employees. . Write the questions in a professional tone that is sensitive to other issues currently affecting the workforce. . Explain to employees clearly who is asking for the information and what it will be used for. These t)?es ofsurveys generally come from the health promo- tion mmmittee with a cover letter from the CEO or other top manager. . Be specific about where to ietum the suney and set a deadline for returns. lt is easy to design a survey that is preaddressed and needs only to be folded, stapled, and placed in interofhce marl- . Provide a variety of different wellness options. Ask employees to mnk them. Ihis will help 'oLr pul umploy(( inlcr- ests in order of priority. . Within each wellness option provide d list of realistic program delivcry methods. . Have solne open-ended sections that will allow employees to provide \"other suggestions. \" . Ask for specific information on the best times and days to hold programs. Ask which locations are the most convenienr too. . Collect basic demographic information (age, gender,job category) in your survey. Then you'll know who re- sponded to your survey and will help you make more info.med programming decisions. . Always thank the respondents for mmpleting and sending the survey. . Always test the survey with a small goup of employees. Review their answe$ and ask them what they would do to improve the survey. Revise the survey and distdbute to your workforce.Provide feedback to the workforce on the results of the survey as soon as possible. This will help build momen- tum for the progmm and serve as an excellent rnarketing tool. Continually link the sufley results with specific program announcements to build support for progam design and participation. For example: T,lre\"holiday weight challenge\" was designed for the 83 percent of the workforce that wante.l to stop oveleating during the holidoys. L\u20actter lo Employees Your input is needed to help us determine your health and fitness- related interests, as well as your anticipated use ofthe Health and Fitness facility and the cafeteria in the new employee centcr, As your Hcalth and Fitness Commit- tee, oul task is to work with the prolessional slaff in providing initial and continuous planning and devel- opment for our new center and its programs. We will make certain that your interests, needs, and ideas are always considered. The reason for this communication is to \"kick-off' the process ofreceiving your input. . Enclosed is an employee center interest sur.r'ey, designed to be brief yet provide us enough information to start our program planning. lt will take only a few minutes to complete this suwey. . After mmpletion, please fold with the retum address on the outside, staple, and place in the interoffice mailby (date). Thanks for your help. We're looking forward to working with you on tle design of our program. The Employee Health and Fitness Committee HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WrsE'75Health Risk Appraisals The health practices and needs of the employees and their families is the second question that must be addressed in the assessment process. Health risk appraisals (HRAS) are instruments or questionnaires that have been designed to help employees dctc.mine their health risks. HRAS assume the user is hee from chronic illness such as heatt disease or cancer. HRAS also assist organizations in analyzing the health risk of the group. This dnalysis $ill provide a di\\tribution ot risk factors which can help identify health promotion areas of greatest potential gain for the organization. Health risk apprajsals are impoflant for many reasons: . They uscd them to health. . They hclp pcople makc heallhy lifestyle decisions and make appropriate usc ol medical services. . They provide a systematic approach tr) assessment of an organization's overall health risks. . Th( inlormati,\\n Sainrd cdn b( u.i(.j L design appropriate interycntion pro grams emphasizing modifiablc risk iacto$. A variety of different HRAs are on thc market, so i1 is important to pick one that lits your budget, inlormational and evalud- tive needs, and management's expecta- tions. Most HRAs use a computer system to analyze the questionnaires and provide the individual and group reports. There are fivc basic HRA types: L Mail-in mmputel-scoled: A nationr. vcndor furnishes questionnaires that you distribute and pick up from your workforce. The questionnaires are thensent to the vendor lbr analysis. The vendor retums the reports in a batch mailing or to each individual. 2. Computer-scored soltw|rc: You purchasc software from a vendor who allows you complete control of the HRA process (from distribution. through pickup, analysis. and individual report retum). 3. Computer-scored health lesh A na- tional vendor pcrforms on-site medical testing (blood pressurc, blood sugar, lipid screening, for example)and administen an HRA. The results from the test are mailed dircctly back to participants, and group summarics ar\u20ac provided to the health promotion manager. 4 Self-scored: An HRA instrument provides individuals a quick and casy way b self-assess and self-scorc thcir health. and testing)or Telephone Do cmployccs rcceive the a folm they can undcrstand. and are reconlmendations 1o appropriate health providers included when appropriate , . Whal mechanisms arc in placc to protecl the confidentiality of partici pantsl . Has the HRA been designed so that its scientific base fits your population in tcfms of types ofrisks. reading level. aod comprehension level? . What is the core database of thc instrument? HIALIHY, WDAI.TIIY & WISERemembefl Heallh sk appraisals are a tool to be uscd during the assessment process. But they should not become the onlv wcllness opportunity offered at the worksite to cmployccs and their families. The eltectiveness of HRAs is still bcing tested in the research lilerature, but fcw doubt their importance as a componcnt in an integrated health promolion program (for follow-up: see health risk appraisals discussed in other seclions; see indcx).. Many companies use the HRA process as a _health reporl card for the organi- zation and individual employee. Summarize Your Findings It is important to summarize the jnfor- mation collecled on both the interest survey and the HRA. Graphic representa tions of major findings can help provide a clear picture to managcment, to your health promotion committce, and to employecs. Don t Bel loo delailcd. bul use the major lindingslo builJ an approprirtc presentation for each audience. A sample report to management follows.

Each pro 98gram should also have one or more objec- tives to be able to monitor progress and results. Also pay attention to your own intended outcomes and your expectations for the group and their level of participation. For example. it doesn't take much group participation just to conduct an awareness session on the types and advantages of regular exercise. In this case, your ex- pected outcomes are minimal. and chances are you won't be able to measure them.

Meeting Wellness NeedJEducating: The lbur types of communication just described have a common goal ol \"selling'wellness to your audiencc.

A poor choice on your parl may rcsult in a loss of credibility with your audience. The purposes for communication are not mutually exclusive, Awareness is created with every communication you send, Messagcs dcsigncd to crcatc intcrcst also providc information and can educatc your audience. Awareness and informalion communications can indirectly recruit volunteels for your wellness committee and participants for your programs. As you concentrate on getting the word out about wcllncss, don't forget the nonvcrbal mcssagc you scnd by your actions, As you and your wellness commit- tee members become identified as spokes- persons for your wellness program, your actions may have more impact than your written or verbal communications. Be Hrelrnv. Wearruv & Wrsraware that you have to \"walk your talk\" to maintain your credibility and bc an effec. tive communicator for wellness. Know Your Audience To be able to predict the impact ofyour message, you first havc to gct to know your audience. This means being familiar with their personal backgrounds and experi- ences, the culturcs in which they live and work, and their lcvcl of interest and cur rent knowledgc about wellness. The more you know about vour audience, the better your chances are of designing eftective communtcattons. PeIsonal Characteristics: fhis includes everything from the basic demographic information of age, sex, race. education, and occupation to individual interests. opinions. expectations. and attitudes.

At the worksite, the most imporlant group in determining the accep tance or rejection of a communication is usually the individual's coworkers. lf participation in a weight management class is viewed as silly or incffcctive by a person's coworkers, it is unlikely that the person will attcnd the classes. even if he or she wants to lose weighL However. if a weight management program is presented as a team competition and teamwork isvalued by the work culture, the same individual may feel prcssurcd to partici' pate. Identification with a specific culture or group outsidc of work may carry even morc importancc in an individual's deci- sion or ability to acccpt and respond to a communication message. This may be family, church or other organizational affiliations, neighborhood or community or the ethnic gr-oup to which the individ;l belongs. Knowledge and Interest in Wellness: Find out how much your audicnce already knows about the information or subjcct of your communication. It's disastrous to oversimplily and talk down to your audi ence, and it's just as bad to present a message that s too complcx and goes right over their heads. In eilher case, the mcs sagc won't rcach your audience in the way vou intcnded and may alienate them. l)uring this stage of your planning process. takc the time t{) [ind out how intcrostcd your audicnce is in the subject ()f your message and what. if any, cxpericnce lhey have had wilh the subjecl in the past. If you find thal your audicnce places a high value ()n limily and childrcn, you may decide to skip the awareness stage of communication and go directly to an information message on parenting pro- grams you plan to offer. lf you discover that a prcvious program on parenling was not wcll rcccivcd, you may decide to pass on parcnting for now but still use the interest and focus on childrcn to ofler a class or selfcare lor children. Failure to identify and use knowledge and interest levels r!hen designing your communications can damage your credibil- ity with your audience before you even get your wellness programs otT the ground.

HEALIHY, WEALTHY & WrsE IUkeep in mind that with a complctc dcscrip tion, you have a better chance of develop- ing communications that will effectively reach them.

WEALTHY & WrsE 109To be effective, personal communication relies heavily on the communicator's credibility with the audience. The commu- nicator will be judged on his or her knowl- edge of the subject and of the audience. Rapport with the audience is also impor tant in this type of communication and may already havc been established through social networks. Rapport can also be established during a communication by thc ease with which a communicator addrcsses and inleracts with the audience. NonpcNonali Mass mcdia. printed materials. electronic messages. and dis- plays such as bulletin boards and posters arc all examples of this type of communica tion. Nonpersonal communication can also be cxtcnded to includc thc image you create for your wellness program.

You may receivc somc verbal feedback through inlormal grapcvine' channels, or you can include a rcqucst for feedback in your communication. If the requesl is easy to comply with and offers a \"rcward\" of some kind. you have an even better chance of oblaining some feedback. Conslrucling YouI Message The next step is to put what you want to say into words that will bc hcard and understood by your audience. The follow 110ing are some points to keep in mind when composing yourmessage: Clfiity: Keep your mcssage as simplc as lossiblc. Make )our senlence\\ and para- graphs short and to the point. An audience tcnds to remember the beginning and thc cnd of a message. What comes in bctween is often forgotten or ignored. Kccp your key points up front in your message and repeat them a\u20aclain at the conclusion. Have one main point and reinforce it by repeating it in differenl ways throughout the message. Do not allow it to become\"hidr-len in less important information. It's bctler 1o have a \"lcan communlcatlon and arousc audience intercst and curiosity than to put thcm to sleep with unnccessary cxplanalions. Resdshility: Along with having a simple. clcarly stated messagc. your audience must bc ablc t() understand lhc words you usc'l he rcading . passive voice. for example.

With this plan in place, the committee can work a couple ol months in advance ol each upcoming activity. The committee could consider the following issues when plan ning specific activities: .

This is thc advantage ofhaving a wellness committee. Since the mcmbcrs work with the other employees. they can have the grcatcst influcncc on participa- lion.

The advantagcs of this option are that the company develops a sense ol ownership of the program, and the program makes use of cxisting stafT expertise. The disadvan tages includc a long delay before the program can be offered, not having the time to pretest the program, a large amount of staff time devoted to program development, and often the necessity of using photocopied materials. In the long run, intenally developed programs may also be quite expensive. The American Hospital Association estimates that it costs bctwccn $50.000 and $250,000 to devclop a high quality wcllness program. 2. Contrrct with { Vendor lo Come On-Site Somc companies may choose 1() have an a scrvicc for the community. Thc advantage of this ap proach is that therc is no slaf[ time dcvotcd t() program dcvcbpment or inslrltction. The mateials may also be quite attractivc, and the program usually has a proven lrack record.'Ihe disadvantage is that the per- participant lee may be high. and there is no sense of program ownership. 3. Troin Your Own Slefiin r Prepackaged Program Organizations may choose 1() train thcir own staff in a turnkey program-a com- promise between the first two options. Thr aJ\\ anlagcr include a sen\\e of o\\unrl ship, a reduced per-panjcipant cost. the ability to offer a program with a provcn track record and success rates, and nicely packaged program materials. The disad- vantagc is the amount of time necessary to train staff and conduct classes. r23Most organizations sclect either option 2 oi 3 because they do not have the staff expertise or the time to develop their own programs -specially in smaller busi- nesses. Both options require evaluating and selecting an rrut'iJe vendor. and lh is can be complex and sometimes confusing. To guide you in this process, here are 2l key criteria in three categorics to considcr whcn cithcr selecting a vcndor to comc on sitc or choosing a program in which to train staff. A convenicnt chccklist for evaluating prcpackagcd programs is also included. You may copy and use this checklist in your own evaluation. THE VENDoR| A QtJEsr FoR THF, Ihsr l.

Ask the vendor who youl ongoing liaison will be: the salesperson. a customer \\er\\ice r(pr(s(nlali\\r. a trainer. an admin ist mainrain contact out if an ouFof{own vendor has a tollfree number to make access less cosllv. How much time is the staff available for receiving your phone calls? Also ask if '124!ou ll recei\\e ongoing mcmo\\ or nc\\ sl<l- ter. and how olten. 3. Your Organization's Needs Can lhe vendor meet the particular needs of your organizalion l For instancc. if you have many remote sites. can the provider deliver to all ol the regardless of sizc or location'l Find out if the vendor can accommodatc your schcduling needs: evcning programs for shift workcrsi pro- grams bcforc work. aflcr work. or during lunchtimc- If you want to run many programs a1 the same time or within a short timc lramc. makc sure the vendor hospital's clients. 6.

Be sure io find oul what other clicnts would be allowed to conducr rhc f\\rogram in your \\cn ic( arca. Some providers will grant cxclusivity within a cenain mile radius of a hospital.

WEALTHY & wrsEwith what is being taught. Examples include dcmonstrating an activity in class so that participants will feel comfortable with it and see that it works and providing participants with support materials such as a smokeless cmergencY Pack. Enjoyment should be part of all Pro grams. lf participants are enjoying the classes. lhey are more likely to altend them. morc likely to do what is askcd. and thus more likely to be successful.

Materials and Pack&ging How the program materials look may hell dcr(rmine whclhcr parlicipant\\ will <nroll and well-packaged, have man)'illustrations, conlain a good deal of white space for ease of rcading, and be written at a reading level that is appro- priate lor the target group (plain English writing is at a ninth-gtade level). The malerials also should be convcnient 1or 125participants to carry, because they may need to b I1g them to every class or use them throughout the day. Matcrials should also be easy to distribute at class meetings. Ifyou must keep an inventory. make sure the materials don't take up a lot of storage space. In addition to printed materials, look for various accessories such as audiotapes, summary cards, slide guides, and graduation diplomas. Although thcy don't makc or break a program, approprl ate specialty itcms makc nicc givcaways. Examples include a calorie expenditure chart and tape measure for a weightloss program, a biofcedback card for a stress management program. a headband for a litness program. and a pocket mirror for a self-esleem program. Finally, find out what types of customization options are available for the program materials. Many organizations likc to put lh(ir namr dnLl lot,,,,n parti.'i- pant matenals. ll. Program lmprovemcnas No health promotion program should bc cast in stone. Thc ficld is changing con stantly, and new, improvcd methodobgies are being devek)ped.

Are f\\ri'gram chanpe\\ allowed? Whal type of approval process rs necessary/ 12. Previous Experience with Specilic Population Groups Many health promotion programs welc o ginally designed to reach employees at the employer's corporate headquaftels, primarily white-collar workers with a fairly high lcvel of education. If a company is serious about rcducing hcalth care costs. as most are. programs cannot appeal only to one target audicncc. Programs may therefore necd to bc modified: for ex ample, adjusting the reading level of materials or providing less mate al toread, adding anecdotes and case histodes appropriate for the target population or increasing the audiovisual aids. Also, cultural differences exist among various parts of the country aod between indus tries. Determile if the program has been used successlully in intlustrres likc 1ours. with population groups like yours and in the geographic arca where you are located. 13. Success Rates Unfbrtunately, many vendors do not have well-documcntcd success rates, and those that do provide success ratcs present them in a manner that makes it difficult to comparc onc vcndor with another, For a study to be reliable, it should be conducted al least six months to onc year after pte- sentation. The research should also bc curent. Dctermine what criteria were used to gathcr thc data.

Program Fees lf the provider comes on-site, generally thc only cost is a per-participant fee.

Despite all these polential costs, training your own staff is usually much less costly than having a vendor come on-sitc to conduct classcs, 126 HLALTHt. WE.^LTIiY & Even a great ptogram won't be success- ful if it's conducted by an unqualjfied, poorly trained leader.

It will produce appropriate definitions of \"success\" for each of the major participants and guaran- lee lhal th( h(alth promolion program a raluable conlrihu- tion to everyone's bottom line.

Dollar figures quoted in the literature citc wcllness programs returning up to $ll tor lor lhe time and thlj dcfinition. Controversy still exists about thc amounl of impact any particular program can havc on any sct population. I1 is safe to say lul. But what is successful'l If you expect to use health promotion programs as your only cosl-containment strategy. they will tail. lf you initiate person-focused wellness programs including stop smoking, weight control, and others, they will have limited succcss without addressing largcr corpo- rate, family, and community issues. Programs founded on an understanding of the corporate and community culture have the most chance for sustainable impact. For example, if you attempt to run a weight control program for employees and continue to sefle high-fat meals in your cafeteria, you will not have great success. lf you do not include the familysupport mechanisms in your piogtam, then it will fail. Some of the measures ofsuccess for wellness programs take several yea$ to emerge (health cost containment), and time must be allowed to determinc impact on this measure. The common time recommendations for wellness evaluations ate L Knowlcdge and altrlude changc (day: to months) 2. Simple bchaviorchange (three months or more) 3. Lifestyle change (smoking; weight control: one year or longer) 4. Absenteeism (one year or more) 5. Health cost containmcnt (three years or longery The ultimate role ofthe evaluator in all planning situations is to serve as one of the major checks and balances. insu ng the interventions have a realistic chance for success and thal all components o{ the intcrvcntion are monibred for feedback ano lmprovemcnt, Evaluation Assumptions Some basic assumptions insure the succcss of the evaluation cffort. lf these assumptions prove to bc unsupported. thc evaluator should assist in getting these tasks done bcforlj continuing the evalua- tion: . Goals and objectives are explicitly stateo. . Baseline measures are available or included in the program plan. . Staff are trained and appropnate assigned time is commitled to the evaluation component of the progmm. . Target populations have been involved with program sp\u20accifications including incentives and appropriate end prod- ucts, . Pilot projects or other small_scale interventions are part ofthe ea y program plan. Wrnrnrr & Wtse. Appropriate budgct ha\\ been commir- ted to the evaluation process. . A feedback plan for use of results is in place. All items on this list need to be reviewed by the worksite health promotion manager before detailed decisions about evaluation can be developed. Du ng the review process, programming history, both good and bad, should be examined to detect potential problems and opportunities for the present evaluation effort. This is also a good time for the evaluator to identify community and other organiza- tional resources that will or could have an impact on the outcome to the progmm implementation. For examplc, if you plan to increase physical activity levels of employccs, do you have a way of tracking participation in ofl-site programs? Do you harc lists of all potentral \\cndor\\ ol thc\\c se ices? Do you consider it a success or a failure if people choose t() use an off-site versus an on-site program? A fcw minutcs of torcthought at this timc will limit your problems of accountability at thc cnd of the program. Measures of Success Do health promotion programs work? Yes! But we must be careful in identifying our mcasures of success and clearly plan techniqucs ofsecuring the necessary data on these measures of success, In general, three areas ofsuccess are targeted in health promotion programsl l. Nonhealth 2. Health cost containment 3. Corporate culture Nonhealth measures include: . Employee satisfaction (anecdotal dat, employee opinion interviews) . Employee tumover rates (personncl teportsi human resources; departmental or unit reviews). Ability to attract new employees (anecdotal data; interviews; resuitment agencies) Health cost containment by unit or unit participation (surveys to rdentify numhen involvedr comluter- ized record keeping groups (community surveys) . Clients' pcrccptions (user surveys) It would bc extremely unusual for any single program to have more than four or fivc major measures of success. As pro gram planner/evaluator. you need to know the past history of \"successes\" and failures, and then you can choose the measures for a particular intervention. What is per- ceived as successful by one vested interest may not be perceived as successful by another. Make sure agreement is reached on what is a successful program, and that it be reasonable for the scope of the inter- vent|on, Hrelrnv, Wsalrnv & WrsE 135Onc final comment: All measures of success should be examined carefully for their \"haidness.\" For example, abscntee ism can be rcldlcd lo many cause. includ- ing health, weather, family problcms. and sports. Just be fully aware ofwhat the mcasure is identifying so you won't bc surprised after data are collcctcd and analyzed. Evaluation Strategies All spccific strategies are atlempts at being accountable for some agreed-upon measute of succcss. For example, when data are collected. the type, amount. and frequency of collection are ddven by your planning decisions about the planned outcomes of your program, For purposes of this summdry. you should considcr four broad strategies: 1. Objective cvaluation 2. Subjective evaluation 3.

The general rule is to collect only what you need, and that necd should be clearly statcd and lied to specific objectives bcforc the start of the program. Subjective evaluation, the sccond category of stratcgics for program evalua tion data collection, is one of the most overlooked categories becausc it is not tradilionally considered as scienlific as the objective data. However, this category is essential in the early impl(rmenlation stages (pilol) of a of a new program or thc modification ol an ongoing one, this application is essonlial li)r carly trouble shooting and Program corrcction. Subjcctivc evaluation is also a vcry powerful tool tor assessinS a wide rangc ol clienl perceptions at any stage of ihe program. Such simple qucstions as r'tylaf do you like most or leasl about lhe pro- g/4m?\"can be very telling for program modification. It is important to structure qucstions ir bolh forced choicc and open- ended formats to clicit the full range of feelings of participants. Compare the following subjective evaluation questions and see which you would like to use in your program situa- tion. 136 Hr +r LnY, Wt-nrrriv & does this pmgram compare to other prcgtums lou hare participated itr during the p.tst lear?

Other forced choice questions could be used as a lollow-up to explore the rating, but information is still limitcd to what choices you give the participant. Thc advantage of this approach is that you can''counl re.ptrnrs. but th( disadvanlagc is that you cannot explore the hidden or underlying causcs of the response. The open-ended question cannot be-countrd.\" and lrequency or perccnlaBr\\ cannot capture the meaning of this type ol question. Open-ended questions are aimed at the \"real\" feelings of participants and show the way toward program problems asalmost no other evaluation method can. The pa icipants' answers, in tbeir lan' guage, tell about feelings mote accuratcly than any approach. lf you want to do in- depth analysis of program success, think about collecting largcr sets of informatiol in various formats ftom fewer numbers of participants rather than few sets from large numbem, Types o[ questions that reflect the subjective nature of program delivery include: l. How was the progmm helpful? 2.

Subjective evaluations are also ex lrcmel) usrful In spccific inler- esred in measuring the quality ol t(aching. materials, facility, or any other component of your programs, subjective evaluations are the proper procedure- Common ex- amples include: HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WrsE t37Forc\u20acd choice: L This inttructor vas Very good Good Avetuge Below avemge- 2, The supporting ,naterials (handouts, fidaos) t erc Very good Gootl_ inst My feelings about the supponing ma,erials archealth risks and might, over the long haul, have an impact on some of the stated cost figures. what is more important at this time is the appropriate targeting of pro- grams toward areas that show the greatest potential lor cosl savings. If you had to choose areas of potential co.t impact. this is where you should begin.

It is ditlicuh lo arrivr at a henefil estimare fo' many health promotion outcomes, and it rs even more difficult to calculate that benefit accuratcly ovcr the life of a particular employee. It seems simple when first thinking about cost-benefit ratios: estimate savings and divide those savings by the direct and indirect costs of the program- Difficulty begins almost immediately when benefit estimates are made. For example, when somconc stops smoking, or is diagnosed as3. Thelocilil! The final arca that subjectivc cvalua tions arc helpful is predicting future planned behaviors. For example, what do people intend to do after the program ends? Research indicates that people's behavioral intent is a strong indicator of future action. It is worthwhile to collect lhis informarion as an indicator oI polen tial long-ran8e program impact. lt can be collected in either the forced choice or open-ended format, whichever seems appropriate. Cost Analysis is the third evaluation strategy. The cost of health care services and the competiti\\e nalure of the markel- place lorce wellnrss programs to bc cflrc- tive and efficient. Wellness programs arc usually mcn tioned as one of many opportunities to affecl lhes( cosr increases. Wellne\\q pro- grams can have some effect on specific 138 HEALTHY, WEALTHY & w$Eh)'peflensive. the short-term savings might be calculated in lumber ofdays of reduced absenteeism. reduced medical costs. or increased productivity. These savings should have to be discountcd according to anticipated ongoing hcalth care monitoring costs, time until savings appcar, participa- tion in support groups. and other ongoing follow-up costs. These and many other factors cloud the potential benefit of the program. Accurate benefit estimates, as indicated, are usually beyond the scope ofmost program managen, but if you plan to do a cost-benefit analysis, follow these basic steps: 1- Itemizc direcl costs: personnel, equip menl, materials. tmining, recruitment worktime of participants (if during work hours), follow-up reinforcements. 2. ltemize indirect costs: spac\u20ac. c(xit share of over, 4. Divide the costs into the estimated totat bcnefits as a general indicat()r ofthe contribution to the cmployer. Any figurc over $l is considered a positive oulcome lor your program, An employer is faced with limited amounts of money to spend on achicving any desired outcome. Your program is just one approach to achieving cost reductioos. For example, should an employer spend money on new machines versus an invesl- ment in health promotion to increase worker productivity? Or should money b\u20ac allocated to mandatory drug testing and toward better preemploymenl screening to produce a healthier workforce? If you sell your progmm on cost-benefit alone. it will be difficult to competc against thcsc and other interventions. However, ifyou must become involved wilh cost.benelit analysis. the follo$ing li\\t of measures should be included in your program accountability: Her-ruv, Weerrnv & Wlse1. One to three-year compadson lor baseline changes on absenteeism 2. Three- to five-year comparison of health insurance benefit claims 3. C)ne- to three-year productivity mea sures 4. One- to three-year tumover rates in participants and nonparticipants 5. Identification of \"significant finds\" from early detection programs and a calcula tion ofdollars saved (for example, onc early breast cancer detection might save not only thousands of dollars. but a life!). The good news is that in several recent suNeys. cost-benefit was not the leading reason to support a wellness program in the workplace. The general concern for employees' hcalth and wcll-being has consistently been among the highest rated motivations for health promotion. along with personal interest of upper manage- ment, and cost containment (for follow-up: see managemert support). This does not mean that worksite health promotion managers can forltet about costs, bu1 it does put this concern in a diflerent per- spcctivc. No doubt that expansi()n of r:xisting programs. and the founding ofnew ones. will depend on the perception that heallh promotion is a sound business decisi()n. CosGeffective analysis is a tool that is a\\ ailablc now fr'r almosl all worksile health promotion managers to assist in dcmonstrating thc worth of wellness programs. Cost effectiveness of interventions is one of thc most important tools for the evalua- tor. Which approach ofthe many available should you use to change a behavior? what level of intensity or duration of program is necessary 1() achieve a particu- lar impact? These important questions must be answered to be more accountable lo managcmcnl. For e'(amplc. lhc [Lrllora- ing illustration will completc the necessary steps for a cost-effectiveness analysis. 1. Need: (estimated population) the eligible population for a particular inlervention (1.000 people in this exampre.J 1392. Reached: number of eligible who participated in the progam (500) 3. Covemge: numbers reached, divided by need (1 000/500 X 100 = 50% ) 4. Impact: (ifimediate change) early results that are attdbutable to your inteflention prcgram (in this example, 250 people changed the target behav 1or) 5. Efficacy: impact, divided by = 50ol. ) 6 . Effectiveness: by (250/ 1000 x lm = 2s%) 7. Program costsr In this example, $1,25() 8. Efficienry: costs, divided by reached ($1,a5olsoo = $2.s0) 9. Cost-effectiveness: costs, divided by the impact ($1,250/250 = $5 per effect) The importance of this effort is that all programs can be compared to determine where and how you can get the most\"bang\" for your money invested. This analysis is not hindered by the problems of estimanng b(ncfils ot programs. It can bc used to quantify the accomplishment of stated objectives in a manner that upper management can relate to. It allows the evaluator to make hard choices about where to put limited resources to improve the health of the targct population. Corporale cullure evalualion is the fourth and final cussed hcre. The impacl oI health promo- tion programs can also be measured to determine ihe level of institutionalization (for follow up: see corporlle cullure). Major changes are usually necessary in the corporate culture for lasting health promo- tion changes in the workforce. Prograrns that only target and measure impact on individual behaviors wiu have difficulty meering long-term behavior change obiec tives. Typically, changes in the supporting environment, including the workplace and home, are necessary fbl long-tem success. Programs that consciously plan to impacl these support systems should also look for ways of tracking changes.The following lisl provides examples of sals lo idenlity drc \\upporl- ive o[ comprehensive to 1.

A Final Word Any program that relies on volunteer pa icipation must develop inleresting programs and deliver them in a manner that supports trust and a sense of commri nity (ownership). Several issues in evalua- tion can have significant impact on the ultimalc acceptancc of th( nrogram int(r- vention by the target population. including confidcntiality and the trustworthiness or ethics of the program evaluator. 140 HEALTHY, WEAL tHY & WrsEFirst and most important, participants should know that information collected about their health and well-being will be confidenlial and that any data reports will be based on group intcrpretations that shield the identity of particular persons. Any discussions about the program to higher management should not single out participants by name in any way that coutd harm that employee's future at thc worksile. All employees should have the right to withdnw from any program at any lime wilhout any negalire repercussion<. In summary, the worksite health promo- tion managcr must be perccived by the target population as having their intcrests at the forefront in program delivcry and evaluation.

WEALTHY & WISEWhat Will Your Health Promotion Program Cost? How much should you budget for your health promotion program? The following general guidelines are olfered here simply because many health planners need some- thing to build a budgct on. Cost cstimatcs are for all direct expcnses for the purchase of a newsletter. for examplc. to pay instruc- tors. and for salarics or othcr indircct costs or costs for capital construction or equip ment for an ir-house fitness center. Estimate the size of your overall pro- gram budget by multiplying thc cosr h. the program (not iusl hy the number you expect to participate). For example, a company wants to starl with a moderatc program and build to a more comprchensive program a year or two later. The budget for a moderate lrogram lor irs lno emllo)ee' might h( in the rangc of $800 to $1,500 for the first year- In the second year, the company might set aside $20 per employee x 100 or $2,000.A 1992 study by Hewitt Associates and reportcd in B&rm eJJ & Healr,h (September 1992) indicated that 28 perccnt of compa- nies spent $5 or less per employee on health promotion activities in 1990. An other 19 pcrccnt spent $6 to $10, so it's clear, thc wcllncss activities can be done on low budgets. and rcsourceful companies are successful- Several factors altect the budget.

Employee pays all costs: May hampet participation if cost is pcrceived as too expensrve_ Shared costs: Partial payment by the company can show that company cares. Partial pavmcnt by employee makes cmploycc morc be he.l ofall of'tions. Encouragc\\ cmplolec participation and rewards those who take it seriously. For example: Employee pays total cost of smoking ccssation program.

They let the employees know what they can expect from the company and what the company expects from them. A corporate health policy should be bascd on the interest ofimproving the health and well-being of the employee and. at the same time, reflect the company's mission statement and philosophy. Health supportive policies complement a wellness program. They help shape a corporatc culture that reflects commitment to a healthy workforce. Often company policies are as influen tial in changing health behaviors as tar, getcd health promotion interventions. For example, a smoking policy with rcstrictions on where employccs can smoke can be as elTective as offering smoking cessation classes. Why? Because many people quit smoking thcmselves, and sometimes the workplace restrictions are just that extra push they nced to stop complelely.

Often. the health promotion managcr is assigned the task of developing policies related to health promotion. Here are some guidelines to follow when devel- oping policies: Review related policics from companies similar to yours and cxamine the process used to develop thosc policies. Establish an employee committee (an action team) to draft preliminary policy statements. The policy statement should include the rationale for the policy and how the policy will be enforced. This mmmittee should be representative of variotrs employee groups and should include organized labor. A policy must bc accepted by most of the employees to be truly enforceable. This group should provide insight into what policies will be successful within your company. HEALTIY, WEALTHY & WrsE 151It will also provide a sense ofownership to the rank and file and give the health promotion manager access to chzrnnels of cornnunication needed for policy review and implementation. Gain support for the policy from upper management. The policy must supply the benefits anticipated. Your goal may be to help control health care costs by requiring a mandatory safety belt use policy for employees riding in company cafs. But if upper management is not willing to weather the initial storm of employee protests, then the policy should be modified or dropped. Ask a respeded membcr of company management to hclp champion the policy. Find an advocatc who is re- specled by all employccs to help put the poliry in place (sign or cosigr a memo. for example). Gain support of midlevel managers for the proposed policy. In any organiza tion it is important that midlevel managers understand and suppofi the policy. In most companies, policy implementation will not succeed without them. Be sure to explain what will bc cxpected of managers (in a managels'meeting ifthal is the way your company communrcates to rts managc$). Meet with labor unions and other appropriate employee groups to present thc poliry. The rationale for the poliry and how itwill be put into plac\u20ac should bc clcarly outlined for these key em- ployccs. Be sure to allow time for discussion ielated to potential problcms and how to seek employee support for the poliry. Prepare employees, Announce a timeline, but cducate employees about the poliry and how it will affect them long before the policy goes into effect. This gives employees time to adjust to changes and enables them to comply before the effectivc date. Dudng the countdown (for a smoking ban, for example), hold educational workshops. have promotional items, and contests. These activities will reinforce what is going to happen and reduce resistancc.ln this example, for a smoking ban, allow a year or more to prepare em- plo\\ ees for lhe remove adopt smokers during the Great American Smokeout in November; and hold informational wolkshops to answer questions from smoke$ and nonsmokers. . Implement and evaluate the policy. Health promotion managers should announce how and when the poliry will be implemented and allow adequate time to see how it isworking. Then evaluate and refine the policy as re- quired. Sometimes a policy needs to be finetuned. How Do You Write a Policy? When the times comes to actually write thc formal policy, be sure the policy clearly states the goals you want to reach. The following items might be included in a health-related policy: Rationale Policy statement Personnel responsible PeNon in charge of implementation and management Other applicable policics Management and discipline/enforce- ment Guidelines Resources available 1() employees 152 HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WrsEConsiderations in developing a fl\u20acxtime poliq RalloNA!-E: The main objective of flexible working hours is to create an alternative to tmditionally fixed work schedules through a system which grants employces a certain fieedom to choose times of affival and depar- ture. Flexlime offe$ many advantages to thc employee as well as the em- ployer. First, through flextime, a company can attmct and retain skilled employ ees who have family responsibilitics. Whcn flextime is implemented. an employee is given time in the mom- ing. as well as in the aftemoon, when doctor/dcntist appointments are made, children are coming home from school, or health promotion activities are taking place. Second, tardiness is greatly reduced. Companies who have flextime report deffeases in tardiness and absentee- ism. Third, the quality of life outside work is impioved because employees have some flexibility to accommodate their lifestyles. The employee often feels a real sense ofcontrol when flextime is implemented while, in turn. companies have found an improved corporate climate, in- deased productivity, and a greater efficiency in task mmpletion. Fourlh, there is a general increase in job knowledge and an improvement in communication and management skills. Finally, traffic congestion is reduced when flextime is introduced. Em- ployees have found less trafficcongestion whcn they do not have to follow a rigid workday schedule, especially whcn the company is located in high{raffic areas of a city. For a company to develop flex1ime, management and the employee have to work together to accommodate public hours, productivity, and a work schedule that benefits both the employer and employee. CoMloNEN'ts AND GUIDET-rNE\"5: When a company is considering flextime. planners must consider just how flextime will be successful. As part of this planning, a mmpany must think of all the problems associated with flexlime. A policy can anticipate problems and address them before they become problems. ln a flextime poliry, consider these questions (and others): . What is flextime? What is the nomal workday? . who is eligible for flextime? . Does this have any effect on salary or benefits? . Who monitors flextime? . Should we have a t al pedod? . Do employees keep written records? How long is lunch hour? . What are the conscquenc\u20acs foi those who abuse the pdvilege? ENFoRCEMEN'I To enforce the poliry, of coursc, employees must know thc poliry exists. Managers are respon sible for granting employee flextime privileges, and managers should be requircd to go over the policy with employecs under the dfuection. Each employee should read and understand the flextime poliry. tt is a privilege, and abuse may result in cancellation ordisciplinary action. Healrnv.

UNION PACIFIC RAttROAD, OMAHA Irtter to employees about drug testing: Dear Fellow Employee: As we enter a new decade together, public opinion polls show there is no hotter lopic or deeler concern in America. day- to day, than drug use and abuse. From experience I know this concem has run deep among Union Pacific Railroad Company employees. We all call be justly proud of the \"Operation Red Block\" program which commits us as a team to the principles of education, co-worker inter- vention and rehabilitation with respect to drug and alcohol problems. I he Opera- 1.62 Hrerrnr, Weerrnv & Wrsetion Red Block\" concept was created by Union Pacific employees and has now been copied by many other companies. With very few exceptions, Union Pacific employees also have supported and coop- erated $rth lhe po<t-accidenl and reason- able cause drug and alcohol testing re- quirements of the United States Federal Railroad Administration. We believe this testing has been effective. The number of employees who tested positive declined to 6.7% in 1989, compared to 9.2% in 1988 and 10.3ol. in 1987. But, I'm sure you will agree, we must redouble our efforts in order to reduce to zero the percentage of drug alld alcohol rule violations. Union Pacific is no more and no less thall a team of individuals devoted to safety and productivity in operations. We simply cannot tolerate drug or alcohol use which imperils the health and safety of employees, custome$ and the public at large. For these reasons, we've developed and alldched for your reading a revi5ed \\late- ment ofUnion Pacific Railroad's Drug and Alcohol Policy, which becomes effective January 16, 1990. This date coincides witb the effective date of the Federal Railroad Administration's new random drug testing regulations. These regulations require random testing of \"Hours ol Service Act\" employees (i.e., train crews, hostlers, hostler attendants, signalmen. dispatche$. helper engineers. and ce ain electricians, machinists and yardmasten). The revised policy extelds thjs random drug testing to all safety-sensitive manage- merft employees, including Mike Walsh lthen CEO] and myself. The poticy also demonstrates ljnion Pacific's vigorous compliance with the Diug-Free workplace Act of 1988. In so doing. ir exlend\\ olher toricolugical lesting (e.g., for individualized reasonable cause, during physical examinations, or as follow- up to rehabilitation after a drug or alcohol rule vjolation or medical disqualification) to certain safety-sensitive employees.including management, who have not previously been subject to testing. Preparation of initial computer selec- tions for random testing will begin on January 16. On the same date. Urion Pacific also will no longer rely on FRA autho ty to perform i[dividualized reason- able cause testing of \"Hours of Seflice Act\" employees, unless individual notice of FRA testing is given in a specific case. We will continue this testing, but under our own authority. I-or your general informalion. any tlpe of drug or alcohol testing which is not aheady occurring on Union Pacific at this time, including random testing, will not occur under this revised policy until March 1, 1990. lt will take us that long to com- pletc administrative training which is essential to the success ofthe extended testing prognm. The policy is lengthy. I urge you to read it. It spells out ill detail, so there will be no misunderstanding, Union Pacifi c's expecta- tions conceming drug and alcohol use by its employees. It discusses applicable rules, drug and alcohol testing- essential em- ployee protections built into the testing process, and cornpany guidelines governing employee assistance and possible return to service following a drug or alcohol prob- l(rm. A summary ofthe policy is also attached to assist you. I look forward to every employee's full cooperation with the Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy.

How? During the phrases such as \"ddnk in modcration,\"\"drink responsibly.\" and \"know when to saywhen\" have been widely promoted in American business and industry. The facl o[ the matter is that up to,{7 percent of industrial injudes and 40 percent of industrial fatalities can be linked to alcohol abuse and alcohol- ism. Problem drinkers are absent from work about four to cight times more than other emplovees. And untrcated alcoholism is associated with higher health care costs and higherpremiums paid by companics. EmployeN are looking at stronger risk ma[agement policics that clearly prohibit d nking by employees who are on dutv, who may be called to duty. or who are operating any equipment owned or leased by the company. Although these stratcgies help to reduce the likelihood of accidents and injuries atthe worksite, many alcohol-related problems occur as a result of employees consuming while off duty and away from the worKslte. Manv employers are encouraging theii employees to \"drink responsi- bly\" when they arc off duty. Can it be done. and what is \"responsible d nking\"? It can mean almost anlthing from tolal abstinence to not falling over the cal when tiptoeing in from a latc night drinking bout. Also. responsiblc ddnking implies that those who do not drink responsi- bl), drink iffesponsibly. This is a judgmental way of characterizing the alcoholic as an irresponsible pe$on. The blame is placed on someone who has an already misunderstood illncss. Employees with alcoholism. try as they will, cannot drink responsibly.At the same time, responsible drinkillg implies that a pcrson consumes at least some alcohol. ln cefiain situations, any alcohol may be dangerous (such as driving, operating machinery, and pregnancy). And somc groups ofpeople should never drink under any circunstances (those with a family history ofalcoholism or those with certain chronic health conditions, for cxample). So: Is there such a thing as respon sible drinking'l Health experts suggest that it is possible lor those who do choosc to drink to substantially reduce thcir risk for experiencing alcohol-related problems. Thc Almholism and Drug Abuse Council of Nebraska has developed a public information campaign entitled \"Reducing the Risk for Almhol-Related Problems: Bythe Numbeis.\" It's an easy-to remember alcohol use lbrmula, based on research. to provide em- ploye$ and employees with more specilic guidancc in alcohol use. o-t-24 ZERO represelts no alcohol use. Some people choose not to drink at all.

More women, more ethnic and racial populations or groups. In fact, nonwhites and women will make up the bulk ofthe new workers by the turn ofthe millennium. Therein lies the challenge. Are current health promotion programs meeting the needs ofthe culturally diverse workforce? Today, and for the next several yea$, the words multicultural a'rd cultural diter' ri4r will be the focus for many corporate health promotion managers in the areas of policy, programs, and educational resource development. The telm lrxorilY has previously been used, but this term does \\- not adequately describe the variations of racial, ethnic, and cultural groups in the workforce in the United States. National, state, and local demographic trends point to significant shifts in the numbem of ethnic and racial populations and women who will be entering the labor force in this decade (for follow up: see work and femily).

But is worksite wellness ready to selve them? The challenge for the health promotion planner is to develop programs fot diverse groups of employees. The goal is to maiNtream or incorporate their health promotion needs into overall program planning. But many health promotion planneN are unaware of the particular health risks for certain racial and ethnic groups. Heallh planners musl also lackle lhe barrier: thal pre\\ent racial and ethnic populations from participating ill health plomol1on programs. First, who are YOU? Before you can look at your employee groups and their various types of diversity, it's important to look at your own cultural and ethnic identity. We all have a cultural identity, regardless of how the Census Bureau identifies us, which includes the beliefs. \\ alues. atlitude\\. and praclices \\a( leamed ftom parents, relatives, friends, teachers, religious 1eade6, and others and that were shaped through various erperi- ences with these significant others and with the environments in which we lived and interacted (community, home, school). Except for Ame can Indians, all our ancestors came to America ftom a \"lbr- eign country lor a number ol dilferen causes and reasons. Groups keep coming, and for the same reasons your own ances- tols may have come generations ago. Your self-assessment should focus on what beliefs, values, and attitudes you may share or have in common with other cultural groups and leam to develop bridges or common ground to manage difTerences that may exist among you. He,llrnr, Wealruv & Wtse t7l( Health promotion involves more than the achievement ofone or two behavioral changes in the Jives of well motivated middle-class individu als. Health promotion, in its fullest sense. implies a concern lbr the betterment of thc total environment alld way of life of those who live and work in a community. a-, Gordon DeF iese, PhD Health promotion researcher and professor at the Univeisity of Nonh Carolina at Chapel Hill WELCOA Board member Supporting Differences in Your Company Once you've looked at your own cultural identity, you nced to discover how your organization can deliver services to cultur- ally diverse employecs. Certainly, you need strong and significant support from top management-as youwould need for any health promotion program. Their involve ment and visibility is the key to long term integration of your program for culturally divene employees. Also examine these aspects of your company; . what are the attitudes, beliefs, and collective experiences of staff who work with vaious cultuml groups? . Can your stalf or other departments develop educational resoulces (pnnt, visual) in other languages or deliver bilingual sewices one-on-one or in a group settjng? . Does the company support events. activities, or programs targeted to specific raclal, ethnic, or cultural groups? What were they? How suc- cessful? Can the methods be adapted for health promotion ot wellness sewices? Examine the Diversity of Your WorKorce Check with your personnel department 172to find out thc actual levels of new em ployee growth by race, ethnicity. agc, gender, and occupational status. Remember that racial aIId ethnic popu Iations have subgroups broken down by country of origin and language as well as by location in the United States. For example. subgroups of the Hispanic poptt- lation are Mcxican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican. Subgroups of Southeast Asians rnclude populalions from Vrqtnam. faos. and Cambodia. Most racial and ethnic populations have beelr increasing at a greater rate than th\u20ac white population. Since 1980, the Afiican American population-the largest racial and ethnic Elroup-has increased 13 per- cent to 30.2 million people through 1990. Hispanic population growth over the samc period has been 34 percent 10 a lotal of 19.8 million. whilc the Ameiican Indian/ Alaska Native population has grown by 19 percent to 1.7 million. In addition, Asian and Pacilic Islanders increased by 70 percent to 6.5 million through the 1980s. As you review each of these populations in your workforce, examining morbidity and mortality data available through federal, statc, and local health agencics and nonprofit community-based organizations, you can use this information to lurlher define the targeted areas and senices your worksite program should focus on. Here's a bricf overview o{ the leading hcalth issues for each of the four main racial and ethnic groups: African Ame cans Of all the racial and ethnic populations, this group has the largest numbcr of studies and research compilcd to provide a good undentanding of health nccds and problems. Overall. the morbidity rate lbr African Ame can males continues to be aboul 50 percenl higher than the rale [or white males and females. Specifically: Homicide: The leading cause of death for African Americans parlicularly malcs betwcen the ages of l5 and 45 years. Helr-ruv, WrelluY & WrsECardiovascular Disease: Heart disease and stroke is the lcading cause of death among all African American males tbr all age groups. Cancer: Among this group represcnts a highcr cxcess incidence when compared with ratcs among white populalions. Most common forms for men include ptostate, lung, colorectal: among women, breast, colorectal, and lung. Diabctcs: Ranks as a major problem lvith prevalence ratcs for males 16 peicent and temales 50 higher compareJ u ith ions Liver Discasc: for Africal Amedcans are almost double the rale found in white populations. HIV/AIDS: An emerging health con- cern witb a disproportionate number of new cases being identified among African American populations. Hispanics (Latino) Although lhi database for lhis popula- tion is nol as extensive and as well defined as the data for African Amcricans, the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examira- tion Survey (HHANES) completed by the National Center tbr Health Statistics in 1986 provides somc useful information on the health status for Hispanic groups: Cardiovascular Disease: Ranks as the leading cause of death for all Latino groups. but the rates ofheait disease among Puerto Rican males is approxi- mately 20 pcrccnt higher than among Cuban and Mexican-born males- Diabetes: Found to have a higher prevalence Mcxicans and Puerlo Rrciln!. Me\\icans hd\\c a risl of diabetes at lcast two to three times gieater than white populations. Cancer: Rates for Latino men in par- ticular havc bccn rising, and there is variancc in cancer mortality and survival rarc. which appear relal(Ll to diflerence\\ in sociocconomic levels. access to preventive sen iccs. and artltuJcs Iles. HIV/AIDS: An emerging a disproportionate number of ner caser being identilicd amongHispanic populations. Asian and Pacihc Islande$ Curent statistics collected for this population are not adequatcly coded to assess specific health needs of the various ethnic subgroups such as Vietnamese, Cambodian, or Korean. Despite lack of suflicienl da ta. some problem areas itlenli- ficd include the following: Tobacco Use: Tends to be higher among Southeast Asian males when compared with similar populations of white males. Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseasesr TB and hepatitis B may be a particular problem for adults and their children, according to surveillance reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Colorectal Cancer: Incidence for Japa- nese males, in particular, is higher when compared with other Asian and Pacific Islander ethnic subgroups. American Indian/Alaska NatiYes Again, iesearch and data on the health of Ameican Indian/Alaska Natives suffer from a lack of specificity and scope among thc diverse tribal groups and populations rcsiding in various regrons of the United States. Despite Ihe lack of data, some health problems specific to these groups have been identified: Alcohol Use: Alcohol use and related conditions or problems such as cirhosis of the liver, mental health. accidents, and homicide. Diabetes: The disease and its associated conditions. Infant Mortality: Excess post-neolatal mortality. 173An additional significant statistic to keep in mind is that among populations ulder 45 years of age, African Ame cans and American Indians have the highest death rates with the greatest differences between these groups and white popula- tions occurring at ages 25 to 44. Research the history and culture of the populations you have represented in your workforce. Your review should include the following: . Socioeconomic and political history in the United States . Family structure, roles. and influences of peels . Religior . [.evel ol acculturation (lenglh of lime they or their family has lived in the United States) . Geographic area (rural venus urban) and community environment in which they lived most of their formative years (elementary through high school) . Primary/secondarJ languages (which language do they read, wdte, and speak and in what situations such as work, community, church and at home) . What is their definition of health, welL[ess, and illness in relation to themselves, their family, and peer group? . What has beer their expedence with health care seffices in the United States? Some goups have had bad expedences, and this is true with both new ifimigmnts as well as third and fourth generation citizcns. Here are some cautions about any racial, cultural, or ethnic group: . They are all NOT similar or alike in their thinking, beliefs, language, educa tion, cultural practices, and the like. There are many differences among the vadous cultural groups depending on facto$ such as age, country of origin, geographic location in the United States, and social and economic status. The new-arrival Southeast Asian immigrants coming frompredominantly 174an agncultural economy and lbr many yearc ravaged by wals are far different from Asian groups from Japan or mainland China, both having different form\\ of gorernmenls. indu\\try. lrade. commerce, and wealth among its cltzens. Indian populations have had geogaphic as well as migratory differences in their history and culture that were shaped by governmental policy and the movement of setde$ to the Southwest Plains states and Westem United States. Puerto Rico, Cuba, ard the Dominican Republic are islands in the C.aibbean with unique histories and circumstances that created the movement oftheir populations to the United States. Mexim has a cross border relationship with the United States that oeates a great deal of migratory behavior related to family, economic, alld educational issues. Not all goups p.efer nontraditional medicine or religious healers for illness. They do not all reject Westem or modem medical and health selvices. Again, there is great vafation in cukural group beliels and practices when it comes to seeking care for health problems. It is impoftant for you as a worksite health planner to fully explore the ethnic and cultural health beliefs and value systems of your progmm particl- pants. Frequently our tendencies are to reinforce stereot)?es or \"media im- ages\" of these diverse groups. One example would be that for many years it has been conmonly \"accepted\" that Hispanics tend to rely more or solely on\"folk medicine\" or nontraditional hedl ers (t ul onde r s) lhus underutilizing Westem medical and preventive health seNices that are available. A study conducted as part of the HIIANES suwey (by Trevino. Higginbotham and Ray) evaluated this hlpothesis among a samplc of Mexican Americans living in the Southwest. Their findings concluded that very lew Mexican Americans consulted a curanderc, and Ihose that do so will HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WlsEfrequently visit a physician as well. The study suggests that health professionals focus more on the linguistic and cultual differences as being the more significant baniers to access and utilization of medical services. The key issues to examine when deter- minilg what types of health belief systems or values exist among your diveNe popula' tions include: . How does lheir culture and languag( portray and describe images of health, happiness, family, food (nutrition), exercise, medicine, and its prcfessior- als? (This can be ascertained by focus $oups, reviewing print, audio, and visual materials of the cultue, and requesting feedback from your racia. and ethnic goup6.) . What are individual, family, or group norms related to self-esteem, personal mmmunication styles, concepts of respect, trust, and fiendship? . How do their spiritual and religious beliefs coincide or conflict with health habits or health pmctices you are attempting to teach and develop? . Your health promotion prognm may not necessadly be rejecled or given little oedibility because you are Irot of the same racial, cultuml, ethnic, or religious goup. But it is impofiant for you to work with these groups to eam their respect, trust, and moperation. Do not use youl title, academic, prcfessional, or organizational qedentials to gain access. To be successful, it will be your peNonal quatties and actions-not your own racial or ethnic atEliation- that demonstrate integity, honesty, sensitivity, and genuine concem. In summ6q. 3 9oo6 Orocess to follow in the research and investigation ofthe diversity in your population is to acknowl- edge and respect uniqueness and variation among the cultural groups, erase your own past images or beliefs ofthese groups, and replace them with the new ones you will experience as you work with these popula- tions. Be open to different ideas and be nonjudgmental in your approach and communication styles. Heerrnv, Weet-rny & WrseWhy Don't They Participate? The worksite is one ofthe best places to rcach millions of Americans with messages about health improvement. Curent strategies for reaching racial and ethnic populations target community sites such as churches. schools, heallh clinics, bars, chain restaurants, and neighborhood cente$. The worksite is rarely mentioled. Despite disproportionately high rates of unemploy- ment among racial and ethnic populations in general, most of these Americans work, and they can be reached at the worksite. Health promotion needs of culturally diverce populations are overlooked in worksite settings, even though their needs are often the greatest. In fact, health promotion plannen generally don't know the specitic health risks ol racial and ethnic populations of Americans, yet these sks can be addressed through education, awareness, and incentive programs at the worksite as pan of any sound wellness program. Employers can learn how to qeate supportive work environments in which employees of any racial or ethnic group are encouraged to take personal responsibility for their own health and helped to make life-saving lifestyle changes. These benefits spill over inlo the fami- lies as well. Members of many racial and ethnic groups are often at the greatest health risk for a number of other reasons, yet their participation rates are clearly lower. Worksite health promotion progtams can be sensitive to these issues yet overcome the following barders to participation: lgnorancq Employers, and Americans in general, are often not well educated regarding the histories alrd life experiences of racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Often this ignorance (sometimes manifested as racism) can be hurtful to members of these culturally diverse groups and can hi[der ftuitful working relatioll- ships among racial groups. Worksite programs lreed to include training compo- nents for worksite health planners that L'75increase sensitivity and understanding among a groups, Socioeconomic status: Poverty is one of the most important factors affecting the health of racial and ethnic groups. By targeting the working populations in each diversc group. health planners can main- stream health promotion programs at work to help educate those with low incomcs about how to buy nutritious foods on a limited budget, for example, or how to makc healthful lood choices. Worksite health promotion programs can educate employees about how to make thc best use of community health clinics for immuniza tion and preventive care and notjust lor medical cmergencies, about self care issues, and about smoking cessation. Among employcd people are those whose wages are so low. they aie below the poverty level but do not apply 1br or qualify for government aid. Many do not have employer-sponsored hea llh in.urance. or lhey can l aflord lh( piemiums which are often too high. \"For individuals of limited means, the protec tion of health cafl become an almost daily problem.\" according to the American Hospjtal Association. Offer strategies for educating employecs about wise use of health insurance, ifplans arc available and affordable; at the same time. altcrnative delivery systems for health care along with the importance ofpreventive care should be discussed as ways employers can help employees manage health care issues fbr themselves and their families. Educationi Just as income is a predictor of health (and access fo health insurance and health care are limited because of income),lack of education olten traps racial and clhnic populatronr in low paying jobs. Culturc: Cultural traditions often determine health beliefs and practices. Culture can also determine nutritional habits. Health promotion programs at worksites should be sensitivc to culture and tradition and build on their strengths- For example, Arizona Mail Ordei in Tucson offered a lunchtimc nutritional 176session on thc foods of the Southwcst. Nutrition experts ftom county health departmenl shn$cd Hispanic ingredients. Sociocultural factors also affect attiludes about health. Dilferent cultures have different vicws about health, mcntal health, death, dying, the role ofthe famil) and treatment. Cultural connotations related to health oftcn detennine help- seeking behaviors: when and where to get help for mcdical concerns. Culture can also affect a racial and ethnic group s perceplion of the etiology of disease: where does Should lhi\\ he trcaledl And houl Somclimes a group s sense of locus of control plays a major role in shaping attitudes: Am I ill because of fate or lifcstyle choice? Fear or distrusf Some employees. cspecially those at low income levels. feel powerless to change their health behaviors and lack confidence in thcir own ability to achieve positive change. They may also fear or distrust institutions (governmcnt or employment rclated) that seek lo \"help them.\" Worksitc health planners should not \"punish\" thc cmployee but rather build on the positives through incentives. Work site health promotion programs must become part of the company's corporate culture and cncourage involvement by all racial and ethnic groups represented in the workforce. Committees that direct the health promotion programming should specifically include a cross sectiol of the cmployee population and thereby lbster employee ownership. Employee driven hcallh promolron program\\ arc often the most successful and boast of high participa tion rates. Multicultural/Multidimensional The most succcssful programs that serve culturally diverse groups take a common sense approach and mainstream health promotion in the following ways: . Porm an advisory group that represcnts the cuhural di\\ersily in )our !tork.il.. The group will work with you to estab \\r HEALTHY, WEAI-THY & WlsElish program priorities. develop specific objectives for the year. and assist in carrying out specific activities (such as facilitating discussions, tmnslating materials. organizing special events). Use a multiculturavmultidimensional approach. Addrcss diffcrcnt lcvels of health issues and encourage individual behavior change. Help your corporate culture support culturally divene health promotion activilies at work and at home. For example. employee lun cheons or potlucks might promote menus of ethnically diverse foods prepared in a hearl healthy manncr with low salt and low fat content. Aerobic dancc or excrcise programs might use culturally relevant music prepared by the instructorwith help from the advisory goup. Organize family litness or health promotion evenls in the community in conjunction with cultural testivals or other celcbra tl()ns. Empbasize personal or small-group approaches to establish communication channels, ffust, and respect. These approaches are more favorably reccivcd by culturally diverse groups and create higher levels of program compliance. Find some employees from the va ous racial and ethnic llroups to ser.r'e as rolc models to endorsc your health tion activities. Create simple. clear. easy-to-read and casy to-understand health education materials, audiovisual aids alrd other resources, Hete is where your advisory group can hclp. cspccially \\\\'ith transla- lion. Also, many local. state. and national orllanizations develop health educalion resources which might be culturallv and linguislically appropriatc lor your program.The lbllowin\u20aci examples summarize health promotion projccts that targeted three different racial and ethnic groups and show how eflective each was in helping individuals, groups, and families change health behaviors. African Americans: Throuph J coopcra- tive agreemcnt bctwcen Emory Universitv and thc Centers for Disease Control, an African American urban community in Atlanta was able to plan. implement, and evaluate a fisk reduction project for car- diovascular disease. Using a coalition reprcscntingworksites, local businesses, community groups, schools. and health clinics. a 1o-week exercisc and nut tion intervention program targctcd obesc local residents from 18 to 59 yca$ of agc. A total of 209 people responded to advenise- ments and ilrterven tion over a seven-month time period. Participants significantly reduced their weight and blood pressure immediately after the inlervention and at a four-month follow-up. Mexican-Americans: Taking Care of Yorr Heart (Cuidando El Corazon) was dcsigncd to measure Ihe eflectiveness of culturally adapted weight reduction and exercise programs to promote weight loss among Mexican Americans living in a rural Southwestem community. The program used a family-oriented approach to lifestyle change and worked with employees and community leaders. Parlicipants in one group received only a manual on behavior change. nutrition. iinLl (r(rcr.e and lradi tional recipes modificd in fat content. A[othcr group received the same manual but attended year lon!! classcs. The third a family group-received a manual and attcnded classes Ihat emphasized tcchniques for making changes in the family's eating and exercise habits. Thc family group and thc group that received classes had signiiicantly greater weight losses than the informalion-only group. Weight loss was grcatcst in the famil),- involvemcnt group and least in the infor- mauon onlY group.Mainstream Your Program Health promotion can be delivered to culturally diverse groups, and scvcral communit\\ lrogram. ha\\e pro\\en il.

HEALTHY, WE,u-TrY & WlsE 177American Indiansi The lndian Health Service in cooperation with the Zuni lndian tribal leaden of Southwest New Mexico, community groups, and local businesses initiated an exercise and weight control program.

Two years of follow'up indicated dia betic participants experienced weight loss that helped them control their diabetes. And 45 percent of the participants in the weight loss competition completed the contest, lost weight, and reduced body fat contenl Each ofthese three programs was successful becausc the progmm developed from witbin the group rather than being imposed from the outside.

Worksite health planners must take an active iole ln making health promotion issues part of thc strategic plan and on the agenda of the quality improvement teams. Employees at all levels are becoming involved in quality improvemcnt teams to address numerous issues. Implementing a health promotion program at a worksite can be just one topic for a quality improve- ment team. The team can follow the problem-solving process and direct all efforts at addressing the stated problem. The quality improvement team gives worksite advisory committees a structurein which to address corporate health promotion issues. Six Strategies to Increas\u20ac Participation l. Quality improvement teams. Quality improvement teams build on the cmployec empowerment movement in companies across the country. Worksite health promotion programs stand to gain heavily from this kind ofemployee empowernent. Where to starl First, identiry the health and safety issues that are important to your blue-collar population. Set up a new tcam or usc cxtstmg tcams to address these mnc\u20acrns. On Track Union Pacific Raihoad used a quality lmprovement leam to conduct a health fair and to kick off a compre- hensive health promotion progmm, called Project Health Track, for employees in the St. Louis area. ln 1991,35 percent ofSt. Louis general office employees participated in the health fair. The goal in 1992 was to increase participation to 50 percent and promote Project Health Track. Why was attendance low? The quality improvemcnt team used the following tools to analyze the prob lem: Brainstorming is a tool used to gct thoughts out on thc table without any judgments attached. For cxample, the team leader may ask each team member: Why tlo you think employ- eet are not pafiicipatirlg? Eacb, response is listed. A survey ofparlicipants fiom the previous year was conducted.

Union involvement, Blue-collar employccs will be more inclined to paiticlpate ifunions endorse the health promotion prcgrams. It is imperatrve that unions and employees be aware that information received throulir health promotion programs is confiden- tial and will not be uscd against anyone in any way. The best wav is to convince union representatives about the benefits ofyour program and thus gain their support. Ifyou do, they will help spread the word.

Use your talk to promote thc rcsources available from the company's health promotion prcgram. 4 Conmunication through informal leaders, Identily the informal leaden and opinion makers in vourblue-collar population. especially when you are introducing a new health promotion program. Talk with employees. con- duct f(rus groups, or meet with those who have been around a while and know who the opinion leaders are. AAer you identiry the informal leaders, you must try to get them to buy into the program. Once they are sold on your plan, they will spread the word. Spend time and resources selling the health promotion progmm to the informal leadeN. Other blue-collar coworkeF are more likely to adopt the program if they receive the message from those they trust (and they may not yet trust you). Another strategy for boosting participa tion among blue-collar workers is taken from the Health Belief Model. Simply put, you shape the perceptions of the program and try to address the barders that keep employees away. Here are some methods: . Conduct screenings to help employees realize they are vulnerable and to deal with the \"it won't happcn to me\" syn&ome. Health fahs, payroll incen- literature, and presentations to safety meetings may help cxplain health risks. . Get a testimonial from someone employees know. For example, a coworker under treatment for lung cancer may speak to a smoking cessation class.. Surveys, fbcus groups. or open discw- sions also help identify barien and bcncfits to pafiicipation. 5, l,\u20acgal issues. New legislation and changes in benefit packages havc implications for health promotion programs. Inform employees about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) what it means to them. The ADA may helP health promotion managers sepamte unpopular practices from health promotion activities. For example, the health promotion program may be part of the medical department, which is also rcsponsible for drug testing. In short, the ADA allows employees to be pulled from seflice for drug use but not for being overweight (for follow-up: see Americans with Disabilities Act). 6, Adalress concems.

Whcn evaluating employee health claims, Union Pacific health promotion manage$ discovered that ilr 1987 the company's blue-collar workers submitted an average of 3.6 health care claims per employee per monlh. Therefore, the Union Pacific fitness center staff decided to attcmpt to increase the shop employees' aware- ness ofthe benefits ofa healthy lifestyle and ultimatcly their partici pation in the company's health promotion program. They conducted a series of three health fairs in Union Pacific's Omaha and Council Bluffs (Iowa) shops in January 1988- The fais were run by the fitness center staff, with help from other health organizations such as the American Heart Association, Ame can Lung Association, Ameri can Cnncer Socicty, and paramcdic students from a local university. The health fairs were intended to create greater interest in the fitness center and its programs, gcnerate more interest in the development of worksite fitncss programs. and inctease health awateness amonll company cmployees. A month before thc fairs were presented, staff contacted the appro pnate supcrvisors to gain their assurance that they would permit their cmployees 1() pafiicipate. and they posted flycrs on bulletin boards in allthc shops. The health fairs werc held in the shops themselves, to make it easy for the shop worke$ to attend. The fiiN were free. Elevcn stations includcd screenings for cholesterol, pulrnonary and blood pressure, with educational material and test results that included recommendations, four videolapemachines showing different educa- tional tapes throughout the day, and four stations with peninent pam- phlets on heallh. With a 70 percent attendance rate. fitness center staff concluded that this hard-to-reach market was indeed mnc\u20acmed about health Promotion. Instead of aiming their piograms at the people who are currently using the health promotion seNices. they went aftl]r the ones who are not. They took health seryices and heahh infomation to the target population and made it painless and easy for blue-collar worken to learn about health. Taking the Show on the Road The men who work on the steel gangs for Union Pacific Rallroad are always on the move. They gowher- ever there are problems with the track and stay until it is fixed. These men (no women) live on the tracks in train cars and are not in one location for long. Now that's a dilficult and hard-to-reach population! llnion Pacific has rcfurbished old railroad cals into mobile fitness centers. This concept is similar to that ofthc U.S. Na\\ry which has fitness facilities aboard some of its frigates. The train cals are about 9 feet wide and 54 feet long. The cars contain both strength ?uld aerobic equipment for a complete workout. Some cars are carpcted and have VCR and cable television capability as part of a sl\\{hannel individual stereo hook-up system. l]nbreakable mirors provide instant visual feedback, and the exercise graphics printed on the outside of the cars are a symbolofUnion Pacific's commitment to welLness. The fi1st two cars were outfitted in 1988, and four more have been sent out to the steel workers. Usage is high, and they have helped boost morale as well.

In fact, it is possible that the declining health of the population of the United States can be attributed directly or indirectly to the decline of the family.

Spillover theory asserts that there is a similarity between what occurs in the work environment al1d whal occurs in the famrll enrironment. In other words, happiness at work leads to happiness at homc. In addition, a person's work experiences aie assumed to influence what he or she does away from work and carry over into home life. Those attitudes affect how people think about themselves and other\", including their spouses and children. Spillover is generally discussed in temrs of positive relationships, butjob stresses can displace the potential for positive family interactions, while family stresses can create job disfunction. Alternatively the spillover in situations in which the wotk is boring or monotonous can result rn an \"energy deficit\" making the worker\"lazy,\" which in turn leads to the worker's not doing certain things at home or with family members. Because of greater intcrest in quality of life-linking work, health, and leisure-corporations, govem- ment, schools, and religious institutions will need to redefine relationships and expectations, and expeiment with new sefllces. Businesses are trying to become more supportive of families. Dana Friedman and Ellen Galinsky in lhetr bookWork and Family (199I) explain how work and family issues are reshaping some ofthe fundamental tenets of business life: . Keep 'our peAonalproblems at home. Obviously, when there is no ol1e at home, it becomes indeasingly difficult and unrealistic to adheie to this concept. 187Give them an inch and thcy will take a mile. This is based on the assumption that employees will abuse whatever pdvi- leges they are given. However, by giving them more flexibility, they can bc evcn more productive, Equity means teating everyone the same. Many managers believe that what you do for one you must do for everyone. They are not used to dealing with the kind of divefiity that currently exists. They may also be afraid that if they do not provide exactly the same responsc to all employees, a lawsuit will occur. But utilization studies of \"equal\" benefits indicate many employees have no use for the benefits offered and would appreciate choice. Benefit programs are provided fbr long- telm income security and protection. Cnmpanies are used to responding to catastrophes. Yet work-family prob lems call upon programs to respond not to the tragedies of life but, rather, to the drudgeries of life. It's the day-lo-day hassles that must be addressed, and this is new to managers. Benefit programs can only satisfy employees and make them happy; they cannot make people more productive. Frededck Herzberg's theories of motivation suggested that benefits are extdnsic to work and cannot motivate people to perform better. However, his research was conducted on male, whjle workers in the 1950s. It is likely that different things motivate the workfbrce of today. Presence equals pertbmance. The only way many managers can fecl comfofiable knowing that a worker is doing his or her job is if they are over seeing it. This strongly held colviction is what prevents managers from grant- ing time off or work at-home options. Again, it seems counterintuitive that cmployees could actually produce more if given more time away from the office.. Hours equal oufput.

The Post-Modern Nuclear Family The traditional post-modem nuclear Iamily accounts for less than 20 percent of households in the ljnitcd States. The tmditional picture of a male wage-earner committed to the support of a wil-e and several children makes up only about 1l percent of all families. Pcrhaps the greatest change is in the dual-workcr family and the single-parent [amily: aboul 40 percenl of lhe $ or k fnrcc is comprised of dual-earncr couples. and another 6 percent is single parcnts. Men are becoming more involved in family too. For most women and men today, the company and the lamily are th\u20ac two central institutions in lile. Changes in the workforce are accompanied by changes rn \\ alue!. creating lile and famil) How Family Matters Affect Work Here are some possiblc impacts of home and familv on the corporation: . Defiea.e in produclivity (lor qxirmple. a penon on a car assembly line may nol have his mind on his work ifhis teenage daughter did not come home the night befbre) . lncrease in pressure on supervison as gatekeepeN of corporate polic)' (for example, a mother comes to work 15 188 Heerrnv, Weu-ruv & Wrstminutes late three da)s a week because she carpools the kids to school and asks her supe isor to overlook her tardiness or allo* her to make up lhe worktime at lunch) . Increase in health benefit use (for example, an employee's spouse is being treated for alcohol abuse in an in- parienr lacilrr] wirh follos-up counsel- ing and family sessions) . Rise in employee expedations for corpomte involvement (for example, a survey is taken of the employees' family need. such as flextime and dependenl care accounts and nothing happens) . Expansion ofemployee benefits and family policies in such areas as child care, flextime. relocatjon, and travel (for example, a manager has been asked to relocate to the corporate headquarters, but the manager's spouse does not want to leave his job and move;the company may provide assistance in helping thc spouse find a suitable position or accommodate the manager with a similarly responsible position in the regional office) What Family Matten Cost a Company h 1991, a Family Life Education (FLE) program was conducted at Waste Management's corporate headquarters iL Oakbrook,Ill., by family lifc specialist Dr. Joy Segal. She looked at five areas of Iamily lile that cost a company money: 1. Costs of lull-day abselces due to family related illness. stresses, and sirnilar reasons 2. Time away from work ofless than a day, such as leaving early, arriving late, ortalking on the phone to a latchkey child 3. Productivity losses due to family stresses 4. Costs of company benefits used for family-related stresses, such as medical benefits, psychiat c benefits. and substance abuse programs5. Potential tumover costs when an employee leaves the company because of family stresses The results of the inte ention show that participants in the FLE program reported impacts into the workplace pior to the training which cost an average of7.2 percent of annual salary per pelson. After training, those impacts were reduced to an average cost of 3.4 percent of annual salary (with the largest savings being in decreases in benefit utilization). This was a reported savings to Waste Management, avemging 3.8 percent of annual salary for the em ployees responding to the survey. This study points clearly to the fact that even a small intervention in this case, 10 weeks of group-oriented family life educa tion based on the Systematic Training for Effective Parenting program {an have both dollar savings and an impact on health. What Companies Can Do Once the decision has been made to actively address work and family concerns, companies can choose from a variety of cost effective options such as these: Flextime Flextime allows va ations in start and stop times. The idea was imported from Gcrmany duing the 1970s largely in response to concerns about commuting congestion and energy. Today, it is also seen as a way to address family needs. In a 1981 study of325,000 employees by the Office of Personnel Management, flcxtimc users were found to spend more time with their familics, more time on household chorcs, and more time in children's school activities. The freedom to set their own work schedules enabled employees to spend less money for child care services. A study at two fedeml agencies found that flextime useis came to work earlier and gained rncreased family time in the c\\ening as compared to a cnnrrol group. txpertr say that altemative work schedules may enhance the quality of family rclationships.

Your child loses the house key and can't get into the house after school What will your employer allow you to do?Indeed, several studies indicate an improvement in morale as the result of flextime. A caution: Minor changes in a work schedule such as variations of a half hour at either end of the workday will not dramatically alter the time demands of a busy working parenl. Workplace Flexibility Many employees who perform a variety of tasks are interested in work at home options on an occasional basis, to handle last-minute emergencies or planned-for family obligations. This option may exist in corporations on a department by depart- ment basis but is rarely company-wide. Parents with formal work-at-home arrangements admit that this option does not preclude the need for child care assis- tance. It is difficult to be productive with a two-year-old tugging at o[e's sleeve. Nonetheless, working at home provides maximum flexibility, and parents can perform work tasks after the children have gone to bed or get child care assistance during the day. ft/ );)nz 190 Her-rnv, Weelrnv & WrseThe Quill Corp. in Lincoinshire, ll., has set up an in-house temporary services department staIfed moslly b) form(r full- time employees. Many of them are women who left the compaly to raise children and wanted to come back-but not full-time. New or Modilied Policies Most parents desire a period of time away from work after the arrival of a new child. Several studies indicate that the quit rate for ne$ molhers is considerably lo$er than commonly expected. About 14 per- cent of new mothers do not return after their period ofleave, but the single most important predictor of retention following childbirth is the availability ofjob guaran teed maternity leave. A 1987 study by the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) found that the accommodations considered most impor. tant were . Job-protected leave . Some Health imumnce coverage during leave . SufEcient paid time off for medical appointments and occasional sick days . Flexible scheduling that allows for adjustments in the work routine . A period of parenting leave following disability . Help with finding or paying for child care . A supportive supervisor The researchers found that the women who worked for the most accommodating companies (in other words, who had access to some of these benefits) were more satisfied with theirjobs, took fewer sick days, worked more on their own time, worked later into their pregnancies, alrd were more likely to return to work after the period of leave. The NCJW study maI well be justified: When companies are more accommodating, employees seem more likely to respond in kird.Training and Educ{tion Proglams Family life education programs in parenting, stepparenting, single parenting, and halancing work and family are a lo$- cost, highly effective way for corporations to respond to specific work and family issues. These programs can be conducted during lunch hours (so as not to take time from work) by an outside facilitator or a trained staff person. On-site Child Carc In the early years ofcorporate experi- mentation, most companies thought that the on-site child care center was the only way to respond to employees' child care needs. Today, the center is one ofthe least popular options because most employen are inlere\\ted in helping their employeer find or pay for child care within rhe com- munity child care system. The options of child care referral services and flexible benefits ofler assislance to a large number of employees for less money. Carc for Sick Kids A group of Minneapolis companies, including 3M, Pillsbury and Honeywell, contributed to the creation of a sick child care center for recuperating or mildly ill children. An Illinois medical center, Glenoaks, among many othen, has cre- ated the \"Under the Weather\" sick child care program and made it available to local corporations. A Washington, D.C., law firm, Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering, cre- ated an on-site program for emergency care situations. A coNortium of several companies in New York City, including Colgate Palmolive, Time [nc. Magazines, and the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher and Flom developed an in-home service that sends trained providers into the child's home in an emergency. Realizing that parents may want to be with their sick children, a growing number of firms allow employees to take their own sick leave to be used for family reasons, or they offer two additional days off for family responsibilities. A 1988 su ey of 521 large companies by The Conference HEAr I HY, WEALfiJY is in the worksite. At Farm Bureau in Des Moines. And mom and dad can take part in many of their children's activities such as \"kidercise\" at this company's child care center, or the kids can go next door to see just what their parcnts do at work. But most of the time the kids are just too busy to worry about business matters. In half-day activity sessions, they leam about things like bike safety or when to call 911. Older kids like the all-day sports camps con- ducted by area coaches and team playels. About 70 percent of the slots in this child care center run by an outside contractor are filled by Farm Bureau employees' kids. \"Employees pay a reduced iate too,\" according to Wellness Director Debbie Yount, who sa's thc 138 slots fill quickly because there's a waiting list. The Children's Place was the biain- child of an employee/management task force and just seemed a nec\u20acs sity for the nearly 1,000 cmployecs at this company where the workforce is 68 percent female. The Iowa Farm Bureau is a member of the Central lowa Wellness Council. Board found that two thirds offercd sick leave for family members 59 pcrccnt of which was unpaid. Infomation and Resources A nationally representative survey conducted for Fort&/,e magazine found that one of every three parents ol infants and toddlers and one of every four paients ol 192preschoolers had a \"difficult\" or a \"very difficult\" time finding child care. A number of studies also indicate that different types of child care affect parents at work. Companies raiely need to see absentecism data to know that parents arc absent when rcgular care arrangements break down. especially during school holidays or when tbeir children are sick. Many companies provide information to employees about child care through local and national rcsource and rcfcrral agcn cies. These agencies help parents find appropriate care and make them wiser consumeN of the care they purchase. Another way to supply information regarding family life issues is through regular or occasional parenting and elde_ care semina$ coveiing a range of topics hom \"finding quality care\" (that is, helping parents realize that child care is really eaily education) lL) hur! to .l invite local service pro viders to thc worksite to set up booths and distribute brochures and information about their services. At some companies, such as Waste Management, employee support groups have developed, encouraging parents to share problems and solutions wilh one another. Hcwitt Associatcs, a bcncfits consulting firm. has created a parent resource library that distributes videos, books, and other parenting informatjon. Dependent Care Cost.Reductior Plans On average, parents pay $3,173 each )ear for child care. I-acrors aff(cting co\\. are the form of care used, with center care being the most expensive; the age of the child. \\.rirh in[ant care often co\\ting moql: and the geographic location of the pro- gram, with care in the Northeast being more erpensive lhan care pro\\ idcd in rhc South. To help employees reduce the costs of purcharrng chrlJ care 'en rcrs. employer. may contract with individual vendors to create specific program discounts. Dis- HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WrsEcounts are typically offcred by profit- making chains of simulta- neously fill empty spaces. Othel compa- nies subsidize child care costs at a program of the employee's choosing. Such a vouchcr program is typically limited to employees whose family incomes are below $30,000. as a way to help those in greatest need and to limit overall costs. The most popular form of employer support for child care is a Dcpendenl Care Assistance Plan (DCAP) offered within a flexible benefit program. Section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code made child care a nontaxable benefit. Coupled with Section 125 of the lnternal Revenue Code, which permits employers to offer a choice in benefits, employees can use pre tax dollars to purchase dependent care ser vices. DCAPS are the most popular form ofchild care support from the business community because the company only assumes administrative costs. Latchkey Progams An estimated four to seven million children come home to empty houses or apartments after school. This crcates worry foi the parenis of school-age chil dren and therefore affects their employers. One study found, for example, that the average employee misses 13 days of work per year when their children are in self- carc, al home alone or with siblings com- pared to the average employee who misses seven to nine days. Although women's rates of absenteeism are generally higher than men's, men's slightly exceed women's when thc children are in sclf care: they miss an average of 13.4 days compared to women's l3 days. One explanation for thls is that men take increasing responsibility for their children as the children grow older. Switchboard operators always know when school's out. Their lincs are filled with kids \"checking in\" with mom or dad at work. Hallmark has responded to the problem by contributing to a phone-in service that children can call when they arrive home or when they need assistance or someone to talk to. Harlrnr, We,r.r-tttv & WrseIDEAS Ar WoRx Juggling Wo* and Fanily CUNA Mutual offered an extra hand to help employee parentsluggle family issues whilc managing their career. When the health promotion department sponsored Work /Family Day at the company's headquar'teN, more than 700 employees, their children. parents, grandparents, and friends attended. \"We know the whole individual is the product of his or her home, family, and friends, as well as the work environment, coworkers, andprofes sional activities,\" said President and CEO Richard M. Heins who gteeted familics at the event. The afternoon of videos, workshops. demonstrations. toum, and activities for children and adults helped everyone. \"My mom is a secretary at CUNA Mutual,\" said the caption on one of the awatd-winning da\\,l'lngs.\"Shejob shares so she canbe home with me every other week.\" Goals of the day were to inoease awateness of community and com- pany seflices available to employees and theii families and to show how corporate health promotion supports work and firmily.

Elder Care Employee needs assessmcnts indicatc that approximately 20 pcrccnt ofworkc$ cunenlly care for an aging relative. More intensive carc is provided by about 6 to 8 pcrccnt ofworkers. A survey at lhe Travelers Companies found caregivers providing roughly 10 hours of care pcr week. About 10 percent provided 35 hours of care each week. Bctween a third and a half of employed caregivers are responsible for an elderly relative living rnore than 5 miles away. Caring for elderly rclativcs may be more complex than child care because it involves the coordination of a variety ofsocial services such as transportation. medical, legal. housekeeping, and personal services. Employed caregivers often musl use company time for researching and confei-ring with doctors. finding homc health caie, visiting nursing homes, and applying lbr Medicarc. In a survcy conducted by the Ncw York Business Group on Health, two- thirds of companies found caregiven use the telephone excessivcly and sffess and strcss rclated illness than other employees. even those with children. ln a survey of employees at 33 companies, researchers lound that 55 percent of the women and 50 percent of thc mcn reported being inter- rupted at work as a result of their elder care responsibilities. Most of the companies responding to employees' elder carc nccds provide inlbrmation and counseling about the array of available services. Some, such as Waste Management. go onc stcp further and provide psychosocial support by having -'lo,,:-o\\ cari[8\" support groups available to those in need of help. While child care and elder care supports are necessary in order to get to work, the greatest stress for this \"sandwich genera- tio[\" of employees may be caused by the rigidity of the workday and their ability t- handle emergencies or arrange family obligations as problems arise. Flextime allows employees caught between parenting their own children, and parenting their parents, to manage their workday and their family life. Companies Respond to a Changing WorKorce In addition to the desire to create a healthy, productive workforce, thele are othet reasons for a colporate response to work and family. TheY includel . Changes in the labor fiarket Wotk' force 2An, the repofi cnmmissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor and published by the Hudson lnstitute, outlined the effects of a labor pool that \\ is smaller and less prepared to deal with the demands ofjobs requidng increased communications and technological skills- Slower labor force growth means that economic growth cannot come from merely hidng more people, as U.S companies did in the past.

Companies have shown that women and other minorities cannot succeed with rules designed for white male breadwlnnen or rn an environment where they are penalized for taking advantage of the company's flexible policies.

How does a company compensate an otherwse desewing individual who cannot get the promotion or mmer office expected? Family-supportive policies ate some- times used as part of a strategy to keep desired employees. Company suveys conducted by the Famfies and work Institute suggest that indeasing num- ben of workers are willing to trade the fast hack for a life with a better balance between home and work. Child care mandates. Threats of gov- emment mandates, such as antismoking legislation, may also motivate some employen to respond. While no bill has created mandates for the provision of child care support, mandated parental leave exists in 13 states. Four of those laws include time off for elderly rela- tives as well as for the birth or adoption of children. Experts predict an increase in the number of states that will pass such a measure since close to 30 states have leave bills somewhere in the legislative pipeline, and proposed federal measues have been enacted. Some companies, in anticipation of such mandates, have improved the provi- sions of their leave policies. lmprove produciivity. Companies can no longer hire rnore people when they need to increase production. Rather, they must intensify the productivity of the people theyhke. This need is likely to result in sigificant change ill the way work is stnrctured and in the way people are organized to work. Beneffts for the surviYots\" Some companies in the midst of downsizing or layoffs have allowed family issues to emerge as a way to boost morale of the remaining employees. After becoming\"lean and mea4\" companies are eager to keep the most valued employees and have them work productively with fewer resources. \"Survivor benefits\" have become popular family support 195ive policies among them. For instancc, AT&T developed its comprehensive work family agenda after massive layoffs. Union negotiations Work and family issues also appeal to the labor move- ment as a strategy for increasing union membenhip. Unions have similar prcblems of recruitment that corpora- tions are experiencing; thus, child care and other family issues have reached the bargaining table. raised by both sides in the negotiation process. For instance, joint labor,management committees have been responsible for the $l0million Family Care Develop- ment Fund sponsored by AT&T and the $3 million fund negotiated at l.n NEX. 196 HEALTHY, WEALTHY & W$ESelf-Care Gene Drabinski Mary, the mon, has been asleep fot only an hour or so when her t,,,,,O_year oA son comes in the room crying and coughing.

Mary, the benefits manager, knows that most hcalth care cost-containment efforts have focused on managing the provider side of care: bargaining for lower-cost visits, insuring care is given at the least expensive site, making sure the care is medically needed and is of high quality. Medical self care programs tbcus on the employer's greatest cost'control resource: the employee. By helping employees make better decisions about the care they need and how best to get it. Mary can impact the demand side of the health care cost equa tion. Self-care programs are inexpensive, easy to implement, and enthusiastically received. Unlike participation in fitness, stress, or nutrition programs. self-care programs often involve 90 to 100 percent of emplolces. In addirinn. sclf care pro- grams produce measurable bcnefits that are visible from day one. First-year return- on-investment ratios avetage around 2.5 to 1.

No malter how low lhe cost, health care is no bargain if it provides no benefit. What's in it for me? The employer Every time employees makes a decision about health care, you have an opportunity to help make that a better decision. When you begin helping employees improre their most common decisions such as what to do when faced with a health problem at home you can build a strong foundation for continuing improvement. People improve a little at a time. Waiting until very complex and potentially expensive health care decisions need to be made before asking the employee to become involved provides little opportunity for gradual, incremental improvement. I The potential of medical self-care education to impact health care costs far exceeds that of lifestyle-based education. al Thomas Golavewski and colleagues\"A Benefit-to-Cost Analysis ofa Worksite Health Promotion Program\" Journal of Occupational Medicine December 1992 At least seven controlled evaluations of comprehensive self-care programs have been reported in the medical literature, and hundreds more have been completed informally at the worksite. All seven published studies report a reduction in visits to phlsrcianr. AllhouSh some sludie< lacked statistical significance, the magni rude oI the reduclions is relatively consis tent, ranging from 7 to 24 percelrt fewer visits to the doctor.Worksile evaluations, ranging from lhree monlhs lo one )ear a[ler starting a self-care program, show similar positive responses. Over 70 percent ofparticipants con\\isrenlly reporl using self-care guides six months after a program; 50 to 60 percent use the information they were given through their employer to prepare for physician visits; and 30 to 50 percent say self-care information helped them avoid unnecessary medical costs. Wherever self-care programs have been studied, the results have been positive. The cost is small and the payoff is big for the employer. The employee Employees are being asked to play larger and larger roles in health care cost containment. From cost-sharing and flexible benefits to precertification and point-of-service options, employees now have more responsibility than they had only a 1-ew yeals ago. Self-care prognms provide the tools and training that enable employees to success- fully take a more active role in their health and their health care. Employees don't make unnecessary trips to the emergency room because there is nothing good on TV. They often go to the emergency room because they lack the information, compe- tence, and confidence needed to make a better decision. Self-care helps them improve their competence without rest ct- ing their choices or limiting their access to care. The workplace health promotion planner Because self-care is used unive$ally and most people wish they were better at it, self-care programs are always well received by employees. Self-care workshops are fun, participative, and focus on the con- cerns ofthe participants, not on the con- cerns or agenda of the facilitator.

Health workc$ in rural Mexico hold village self-caie discussion groups so that families can learn hom each other's expedencc. It is clear fhat leaning sell-care can lake many forms. At today's worksite, self-carc programs usually come in one of three models: . A self care book is distributcd to employees. . Employees rcccivc a sell-care book and participate in workshops oi vjdeo-based lmlnlng. . tsooks and workshops are provided, and employees are encouragcd to use a telephone-based health information service for expanded information. Each of these modcls has certain costs, logistical challenges. and benefits. Al-EMERGENCY RO^9MGIV, that rcsull\\ are worth the resources you invest, each ol these models can work for you. Here are some things you need to know about each approach. Dist bute Medicel Self-Care Books This is the easiest method of implement- ing a self-care program. Simply purchase the self-care book your company thinks will work best and distribute it to employ- . If you have a male-dominated work- force and leel other family members may be more involved in health care decisions, consider mailing the book to employees at home. . If some of your employees prefer reading a language otherthan English, ask if the bookyou have chosen is available in tle language they want. . Some self{are programs will also let you customize the coverofthe book. If you believe thi\\ Llption raill(ncourage yotu employees to use the book. ask about it. How you give a gift is often as important as the gift itself. lf you stack the books up at the time clock, some employces will takc them home afld use them. Personal]y distributing the books will probably en- courage more employees to use them. The greatest sk in simply distributing the books without any educational session is that employees may believe you are telling them nol lo go lo lhe doclor. I hi: beliefcan defeat your self care program and build resentment instead of confi dence. So make sure your distribution method gives you Ihe opportunity to explain the intent and goals ofself-care. Cost of distributing books: No more than $10 per employee. Distribute Books Plus an Educational Program Ifyou show employees how 1() use a self- carc book to solve a problem (preferably aproblem oftheir own), you can dramati- cally improve the effectiveness of your self- care program, Self-care workshops don't give answers to health problems, advise participants on when they should seek professional care, or solve disputes on how best to treat a cold. Self-care workshops let participants learn from each other and practice solving problems by using their self-care book. They can also provide an opportunity to discuss topics as diverse as how to get the most from a physician visit and how to use your benefit plan wisely. If you dccidc to sponsor self-care work shops, you will incur the additional ex- pense ofgiving employees time off to attend the workshop. This expense can be offset by holding the workshop during safety meetings, staff or crew meelings. or employer-sponsored lunch meetings. While the \"book-and-workshop\" approach costs more to implement, you can safely predict more positive outcomes than the\"book-only\" approach. Finding the right workshop presenter can bc a challengc. Many cmployers look to hcalth professionals as presenters, and lhey are knn$ledgeahle. inlerested in the topic, and usually enthusiastic. Health professionals, however, can be 1oo \"ex- pert\" for your audience, can lapse into professional jargon, and can be more interested in giving the \"right answer\" than in empowering your cmployces. Safety committee leaders. supe isors, and other respecled membe$ ofyour workforce can be lrained to lead self care workshops. and they do as good a job as anyone else. The only prerequisites for a self-care workshop leader are an interest in the topic and respect for and the respecl of the audience. Training for workshop presenters is important. Whether you usc intcrnal or e\\ternal presenters. make.ure the) ha\\e been trained to teach self-care.

Cost for book and workshop: Cost of the book + Cost of presenter training + Cost of the workshop. Should not exceed $20 per employcc. Books, Workshops, aIId Telephone-hased lnfonnation Many employers have expanded their employee health information by subscrib- ing to telephone-based care counseiing seNices. One examplc of such a program is the Carewise service offered by Em ployee Managed Care Corporation (EMC) of Bellevue. Wash. The CarcWrse service offers employees tollfree access to Carewise nu$es, who help employees become experts on their own health prob lems. The nurses help individual callers understand the medical problem and the treatment options available. They also help develop <luestions to be asked at the next physician visit. The Carewisc nurses do not practice medicine;they do not diagnose or piovide any treatment. Their sole purpose is to coach, counsel, and inform thc individual so that he or she can become a bettcr medical consumer.

How will you promote your program'l How will you keep the self-care ball rolling after the books are distributed or when the workshops are over? How can you keep your employees remembering self-care? Sit down with a calendar and think through the next 12 months. Doyou publish a newsletter or subscribe to one? Newsletter articles on topics dealing with self-care that refer to your self-care text are a\\ailable lrom some self care compa- nies. These articles can be printed in your company newsletter or in any major health newsletter. Besides a icles, you can have quizzes that require empioyees to look up answers in the self-care text. Prizes will help molivale conlestanls. Fvaluations oI lhr progmm and testimonials from employees who have successfully used self-care resources are also good ways to keep sending the message to your employees. A little time, imagination, and assistance from your self-care company can give you a solid, well-thought-out one-year plan. Your employees can help you plan the second yeai. 3. Evlluate early and often. Before you start, define your goals. Do you want to reduce unnecessary utiliza- tion? Provide a value-added benefit? Help employees do a betterjob or take a more active part in their health care? Once you have decided on your goals, build in a regular means for evaluating them. Can you get outpatient claims data? Can you send surveys to employees' homes? Can you simply ask your employ- ees during meetings how they use or like the program? The more you evaluate, the better your results will be. And don't forget: Every time you ask employees about self-care, you reinforce the self-care message.4. What aboul new employees? There are three steps to changing behavior. First, people must know aboul the new behavior: second, they must practice the new behavior: and third. the) must prefer the new behavior. Using a self-care manual at home for everyday questions and to help them prepare for a doctor visit is a new behavior for most people. The very best way to encourage this behavior in new employees is to have an employee $ ho has gone lhrough all three steps introduce the book and progmm to them maybe during new employee orientation. Try to select employees who have successfully used your self care progmm. Peer counseling is a powerful way to keep the self-care message alive.

Weelrnv & WrspIDrAs Ar WoRX IN Tm CoMMUNTTT Stay Healt\\ Georgia Eight metro Atlanta and North Georgia hospirals tcamed up with a local NBC TV affiliate and metro Atlanla shopping malls to provide free health screenings, health infor- mation, and demonstrations to the community. The pilot project spanned one year, with ftee health screenings conducted by health care prclessionals each month. All eight hospitals are part of the Voluntary Hospitals of America. Stay Healthy USA is a national prqect ofvoluntary Hospitals of America, and Stay Healthy Georgia is the state effort. VHA is the nation's largcst alliance of locally owned and operated not-for profit hospitals. The health evcnts werc promoted by the third partner in this community eveflt the TV station. The goal is to enhance the involvc ment of cornmunitv hospitals in community disease prevention and health promotion. Standards for this program are the Healthy People 2000 national health objcctives. Specitic health goals were sclected becausc thcy could be addressed through screenings, evcnts, and demonstra- tions. The events were held at metro Atlanta shopping malls.

Reaults: Events averagcd about a thousand parlicipants cach, and afterthe firct nine months. morc thao 23,000 had participated ovcrall. Screenings/events were usually held weckdays lrom noon to 8p.m. Follow-up: Individual hospitals kept a copy of each participant's results for follow-up. Anyone with abnor- malsoeening results was rcferred to a personal physician or to the hospital's physician referral program. Additional follow-up activities included mailcrs on specific appro- priate topics sent to pafticipants at home. PlanneN of these events observed that some participants used these events as their p mary care. Many had limited financial resources. but thcy were seen frec by physicians even afterthe health events so that medical problems could be diag- nosed and trcated.

Pranschke As group health care costs have skyiock- eted, some employers have embraced wellness programs in an effort to hold dowll these costs in the short and long term. Wellness programs may be tied to group health plans through the use of incentives such as lower premium rates or ilcreased flex plan credits. and through penalties such as increased premiums or relativelv lower flex credits. By shifting increased costs to those who are less healthy. a health care plan and i1s corresponding wellness program may decrease current co.l\\ and lromise lonts- term savings due to healthier participants and lower claims experience (for follow- up: see dsk Ameticans ||ith Disahilities Act, wellness progtut 1s, henlth care reform, Co BRA tlisclosure requirements under ERISA, and compliance with IntertMl Revente Cotle requirements for favorable tar trcatment of benefits.

The ADA generally piovides that an employer may not discriminate against the disablcd, including in its wellncss programs. How do wellness programs fit into the ADA picture? Those persons who are targeted by wcllness prognms people with high blood prcssure, obesity, and high cholesterol, to name only a a wellness program i. illegal under the ADA. Although the ADA affects wellness programs. the law does not prohibit them- Employc$ may still offer wellness pro- grams that distinguish among employees based on certain factors. Employers that are subjcct to the ADA should reconsidei and redesign their wellness programs to conform to the specific guidelines and applicable rules of the ADA. This discus sion desc bes the ADA and how to avoid lcgal problems when dcsigning a wellness program, Who are the Disabled Pe$ons Ptotected by the ADA? The disabled persons protected by the ADA are . Those people who have a mental or physical condition that substantially limits one or more oftheir everyday aclivities. such d. \\ alkrng or working. . Those people who have a history of a disability, and . Those people who arc regarded as disabled. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is the fedcral gov- ernment agency charged with interprcting and enlorcing lhe ADA. The FFOC has not provided a laundry lisl of conditions that are disabling, so anyone who meets the general standards will be protected by the law. The EEOC has stated, for ex- ample, that even obesity may be a disabil- HEALTH\\, WE ar rHY & wrsEity in certain circumstances. In addition, former illegal drug abusers who are not currently using illegal drugs and alcoholics are \"disabled\" under the ADA, comprising a large percentage of the disabled in the United States. while the definition of a disability is broader than the meaning many people commonly undcrstand- it is important to remember that a person with a medical condition is not necessarily disabled ifhe or she is nol substantially limited by it. What Does the ADA Prohibit? Under the ADA, an employer must not discriminate against disabled employees and job applicants on the basis of disabil ity. The ADA also prohibits discrimina tion with regard to fringe benefits offered to employees (whether or not administered by the employer). In addition, employers subject to the ADA cannot discriminate against the disabled with regard to any other term, condition, or privilege of employment. An employer cannot refuse to hire a qualified disabled applicant due to in- creased insurance costs or a lack of cover- age. An employer al\\o ma) nol di\\crimi- nate against a pe$on because that peNon is associated with disabled persons. For example, an employer cannot discriminate against a percon who volunteers at an AIDS clinic or against a person who has a disabled dependent who may increase insurance costs. An employer's group hcalth plan may apply uniform limits on benefits, but only if it does not target the disabled in ordcr to evade the ADA. The general ADA rules against discrimination thus encompass group health plans and may particularly affect those that coordinate their cost- containment strategies with wellness progmms. Wellness Proglam Design Features: Rewards snd Penalties All employers offering wellness pro grams or adopting them for the first time must evaluate whether theii programs Hrerrnv, Wt,lr-trv & Wlsemeet their goals and are valid under the ADA. The rnain issue raised by wellness programs rspecially behaviorchange programs is whether nondisc mjnatory treatment of disabled or potentially dis- abled employees protected by the ADA may involve penalties and rewards tied to employee health plans. Employees who successfully complete their wellness programs-as shown by lower blood pressure, for example may receive rewards, also called \"carrots.\" Examples ofrewards that may be tied to a group health plan are benefit enhance- ments (for example, greater life insurance coverage for nonsmokers), lower deductibles, premium reductions, and extra cafeteria plan credits. Employees who do not participate, or who do not participate successfully, as shown by unchanged or worsened health factors, may be penalized. Example of such penalties, also called \"sticks,\" that may be tied to group health plans are limited or no access to coverage, reduced coverage, reduced benefits, and surcharges for lifestyles related to poor health. To illustrate, assume an employee is overweight by over 50 pounds, as shown on his health questionnaire. His employer's wellness program may offer him covemge only for illnesses or accidents not related to his obesity. The prognm also could offer him the same covemge as other partici- pants. but impose a $50 a month surcharge if he fails to decrease his weight by a cefiain amount after a specified period of time such as three months. Wellness Prcgrams Under the ADA The ADA affects how wellness pro grams and employee welfare benefit plans intertwine through the use ofincentives and penalties. Under federal law, the ADA requires employers to afford disabled employees \"equal access to whatevet health insumnce coverage the employer provides to other employees.\" These rules apply to insured and self insured plans. An' limil\\ on coverage lor cerlain proce- dures or treatments or limits on reimburse- 209ments must be applied equally to individi'- als with and without disabilities. EmployeN must not offer a wellness program that violates this equal access rule, or other ADA rules. but several provisions in the ADA support the concept that employers may continue to offer wellness programs tied to employce health insurance plans. While equal access is required, an employer is not expected to ensure that the disabled receive the same results ofben efits or \"precisely the same benefits and privileges.\" This rule indicates that an employer may disti[guish between low- sk and high-risk employees in employee benelits lhrough \\aellne\\\\ programs \\ ith out violating the ADA. Everyone would have an equal opportunity to receive the health benefits, and that any differences ln benefits and privileges would be permis- sible because they need not be precisely the same as those received by nondisabled employees. As penalties under wellness programs become greater (or incentives unattainable), however. this argument becomes weaker, The ADA also \\lale\\ Ihat \"permissible underwriting practices\" do not violate the ADA. Underwriting is generally the process of assessing and assuming certair risks, while excluding othe$. This under- writing exception indicates that employers may offer wellness programs tied to re- wards and penalties in an insured or self- insured group health llan. Some emplo)- ers, especially smaller ones, hope to rely on this underw ting rule to exclude certain high-risk people entirely from coverage, just as some insurers do. The meaning ol the ADA underwriting rule is unclear, so caution is the watch'word when denying or reducilg coverage. Nonetheless, if an employer treats employecs fairly and evenly, the risk of a lawsuit is greatly ieduced. Specific ADA Issues in Wellness Programs When designing a wellness program to comply with the ADA, employers should consider the applicability of reasonable 210accommodation within the wellness pro- gram, confidentiality of medical informa tion, and voluntary wellness programs, which are clearly permitted under the ADA. What is reasonable accommodalion? Employers subject to the ADA must provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees to enable them to perform their jobs, and this requirement extends to all employee benefits. Reason- able accommodations are modifications or adjustments lhat enable disabled emploJ- ees to enjoy equal henelirs and pri\\ ileges of employment as provided to similarly situated nondisabled employees. What is { reason{ble accommodation in a wellness prcglam? The reasonable accommodation obligation will mean that an employer ollering a wellne.is incenlive for a lifestyle or behavior change-such as reduced premiums for lowe ng weight or .laying uilhin normal werght guidelines- should modify the program for someone with, for example, genetic obesity who is not able to participate. The person in this case may be considered disabled and unable to lower weight but could be required to do moderate exercises or read about nutrition or lower some other factor such as heafl mte instead ol losing weight. This legal requirement should not be difficult or expensive to satisly in most wellness programs, Nonetheless, an employer should understand what reason- able accommodation means and should follow specific guidelines to assure that its wellness program is firm, yet llexible. When does an employer offer a reason- able accommodation? The reasonable accommodation process begins with the disabled employee, who must ask for a reasonable accommodation. Although the ADA does not require it, an employerwith a weliness program probably should state before-the-fact that an accommodation is available for a disabled person who sub- mits acceptable evidence of disability. For example, il lhe employer desc bes the wellne\\\\ program in a compan) polic). lhi! statement can appear there. If the wellness program is coordinated with the Heerrnv, Wrartrr & Wrseemployer's health plan through incentives or penalties, the group health plan docu- ment and summary plan description should describe the program and mention the availabilit) of an dccommodation. (Tt the plan sponsor omits this information, it may violate ERISA.) Does an employer have lo modify its wellness proglam eyery time an employee rcquests a ce sin change? No, employe$ are not at the mercy of every employee's request. Employers may require employ- ees to submit medical proof of their dis- ability when needed or desired for the accommodation proc\u20acss. While the em- ployer and employee should work together to consider effective accommodations, the employer makes the final decision on what adjustments will be made. How will rersonable accommodation work where the employer coordinales its group health plan with its wellness pro- gram? Let's assume an employee has genetic high cholesterol, and his employer's wellness program requires an employee with high cholesterol to lower rhe choleslerol le\\el or pay $50 a monlh in additional health care plan conlribulions. After the employee initiates the reasonable accommodation process by requestilg a reasonable accommodation, the employer requests medical proof of a disability. The employee then proves the existence ofthe disabling hereditary condition through medical oprnron\\ \\taling he has this condi- tion which substantially limits the em- ployee in a life function considered by the ADA. The sponsor of the wellness pro- gram should then rely on the flexibility il has built into its wellness program. Pursu- ant to its flcxible program, the employer either should not penalize this disabled pe$on or should offer him the same benefits. What Are the ADA Cotlidentiality Rules? Under the ADA, all medical informa- lion relaling lo applicants and employees must be wrilten on separale forms. kepl in separate medical files, and treated as confidential medical records. This rule applies to all medical information, rcgard- Herlrnv, Weerrnv & Wseless of how it is obtained, including all information relating to employee health plans and wellness programs. The only four exceptions to this confi- dentiality are di\\closure to workers com_ pensation officials as required by law, supervison and managers of informalior regardlng necessary restictions on work and duties of the employee and necessary accommodations, first aid and safety peNonnel, when appropriate, if the disabil- ity might require emergency treatment, and government officials investigating ADA comDliance. In addition. the ADA regulation; provide that medical informa- tion \"shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with\" the ADA. Does ar employer Yiolate the ADA when it uses medicll infomation oblained in r wellness prognm to detemine whether certain employees should be chaqed a different rate for group heallh covenge? This depends on how the information was gathered. Specific rules for use of an applicant's records and an exception in the ADA for voluntary wellness plans imply that these two sources of gathering information may be the only proper ways for an employer to evaluate and monitor wellness. An employee's post-offer medical examination might be OK to use to detemine rate differences for group health coverage. May an employer consider infomttion relating to the health ofjob applicmts snd currenl employees when determining whether people are \"well\" for insumnce purposes? The information that may be used for \"insurance purposes\" is limited to that obtained from ajob applicant in the course of a Dost-offer medical examination. This exception relating to applicants is the only provision ir the ADA pe.mitting use of the medical information for \"insurance purposes,\" which probably includes most wellness programs that treat employees differently under group health plans based on health sk factors- Therefore. an employer should not use other types of medical examinations. or information relating to current employees, to evaluate or monitor risks in a behavior/lifestyle change program. 217This means employers cannot consider the results of fitness-for-duty examinations. annual physical examinations. medical claims records. or physical examinations of late entrants for coveiage by group health plans, to name a few. For example, if an cmployee is requircd to have an annual physical which reveals diabetes, the em- ployer could not use the information to charge the employee higher premiums for group health corerage. Any t|fference. rn covemge or cont bution levels under a group health plan would have to be based on post-offer medical information only. As a practical matter. this app.oach would lead to discrimination because an cmployee would ncvcr have an oppofiu nity to demonstratc improved health. Regardless of how the rule fails 1o prevent discrimination, the important rule to remember is that employers generally cannot gather medical inlormation to evaluate and monitor health isks under. group health plan. except in the limited mannei allowed under voluntary wellness programs. What Are \"Voluntary Wellness Programs\"? Under a specific ADA rule, an emplover may conduct a voluntary medical inquiry or examinatiolr as part oi a voluntary employec health promotion program available to employees at the worksite. Voluntary wellness programs are an cxception to thc ADA's general rule prohibiting an emplover from making medical inquiries. The general mles on confidentiality of medical information still apply. and the information \u20aclathcred for thc wellness program may not be used for any purpose inconsistent wilh lhe ADA. May employers use the medical infoma- tion obtained from the yoluntary wellness program lo charge employees dilferent insurance rates lhrough penalties or incentives? Does the lerm ttvoluntary employee health program\" include l wellness program tied to employee heallh coverage? The legal guidance on volun- tary health programs is sketchy, but the answer to both questions appca$ to be\"no.\" The EEOC states: 212fEmployee heahh] programs oJien include, for example, metlical screening for high blood pressure, weight control counteling, and cancer detection. VoI- tntary activities, such as blootl pressure monitoing arld the of prcscription drugs, such i^sulin, are aho pemitted. It shoLtLl be noted, ho||ever, that the medical recorfu developetl in the course of such acivifies must be maintained in the conJ lential manner Jbr anl purpose it violalion of this part, such as limiting health insurunce eligibilitl. This statement indicates that voluntary wellness programs where the purpose of any medical screenings is cost-contain- ment, not disease detection, is not a volun- tary employee health program as defined by the ADA. Tying behavior change programs to a group health plan is risky because an employee could assert that medical infor mation is being used for an improper purpose-limiting health insurance eligibil- ity, as prohibited by the EEOC. How should we interpret the \"Bona Fide Employee Benefit Plan\" exception? Despite these warnings, an employer ma) restructure a behavior change program to fit within ADA guidelines. The ADA pro!ide\\ thal emplolerr. insLrred anrl r<ll- insured, rnay establish, sponsor, obsewe, or administer the lerms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on underwriting risks, classifying risks. or administering such risks that are bascd on (or not inconsistent with) state law. The plan must not be used as a-sublerfuge ro e\\ ade rhe purposeq of lhc ADA. Under the ADA, an employer cannot use such a plan to deny a disabled em- ployee equal access to insurance or \"sub ject lhim or her] to different terms or conditions ol insurance based on disability alone, ifthe disability does not pose in- creased dsks.\" Thcrcforc, if a disability does pose increased risks. the cmploycr may, based solely on the disability. subject an employee with that disability to differ. HEALTHY. WEALTHY & WrsEent terms or conditions of insurance. Provided an employer has sufficient data empirical evidencc, and actuarial supporL, the employer may charge a disabled employee a differcnt rate. so long as it does not do so as a \"subterfuge\" to evade the ADA's purposes. Is there any guidance on what not to do in an ernployee benefit plan? The em- ployer needs to be careful to avoid two situations that indicatc a group hcalth plan violates thc ADA. First, singling out one high cost illness for exclusion, while continuing to covei other high-cost illnesses, might be cvidence of a subterfuge (regardlcss of the over whelming cost of an illness such as AIDS). Second, anv dccision Io limit cerlain treatments \"should or mcdrcal (llicienc) or.ome other approf'ri ate. objective factor applied across the board,\" but these limitations still could be a subterluge in violation of the ADA. While these two rules do not address wellness programs, an employer should consider whether a wellness program operates in a similar way to excludc or targel the disabled for different treatment indicaling they do not have equal access to all benetits of cmployment. thc FLOC i. bcnefit plan compli ance with the ADA. The EEOC must address many general employment dis crimination charges, and Congress gavc the commission vcry little guidance on whcn employee benefit plans are a subtertUgc to evade the purposes of the ADA. The agency simply may allow the coufis to decide the issue. llntil then. employers should design lheir group h(allh plan. and corresp,'nding wellness programs to fit within ccrtain parameters. such as providing lor reason able accommodation, trcating everyone fairly, and avoiding reliance on improperly gathered or utilired mcdical information.Action Plan Seleding the Wellness Program . Analyze the employel's aggregate costs related to employee health, including insurance premiums or self_insured benefits, workers' compensation costs, lost work time, and wellness programs (lor follo$-up: .ec health claim dala). . Determine which health problems or mnditions generate most of the employer's health costs. Many employer's wellncss programs have targeted certain conditions and have missed thc mark. For cxample, target- ing a condition such as high blood pressure is not very effectivc ifprevent- ;ble childhood illnesses typically cost a particular employer more money . Based on this study of the costs of employce health carc. choose the type of wellness program which will reduce those costs. For examPle, ifan employer's most costly heallh claims result from on-the-job accidents and preventable chitdhood discases, the employer should select a safcty pro- gram and a disease prcvention program. Deciding Whether the Program Is Mandatory or voluntary . Determine whether the wellness program should be mandatory or voluntary. Under the ADA, as well as other applicable laws, education and satety programs maY be mandatory. On lhr menting lhe mosl con\\ervali!c po\\rlion unde the ADA and othcr applicable laws by implementing completely voluntary progmms. .

To take the mosl conscflative aPProach. the employershould not tie incentives or penalties to employee benefils but could give away mugs and'I'-shirts. for HEAr-THY. WEALTTIY & Wlsu 213example. (If the wellness program does not involve incentives or penalties of any kind, the program may be manda- tory without violating the ADA.) . The employer needs to weigh the risks involved with nonvoluntary prcgams with consideration for the program's design, as well as other factols, includ- ilrg the lreed for the progam and whether its employees have filed EEOC complaints in the past under other disoimination laws. Equal Access lo Wellness Programs r In any case. the employer needs to be aware of its responsibility to provide all employees with equal access to tle wellness programs (for example, eiual access to a health education training progam). Nonetheless, it is unlikely that any court would require an em- ployer to restructure programs such as exercise or health education proglams to addrcss and benefit the specific needs of a disabled individual. Physical Examinations and Medical Questionn&ires . Under the most conseflative approach, a wellness program should not require employees to take physical examina- tions or to complete a medical question- naire as a condition of receiving medical coverage or as a means to screen whether employees are meeting rc- quired standards to inrease health benefits. In addition, no penalties or incentives under these types of pro- grams should be related to the employee's health care plan. This doesn't mean that employees should not see a doctor before beginning an exercise progmm. . A less conservative (but feasible) approach is to require employee physicals and to offer incentives related to the employee's health care plan, but the employer should meet certain conditions. First, the employer should nolif] all emplolee.lhal a reasonahle accommodation will be made for any 21.4employee who shows he or she is\"disabled\" as defined by the ADA. Second, the employer should keep all employee medical infomation confi- dential under the ADA guidelines. The safest way to accomplish true confiden- tiality is to have a third party monitor the wellness program. Effecl of Wellness Progrrms on Employment Decisions . An employer should not make a decision about a welLness program without considering the impact of the program on other aspects of its relation- ship with disabled applicants and employees. lf an employer gathers medical information for use in a volurr tary wellness program, for example, the employer's decisions regarding a disabled emplolee may be challengeL based on the employer's knowledge regarding the disability. Although the ADA sets rules for confidentiality of medical records, the bwden shifts to tle employer to demonstrate that the proper procedures were actually followed, which may be difficult to prove. A discharged employee would argue that the employer discriminated against him based on a disability know to the employer, pitting his word against theirs. . An employer should consider who within the organization can have access to wellness information. An employer can screen the medical infomation from people making employment decisions and could take a very conser- vative position by having an indepen- dent third party administer the wellness program without any employer involve- ment and klrowledge. Be Appropriately Cautious While the ADA'S rules indicate that an employer may be able to offer all types of wellness programs, employers who offer such programs must be careful to comply with the guidelines of the ADA- Future guidanc\u20ac on the meaning of the ADA as it HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WlsEapplies to wellness programs is not ex- pected for some time. The EEOC has many serious issues to iesolve regarding the protection ofthe disabled, and guid- ance and enforcement efforts are likely to focus on discrimination in hiring and complete exclusion from employee ben efits rather than wellness progiams that have a less dlastic, immediate effect on the disabled. In addition, the focus of these enforcement effo s is likely to delay court decisions on this issue. Nonetheless, employers who cufiently oller r\\ellncs\\ program\\ lied to emplu]ee health plans (for follow-up: see risk rating and linking wellness to benefit plan design) and employers who want to implement wellness programs cannot take the \"waif alld-see\" approach. As the number of cmployees involved in a wellncss program increases, so does the risk of a lawsuit. In addition. given the value placed on health benefits by the disabled and the assistance of the EEOC in enforcement efforts, a lawsuit is a realistic possibility. By following the guidelines described here and modifying ucJlness program. a. the law develops, employers may ofler these programs while remaining approprr- ately cautrous.

Federal L\\press. and A1&T. The report was funded by a grant from the National Institute on Disability and Reha bilitation Research. According to the report, Congress is contemplating basic changes in income maintenance programs such as Supplemen- tal Security lncome and Social Security Disability Insurance that will provide retum-to-work incentives, and many states are moving toward adapting vocational rehabilitation policics as part of a larger strategy to reform workers compensation laws, The sourcebook cites several fundamen- tal strategies for developing an effective program. They include the following: 1. Build a human resource philosophy that values employees. 2. Gain senior management support, 3. lntervene early and regrlarly. 4. Develop case management capabilities.5. Create modified/light duty jobs to allow early retum to work. 6. Cultivate supervisors who allow and elcounge early retum to work. More specific strategies are also defiled in detail, and crite a used in determining which case management vendo$ to use have been developed by the Buick Oldsmobile-Cadillac group of General Motors and John Hancock Life Insurance Company. ADA and Disebility Managemenl With the passage of the Ame cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), disability management policies need to comply with Title I Equal Employment Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities. Company disability manage$ must be familiar with the ADA and review all personnel and disability management policies for compliance with the regula- tions (for follow-up: see Americans with Disabilities Act). For employers with 25 or more employees, the ADA employment provisions became effective July 26, 1992. For assistance with policy review and ADA audits, the EEOC Technical Assis tance Manual is a\\ailable from the federal government by calling (800) 669-EEOC. The Window of Suggestibility Why does one person retum to work following a disability while another be- comes captive to what is sometimes callecl the \"workers' disability syndrome\"? The answer is determined by the policies and procedures of sewice programs as well as chdracLcri'licr of thc disabled individuals themselves. Studies strongly suggcst that early intervention is a variable that can make a major difference in outcomcs. The sooner an individual can establish thc objective of returning to work, the more likely the goal will be met. One study says an injured worker commonly enten a highly suggestible state just following a disabling incident. Staff at 2L6 Hr,trrtw, Wur.nr & Wrsnthe Stout State Vocational Rehabilitation Imtitute conclude that this \"window of suggestibility\" is the key to rehabilitation success. The injured worker's immediate re- sponse to his or her injury is important. The longer the injured worker is not working, the easier it becomes to respond negatively and the chances of successfully retuming to a productive, meaningful lifc are significantly decreased. Other studie. say tha t quccesqtul reha- bilitation outcomes depend on prompt initiation of the rehabilitation process. Studies usillg lational samples have found that personality characteristics-especially those relating to independence-begin tu change within 60 days after injury. To illustrate,80 percent of a group ol cardiac palienls $ho were gi\\en counr(ling \\rithin two weeks after their hea attacks re turned to work faster than those who wcre not given counseling. IDDAS Ar WoRx Mainstr\u20ac5ming Employees with Disabilities The Mainstream Program at Princi pal Financial Group has saved more than $1 million since it began in 1 986. The goal is to rctum employees with pemanent or temporary disabilities to their original jobs, afler making accommodations for the limitations. Employees who are unable to return to their former jobs are used as temporary support in other offices unlil their abilities are matched to pemanent posrtrons, The 70 employees who have been mainstreamed in the past four years have had a 98 percent suocess rate. The company reported savings from reduced disability claims (Personnel J ournal, Ang.rst 1,992).Many companies now have \"early warning systems\" or \"prompt contact programs\" for instant reporting of injuries or signs of illness. These programs offer early support and guidance and have proven their value in intenecting the\"invalid psychology\" that ensnares some disabled workers for life. Simple Steps to Job Accommodation Accommodatilg disabled workers on thejob is not a mysterious process. Tt is. howevcr. a new task for many employeN and can create appreheNion. First, what is \"job accommodation\"? Simply. it is adapting the job site or the job function to fit the qualified disabled per- son. It need not be elaborate. expensive. nor burdensome. Employers should think in terms oI leasonahlr and common sensc solutions to making thejob site and job function woik for the qualified percent lound lhal accommodalions arr not prohibitively expensive. Some 51 percent provided accommodations at no cost, and an additional 30 percent cost between $1 and $500. This same sludy found that 80 percent of the accommo- dated workers felt their needs were being met, Many cxperienced employers gain additional benefits from job accommoda- rion: Redeqignedjob ta\\1. frcqu(nlly are safer and more efficient for both disabled and nondisabled workers; modifications to buildings, such as easily operated dools. benefit all employeesl the already qualified disabled worker becomes more valuable and productive for the employer. Job accommodation takes many forms It may be only onc change. or it may be a series of changes and adaptations. It really depends on the nature of the business, the plant, or office setting and, primarily. thc individual disabled worker. HEATTHY, WEALTHY . Building wider doors and aisles, elevatonj .

The company is self-insued and has a workforce of over 3.700 people. About 100 employees per year are served by what the company calls the Transitional Work Center (TWC). Over half of the injured employees retum to their formerjobs, less than a quarter are assigrled new jobs, and another quarter are involved in the TWC. Ifthe employee has special recovery needs or physical reslriclions that prohibit the employec's rcturn to the job, the Employcc Health Service staff refer thc pcrson to the TWC.

For worksitc health promotion pro- grams, liability exposures are specifically of concern. Four basic phases are often used when incorporating sk management into planning for a quality health promotion program: 1\u0000 Assessment 2. Development 3. lmplementation 4.

Dircctly: Every business has a widc variety of legal obligations. lf they don't meet these obligations, the company could be held \"dircctly\" liable. Thcse obligations are determined lrom various bodies of la\\l. which includc contracl law, written/s1atu tory law, and tort law. (A business nay also be liable vicariously, which means il might be responsiblc for negligent acts of its employees.) Contracts wlitten or oral agreements between parties-are oftcn used in health promotion programs. Examples of con- tracls used in healtb promotion programs are health history forms, informed con- scnts, medical releases. waivers, and third- party contracts. Third party conracts can includc agreements with vendon who providc programs or services oi with corporations that contract with businesscs to manage the entjre health promotion program.

Wpnt-rsv & WrsrWaiYers Company health promotion programs in housc fitness faciiities, or spicialcom- munity events such as runs or bike rides may require parlicipanl\\ lo sign a \\ aiver. It is generally thought that waivers do not absolve the company or event planner from liability fo. its negligence if someone gets hurt: however, waivers are encouraged to be used to spell out the terms of the program or e\\ enl and limil liJbilily c\\lo- sure to the extent legally possible. Again, health promotion program planners should check with legal counsel to determine if a waiver is appropriate. Written or statutory laws also apply to health lromolion proglamr. Frr erampl<. the health promotiol1 professional should be aware ofcertain provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and certain standards fiom the Occupa tional Safety and Health Administration (osHA). Onc OSHA standard, occupational exposure to blood-bome pathogens. which became effective March 6. i992. applies to employees who may be exposed to blood. In health promotion, this could apply to employees who provide emergency first aid as well as those who draw blood. A liability exposure could exist if the health promotion program did not adhere to both contracl and wdtlen/statutory law. However, the most significant exposures rn health promrrtion program. are rnadrert enl persoIral injuries. These kinds of injuries can result in ncgligcncc claims which are generally govcrned by tort law (Wotkers' compensation may also govcrn personal injuries.) Here are some suggestions for health promotion managers to identify risks in this area: . Examine court cases that have involved health promotion activitics that have resulted in personal injuries. . Review accident/injury reports from other similar programs. .Consult with experts such as lawyem alld isk mallagers who deal directly with facilities/cquipment for potcn tial problems.

A Heallh Promotion Manager's Nightmare Actual court cases have dealt with the following personal injuries in exercise settings: . stroke during a gaded exercise test . death from heart attack caused by graded exercise test . hactured arm from falling off treadmill . back injury while using exercise ma- chine . crushed trachea causing permanent damages when the barbell for a bench press fell onto the neck . quadriplegia resulting ftom dive into swrmmrng poor. electrocution while using whirlpool not properly equipped with ground-fault interruPter r cerebral pals) in child due to expo.urr to super-heated hot tub while pregnant . aggravation of hiatus hemia due to improper fitness instruction . back injury during an aerobic dance clas. due lo overcro\\ ded. improperll instructed class . severe brain damage resulting in permanent disabitty due to no immedi- ate administration of CPR by health,/ fitness staff after an apparent cardiac aIrest The health promotion manager, after reviewing these cases, should be able to determine (or speculate) what caused these injuries. Take it a step turther and ask: Can these kinds of injuries happen in our company's health promotion program? ln a.ses.ing the liability. a health promotior manager may a\\k the following que(lion\\ ahout the personal injuries iusl described .

Did staff properly screen participants wiLh kno\\ n mcdical conditions (prcg nancy. hiatus hemia) prior of the facilities? . wasn't CPR administered? Was it because staff weren't c\u20acrtfied or because there was no emergency procedure? By conducting this type of analysis. the health promotion professional can identify five major areas of concern regarding personal injury exposures associated with physical activity: . proceduresDevelopment: What Are the Program Goals? There are three basic steps in the devel- opment phase of risk management for health promotion programs: 1. Determine program philosophy 2. Develop risk management stmtegies 3. Develop a poliry and procedures manual A health promotion program should have a mission statement which rellects the philosophy, purpose, and goals of the program. If the program is desigled to improve employee health versus providc recreation, tbere may be some legal con- cens related to a medical model. Another philosophical issue to adtlre.s ir if thc hcalth promotion activities will be conduclcd during work lime or non \\ ork time. This is important because if an employee gets hurt while participating in hcalth promotion activities during work time, he or she will probably be covered under workers' compensation. lf an employee gets hun durrng non-uork tim< on the employer's premises, the employee may be able to bring a common law tort claim against the company if the company was negngenr. Hcalth promotion managcrs may want to review the workcrs' compensation laws that apply to their state (laws vary from state to state) and discuss these issues with:'r., ' -- ' I HEATTHY, WEALTHY & wlsE 223legal counsel when writing a policy ad- dressing this issue. If it is determined that an employee could sue the company, in the event of an injury, the program would need adequate general and professional liability insurance covemge. (Health promotion manageB may want to find out if they themscl\\e\\ are adequalely corered hy lhe company's liability insurance if an em- ployee were to sue and may also need to consider professional liability coverage.) Is it coYered by workers' comp? In a common law tort claim. an employec can sue for both economic (medical expenses and wage losses) and noneconomic (pain and suffer- ing) damages. However, the em- ployee must show that the employei owed a duty of care to the employee; the employer breached that duty and caused thc employee's injury; and the employee suffered legal recognizable injury. In a workers' comp claim. thc employee does not have a ight to make a cornnon law tort claim. The employee receives emnomic dam- ages (medical expenses and a certain percentage of his or her wages whjle I1ot being able to work) and is not eligib'e for noneconomic damages- These workers' comp belefi1s are paid on a no-fault basis, except if the employee intertionally injured himself or herself or perh aps was contributorily negligent. Another philosophical issue is whether to hire employees to manage and conduct the senices/programs within the health promotion program or to contract wilh third parties. In either case, certain legal considerations apply. For example, with a third-party contract. make suie the pro vider has liability insurance and a hold harmless clause within the contract. (oh, yes, have a written contract for these se lces.) The health promolion manager may then review standards established by otherc, especially those related to penonal injury. Several professional organizatjons such as the American College of SportsMedicine (ACSM), American Heart Association, the YMCA, the Americal Council on Exercise, and the Aerobic Fitness Association of America have published exercise program standards and guidelines to offer advice on the delivery of quality programs. I he ACSM .landards puhlished in lh( ACS M's Healtll/Filness Facilitl Standards ond Guidelines are the most highly re- garded because the American College of Sports Medicine is considercd the leading fitness authority in the world. ACSM srandard\\ addre\\\\ the frve major arcas ol concem regarding personal injury as identified in the assessment phase. By incorporating the ACSM standards in Ihe litnes\\ program.lhe heallh promo tion manager can be fairly confident of minimizing personal injury exposures. However, your facility may have unique situations not addressed by these national standards. For programs such as smoking cessation, stress management, nutition, and weight management, the best risk management strategy is to hire well-qualified and credentialed in5lructor\\. f.lablish a slan- dard or policy the ofthe health promotion program regarding qualifica- tions of peNonnel- That way when an employee steps forward and volunteers to conduct a prognm-and doesn't measure up to the standards-you will have a written policy to politely decline the otler. Once decisions have been made to incorporate isk management strategies into the heallh promotion program, record these policies and procedures in writing and develop all forms and documents. (For good examples, see AFB Guidelines for Employe Heahh Promotion Slan- dards and Guidelines.)

Evaluation: Have You Reduced Risk? lf an injury occurs. conduct an immcd.- ate evaluation as to whether all emergency procedures were followed according to the policy and procedure manual. lf they weren't, find out why.

For example, has the risk man- agement plan minimized liability exposures and do the benefits outweigh the costs? lnvolve the staff who carly out these policies and procedures in this evaluation. Risk management is an admini\\lrative process. It helps minimize liability for the company. With proper risk management policies and procedures ill place, a com- pary may offer a consistently higher quality program or service. This is only an introduction to some of the legal issues involved in health promotion. You are encouraged to consult with a lawyer to obtail a good understanding of the law and the liability and to find out how risk man- agement can enhalce your company's health promotion program.The Legal Test Two recent court cases used this test to determine if an employee's injuries were work related and eligible for workers' compensation: An Oregon car salesman was injured in a softball game while attending a company picnic. Employees who were scheduled to work the day of the picnic could either attend the picnic ot work. The court used a three-part test to determine if this recreational injury was work-related: 1. Did the injury occur during lunch, during a recreation period, or as a regular incident of thc cmplo',rnent? 2. Did the employer er.-pressly or implicidy require employee participa- tion in the activity? OR 3. Did the employerdedve substantial direct benefit lrom the activity beyond improved worker health and morale?In this case, the court used the second test and found that the employee was required to participate in the picnic or to work. (Town and Countr! Chrysler v. Mitche ,833 P.2d employee of a restau- lant chain was injured in a softball game. The employer had established a softball league consisting of teams made up of various employees of its different rcstaumnts. At the July 4th picnic, a trophy was awarded to the winning company team. The injured employee filed for worke$' compensation and won. The court used thc previous three-part test, but in this case, used the third part ofthe test. The softball program and the annual picnic were used to promote employee relations and to boost morale, but in addition, the court {uled the employer would derive substantial benefit from the activity.

Marlow s 1954 theory ofmotivation states that \"only unsatisfied needs provide the sources of motivation, a satisfied need creates no tension and therefore no motivation.\" Two factors play into motivation: 1. relative ease and ability to achieve an outmme or pdze; and 2- thc extent to which the rcward is \\rorlh$hile and lhe goal is achierable. If a person wants and values a reward, but believes that regardless of the efforts cannot achieve it, motivation will be low. And likewise, if a person believes that his or her efforts will produce a given reward but that the reward holds no value, motiva- tion will be low. lncentives are an integral part of any health promotion program. When deciding what incentives are involved or should be used in your health promotion programs and activities, do the following: . Determine your target population and their characteristics. . ldentify appropriate incentives. . Linl the incenlives ro the behavior or change. . Evaluate the impact. Determine Target Population Become a social scientist and under- stand the complexities of human behavior. It all people were clearly motivated by reason, incentives would be as unnecessary as health promotion. People would \"do the ight thing\" because it made sense. But individuals frequently are not mtional, and no one is motivated by the same things. What may incite and ignite one individual or group ofindividuals may have no stimulus for another. Not everyone is a world class athlete who is motivated by 229achievement for the sake of achievement Therefore, levels and a variety of activities and incentives are important to assure reaching a broad number of employees and/or family members and having the intended impact. Define )our target populalion and whal motivates them. Identify why do. wilh )ourself and ask.\"What personally moves me to action?\" Then ask your employees what would motivate them to participate or to make a change. Consider these factors when analyzing your largel audjence and decid- ing what incentives . . current health . cultuml and organizational norms . job and social status . values individual, group, and organizational If a financial reward is attached to a behavior change, for example, considei the organizational status and income levels of youl target group. Set the financial reward high enough to promote change or action remembering that it has a different value for an hourly worker than for a top execu- tive. \\lftee,'*shitt '* 230 HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WrsEldentify Appropriate Incentives Different incentives motivate individuals in a variety of ways.

Incentives range ftom the simple to the complex and include . rules, tegulations. and norms . avoidanc\u20ac of . . rcinforcement, rewards, awards, and recognition . goals . time r pleasure and fun . trinkets, prizes, and . food . competition financialrcwards. wellneq! rebate programs (for follow up: see rbk rating and linking wellness 10 benefit plan design) Rules, Regulations, and Norms Written rules and unwritten rules (norms) are powerful drivers of behavior and change. They set standards that must be met (conformity) and outline the consequences and penalties associated with not meeting them. They drive our daily actions and can quickly create changc. I-or example, state no-smoking legislation has created smoIefree uorl and pubhc envi- ionments at a more rapid rate than the previous decade of social piessure against smoking. Combined, the social pressure and regulations have dramatically affected the incidence of smoking in our society. Rules and regulations may include OSHA regulations, safety belt use. driving under- the-influence laws, and food labels. Avoidance of Consequences There are consequences associated with many activities sorne more negative than olhers. For erample. lhe negatire conse quence associated with smoking is lung cancer; the negative consequence of not fastening your salety belt is possible injury or death in a traffic accident: and the negative consequence of eating a high-fat diet is heart disease and cancer. Therefore, practicing healthy lifestyles is simply avoiding the possible conseque[ces of unhealthy lifestyles. For some, the poten tial negative consequences associated with a particular actio[ are not great cnough to create change. The addicted smoker simply will not quit. The challenge for the health educator is to find ways lo motivate that individual to action and change. Belonging and Acceptance Huma ns want lo be *ith olhers oI lheir own kind, have relationships, and want acceptance. Groups and social pressure are powcrful motivators. Few individuals want to bc \"out of step.\" HeaLtuv, Wrllrrr & WrsrGroups. Group support, being with coworkers, or an event that includes family can be important to participation and involvenent. How many times have you heard from a friend fiom another company that as an organization \"we are a family.\" Being together creates an environment of social support. Acceptance, An incentive for practicing a particular heaithy lifestyle is to make it socially acceptable or unacceptable. For example, create the norm where healthy food at morning meetings becomes an acaepted practice;oi that alcohol at com- pany picnics becomes unacceptable (also d compan) policy on alcohol usr can helP). Teams. Create events that include teams. Teams will llaturally improve the participation in a program simply because participants recruit their own team. Also, lhe socialsupporl and pre\\sure inher(nl in team events can help to motivate program participants. Tie in a prize and you have added two more incentive dimensions to the picture-material goods and goals. Influence rnd Status Role models, support from influential figures within your organization, or in- volvement from well-respected individuals lrom ) our organizalron or commu- nity are important incentives and influ- ences on behavior. These influential people can increase participation and motivate individuals to action- People want to be like those who are successful and who have power and influence. Also, an individual's ability Io rise in an organization may be attached to palticular codes of behaviors. [f the boss runs and doesn't smoke and;s vocal about it, those behaviom are more likely to be copied by others lower in the organization. Values and Beliefs Valueq are \\rhal t|( cheri.ih and desitc in life. Individuals, groups, and organizations are driven by values. Decisions are driven by values. Values evolve from belielsabout what is good and bad, what should oi ought to be. What are the values in your organization or of your employees? Is good health a value? The well-being and health of emplo),ees is a value that organizations should achieve. when it has become a value, creating health promotion and a healthy work environment is much easier (for lollou-up: see wo*site/organi zation|l audit). Reinforcemenl, Rewards, Awards, ir $ell documented in lileralure lha reinforc\u20acment, either positive or negative, can shape behavior. Simply, people will repeat what they are rewarded for doing Behat iori\\ls ad\\ocat( positire rcinforce- ment for shaping and controlling behavior, not punishment.

Name an em- ployee of the month or designate special parking spaces to recognize accomplisb- ments. Other forms of recognition include trophies, prizes, ccrtificates, and bluc ribbons.

Link a payoff to reaching a goal reimbunement of class fees, money, or a prize. For example, if an individual has quit smoking lor threc months, he or she will reccive full reim- bursemcnt for the program. Or have the person pay the full program fee. When the pe$on has attended half the sessions. reimburse him or her half of the fee and thc remainder at the completion of the coufse, 232 HLALTTTY, WEALTHY & WISETime Time is an incentive. As we grow older the mortality factor is a great incentive to practice healthy lifestyles. Time can bc an inccntive when given to attend a program or activity. Obviously, health promotion progiams conducted on company time can improve participation- Also, time dead- lines are important motivators ofbehavior such as the 10-week walking club. Pleasure and Fun Humans are pleasure seekers. They want to fcel good, play,laugh, and havc fun. lnject fun and creativity in your events and activities to incrcase participa- tion. Use l nkets and gifts that are fun. Have programs that motivate people to nanl to participale. For crample. rathrl tban a two-milc treasure hunt/fun walk wherc teams go out in the neighborhood, plant, or building to solve clues. Award lunches or prizes to the winning team. In this ex ample, a combination of inccntives was used: fun. teams, and prizcs. HEAI-THY, WE,\\LTHY & P zes, Gifts l'hese are thc more familiar incentivcs that most companies have used not only in health promotion programs but in em- ployee recognition programs, marketing, or customer relations. A program, prod- uct, or company llame may be imprinted on a widc variety of items, such as buttons, clothing, pens. calenda$, hats, cups, mugs, magnets. Other items that have been uscd as incentives are trips. cals. electronics, and gift certificates. Link pri/(s t,' achie\\emcnl ol a behav- ior. Reinforce behavior by incrementally awarding prizes throughout the program or as cefiain incremental goals are reached. Link givcaways to parlicipation to any- one who participates, to the first 50 who register, to those who complete thc pro gram. Entice participation by having a drawing with a large itcm as the prize. Link items to desircd behaviors. For example. if you want your employees in a *eight loss proeram lu tlrinL more $ater in order to mug. You havc not only provided them the mechanism, but if thc item is imprinted, it will serve as a re- minJrr ul all Ihc lhingq they are learning in )our program. Also. u hen othcr couorl- ers see the mug, they mav be stimulated to join your next class. Use incentives for name recognition. Use imprinted ad specialties to keep your program name before your employees. Food Food has always been a draw to pro grams. FooJ can al.o bc given a\\ a pri,/e. Use food to increase participation or give away lunches or dinnen. or coupons for the cafeteria to try new healthy choices. Competition/Challenges Everyone wants to be number one, to win a blue ribbor, and to be king of the mountain. Humans instinctively want to win and love the challengc associated with the competition to win. Competitions can add energy and direction to a behavior change program. A competition can be against oneself, against others, can involve leam\\. deparlment\\. dir i:iun.. companres. or communtttes. Elements that make competitions successful are teams, tangible rewards, goals, and dcfined but realistic time limits. Compctitions can also be highly successful in gelring men (y(.. raomcn rend to parrici pate more than men) involved. A competi, tion for only top management is also an excellent way to get this hard{o,get- involved group to participate. Rewards for winning can simply be the satisfaction of beating the others, public recognition, cash, prizes, or material goods. Financial Rewerds Financial incenlites are mosl likcly lhe most powerful. Without them wc cannot provide for the basic needs of life food, shclter, clothing.

He's the spokesperson for one of the company's leading ptoducts, and his message has be come a motivator fbr the Chattem employees as well. More than haif of Chattcm's 360 employccs run,walk, play tennis, and exercise in other ways 1() qualily for $50 at the end of the annual 10-week incentive proglam. Each employee must exercise at least three houn a week to pocket the cash. In a motivational meeting for all employees at Chattem, Namath talked about two things he never gets tired of: winning and staying healthy-an appropriate message for a compaly with several products to support exercise and fitness.

WEALTHY & WrsEUsing the Right Incentives Appropriateness Choose incentives carefully to insure they are approp ate. Serving food at your lunch-andlearn sessions will increase your participation, but high-fat foods at these sessions would be inappropriate in the face ofyour wellness program promoting good heallh. Rather. healthy turkey products low-fat cheese, and vegetables would be better choices. How and When to Use Incentives Integrate incentives into all levels of your planning, implementatiol, and evalu- ation of your programs and activities. They can be used before the program (for example, a coupon for a reduction of program fee to entice participation), at the beginning ofthe program (a free gift to anyone who attends. a drawing), incre- mentally over the program (as individuals reach certain benchmarks in the progmm, for example), end of program (certificate, cash, prize, name in the company newslet ter). or post-program (a lree gift for any one who retums the evaluation or who has maintained the behavior change). Incentives can be used to encourage attendance, behavior change, maintenance, and compliance. Incentives should occur at fairly frequent intervals to reinforce the behavior you want. Here are two ex- amples of how and when to use jncentives: Example 1, lf regulai exercise is the outcome you want to achieve. design an incremental reward system that awards gifts of increasing values as individuals meet increasing levels of exercise. Example 2. In a week-long program at a major truck manufacturer in recognition of National Employce Health & Fitness Day, a \"Three and You Win\" incentive program was put into place. Although there was the typical food and drawings at each event, there was an opportunity to get a bigger prize a fanny pack filled with goodies, a $10 value. Rather than handing out theitems at each and every event, employees were required to participate in three of the week's seven activities. The result was over 40 percent participation in at least three events. Can you imagine how many participated in only one event? Entice and Excite You've heard that employees will do anything for a T-shirt or anything else. Well, they will. Entice and excite your employees to action with incentives. Whether il is an unmel need or the prom- ise of a free gift, incentives drive behavior. Use incentives to your best advantage in your health promotjon efforts to encourage participation, to motivate individuals to change. and lo !u\\tain lhc desired beha\\- ior.

Cortent specific themes will be fould in Section IL Tur Yar or rue Crr eto OrHrn ANNu,cr THEMTs: . Fint-year themes should promote owneEhip of the program and its purpose, - Name-the-program contests - Kickoff theme in relation to football for a fall sta - Tipoff or face-off for a winter sports tneme - Use New Year's resolutions for a January starl . Second-year themes can be used to continue momentum or rekindle lnteresl: - Birthday party themes for semnd year anniversary date, teenrolllnent. or second-year health screeningGive employees a gift, \"the gift of health.\" SymboLize the gift with a fresh apple fbr everyone who signs up for the activity.

Name a day honoring one of your participants who has been successful and perhaps inspirational to others.Keep the size manageable, five to seven members. Keep the composition representative. Don't give them busy work. Run tight businesslike meetings, re- spe\u20acting their time. Involve them in promotional activities. Let them be a part of your networking plan. Feed them.

Develop an expectation that program adivities will always have a nominal fee. This creates an additional impression of value for the activity. (Employees are paying for similar activities in the communrry anyway.) Ask any extemal vendor that conducts activities in your facility-for example, \\},[CA aerobics classes to provide posters and registration materials with your input and subjecl to your approval- Use qualified employee voluntcem for plesentations when appropriate: Biking enthusiast to conduct a seminar on bike maintenance - Successful marathon runner to conduct any of a number of running seminars with the content subject to your approval - Employees of Asian ancestry to conduct a low-fat wok moking demonstration - Spouse ofan employee with Alzheimer's disease to speak on the subject with support lrom the appro pnate communltv agency. pos\\ible and approJ'ri- ate. .

Establish reasonably objective criteria for the grants: - Must have a healthbenefit. - Should have the potential to impact significant numbers of employees - The wellness grant funds should be malched b) conlributron. from other departments or pafiicipants or both. The project should have significant employee volunteerism assoclated with it. . Examples of projects include: - Purchase and installation of bicycl\u20ac racks, sand volleyball courts, basket- ball hoops, a bark chip walking trail Purcha5e of lmall mals for aerobica classes - Puchase of a refrigerator for a facility without a cafeteda - Building a modest \"fitness center\" using unused space, used equipment, employee labor INCENTIVE IDEAS Point Systems Point systems have the advantage of allowing an individual to accumulate points and redeem them for a significant reward ftom a catalogue. They also allow for''shaping\" behavior-in other words, rewarding successive approximations of the desired behavior. This can be especially useful with high-risk individuals. . Use \"dollars\" rather than points. . Reward very small positive behaviors such as - Registration for an activity before the deadline Haarrnv, Wrlrrnr & Wrse 241- Attendance at each session of an achvrty - Completion of an activity - Achievement of a goal - Being \"caught in the act\" of pradic- ing a healthy behavior - Supporting a high-risk individual in his or her behavior change . Select point values appropriate to the actr\\4ty. . Select rewards that will encourage longer term involvement in the pro gam. Lotteries Rather than offering incentives for everyone who completes an event, offer chances in a drawing for a limited number of very valuable prizes. . This allows bettcr budgetary control. . lf the event goes on over time, allow pa rt icipanls Io eam multiple chances in the drawing by continued participation. . Hold the drawing during a busy lunch period, company picnic, or communica lons meeung. . Have enough FiTc\\.o employee\\ are encouraged to participatc because oI the odds. Trash and Trinkets When selecting small incentive items, choose items that willnot be throw[ awar and will give you additional visibility. . Desk accessodes that arc useful . Automobile items that are useful . Clothing items that allow yotu logo to be visible Unusual Incentives . Gift certificates lbr - Therapeutic massage - Court timc with guest fee waived at a tennis club 242- Racquet restringing - Bicycle \"tuneup\" - Bicycle wheel straightening - Salad bar lunches - Aerobics class registmtion - Class registration fee or copaynent for your classes . Relaxation tapes-loons in the North woods, seashore sounds, New Age music, oovels on tape for listening in a car PROMOTIONAT IDEAS One of the most difficult, ongoing challenges in heallh promotion i\\ lhe la5l.. ofpromotion itself. The populatiot we deal with on a day-to-day basis is subject to behavior patterns that may have begun in childhood. Keeping a health piomotion program fresh and viable with high levels of participation requires the use ofnew ideas or old ideas made new with slight modification. This section will provide some of both. Management Support ldeas Puruc Eroonsr,vtrnrs: Ask significant management to publicly endorse an activity at a general commu- nication meeting. Ask malagement to visibly register or participate in an activity. Ask maflagement to \"co sig[\" a dual signature memo announcing a signifi cant actlllty. Print photogmphs of executives pafiici pating in an activity in your newsletter. Ask management to wear your pro- gmm T-shirts, bultons, or promotional item at continuing education qedits for completion of selected education cotuses such as shess management. Tsr Prnsour Toucx: Try to deal with executives on a per- sonal level as often as possible and when appropriate. r Make houre call\" b) going lo execu- tives' offices for a blood pressure reading. .

This is especially true in regard to efforts to reach dependents. Three areas that can serve as springboards for further activity include promoting adult flu shot clinics, child immunizations, and AIDS educalion. Here are a few ideas ir these areasl Fru Cunrc Tnrmrs: . Since the flu season starts in late fall or early winter as does the use of fire- places. trying tying the two together with chimney sweep themes: \"Pay attention to the flu\" - \"Make ofthe flu\" ''Clues about the flu\" . Target older employees and retirees since these are the most susceptible populations. . Promote cold prevention by hand washing. Try a monthlyminute using\"Glow GeIm,\" a prcduct that is put on the hands before washing. Then the hands are examined under \"black light\" after washing. The quality ofthe hand washing will be evident. Hand out tip sheets arrd a schedule of local flu shot clinics. . Ofler a seminar series on flu preven- tion.

In addition to lhe slandard prevenlion i\\sues such semina$, try takilg a different approach that rclates to where the disease has progressed in society. Because of the sensitive and tragic nature of this disease, tle use of light- hearted hurnor may be inappropriate. .

Form support gioups if you havc employees who have AIDS. . Take a more direct approach and sell condoms in your company store or in lavatory vending machines.CLINICAT PREVENTIVE SERVICES l'rr VoucH Fon You: problems we face in con- ducting health screeniog involve the physical testing process. The more tests we offer, the more useful the assessment, but the more difficult it is to conduct logisti cally. . Prea.range screenilg tests at off-site locations: - Blood pressure at the fue station Blood tests at local clinics,labs, or hospitals - Fitness test batteries and body composition at local health clubs and YMCAs - Lung capacity tests at appropriate cornmunlty agencres Give participants instructions and paperwork and have all the tests done in conjunstion with a normall) scheduled physical with their per- sonal physician. . Design a single-sheet data folm for particrpants to record any or all of the tests. The results can be entered on the health dsk appraisal later. . If your organization normally pays for these tests, anange a voucher system that will allow the participant to present the voucher or the vendor to bill the organization. .

Offer separate \"interpretation\" semi- nals that explain the natue of the rcsults and promote follow-up educa_ tion. Horurwonr: Virtually all of the health dsk appraisal procedures can take place off-site with some planning. . Use an HRA that requires minimal dircctlon for accurate completion. . Administer the HRA through direct mail to the home. This service can be arranged either through the HRA vendor in many cases, ot through companies that specialize in direct mail services. This increases spouse involve- ment, . Combine this with appropriate physical test ideas already listed. .

Ironically, preventive exams and procedures such as this are often specifically excluded from cover age and may not even apply to the dedudible. Such a strategy is relatively simple to implement and sends a clear message that the company cares about prevention. On the other hand, preven- tive benefits may increase premiurns from 1 to 4 percent, and claims may be more difficult to process. 2. Add wellness enhancements to the basic health plan coverage. Such enlancements may take the folm of reduced coinsurance amounts, waiver ol co-pay rcquirements, increased preventive medical benefit coverage, or payment for preventive procedures at a higher level than the usual and custom- ary limits for other medical costs. This strategy provides a stronger incentive for healthy lifestyle choices through the company health plan and is relatively simple. The problem is that those who do not participate perceive it as a penalty, alld those who do pafiicipate may not actually perceive the value of these benefits at all. Communication is the key. 3. Provide a direcffunded cash bonus based on the employee's meefing a specifi ed number of wellness achieve- ments. This momle booster gives employees an oppoftunity to receive cash. The problem is that employees who don't participate ordon't meet the health cdteria (such as being within normal weight or a nol1smoker) per- ceive the program as a penalty. This stmtegl requires a fair amourt of recordkeeping, and employees must pay ta,\\ on the cash bonuses, which dilutes the value of the award. EDITIR's NorE: Larry Chapman originally presented these ideas during a WELCOA- sponsored teleconference in 1992. A deotape of the g9-minute presentation may be available through lour local Wellness Council or from WELCOA.Larry S. Chapman Without health promotion programs or any health caie management, companies will see profits increasingly and dispropor- tionalely eaten up by health care costs. Companies with health care management plans and health promotion programs will see increases in per capita health care costs but at a much lower rate of increase-and certainly within manageable growth pat terns, By linking wellness to benefits. the company in effect institutionalizes wellness (for follow-up: see corporale culiure). Through some of these techniques, belefits costs may be reduced. the organization's culture changed, and program participation enhanced. Suggested Strategies 1. lnclude preventive medical benefit coverage in the health plan design. \\- This gives employees and their mvcred dependents an incentive to receive pedodic medical screcning such as mammography, PAP smears. and Larry S.

Heelrnr, Wealrnv & WrsE 2594. Give waivers to reduce the health insurance deductible for employees who meet certain health criteia. This is a less expensive alternative to a compa- mble cash bonus and can be used to offset increased deductiblcs in the company's health insumnce plan. Again, those who don't meet thc goals or don't participate pcrceive this stategy as a Penalty. 5. Use a health advice line to provide consumer information as well as tips on behavior change and health risk rcduc- tion. This stntegy works very well for remote worksites. The program must be available tollfree to all employees and actively promoted. lt's rclatively simplc to implement but lacks force unless calling the advice line is linkcd to other incentives. 6. Use incentives for employees to help find and correct erors in hospital and medicalbills. Pay them half of the\"fi\\ed\" error bctween $25 and $500. This strategy helps employecs take increased responsibility in their own care and creates a powcrful sentinel elfect on provider billing plactices. Common problems with billing jnclude upcoding (billed for a lenpfhy visit. for example,whcn the patient was only seen for a few minutes), unbundling (instead o{billingfor an ofljce an offrce visit, for example), and chuming to specialists. Employer would develop specific rules and communicate the plan perjodically to keep it effective. 7. Enrich the benefits coverage for those who meet wellness requirements or mcel heallh eamed time off or leave systems, or Life insurance. access to vision and prescdption drug and enhanced dental benefits. This strategy provides a strong incentivc for wellness behaviors with minimal expcn\\e. bul good communica tion is the key to helping employees perccive the actual value of these bencfits.8. Through wellness gajnsharing, the cmployer provides a cash rcbate o[ a portion of the savings ftom a hcalth benefit plan back to individual employ- ees, with an option to get additional points for wellness lifestyle bchavio$ and attributes. Rebates are based on individual and group peformance, can be used with insured and sclf insured heatth plans, and can be used to ottset increased cost sharing. Companies that use wellness gainsharing commonly rebate half tle differencc between actual and er?ccted claims. Employees eam wellness bonus points and cash in at the cnd of the benefit yeai. Linking wetlness to other employee benefits, although important, must be done carefully to make sure the company com- plies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (for follow-rlp: see Americans wilh Disrbilities Act). As with any other wellness activities, you must communicate the strategies to employees and help them perceive the value ofthese inccntives. But tailor thc approach and the plan to youi group and your health plan.
