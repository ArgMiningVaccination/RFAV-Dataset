Ayurveda is not only the oldest Indian but also the oldest medical science in the world. In fact, some researchers have also proclaimed it to be the fifth Veda (Veda = knowledge) of India. But, in reality, it is part of Atharvaveda. Every living being desires a happy and long life. Ayurveda is the way to achieve a healthy and disease-free science of life. All the knowledge regarding life, even in the ages beyond, is available in Ayurveda. Ayurveda cures the disease, helps people lead a healthy life, and achieve long life. Renowned ayurvedic teacher \"Charkacharya\"has said that \" The best medicine (Arshad) should be such that it cures the patient and the best doctor is that who cures the patient.\" Ayurveda is not only medical science, but it is an insight, which helps to protect the health of healthy men and cures the malady of a diseased man. In addition, it also caters to complete social happiness and also presents a direction to the spiritual and godly joy. One special aspect of Ayurveda is that it treats the human being as a whole, whereas other medical sciences treat only a particular diseased part of the body. [It is considered in Ayurveda that the human body is made of 24 elements (chaturvisaatitatvaatmak samast purush)] In Ayurveda, one can also get knowledge about religion, art, literature, philosophy, and science. Charkacharya has said that \"In this world, each and everything can be used as a medicine.\" \"Naanauausadhibhutam Jagati kichidh Dravyamuplabhamahe\" The origin of the Sanskrit word \"Ayushoveda\". \"Chaitanya nuvartan Mayu: \" A living body is called life. Ayu= The combination of the body (Sharir), senses (Indra), mind (Man), and soul (Atma) is called life (Ayu). The state of liveliness is called life(Ayu)(Ayurjeevitkaal Author: Amarkosh,2/8/120). Till one is alive, one has life. The age of a living body is called life (Ayu). The combination of body and soul is called life and the period from conception to death is called age (Ayu). Synonyms of \"Age (Ayu)\" denotes Its origin has come from the Sanskrit word \"Vid\". The meaning of Vid can be taken as, what is already present (astitva), what can be attainable (Veti- Gyaayate), what can be thought about (Vite, vichaaryate), and what can be achieved (Vindate Vindati Labhyate). Definition of Ayurveda Ayurveda is defined along the path of good and bad matter (Dravya), good or bad quality and the good or bad actions of a living being. Also, the length of life and its quality are described here. The concept of health is categorized into 4 parts: - Good living (Hitayu) - Unfavorable living (Ahitayu) - Happy living (Sukhayu) Why is Ayurveda Necessary? The aim of Ayurveda is to protect the health of a healthy person. To achieve this it takes care of the health in the following manner: - - To protect health during the day (Dincharya) - To protect health during the night (Ratricharya) - To ensure right living (Sadvritya) - To live according to one's characteristic (Trividhya Upstumbh) It is said that the knowledge of Ayurveda is ageless and ever pervading. Lord Brahma got its realization and the knowledge of Ayurveda soon dispersed to heaven (Devlok) and the earth. Lord Brahma is the founder of Ayurveda. His famous ayurvedic book is called \"Brahmasahita\". According to different ayurvedic bibles, the generations of ayurvedic Daksh Prajapati, Ashiwinokumaro, Indra, Bharadwaj, Dhanwantri are considered the pioneers of Ayurveda. In those days, Ayurveda was the worldwide medical science followed and other medical sciences got inspired by it. Family Tree of Ayurveda AyurvedaiIs Divided Into 8 Parts - Surgery (Shalya) - E.N.T (Shalaakya) - Medicine (Kaya chikitsa) science (Rasayan tantra) Few Ancient Pediatric Ayurveda It is that part of Ayurveda, which deals with child-rearing, childhood illness, and treatment. Komar Bhritya = Komar +Bhritya. Komar (Kumar) is a title by which a child is addressed. Bhritya denotes the parent, child caretaker, or guide. Komar Bhritya involves care child-rearing and treating disease right from the time of conception up to the age of maturity (up to 16 years). It also involves maintaining and protecting the good health of the child. It is a scientific method of dealing with childhood disease symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. The following aspects of prevention and care are taken care of in Pediatric Ayurveda: - - Infertility: its causes and its treatment. - Proper development of fetus in the uterus. - Care of maternal illness which may affect the fetus. - Care of difficulties and problems during labor. \"Aapram satvaye Komarbhritya Garbhamarmani Prajnane Ch Viyatet|\" -Pr.11.A.16/2 If considered along the lines of modern medical science, Pediatric Ayurveda can be divided into 3 parts. - Gynecology (Stree Roga Vigyan). - Obstetrics and Fetal medicine (Prasuti Vigyan). - Pediatrics (Balchikitsa Vigyan) Today's era is the era of specialization. As a result, newer research and developments are occurring faster leading to sub-specialization and super-specialization. A doctor specialized in one category is not able to attain complete knowledge of other specialties. As a result, one patient may have to go to several consultants in order to treat his disease. But one should not forget that a human being is a psychophysical organism (Manodehik Tantra) and his functioning is interdependent on various organs simultaneously. Ayurveda not only treats the disease symptoms but also takes care of the diseased personality and the person in totality. Thus, this division of Ayurvedic branches has been done keeping the above in mind. The subjects covered in Pediatric Ayurveda are thus overlapping with each other because all these subjects are somehow related to child health. Right from conception, fetal growth, and development (monthly), birth, neonatal development, infancy, toddler, pre-schooler, school-going child, adolescent - they are all related to child growth and development. Any subject related directly and indirectly to child health is included in Pediatric Ayurveda. Importance of Pediatric Ayurveda Pediatric Ayurveda lays the foundation of a good life. It gives importance to the physical, mental, and psychological growth of a child. If child-rearing, childcare, and treatment are carried out according to the rules of Pediatric Ayurveda, then definitely the child will turn into a happy and healthy adult. At every stage of development of the child, there are special problems faced for e.g. during teething (Dhantodbhav), it is natural for a child to have loose motions and fever. At every age of the child, the pattern of the disease changes for which the treatment also has to change accordingly for e.g. secondary sex characteristics appear during the adolescent age at which the abnormal pubertal developments may also occur. Children in general, are more prone to infectious disease as compared to the adult. Children are also more prone to accidents for e.g. Foreign body aspirations. Childhood diagnosis is different and difficult as compared to that in the adult. Children are scared to go to the doctor and are unable to communicate about their symptoms. They are not easily ready for a physical examination and have to be coaxed to do that. Thus, a physician has to be alert and careful while dealing with children. Childhood treatment is also different as compared to the adult. The method of 5 elemental actions (panchakarma) used in adults is not recommended in children and if used, has to be used with utmost caution. Children do not tolerate bad tasting (Vish mishit, Tukshana, Katu, Tikt, Kasaya) medicine. They prefer sweet and tasty medicine. Thus treatment in children has its own importance. Literature Related to Pediatric Ayurveda In the ancient ages, Pediatric Ayurveda was at its peak. At that time all the subgroups of Ayurveda had their specific textbooks available, later with further research more and more scriptures were added. But due to the erosion of time, foreign attacks on India, and religious conversion; this science soon lost its importance, and the medicine and its scriptures gradually started disappearing. Whatever scripts were hidden here & there and the original, as well as translated versions taken away by the foreigners, are the only ones that have survived time. Today, the bible available on Pediatric Ayurveda (Komar Bhritya) is Kaashyap sahita/Vridhajeevak tantra (Author - Vridhajeevak). There were also renowned teachers of Pediatric Ayurveda even before and after the era of Kaashyap. Other important text books of Pediatric Ayurveda are:- Kumar Tantra, and Dasgrive Baal Tantra\". In the seventh century AD, even Chinese literature described the above books. Even newer textbooks like \"Bhaisachya ratnavali\" and \"Yogratnar\" have also described Pediatric Ayurveda. Now a-days, books are available which describe either/and both modern as well as olden Pediatric Ayurveda. Among these, the following books are available: Acharya Radhanath - 1978) In 1962, a monthly magazine on childhood diseases \"Shishu Rogank\" was started. And in 1967, \"Baal Rogank\" was published. In 1975, Sudhanidi published \"Shishu Rogank Chikitsa.\" In addition, several editions of Komar Bhritya are available in different Indian languages. Division of Pediatrics Into Different Stages According to the Age of Child In Pediatric Ayurveda, ages from 1-16 years are considered as part of childhood. They are divided into 3 parts:- - Chirab:- From birth to 1 year. - Chiranath: From 2 - 3 years. - Annad: from 4 to 16 years. (Note: Kaashyap Sahita has divided the active life of man into 6 stages of which 3 stages are part of the pediatric age. - Garbhavasta - From conception to birth. - Balya avasta - From birth to 1 year. - Komar avasta - From 1 year to 16 years.) The stage during which the infant is dependent on mother's milk is called Chirab. This stage is from birth to approximately 1 year of age. Chirab:- The stage in which the child eats other food apart from the mother's milk is called Chiranath. This is usually 2 - 3 years of age. Chiranath:- The stage in which the child is no longer dependent on mother's milk and can eat normal adult diet is called Annad. This stage is from 4 years to 16 years of age. Annad:- These stages do not have a clear cut demarcation line and they overlap with each other. But this classification has its own importance. Each stage denotes a special developmental aspect of the child's growth. This classification is useful to determine the cause of disease and also the right treatment in the right quantity. Other Classifications Now a-days, according to social factors, Ayurvedic pediatrics is divided into 4 parts:- - Navjaat (Newborn)-From birth to 1 month of age. - Shishu (Infant)- From 2 months to 2 years of age - Balak (Child) - From 3 years to 12 years of age - Kishor (Adolescent)- From 13 to 16 years of age.
