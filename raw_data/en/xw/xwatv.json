They eat as many of the infecting micro-organisms as they can. Also called innate / natural killer cells /square6Organism is recognised as \"foreign\"because of unique molecules on it's surface - antigens * 13 Antigen /square6A live or inactivated substance (e.g. protein or polysaccharide) capable of producing an immune response /square6\"Anything that can be bound by an antibody\" 14 Body's natural response to infection /square6Macrophages digest most the micro-organism except the antigens /square6They \"regurgitate\"these antigens (ln) displaying them on their surface (antigen presenting cells) so that other wbcscalled lymphocytes can take over the attack /square6Two types; T cells and B cells 15 Active immunity /square6Humoral/ Antibody mediated /boxshadowdwnB cells /square6Cell mediated /boxshadowdwnT cells /square6Killer / cytotoxic-destroy infected cells and micro - organisms /square6Helper -stimulate and direct activity of B cells 16 Antibodies /square6Different types /boxshadowdwnIgM, IgG , IgA, IgD, IgE /square6Each antibody is specific for its antigen -no cross protection /square6We have millions of different antibodies /square6When B cells come into contact with their matching antigen, they are stimulated to divide into larger cells called plasma cells, which secrete huge amounts of antibodies 17 Antibodies - functions /square6These antibodies circulate and attack the micro-org anisms that have not yet infected cells /square6Antibodies gather on the micro-organism's surface /square6This blocks adhesion / cell entry of the antigen /square6Neutralises and prevents organism's replication /square6Signals (cytokines) macrophages and other co organism via complement proteins -lysis /square6Neutralises toxin /square6Goal of vaccines is to stimulate this response 18 Immune response /square6Primary immune response develops in the weeks following first exposure to an antigen /boxshadowdwnMainly IgMantibody /square6Secondary immune response is faster and more powerful /boxshadowdwnPredominantly IgG antibody With kind permission from Nick Holmes With kind permission from Nick Holmes Source: HPA 20 Innate and adaptive immunity work together With kind permission from Nick Holmes Source HPA 21 Memory cells /square6After the body has eliminated the infection some of the B and T cells are converted into memory cells /square6These can quickly divide into the specialised B and T cells if re-exposure to the infection occurs /square6The immune system's capacity to have a memory of previous encounters with an infection is the basis for vaccination. 22 How vaccines work /square6Induce active immunity /boxshadowdwnImmunity and immunologic memory similar to natural infection but without risk of disease /square6Immunological memory allows /boxshadowdwnRapid recognition and response to infection /boxshadowdwnPrevents or modifies effects of disease 23 Immune response to an ideal vaccine: /square6Vaccine is taken up by antigen-presenting cells /square6activates both T and B cells to give memory cells /square6generates Thand Tccells to the antigens /square6antigen persists to continue to recruit B memory cells and produce high affinity antibody Source HPA 24 Types of Vaccine Live Attenuated Live organism with low virulence Inactivated Organism with no virulence Inactivated toxins \"Toxoids\" Subcellularfraction (inclconjugated vaccines) No virulence Genetically engineered Contains no original antigen product Source HPA 25 Live attenuated vaccines /square6Weakened viruses / bacteria /boxshadowdwnAchieved by growing numerous generations in lab /boxshadowdwnStimulates immune system to react as it does to natural infection /boxshadowdwnProduces long lasting immune response after one or two doses /boxshadowdwnCan cause mild form of the disease e.g. mini measle s which is not transmissible /boxshadowdwnCANNOT be given to immuno-compromised persons /boxshadowdwnE.g. BCG / MMR / Varicella / 26 Inactivated vaccine and toxoids /square6When adequate attenuation of live virus is not possible the vaccine is inactivated by chemical process or heat /square6Toxoidsare toxins that have been inactivated and chemically modified /square6Cannot cause the disease they are designed to protect against /square6Doses /boxshadowdwnTwo or more doses plus booster doses usually requir ed 27 Inactivated vaccine and /square6Often require adjuvant or conjugation to stimulate immune response 28 What is the role of an adjuvant /square6To enhance the immune response to the vaccine's antigen /square6Mode of actions are not precisely defined: /boxshadowdwnTo carry the vaccine antigen and to slow its releas e /boxshadowdwnTo provoke a local inflammatory response /boxshadowdwnActivates innate cells /boxshadowdwnE.g. Hep B, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria e.g. coating of sugar molecules (called polysaccharides) /square6Polysaccharide coatings make it difficult for a bab y or young child's immature immune system to see and respond to the bacterium inside /square6Polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in children under 2 years old and do not stimulate lon g term immunological memory /square6Conjugate vaccines have enabled us to effectively protect children against Hib, Men C and pneumococca l diseases Source HPA 30 Carrier protein Polysaccharide linked to carrier protein Conjugate vaccine Bacteria Polysaccharide (sugar) coating Conjugation Conjugation is the process of attaching (linking) t he polysaccharide antigen to a protein carrier that th e infant's immune system already recognises in order to provok e an immune response Source HPA 31 Examples of Vaccines Source HPA 32 Live Attenuated Vaccines /square6Advantage /square6Potent, response close to the optimal naturally acquired immune response /square6Disadvantage /square6May reproduce features of the disease as sub-clinical or mild form of the infection /square6May revert to virulent form (e.g. OPV) /square6Cannot be given to immunosuppressedor pregnant patients Source HPA 33 Inactive Vaccines /square6Advantages /square6Cannot cause infection to immunosuppressedand pregnant individuals /square6Disadvantages /square6Less immunogenic and require addition of adjuvantsand booster doses Source HPA 34 Do vaccines overload the immune system? /square6Within hours of birth, a baby's gastrointestinal & respiratory tract are heavily colonised with bacter ia /square6Rather than overwhelming the immune system, vaccine s help stimulate and strengthen it /square6Immune systems need stimulation to develop well: allergies may result from too little immune stimula tion in our cleaner environments /square6There is no evidence that vaccines can overload the immune system. The immune system is designed to dea l with a constant stream of foreign antigens on the s urface and inside our bodies. 35 Vaccine failures /square6Primary failure /boxshadowdwnan individual fails to make an adequate immune response to the initial vaccination (e.g. in about 10% of measles and mumps vaccine recipients) /boxshadowdwnInfection possible any time post vaccination /square6Secondary failure /boxshadowdwnan individual makes an adequate immune response initially but then immunity wanes over time /boxshadowdwna feature of most inactivated vaccines, hence the n eed for boosters 36 Timing of Primary Immunisation Course /square6Maternal IgGis transferred across the placenta /square6Passively acquired IgGfrom mother can suppress response to DTP, Polio, Men C and Hib vaccine for about 2 months /square6Maternal antibody to measles may interfere for up t o a year Source HPA 37 Time intervals between vaccine doses /square6Allows each immune response to develop -e.g. primar y immunisation (1 month) /boxshadowdwnThis allows the next response to be a true secondar y response -i.e. faster and bigger and with higher affinity Ig G 38 Time intervals between vaccine doses /square6Avoids immune interference /boxshadowdwnIf another live vaccine is given while the immune s ystem is making a primary immune response, the activation of the innate immune system may neutralise the second live vaccine so that it does not work. Hence we wait 4 weeks to allow the immune system to recover /boxshadowdwnHuman normal immunoglobulin contains antibodies to many infections including measles. These antibodies will neutralise any live vaccine. Hence we wait 3 months for the a ntibody level to fall 39 Time intervals between vaccine doses Antigen combinations Recommended minimal interval between doses 2 or more killed vaccines No minimum intervalDoses of same killed vaccine 4 weeks apart, 8 weeks for PCV Killed and live vaccines No minimum interval 2 or more live vaccines 4 week minimum interval if not administered simultaneously Immunoglobulin and live vaccines 3 months 40 WHAT CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT RESPONSE TO VACCINES? /square6Simultaneous administration of immunoglobulin /square6Immunosuppression /square6Sickle cell disease and other causes of hyposplenis m /square6Malnutrition and chronic disease /square6Nephroticsyndrome /square6Prematurity (some evidence premature babies may hav e sub-optimal response to Hib and Hep B vaccines but should be scheduled on basis of their actual date o f birth) Source HPA 41 What is herd immunity? /square6The indirect protection from infection of susceptible members of the population, and the protection of the population as a whole, which is brought about by the presence of immune individuals Source HPA 42 Herd immunity /square4To achieve herd immunity the percentage of individuals who need to be vaccinated depends on the disease and the vaccines used. /square4Only for transmissible infectious diseases Source HPA 43 Dynamics of transmission /square6If an infection is to persist, each infected individual must, on average, transmit that infection to at least one other individual. If this does not occur, the infection will disappear progressively from the population Source HPA 44 Infection/ Infectious agent Average age at infection, in yr Inter- epidemic period (yr) RoCritical vaccination coverage to block transmission , (%) Measles HPA 45 Outbreaks occur in populations with high coverage 1000 children 5 not immunised 5 measles cases 995 immunised: 2 doses MMR 9 cases mumps 95% against rubella children offered first dose 900 accept 810 protected 90% efficacy 90 not protected 100 do not accept Why herd immunity is important /square6No vaccine is 100% effective e.g. measles vaccine is 90-95% effective so out of every 100 children given the vaccine 5-10 will not be protected /square6Some people unable to receive live vaccines e.g the immunocompromised /square6Herd immunity is the most effective way of protecting people who do not respond to vaccines or can't be given them for medical reasons Source HPA 48 Summary 1.It is possible to provide passive immunity by using immunoglobulinsor active immunity by using vaccines . There are different types of vaccine manufactured by dif ferent methods 2.Vaccines contain antigens resembling those of natur al infections and stimulate the immune system to make a primary response and a memory response . Booster doses of v accine reinforce the memory response 3.Knowledge of how vaccines stimulate the immune syst em can be applied to answering questions such as schedulin g intervals, age-dependent responses, the basis for non-response in some individuals, herd immunity and elimination of infec tion. 49 /square6Immunity and How Vaccines Work, NIO /square6How Vaccines Work, HPA, UK www.hpa.org.uk/webc/hpawebfile/hpaweb_c/12798883004 93 NIH -National Institute gy and Disease /square6The Science Q&A.
