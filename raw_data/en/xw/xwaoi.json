Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 4/23/2023 Highly skilled and keeps up the most cutting edge technologies. Both doctors are highly educated and dedicate professionals who put their heart and soul into their practice with a passion to make their patients feel better and minimize and eliminate pain! - 2/7/2018 I have been going to Balance for a little over a month now and I've seen a major improvement in my posture as well as a decrease in my shoulder pain. Dr. Paul is extremely thorough and made sure I complete understood the treatment plan he wanted to implement. He was very straightforward throughout the treatment and was willing to work with me on payments. The quality of care and attention to detail are two major reasons why I recommend Balance Chiropractic but there are countless other reasons to choose them including their amazing staff, the cleanliness of the the office and exam rooms and flexible office hours among many other reasons. I could go on for a while explaining why you should choose them but its best to make an appointment and find out why they're the best for yourself! - 5/28/2018 I've been going to Balance Chiropractic for about 4 months now. Choosing Balance has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. Before I decided to see a chiropractor I was living in daily pain. I am so glad that I chose Balance. I went from daily pain to literally no pain whatsoever. The Drs there, Dr Deborah and Dr Paul are professional, caring, knowledgeable, and treat their patients like family. Karen at the front desk couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. I have had such a positive experience coming here and now that I don't have back pain anymore I'm able to exercise and I feel so great. I recommend Balance to anyone who needs a chiropractor! - 1/20/2020 I was having issues with my neck and shooting pain down my arm . Dr Paul and his office were amazing I started regular therapy with him nothing seemed to be helping Dr Paul suggested using the decompression and laser therapy . He explained the process to me this was a God sent to me after a few treatments the pain became less and less its been over 6 months now since I have finished treatment and I have no pain at all . I truly believe this therapy is what helped me become pain free . Dr Paul and Dr Deb are very caring people who listen and do everything they can to make you comfortable . I would never recommend a better Chiropractic office - 4/2/2016 The entire experience here is awesome! The secretary is friendly and helpful, and the doctors are great. They give you their full attention and all the time you need. They take time to ask you questions, understand your situation, and explain to you their plan of action. They use e stim and massage to prepare your body for adjustment. I was seeing Dr. Paul regularly until I moved out of the area. He would recommend follow up treatments but never pressured me to come more often than I was comfortable with. He greatly helped my neck and back pain, and the few times I convinced my husband (who doesn't like to spend time or money on doctors) to go for treatment of an ankle injury, he was very pleased with the experience and kept exclaiming how much better he felt. - 5/1/2019 The team at balance will improve your life. I've been seeing them for over a year and it's the best place. I get adjusted once a week due to my job and it's completely changed my life. I had no idea how it can affect not only your posture but your overall health and your long term health. Their wellness services are also highly recommended! Just go and hear what they have to say! It's worth your time and your investment! - 1/3/2018 I started going to Balance Chiropractic because of a some major back pain that happened to me very suddenly. The Doctors are great and worked on me providing good advise. After about 6 weeks of treatment I'm as good as new. The doctors are very friendly and Based on my treatment I highly recommend!! - 10/12/2018 Just to start, my insurance just sent me a letter that all claims were paid. Since that was very important other than treating my wife who is still in pain to this very day. She had a scheduled appointment that day and you stated that you you could not treat her because of an issue with insurance that your office stated you would accept. From the start we stated to you that we were both veterans, retired, and we could only use our insurance. I could not understand how you ( Dr. Paul) could not treat her or even just given us a heads up on this situation and just basically drop all of my wife's treatments unless you received money. Don't get me wrong people, Dr Paul is a very good chiropractor who does miracles for people including my wife. But if you can't pay for extra services you just can't continue being a patient with just insurance. I understand but you should have stated that on the first consultation. We came in looking for a lifetime chiropractor and felt like we had a dishonorable discharge. Receptionist was outstanding, friendly and inviting to the office. My wife is still in pain and seeing a PT. Still searching for a honest chiropractor in Huntington NY. Thanks for helping my wife for the 5/6 months that you helped her with her pain. Hopefully you are successful without patients with insurance or who are going through tough times. God bless you and your family. - 2/8/2016 Wow! What a great find for me. I had terrible neck stiffness and pain from a sports injury. After one visit with Paul I felt so much better and gained significantly better range of motion. After two visits and more therapy I'm back to 80%. By far the best Chiropractic experience I have ever had. I would confidently recommend Balance Chiropractic. - 4/15/2017 I came to Balance Chiropractic for treatment of lower back and neck pain, and Dr. Debbie made me feel so much better after just a few visits! I found her to be very caring and patient, and loved the relaxed vibe of the treatment rooms. I would definitely recommend Balance Chiropractic!
