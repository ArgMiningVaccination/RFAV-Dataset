O'Connor, David Hufford, Bonnie Glass-Cofn, Barre T oelken, and I participated as faculty. During an intense week of conferences and informal discussion, we realizedthat the direct involvement of humanities scholars in various aspects of insti-tutional biomedicine\u2014such as medical education, clinical pastoral care, andnegotiation of transcultural issues\u2014now informs work in folklore and medi-cine as never before. Old models of investigation that articially isolate \"folkmedicine,\" \"complementary and alternative medicine,\" and \"biomedicine\" asmutually exclusive conduits of information were proving too limited in ourexploration of the real-life complexities of health belief systems as theyobservably exist and are applied by contemporary Americans. Our own workas well as recent research in medical publications strongly suggests that indi-viduals construct their health belief systems from diverse sources of authori-ty, including community and ethnic tradition, education, spiritual beliefs,personal experience, influence of popular media, and perception of the goalsand means of formal medicine. What is less evident is how these health belief systems of authority interact\u2014sometimes competing, sometimes conflicting,sometimes remarkably congruent. We agreed that it was time for a publicationexploring this new integrative (dare I say \"holistic\"?) dimension in our obser-vation and research. It was evident from the beginning that to do justice to the current schol- arship we would need to include many more scholars than those who hadbeen present at the conference; there are yet other scholars not representedhere whose work is adding important insights to our understanding of thecultures of medicine, vernacular and otherwise. Two important \"shadow con-tributors\" to this publication are Margaret Brady of the University of Utahand Patrick Mullen of Ohio State University, our fellow participants in the /ornament21 vii/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page vii1996 conference, whose comments and support then and since have been invaluable to the project. The staff at Utah State make participation in the Fife Conference a mem- orable event in any folklorist's career. Special thanks go to Barbara Walker, Randy Williams, and their helpers for transforming us into family for our weekin Logan. Barre T oelken's engagement in this project has been pervasive, fromhis organization of Fife 1996 to his ne contribution to this volume. It was a casual conversation with him at a subsequent meeting of the AmericanFolklore Society that suggested to me the title for this work. It is my personal pleasure as editor to thank my colleagues, students, and friends at Western Kentucky University. Release time and a sabbatical leavemade my work on the project possible, thanks to the generosity of Dean DavidD. Lee, former and current department heads Thomas Baldwin and LindaPickle, and former folk studies program director Michael Ann Williams. Mygraduate assistants Cara Hoglund and Jacob Owen were indomitable com-rades, offering excellent organizational ideas as well as basic editorial \"gruntwork.\" Work-study students Scott Sisco and Jennifer Englert were prompt,accurate, and unfailingly cheerful. Finally, warm thanks to John Alley of Utah State University Press, who combines two rare and wonderful qualities in an editor: patience and optimism.viii Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page viiifor Nolan A friend is medicine of life. \u2014Aelred Rielvaux Healing_Logics.v3 11:43 AM Page 21 Introduction Erika Brady sometimes the attraction of a eld of study emerges naturally and pre- dictably within the ivied structure of an academic setting; sometimes it ambushes you from an unanticipated stronghold. In the course of many yearsof academic training in folklore, I never regarded medical folklore as a spe-cialty. Although my ofce as a graduate student at UCLA adjoined that ofWayland Hand, the distinguished American taxonomist of medical folklore,his room-length boxes of le cards and the boundless store of arcane tidbitspainstakingly organized struck me at the time as more exotic than relevant tocontemporary ethnography. It was not until the early 1980 s, when I unexpect- edly assumed the duties of a part-time chaplain associate at a midsize hospi-tal in southeast Missouri that I began to see the implications of my trainingfor work in a hospital setting, and grasped the emerging signicance of effortsby folklorists and anthropologists in other medical institutions nationwide. Cape Girardeau, Missouri, is located on the Mississippi River, at the inter- section of several cultural regions marked by distinctive vernacular health sys-tems: to the west, the richly diverse biome of the Ozark Plateau has produced anotable heritage of herbal treatment; to the south, the Missouri Bootheel is aneconomic and social extension of the Mississippi Delta, with flourishing prac-tice of rootwork derived from West African patterns. Most consistent of all, sodeeply taken for granted that it escapes notice as a traditional health belief sys-tem, is the profound, almost universal assumption that soul and body are linkedin some larger pattern of meaning that should be acknowledged, and can evenbe altered, by prayer. As a chaplain specializing in oncology, I learned to recog-nize the verbal rhythms that preceded ecstatic trance in Pentecostal patients. I litcandles for Catholics, and obtained permission for holy medals to accompanythem into surgery. From patients of all social backgrounds I heard the many /ornament21 3/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 3supernatural and natural, folk and \"new age\" remedies that had been tried and discarded before so-called \"primary\" care had been sought, and learned also ofthese nonconventional practices being surreptitiously or openly continued con-current with ofcial biomedical care\u2014some of which knowledge posed delicateethical issues for me as mediator between patient, family, and hospital. I cameto realize the cures so aggressively and ingeniously sought, and the palliation ofacute pain when a cure was past hope, were not necessarily goals most highlyvalued by patients and families. In corridors and waiting rooms following adeath, many times the agonized question posed to me was not \"Did he suffer?\"but rather, \"Was he saved?\" There was nothing out of the ordinary about these experiences in themselves\u2014they could be replicated in various forms in any hospital at anytime. Few people, medical professionals included, self-treat illness exclusive-ly within strict biomedical protocols. Just as social practices deriving fromfolk custom rather than scientic method govern many aspects of hospitalbehavior (Hufford 1989;S t e i n 1980; George and Dundes 1978), nonconven- tional models for healing and wellness quietly and stubbornly coexist withthe ofcial allopathic approach, even in a hospital setting. What was unusu-al and new in my experience was the responsiveness of the staff to the possi-bilities of an ethnographic approach to patient and family issues my trainingoffered, and their interest in learning more about making sense of the prac-tices and beliefs they observed\u2014not necessarily to suppress them, but, likefolklorists and anthropologists, to understand them well enough from thepatient's standpoint to grasp their persuasive power. Their interest reflected amuch larger trend in contemporary medicine: the incomplete but growingrecognition that the four-hundred-year-old enterprise to institutionalizemedicine and place health care on a fully secular, professional, and scienticfooting can never\u2014and perhaps should never\u2014entirely succeed. The dominant theme in the social history of U.S. medicine in the twen- tieth century has been the emergence nineteenth-century \"heroic\" medicine\u2014as modalities from participation in ofcial status.Allopathic medicine enjoys all the privileges of what social scientists label\"formal\" or \"elite\" institutions. It is administered by a limited number of care-fully credentialed specialists, change in practice is elaborately controlled, andthe whole is supported by complex interrelationships with similarly \"formal\"institutions such as the legal, medical, and economic systems in this country.As is often the case with well-established formal institutions, the predomi-nance of allopathic medicine has been so pronounced as to suggest an almostOlympian extracultural inevitability: it has achieved 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 4as though it exists outside the social, cultural, and historic contingencies that shape other aspects of custom and practice\u2014a kind of secular religion. Thisprocess has been fueled by the dramatic advances of biomedicine, especiallyin treatment of physical trauma; bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections; andhormonal deciencies. This privileged role, and the infallible status accorded formal medicine, can lead to a kind of biomedical absolutism which has been labeled \"medico-centrism\" (O'Connor 1995,4), which nds expression in ways that overreach even the immense credibility accorded the practice. The ofcial guide to alter-native medical practices published by the American Medical Associationdenes \"quackery\" as the promotion of a scientically unproven practice orremedy, regardless of intent (Zwicky 1993, 5). This denition would make a \"quack\" of a mother administering any nonscientic home remedy, no matterhow amply supported by generations of informal empirical observation, not tomention any hospital chaplain who \"promotes\" the healing benets of prayer. Despite its aura of timeless mastery, the predominance of allopathic med- icine in this country is relatively recent. The publication of Abraham Flexner'sfamous report in 1910 on the state of medical education in the U.S. provides a convenient terminus a quo from which to date its ascendance. Using Germanuniversities and the European-influenced curriculum then current at JohnsHopkins as models, he outlined a system in which training of physicians wouldtake place within relatively few research-centered institutions emphasizing sci-entic method rst and foremost, with clinical skills developed later and some-what secondarily. The consequence is now a comprehensive and lengthy processwhich in practice now involves nothing less than a full transformation of awould-be doctor's way of knowing\u2014as total an acculturative conversion expe-rience as Roman Catholic seminary or military boot camp. The Flexner report struck a responsive chord because his recommenda- tions were both timely in terms of emergent economic and social forces of theperiod, and consistent with long-standing cultural values, practices, and pref-erences deriving historically from a much larger frame of reference than med-icine alone. From the time of the ancient Greeks and the subsequent influenceof Islamic thought, the Western European intellectual tradition has generallyfavored inductive, empirical processes of inquiry over deductive and meta-physical models. Regarding two essential methods of investigation and treat-ment in Western medicine, dissection and surgery, this attraction to inductive,empirical process was assisted (or at least relatively unimpeded) by theChristian theological division of soul from organism, permitting procedureswhich in other cultures would have violated a sacred unity of the being. In theapplication of these observations to therapeutic problem solving, the WesternIntroduction 5Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 5fascination with cause and effect and its accompanying spirit of invention have driven investigators to devise ingenious pharmaceutical and mechanicalinnovations in treatment\u2014techniques specic enough in intended action tobe effectively tested in a controlled setting. Finally, these techniques of treat-ment have proven well suited for dissemination by means of yet another fea-ture of Western culture shaping its formal medicine: the talent forconstructing elaborate bureaucratic organizations, which now research, test,regulate, and administer the therapeutic product. The organizational com-modication of healing in the West is one of its most striking characteristics:it is no linguistic accident that the term \"medicine\" describes both the broadeld of endeavor, and its product. These observations concerning Western ofcial medicine as a social construct are by no means news to social scientists (Glaser 1968 ,94-95). But their expression in recent medical literature is something new. The character- ization of contemporary biomedicine as \"a folk medi-cine . . . is] the traditional practice in industrialized Western nations\"(Harrison 1992,2594) would not be astonishing in a social sciences text, but it isstriking to encounter it in the most recent edition of The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, a standard desk reference published for physicians. This open recognition of formal medicine by its practitioners as a culturally contingent institution not only suggests a reevaluation of many of theassumptions underlying its teaching methods and practice, but also a reeval-uation of attitudes toward nonconventional health belief systems with whichit coexists and sometimes competes. T o some degree, pragmatic concerns motivate this self-critique on the part of the medical establishment. In 1993, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published an eye-opening article titled \"Unconventional Medicine in the United States: Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use,\" inwhich the authors reported the results of a national survey conducted in 1990 . One in three respondents had in the previous year made use of at least one ofsixteen biomedically unproven modalities such as acupuncture, relaxationtechniques, spiritual healing, et cetera. The estimated number of visits toproviders of nonconventional therapy exceeded visits to primary care physi-cians by almost 10percent, and the out-of-pocket expenditures for these vis- its was $10.3 billion\u2014an amount comparable to out-of-pocket expenditures for all hospitalizations in the United States during the same period. What ismore, the individuals seeking nonconventional treatment during the periodin question were generally those who were more affluent and better educated.This study represented a signicant heads-up to anyone assuming that theinstitutional authority of biomedicine is currently unchallenged.6 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 6But perhaps more importantly, acknowledgment of the de facto inter- play between diverse healing systems in the U.S. has been seen as a call for a more introspective self-critique, especially among practitioners of primarycare. In a thoughtful essay now required reading in some family practice resi-dencies, physician G. Gayle Stephens observes: From where I sit, the philosophical beliefs and attitudes of medical edu- cators, the problems of clinical practice, and the organization and struc-tures of medical care have common root defects that were contained inFlexner's famous report. They are the preoccupation with the humanbody as the only proper object of medical knowledge and the faith inexperimental biology as the solution to all problems of health and ill-ness. Until we take the whole human person in his or her social and cul-tural dimensions as the proper object of knowledge, until we expand ournotions of science to include forms of rationality other than the logical,we will continue to depersonalize and fragment medical care, increase itscosts beyond all calculation, and fail to make its benets equally availableto the whole population. ( 1988,187) Clearly both medical consumers and medical providers are asking for a careful evaluation of the relational as well as institutional patterns of medicine and healing\u2014an evaluation in which specialists in medical folklore are play-ing an increasing role. Intrinsic to the practice of \"Flexnerian\" medicine is the importance of institutional authority: from a patient's standpoint, the credibility and account- ability of a practitioner of ofcial medicine depend to a signicant degree on thevalidity of credentials that guarantee that he or she is a participant in goodstanding in the formal medical community. But there are other forms of author-ity to which a patient may turn when in need of medical assistance. Experientialauthority\u2014personal recall and application of what has worked in the past\u2014ispersuasive but limited. Far more extensive is the realm of relational authority:the credibility of those individuals and resources whose accountability lies notwith a remote institutional afliation, but exists within the community. Thehealing practices and customs supported by relational authority represent just aportion of the affective linkages that bind a community through many sharedforms of expression, including linguistic patterns, foodways, music, and othercultural manifestations. These expressive forms derive strength not only fromthe ways in which they fulll the immediate needs of community members, butalso from the ways in which they embody larger patterns of shared beliefs andvalues. Relational authority may extend horizontally to influence health-relatedpractices of a group at a given time\u2014\"everyone does it\"\u2014or it may extend ver-tically to invoke generations of past practice\u2014\"we have always done it.\"Introduction 7Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 7The concepts of institutional and relational authority are not absolute or mutually exclusive when applied to contemporary conventional and non- conventional medicine. No physician, however impressively credentialed,would care to suggest that his or her accountability lies only toward the statelicensure bureau, and many nonconventional areas of practice such as chiro-practic and acupuncture have ofcial or quasi-ofcial levels of institutionaleducation and control. The very complexity of medicine and culture in thissociety invites analysis in relational and institutional terms. Observe, forexample, how commercial medicine depends on one model or the other in itsadvertising to the general public, depending on the nature and effect of theproduct: television viewers are either lectured by actors in white coats gravelyciting research results, or are entertained by commercial minidramas in whichDr. Mom is rewarded for her recommendation of an over-the-counter med-ication for yeast infection by her daughter's fervent \"Gee, Mom, you're swell.\" Riddling through the complex interplay of health belief systems in the U.S. is a task well suited to the skills of medical ethnography. Most of the con-tributors to this collection are medical folklorists, or medical anthropologistswith close ties to the related eld of medical folklore. For nonspecialist read-ers who are curious about the distinctions between the elds of medical folk-lore, anthropology, and sociology, it may be helpful to observe that folklore asan academic discipline has tended to address cultural aspects of behaviorwhich, though informal and not protected from change, have nonethelessdemonstrated a certain consistency of form over time and which are particu-lar to a specic community or group within a larger society. Central is theconcept of \"traditional\" forms of expressive behavior, both stable and dynam-ic, which satisfy basic human needs at the immediate levels of subsistence(food, shelter, healing), and which also reflect and maintain deeper beliefs andvalues within a social group. The method of inquiry into these patterns ofbehavior has always been qualitative, setting the discipline apart from sociol-ogy, and has tended to concentrate investigation in communities and culturesexisting within the society of the investigator, rather than pursuing research inmore exotic faraway locals, as has often been the practice historically in theeld of anthropology. The tendency of folklorists to examine discrete expressive forms\u2014in the case of medical folklore, specic remedies\u2014has been both a liability and anasset to the discipline. At its best, the study of folklore incorporates what is mostvaluable in both the social sciences and the humanities, interpreting traditionalpractices as texts as dense in meaning as poetry. Early folk-medical scholarshipwas decidedly \"item-centered,\" resulting in ambitious cross-cultural compara-tive bibliographies such as the magisterial work produced from long le8 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 8boxes by Wayland Hand, in which practices common to many different com- munities and cultures could be examined and commonalities adduced. But theitem-centered approach\u2014not unlike the extreme forms of allopathic practice\u2014removes the object of their study from the rich matrix of social context, leavingbehind much of what may be relevant to an understanding of the whole picture.In this volume, Bonnie B. O'Connor and David J. Hufford, both pioneers in thearea of medical folklore, offer a comprehensive introduction to a contemporaryapproach to medical folklore centered on an understanding of folk belief sys-tems, examining the ways in which these systems draw on bodies of knowledgeand belief, support specic means of knowledge production, provide explana-tory models for causation and treatment, and supply evaluative strategies todetermine efcacy. If effectively pursued, the methods necessary for the quantitative inter- views customary among folklorists tend to undermine a purely item-centeredapproach. So-called \"participant observation\" has been at the methodologicalcore of anthropology and folklore for decades, a process in which the investi- gator acquires an experiential understanding of social process by actuallyengaging in the activities of a community while simultaneously observingthem with an eye to making sense of them in disciplinary terms. The conse-quences of this process of engagement have been pervasive. Readers whosebackground is medical may be surprised at the extent to which contributionsto this collection are presented in the rst person, unabashedly presenting\"consciousness of self\" as an integral part or the presentation of research. Whatmay appear to be a radical (and unnerving) subjectivity reflects a current ten-dency in the ethnographic disciplines toward a radical empiricism\u2014an expe-rience-centered approach which not only attempts to take into account the fullcomplexity of experience of individuals in the community being studied, butalso the full complexity of the subjective and objective experience being report-ed by the investigator. Thus readers of the article concerning Los Angelesbot\u00e1nicas by Michael Owen Jones and his colleagues can expect not only an analysis of the meaning of these \"invisible hospitals\" in the communities theyserve, but also an impressionistic evocation of their sights and smells. When a eld worker sets about studying a traditional healer, for example, he or she becomes a student, guratively and sometimes literally an apprenticeto that individual. The native preceptor may in fact become an active collabo-rator in the publication of the research, and, not surprisingly, an increasing number of researchers in the ethnographic disciplines are or become partici-pants in the cultures which they study. A collaborative model for research isbecoming increasingly common in folklore and anthropology. The articles\"Invisible Hospitals: Spiritual Herbal Centers in Ethnic AM Page Bag: Empirical Folk Remedies of Tillman Waggoner of Knoxville, T ennessee\" both represent such a cooperative model; in the latter the informality of the relationship between authors and practitioner is sug-gested by their references to the subject of the article by his rst name, \"Tim.\"Addressing the communicative conduits, both personal and commercial, inwhich folk medicine may be shared in a community, the authors raise old ques-tions concerning the role of the practitioner as both healer and entrepreneurin impoverished, underserved, or \"biomedically resistant\" communities. Theseare issues which go back at least to the herbal publications of NicholasCulpeper in the seventeenth century. A common stereotype of folklore culture views it as existing in isolation from both academic, elite culture and from prot-driven and media-promul-gated influences. \"Folk\" communities in which traditional ways predominateare scarce today, both in the U.S., and to an increasing extent, worldwide. Amore useful model suggests that each individual within complex contempo-rary cultures appropriates systematic elements of health belief from a numberof sources: communal and traditional, journalistic, commercial, and institu-tional. In \"Competing Logics and the Construction of Risk,\" Diane Goldsteinexamines the subtle cultural contextualization of even \"objective\" informationconduits concerning risk factors in AIDS, raising powerful questions con-cerning the consequences of policy based on such data. Shelley Adler exam-ines the bases on which breast cancer patients evaluate conventional andnonconventional treatment choices, and the implied consequences for bio-medical practitioners in addressing these patient choices. Both essays remindus that any approach to communication in health care is shaped at least inpart by culture-based terms and parameters. The so-called \"new age\" movement in health and spirituality has been something of a headache for folklorists and physicians alike. It is a loose termreferring to a quickening of interest dating from the late 1960s in religious and health belief systems characterized by a perceived integration of body, mind,and spirit and attunement of cosmic or natural forces; an eclectic appropria-tion of American Indian, Eastern, and self-constructed systems of healing andspirituality; and an appreciation of the therapeutic spiritual effects of alteredstates of consciousness (Levin and Coreil 1986). Physicians are frustrated by the critique of institutional medicine both implied and directly expressed by manydevotees of \"new age\" modalities. Accustomed to identifying and interpretingcommunity-based traditional behavior, folklorists are annoyed by the cavalierpopular appropriation of traditional practices in a manner that can be insensi-tive and even potentially exploitative, and are frustrated as well by the challengeto the traditional tools of investigation of cultural behavior, especially when the10 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 10\"community\" of practice is a virtual one often linked only by electronic means. William Clements and Frances Malpezzi discuss the dynamics supporting twoareas of new age interest: the borrowing of practices relating to the AmericanIndian sweat lodge rituals, and the attribution of authority to the medical rec-ommendations of the German medieval mystic Hildegard of Bingen. The nal two articles in this collection raise powerful questions for both ethnographers and practitioners of formal medicine, both at the phenomeno-logical and the epistemological levels. \"Participant observation\" as a method-ological technique is relatively straightforward for the eld worker when\"participation\" involves practices that do not challenge basic assumptions, val-ues, and beliefs. Mastering the steps of a social dance or learning to pat a tor-tilla into shape may provide valuable experiential insights that haveimplications for much higher levels of meaning. But for investigators who acci-dentally or intentionally place themselves in the way of experiences that areuninterpretable within their native frameworks of understanding, the conse-quences of participant observation can demand not just an empathic grasp ofthe beliefs of others, but a radical transformation of one's own beliefs andunderstandings and a concomitant distance placed between the researcher andhis or her constituency of colleagues and students, not to mention friends andfamily. When it is the body as well as the mind that has undergone an experi-ence uninterpretable save through \"other\" ways of knowing\u2014when the inves-tigator of healing practice is unexpectedly healed\u2014the issues go to the core ofwhat it means to know and to observe. Bonnie Glass-Cofn's discussion of thequestions crystallized by the challenge she faces in teaching ethnographiccourses based both on the Western critical tools of inquiry and on her ownexperience of shamanistic practice and healing provocatively frames many ofthe tensions faced by medical ethnographers, whether or not they have thecourage to address the tensions as directly and publicly as she does here.Pursuing related themes, Barre T oelken explores the meaning of a personalexperience in which, in Navajo terms, his survival required of his adopted fam-ily a series of immediate personal sacrices followed by tragic consequencesextending to the present\u2014a price with which he is only beginning to come togrips professionally and personally decades later. Most of the contributors to this volume have worked directly with for- mal medical institutions, applying their ethnographic expertise to contempo-rary problems in medical education and practice\u2014a relatively new area of\"applied folklore\" which has special relevance to those who look forward to anera in which a \"post-Flexnerian\" approach to primary care is an honorableand honored companion to purely scientic medicine. At the close of theabove-quoted essay in The Task of Medicine , Gayle Stephens recalls AbrahamIntroduction 11Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 11Flexner's likening of the role of the physician to that of an engineer who makes life and death decisions. Stephens suggests that \"a physician also needsthe creativity and intuitiveness of the novelist,\" the same qualities of observa-tion that also make for good interpretive ethnography. The contributors tothis volume look forward to updating colleagues on the status of research inthis rapidly developing area of our discipline. We also hope that the results ofour research will have a larger consequence, perhaps \"ambushing\" a few read-ers who as yet fail, as I too once failed, to see the dynamic, emergent nature ofnonconventional health belief systems, and the importance of understanding,and when appropriate, honoring the diversity of healing logics.

Hufford Introduction Both the term \"folk medicine\" and the conceptual category to which it refers are academic constructs that identify a particular subset of healing and healthcare practice. The most common interpretation of folk medicine in both pop-ular and professional thought is that it represents a body of belief and prac-tice isolated in various ways from the social and cultural \"mainstream\" andintriguingly unaffected by \"modern\" knowledge, with which it is frequentlycompared on the apparent presumption that \"folk\" and \"modern\" are mutu-ally exclusive classications. Folk medicine thus tends to be conceptualizedwithin a hierarchical model of knowledge and sophistication of thought, inwhich it is typically located in a sort of lower midsection between ofcial, sci-entic medicine at the hierarchical pinnacle and \"primitive\" medicine on thebottom stratum. In part this schema is a product of the widely influential nineteenth- century Anglo-European theory of cultural evolution. From this perspective,medicine, like the rest of culture, was presumed to have developed \"upward\" ina largely linear and unidirectional progression from its crudest, most primitiveform into its modern, Western, highly sophisticated state. All that was mosteffective, according to this theory, was retained and improved upon during thisascent, while discarded and obsolete ideas and practices drifted \"downward\"and were preserved in the \"lower layers\" of culture (somewhat tautologicallyidentied by their difference from or incongruence with the social class andcultural heritage membership of those who articulated the theory). This modelremains very influential in current popular and professional thought, despite /ornament21 13/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 13the fact that the evolutionary view of culture on which it was based has been largely dismissed by most modern scholars of culture. The simple evolutionary model leads almost inevitably to the erroneous conclusion that folk medical resources are by denition outdated and unin-formed, and to the equally erroneous presumption that they are likely to bereplaced by conventional biomedicine through improved access, together withthe processes of education and acculturation. (Until quite recently this was thetypical medical and academic perception of all the health care resources nowgaining increasing popularity and legitimacy, under the general heading ofcomplementary and alternative medicine, and it remains most persistent withrespect to those nonbiomedical systems and modalities classied as \"folk.\")On the other hand, there are also those who romanticize folk medicine,inverting the value structure to portray it as an important repository of once-universal human knowledge and talents abandoned or forgotten in the pushfor progress and increasingly complex technological development (Fulder1982; Grossinger 1982). The romantic view leads to misattributions to, and misinterpretations of, folk medical traditions. Neither of these models is anaccurate or sufcient depiction of the nature of folk medicine, of its robustpersistence in modern times, or of the complexity of the interactions betweenfolk medicine and other health and healing resources\u2014both through historyand in the present day. Dening Folk Medicine What makes some medicine \"folk\" is not the particular content of the systemof knowledge and practice, but the mode of transmission together with thestatus of the system by comparison with whatever other medical system is rec-ognized as \"ofcial\" in the local context (Y oder 1972; Press 1978). Folklorists generally consider a heavy reliance on oral transmission to be a denitive fea-ture of all aspects of folk culture. By this standard, folk medical systems arethose learned and maintained primarily through oral channels. Because in theUnited States there is at present practically no cultural or identity group thatis entirely independent of print and other technological media, the criterionof oral transmission is relative; that is, folk healing traditions have greaterreliance on orality by comparison with other healing systems that rely prima-rily on (usually fairly standardized) printed information sources. Unofcialstatus, with respect to \"ofcial\" dominant cultural forms, is another deningfeature of folk knowledge and practice. These two characteristics\u2014unofcialstatus and strong reliance on oral transmission\u2014therefore interact in den-ing folk medicine.14 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 14Oral traditions involve relatively direct communication among individu- als who share enough values and meanings for the communication to be accu- rately and easily interpreted, and for responses to have a direct and immediateimpact. Thus folk medical traditions tend to show regional variation and toaccommodate specic local conditions, as well as to be closely tied to groups orpopulations who share important identity-dening features such as a particu-lar ethnicity (for example, the Pennsylvania German Br\u00e4uche or powwow tra- dition), a broadly shared cultural heritage (like the recognition by manydistinct Latino populations of a hot/cold classicatory index for foods, medi-cines, and bodily states), or common regional influences (for instance, bothblacks and whites in the Appalachian South share many aspects of regional folkherbalism and its related worldview and theories of disease causation). Particularly in the present day, oral traditions often supplement direct, face-to-face speech with additional communicative media. In the UnitedStates these occasionally include use of telephones and circulation of audio-and videotapes to disseminate and maintain the vigor of traditional knowl-edge and practice and to accomplish or facilitate diagnostic and therapeuticends, as well as exchanges of self-care information and recommendations byphone, fax, and internet. In addition, most do include some written sourcematerials. For example, many refer closely to various religious scripturalsources and several include handwritten or printed books of recipes, formu-lae, verbal charms and prayers, and interpretive dicta. Pragmatic and Systematic Nature of Folk Medicine Several signicant oversights have characterized the study of folk medicineuntil quite recently. For example, although folk medicine, like all medicine,carries both benets and risks, the effectiveness of folk medical practices hasseldom been studied (with the exception of some ethnobotanical studies ofmedicinal plants), tending rather to be dismissed a priori as improbable. (Oneconsequence of this persistent academic blind spot is that we have no inde-pendently veriable record of the benets or detriments of the majority offolk medical practices, or of their effects on health outcomes.) The preceptsand practices of folk medicine have usually been presumed to be erroneous,and therefore thought to survive mainly through unexamined habitual usageor cultural custom. However, it is precisely the health promoting capacities ofany system or therapeutic modality that are of greatest importance to its pro-ponents and users. People dealing with health problems are typically quitepragmatic in approaching and evaluating any form of treatment or remedy: ifit seems not to work, or produces effects that are too unpleasant, it tends to beUnderstanding Folk Medicine 15Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 15rejected; if it seems to work, it tends to be supported and retained in the reper- toire of healing resources likely to be tried again (and recommended to oth-ers). This pragmatism operates at both individual and collective levels. Folkhealing traditions' reputations for efcacy, based on aggregate observationand experience, are central to their persistence and continued vitality. Folk medicine has historically been viewed as a rather random aggrega- tion of disparate ideas and practices. The presumed randomness and frag-mentation, however, are attributions based largely on insufcient depth ofstudy and unexamined assumptions. In fact, folk medical beliefs and practicesare typically organized into complex and coherent systems of thought, action,and content (Hufford 1988 a,1992,1994 ). Folk medical systems encompass, for example, complex bodies of knowledge and belief, specic modes of knowl-edge production (intuition, introspection, experimentation), evaluativeprocesses applied in assessing the effectiveness of interventions and the qual-ications of practitioners, denitions and categories of health and illness,explanatory models (Kleinman 1975, 1984) of disease etiology and human function, theories relating cause and nature of illness to preventive and ther-apeutic choices, specic repertoires of diagnostic and therapeutic actions andmateria medica, generalist and specialist practitioners and the means to theirtraining and legitimation within the system (apprenticeship, cross-gendertraining, supernatural selection), self-care modalities, and generative princi-ples for formulating system-consistent responses to new input arising from confronting novel situations (O'Connor 1995a) and from interactions with other systems, including biomedicine. One signicant reason that the systematic organization of folk medicine has been overlooked for so long is the fact that in modern Western society sys-tematization is a characteristic explicitly associated with ofcial status. In con-ventional biomedicine, for example, the use of textbooks and specied curricula;the development of professional societies, standardized practice guidelines,licensure requirements, and regulatory legislation; the establishment of third-party payor systems following minutely articulated reimbursement criteria; anda host of other features of ofcial culture foster the development and articula-tion of explicit systematization. In addition, these interconnecting features causethe systematization to be socially visible and prominently displayed in institu-tional forms\u2014clearly enough, in fact, that ordinary people commonly refer tothe entire aggregate as \"the [health care] System.\" Folk medicine, by contrast, generally relies more heavily on oral than printed transmission; is passed on more by observation and apprenticeshipthan by collective instruction in institutional settings; does not follow specif-ic curricular formulations; does not seek or generate formal licensure or legal16 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 16sanctions; does not give rise to professional publications or practitioner asso- ciations, or establish ties with external payors; and functions without internalor external requirements of standardization. These characteristics do not gen-erate the explicit display of a systematic framework of organization. However,the lack of such visible expression is not an indication that no systematizationexists. Within any folk healing tradition, the ways in which practitioners areselected, trained, and recognized as legitimate and qualied are interconnected,and are articulated with such other aspects of the system as help-seeking pat-terns (from self-care to seeking the services of a practitioner), understandingsof illness causation, modes of recompense for services, and so forth. For example, in spiritist healing traditions, practitioners are often iden- tied initially through some form of supernatural indication or selection, andacquire their specialized knowledge through a combination of apprenticeshipwith recognized healers and mystically or intuitively acquired knowledge.Their \"credentials,\" consisting of their communities' collective evaluations ofthem, derive in part from the reputations of those with whom they havetrained, and in part from their cumulative personal reputations for properand successful practice. Clients dealing with health problems are aware of arange of possible causes of illness, from environmental factors to spiritual orsupernatural ones. The client or patient who believes an illness to be mild, orto have only material causes, typically begins with self-treatment throughwidely familiar home remedies, may move to consultation with an herbalistwho has more specialized knowledge if results are not satisfactory, and uponsuspecting that the illness has a spiritual cause, then may seek the services ofthe spiritist healer. The healer, having acquired his or her abilities as super-natural or divine gifts, may refuse to charge for services rendered, though thepatient or a close relative may nevertheless leave an offering of goods ormoney in exchange or in gratitude. All of these features are systematicallylinked through shared bodies of knowledge and principles of action that forma coherent and integrated whole. Members of the system may nevertheless beunable to describe it in much detail, to identify its many components, or toarticulate the principles by which these features are interconnected: they candoit, even if they cannot say precisely how and why. The most useful explanatory analogy is language. Ofcial (\"correct\") English has a rigorous and highly complex systematic structure that is codi-ed in books. There are ofcial English speakers and teachers who can recitethe rules and correct inaccurate usages. Practically all American children areexposed to much of this ofcial system, and some even learn it, though mostdo not achieve prociency in articulating its structural elements and princi-ples. Folk language (for instance local dialects and vernaculars, or slang) doesUnderstanding Folk Medicine 17Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM 17not have such a prominent codied system, but linguists have amply demon- strated that a complex system is nonetheless present and is consistently actedupon. Speakers speak their particular linguistic forms correctly (with varyingdegrees of individual competence) and recognize errors, but they generallynd it difcult to state the rules behind the distinctions. A linguist can inferthe rules, however, through observation, analysis, and the questioning ofspeakers, and can construct an accurate descriptive grammar on the basis ofthese inferences. Systems of folk medical belief and practice operate in the same fashion. Believers vary both in the scope of their traditional knowledge and in their competence to act within the system. Some, for example, folk healers, may beable to state the theoretical basis or directly describe substantial portions ofthe system, but the entire system is rarely available for direct inspection. Thenatural form for the expression of folk medical knowledge is in actions and innarratives about events. The theories and complex content of the systemsmust therefore at least in part be inferred from observing and listening tothose who act within them. Then, like linguistic inferences, they can bechecked with \"insiders\" for validity and situational applicability. Core Concepts and Characteristics Folk medicine in the United States comprises a very large and diverse array ofhealth practices and beliefs. Because of the ethnic and cultural heterogeneityof the U.S. population, American folk medicine bears the influences of heal-ing traditions and practices from all over the world. Although the range of dis-tinct folk medical systems and modalities in the United States is enormous,many of these systems do share a number of fundamental concepts that canbe broadly identied\u2014so long as one bears in mind that the ne points ofspecic interpretations and the precise combinations in which they are foundvary from system to system. Characteristics of folk medical systems Transmission primarily through oral means, coupled with unofcial status Health as harmony or balance Interrelation of body, mind, spirit Vitalism Magical or supernatural elements Thoughts and emotions as etiologic factors Concern with underlying causes Positive/negative energies; transference of energies Moral tone; meaning of illness18 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 18Health as harmony or balance. Most folk medical systems dene health in terms of some form of harmony or balance. This balance can be among bod- ily humors or regulatory substances; innate properties such as heat and coldor yin and yang; forces such as upward and downward or inward and outwardmotion; states of the blood or other vehicles of internal bodily nourishmentand cleansing; or periods of activity and rest. The spectrum of health practicesis informed by this concept of balance. Many Latino, Caribbean, Asian, andSoutheast Asian folk traditions, for example, incorporate a balance betweenhot and cold properties of foods, medicaments, and symptoms or bodilystates. Cold conditions are offset with hot foods and medicines; hot condi-tions with cool ones. The goal of preventive and therapeutic actions is tomaintain or restore health by moving toward a neutral center, usually with apreference for remaining slightly on the warm side (Harwood 1971, 1981; Schreiber and Homiak 1981;D u o n al. 1990 ; Gleave and Manes 1990 ). In addition to internal states of equilibrium, harmony between the indi- vidual and external factors such as social, environmental, spiritual, and cos-mological elements may affect health. For example, times of seasonal changeare typically regarded as times of particular vulnerability to illness, and mayrequire special protective steps such as seasonal \"tonics,\" specic foods to betaken or avoided, and attention to health-promoting dress. Protection fromexposure to cold, particularly in the form of cold air, drafts, and wind is acommon preventive measure against ill health (indeed, it is difcult to nd aperson of any background or persuasion who did not grow up with some form of routine familial advice concerning protection from cold for reasonsof health maintenance and disease prevention). This concern accompanies apervasive conviction that cold can enter the body and accumulate, causing orcontributing to a large variety of illnesses both immediately and in the (evenquite distant) future (Snow 1974; Helman 1978; Ragucci 1981;D u o n g 1987). Cosmological factors such as lunar and astrological cycles may also be identi-ed as affecting health or vitality in a variety of ways. These may call forbehavioral adjustments to maintain a healthful balance or reduce health risk,and may be factored into the planting, harvesting, and preparation of medic-inal plants and other substances (Snow 1977; Crellin and Philpott 1990 ). Interrelation of body, mind, and spirit. Most folk healing systems assume a complex interconnectedness of body, mind, and spirit (Harwood 1977; Trotter and Chavira 1981; Reimensnyder 1987; Hufford and Chilton 1996). The balance and harmony that dene health incorporate all of these aspects of persons, and disturbances inUnderstanding Folk Medicine 19Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 19any of the aspects can produce sickness and symptoms in any of the others. Physical injury or sickness may bring about mental, emotional, or spiritualunwellness; emotional disturbance and mental unrest or worry may cause orexacerbate physical illness and disease. Spiritual well-being and harmony maybe crucial aspects of health, and are variously dened in terms of an individ-ual's inner state as well as in terms of relationships between human individu-als and spiritual entities understood to interact with the material world and toinfluence personal health and more general well-being (success, prosperity,happiness, social relations) in a variety of ways. Vital force or essence. The human body is understood in most folk medical systems to be animated and sustained by a special type of force, energy, oressence whose presence and proper activity are essential to life and health. Thenature, source, behavior, and manipulability of this life-sustaining force arevariously dened across systems. There is a wide range of spiritual and meta-physical interpretations of this vital force, including, in some systems, con-nection of each individual's vital force with universal or cosmological fonts orreservoirs (Davis 1988). Damage to or disturbance, obstruction, or capture of the vital force leads to illness; restoration of its proper embodiment, freedom,and function promotes healing. Magical and supernatural elements. A signicant number of folk medical systems recognize magical and supernatural elements in disease etiology. Thesemay include, for example, sin as a direct cause of illness and disharmony; inter-ventions by deities or spirit entities causing illness as retribution or reminder;undesirable states of spirit possession or intrusion (Duong 1987); spiritual causes such as soul loss or capture (Harwood 1981; Trotter and Chavira 1981; Rubel et al. 1984;D a v i s 1988; Dinh et al. 1990; Stephenson 1995); and malign human agency such as cursing, hexing witchcraft, 1977, 1981; Ragucci Brainard and Zaharlick 1989). In some systems there are illness types that are specic to supernatural or magical causation. In addition, many systems recognize the possibility of vari-able causation, including supernatural elements, for any type of disease or ill- ness (mental illnesses, infectious diseases, cancers, et cetera). Particulardevelopments or details of an illness episode may suggest that supernaturalcausal factors are involved. In Haitian and Haitian-American folk healing tra-dition, for example, a magical or supernatural origin for disease may be sug-gested by sudden and severe onset, or by an unusually protracted course(LaGuerre 1987); in many Latino cultures, by either lengthy duration or failure20 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 20to respond to standard (folk or conventional) treatment (Harwood 1977, 1981; Schreiber and Homiak 1981; Trotter and Chavira 1981); in African-American folk healing, by inability of a medical doctor to arrive at a diagnosis or identi- fy a cause for troubling symptoms, or by a continual worsening of symptomsin spite of medical treatment (Snow 1974). Treatment of illnesses that have supernatural or magical causal factors may involve simultaneous use of conventional biomedicine and one or more folkhealing systems. Herbal remedies or conventional medicine may be the systemused for symptom relief or to handle illnesses that seem serious. Whenever mag-ical or supernatural causes are determined to be involved, however, these mustalso be properly addressed in the healing effort or else illness can be expected torecur, even if symptoms abate for the near term. Some of these types of healingmeasures can be carried out on one's own or in the context of the family, forexample, through prayer, offerings, ritual baths and cleansings, use of specicmedicaments and other protective and therapeutic substances, and so forth.Others require the interventions of a specialist practitioner, such as a curandera, shaman, rootworker, powwow, religious authority, or spiritual healer. Thoughts and emotions as etiologic factors. Obsessive, fearful, or negative thoughts, mental unrest and worry, and extremes of emotion (especiallystrong and negative emotions, such as anger or envy) are regarded as directetiologic factors for illness in a number of systems. These factors too may beconsidered contributory in any type of disease or illness process (not just inmental and emotional illness), and again require that appropriate therapeuticaction be taken to address them in order for healing to be complete or lasting. One example common to many systems is envy as a possible etiologic factor in illness, both for the envious person and for those who are objects ofthe envy. Symptoms (for either person) may include headache, sleep distur-bance, nightmares, fatigue or lassitude, loss of appetite, and gastric distress,among others. Envy as a direct cause of illness in others may be mediatedthrough the envious or covetous gaze or the evil eye, which may be cast bothintentionally and unintentionally (Foulks Ragucci 1981; Assanand et al. 1990). Evil eye beliefs form a part of many American folk medical systems. Babies and children may be considered espe-cially susceptible, and protective charms and amulets are commonly worn bychildren and adults alike as a preventive measure. Concern with underlying causes. Most folk medical systems seek to identify and treat underlying as well as immediate causes of disease. Underlying causes help to establish the conditions under which illness may develop or disease takeUnderstanding Folk Medicine 21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 21hold, and may represent some type of fundamental imbalance or disharmony. This view generally accommodates conventional medical views quite readily, forexample, accepting medical etiologies as identifying certain immediate causes.Thus, a germ may be accepted as the immediate cause of a disease, but it isunderstood to have caused it in a particular person at a particular time becauseof, for example, intemal disequilibrium (hot/cold, or yin/yang), a buildup oftoxins in the body, individual sinfulness, violation of dietary requirements(which in some instances may itself be a sin), diminished vital energy, and soforth (Hufford 1993; O'Connor 1995a). From the perspective of the folk medical system, diseases, and the body's susceptibility to their pathological agents, are often considered to be symptoms of underlying imbalances that require redress.This attention to underlying causes commonly leads proponents to feel that folkmedicine treats the causes of ill health, while conventional medicine addresses itself primarily or exclusively to the symptoms. This view furnishes a conceptu- al framework in which the two kinds of healing systems can readily be integrat- ed together in treating disease and promoting health. Energies and transference. An emphasis on various kinds of \"energy\" is almost universal in folk medical systems, beginning, as previously noted, with the recognition of an animating energy or vital force. Folk medicine ofteninvolves several kinds of positive energies in promoting healing, and these arefrequently contrasted with negative, life-destroying energies. Disease mayresult from imbalances in or the loss or theft of vital energy, but it may also becaused by the presence or intrusion of negative energies. These energies maybe implicated in both natural and supernatural concepts of disease etiology.For example, improper preparation or cooking of foods may destroy theirenergetic vitality (natural), or witchcraft may steal it (supernatural), resultingin food that appears good but cannot nourish. Either circumstance can leadto illness. A transference of positive energy from healer to patient is a characteris- tic of those systems in which a practitioner's hands are used therapeutically on or near the patient's body. In secular interpretations, this healing energy maybe understood to come from within the healer's own vital energy stores or topass through the healer from a cosmic source. In religious or spiritual inter-pretations, the healing energy is usually considered to be of divine origin;healers stress that it is God (or another powerful spiritual gure, dependingon the system) who does the actual healing, while the practitioner is but anintermediary. Many of the folk beliefs interpreted by scholars as based on the princi- ple of \"magical contagion\" imply the exchange of such energies. Material22 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 22objects may be endowed with negative energies and placed in the victim's environment; or the residue of a victim's unique life force in hair, nail parings,or an object long worn on his or her body may serve to focus the transmissionof negative force, as in malign magical assault using gurines or magical pack-ets. (These techniques are found, for example, in rootwork, a part of African-American folk tradition, and in some forms of Pennsylvania-German hexing.)In some traditions of prayer healing and psychic healing, conversely, personalobjects still resonant with the sick person's life force serve to focus \"distanthealing.\" Disease, as a negative energy, may be transferred out of a person andinto another living organism (such as a tree or an animal), or onto anotherobject\u2014as a wart is transferred onto a potato or a silver coin in some folk wartcures, later to wither away as the potato decays, or to be transferred to a newhost along with the coin (Hand 1980 ). Conversely, positive energies and innate qualities (serenity, courage, vigor) may be imbibed with specic therapeuticsubstances and contribute in this nonpharmacologic way to the restoration ormaintenance of health. Moral tone. Folk healing systems generally incorporate a strong moral ele- ment such as a presumption of the inherent goodness of Nature, or a sense of personal responsibility for right behavior and health-protecting actions.T ogether with the high value placed on harmony and balance, these moral ele-ments underscore the interconnectedness of personal health with the commu-nity, the physical environment, and the cosmos, and integrate the experience ofsickness and health within a comprehensive and meaningful view of the world.This accounts for the characteristic way in which folk medical systems addressthe meaning of disease and suffering alongside attention to causation and cure,helping to furnish explanations for the always urgent questions that seriouslysick people have of why (in the moral or metaphysical sense) they are sick, whyin this way, and why now. Disease and Illness Classications Folk medical systems include illness taxonomies which tend, on the whole, toclassify illnesses according to causation. In systems that incorporate a hot/coldindex, one way of classifying diseases (or specic symptoms) is by their hot orcold type. Folk medical systems of Southeast-Asian historical origin may clas-sify diseases and syndromes as caused primarily by \"wind,\"\"re,\" or other ele-ments in the body. Across a number of systems, two broad categories indicatenatural or supernatural causation. In several systems, as mentioned, any dis-ease or illness may entail natural and/or supernatural causality, and featuresUnderstanding Folk Medicine 23Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 23of the particular illness episode and its progression will help to determine which factors are implicated and in which ways. In African-American folk tradition, sickness can be broadly classied as natural or unnatural. Natural illnesses occur in accordance with the properworkings of Nature (or, in a religious interpretation, in accordance with God'slaws); unnatural ones are brought on by means that in some way violate God'swill (in religious terms) or the natural order (in secular terms), such as sick-ness caused by sorcery or by excessive worry or mental unrest (Snow 1974, 1977). Both natural and unnatural sicknesses may have material causes (such as germs), or may have divine causal elements such as punishment for sin, orillness sent as a test or reminder of faith and religious duty. Across folk medical systems, some types of illness may be specic to one category while for others a variable type of causation is possible, and etiology may differ in specic instances of the same disease. Causality may also bemixed, or one type may establish the imbalance or disharmony (underlyingcause) that makes a person vulnerable to another form of (immediate) causalagent or circumstance. Treatment is in accordance with the nature and causesof the disease. As new information is gained in the course of the illness, or asprior treatment strategies are deemed ineffective or inappropriate, substitu-tions or additions will be made in the treatment strategy\u2014both within thefolk medical system and by incorporation of other treatment forms such aselements from other systems, including conventional medicine. Folk Illnesses Folk healing systems generally include recognition of some types of illnessthat are not recognized as disease categories in the biomedical diagnosticcanon. These illnesses are referred to by scholars and health professionals as\"folk illnesses,\" sometimes also 1988b; Pang Association 1994). The concept of \"folk illness\" is an academic construct which takes the diagnostic and etiological categories of biomedicine as its ref-erence point. The implication of the label is that an illness so referenced is not\"real,\" or at least is not \"really\" what people who accept it as real believe it tobe. This is an etic viewpoint that is of course not shared by members of andbelievers in the folk medical systems in which these illness categories arefound. Cultural insiders likewise do not use the term \"folk illness,\" referringinstead to each such illness by its own culturally supplied name (Snow 1977; Harwood 1981; 1987).24 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 24Folk illnesses, like other illnesses, have recognized etiologies, particular constellations of symptoms, diagnostic criteria, identied sequelae, and speci- ed preventive and therapeutic measures. Some folk illnesses appear to repre-sent local names or varied symptom patterns of currently recognized medicaldisorders (Rubel et al. 1984; Hufford 1992), while others do not seem to have medical correlates (although they are frequently\u2014and often erroneously\u2014reinterpreted in psychiatric terms by health professionals and researchers). Ineither case, some aspects of the explanatory model of folk illnesses will departfrom the conventional medical model, and treatment will follow the system-congruent reasoning: cooling excess heat, restoring proper motion of vitalforce, dispelling cold or toxins accumulated in the body, extirpating evil influ-ences, and so on. Folk medical causality and therapeutics are not conned sole-ly to folk illnesses, however, but are also applied to medically recognizeddiseases. This is another element that helps to account for the fact that folkhealing traditions are frequently combined as therapeutic options both withbiomedicine and with other unofcial systems or modalities with which par-ticular individuals may be familiar. Some folk illnesses are closely tied to specic populations or healing tra- ditions, while others are widely recognized across cultures and systems. Ofthese, perhaps the most ubiquitous is soul loss, called by a variety of system-specic names, and sometimes academically referred to as \"magical fright\" or\"fright illness\" (Simons and Hughes 1985 ). The fundamental pathogenic fac- tor in soul loss is inappropriate, undesirable, or unintentional separation of aliving person's soul from the body. Soul loss (perhaps most familiar to aca-demics and researchers by its Spanish name, susto [Rubel et al. 1984]) is rec- ognized across a number of systems as most commonly being caused by severefright, trauma, or emotional shock. This may be precipitated by experiencing(or even witnessing) a frightening accident or incident of violence or brutali-ty, receiving sudden bad news for which one is unprepared, experiencingextended extreme hardship, or being caught up in terrifying natural eventssuch as earthquakes and other natural disasters. Some systems also recognizethe possibility of soul loss through capture by human sorcerers (Davis 1988) or malicious spirits (Geddes 1976). Like many medically recognized conditions, soul loss is considered both a sickness in itself, and a contributing factor in other illnesses. Soul loss isalways serious, and if not properly treated can lead to death. Indications arethat treatment outcomes for at least some folk illnesses, including susto, arebest when the appropriate traditional remedies are used or the indicated folkhealers provide the treatment (Rubel et al. 1984). It is important that health professionals not dismiss or trivialize folk illnesses since, for at least some ofUnderstanding Folk Medicine 25Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 25them, there is also evidence that their sufferers are at increased risk for gener- al morbidity and mortality (Rubel et al. 1984), and in some cases traditional treatments may also have important clinical consequences, both positive andnegative (Trotter 1981a,1981b,1985; Lazar and O'Connor 1997). Folk Practitioners Self-care or family care and home-based rst aid account for a great propor-tion of health behavior in both folk tradition and \"mainstream\" practice.Household staples such as eggs, lemons, garlic, chicken soup, rice, and otherfoodstuffs are used preventively and therapeutically across populations andtraditions, together with common medicinal plants and herbs; and their prop-er preparation and applications tend to be matters of general knowledge.Many households maintain a small herb or medicine garden, or keep a few ofthe \"standards\" potted indoors. Dietary and behavioral patterns may or maynot explicitly be considered parts of \"health care,\" yet still may constituteimportant health behaviors within the system and follow system-consistentorganizing principles. Generalist and specialist practitioners are also found in most folk med- ical systems. Across several traditions these include midwives, massagers,bonesetters, blood stoppers, wart curers, thrush or \"thrash\" doctors (forinfants and children), healers of burns and other skin conditions, religious,magical, and spiritual specialists of various kinds, and herbalists. Selection asa practitioner occurs in a number of ways. Common among these are birthorder or other birth circumstances; conferring of divine or other supernatu-rally bestowed gifts and callings; special life circumstances; transformativepersonal experiences, including experiences of serious illness and healing;familial inheritance; and of course self-selection for reasons of personal desireor interest (Hand 1980 ). Seventh children\u2014especially seventh sons\u2014are widely believed to be born with special powers and abilities, and among these may be the gift of heal-ing. (Variations on this theme include the seventh same-sex child with no inter-vening opposite sex births, or the seventh son of a seventh son.) The gift doesnot usually become active until near adulthood, though there are instances ofchild healers in many folk systems. Twins may have innate healing abilities, andif one twin dies the \"left twin\" (the one left behind) is especially likely subse-quently to be able to heal. Posthumous children (those born after the death oftheir mothers\u2014usually a death in childbirth, but also deaths from other cir-cumstances such as illness or accident, following which the child is taken alivefrom the womb) are often considered born healers, either with general healing26 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 26abilities, or with a particular capacity to heal thrush and other diseases of infan- cy and childhood (Hand 1980). Children born with a veil or caul (a portion of the amniotic membrane covering the face or eyes) may be believed destined tobe healers, and sometimes also to have \"second sight\" or clairvoyant abilities,which may also be used in their healing vocations. Ordinary individuals may be singled out to become healers by receipt of a divine or other supernatural gift or calling. The indication of this calling cancome in a number of ways, including mystical experience, notication indreams or visions, direct cognitive awareness, human messenger (oftenanother person with special abilities), or a series of subtle signs whose cumu-lative import gradually becomes clear. It is common in a number of traditionsfor individuals singled out in this way to nd the gift or calling burdensome,and to try to ignore or reject it\u2014especially as acting on it may require sub-stantial changes in behavior and lifestyle. Typically the attempt to refuse sucha calling results in an escalating series of illnesses and other misfortunes thatbefall the designee, until he or she reaches the point of determining that thegift or calling is truly an imperative and must be accepted. Acceptance and theaccompanying change in life direction resolve the preceding state of disrup-tion of the healer's life. Special life circumstances such as widowhood or childlessness may confer healing ability or simply make a (potential) healer readily identiable(Hand 1980). Transformative life experiences, including mystical and vision- ary experiences, religious conversion, and instances of sudden and extremegood or bad fortune may prompt a person to become a healer, or provide asign of a calling. Serious illness which subsequently resolves or is healed byspecic means (including biomedical ones), together with accidents thatleave the victim permanently changed in some way, also gure prominentlyamong these transformative experiences. In some cases this may be simplybecause harsh personal experience yields insight and empathy and a desire tohelp others; in others, the illness experience includes receipt of special infor-mation or mystical insight. Shamanic healers may in the course of their ill-ness enter the spirit world and there be instructed, tested, assaulted, or evenspiritually killed and resurrected, and return to consciousness and the mate-rial world redirected to become healers (Eliade 1964 ). Supernatural selection may be implied in the occurrence of any transformative experience, includ-ing illness. The likelihood of such selection may or may not run in families.Selection or calling to become a healer may itself bestow healing abilitiesdirectly upon the designee, or these may have to be acquired through a peri-od of apprenticeship\u2014sometimes quite long and arduous\u2014with an Medicine 27Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 27Common Therapeutic Practices The enormous diversity of American folk medicine makes it impossible to enumerate every therapeutic practice found in every system. There are, how-ever, broad common categories of preventive and therapeutic modalities inuse across systems, including physically applied therapies, medicinal herbsand other naturally derived substances, sacramental objects, and prayers andother religious and spiritual actions. It is important to note that these are notmutually exclusive categories. Indeed, it is most common to nd considerableoverlap among them, for example, medicinal herbs used in a mash physicallyapplied to the body, with accompanying prayer, for the purpose of bringingabout spiritual purication as a step in the healing process. Of course, particular theories of the modes of action of these therapies, and of the relationship between a particular therapy and the specic healthcondition or individual illness episode for which it is applied, vary across heal-ing traditions in keeping with system-specic explanatory models of healthand illness and care. Because standardization is not a feature of folk medicine,it is also quite common to nd signicant variation from region to region, orfrom healer to healer, in the interpretation and applications of even thosepractices most fundamental to a given system. Religious, spiritual, and magical actions and sacramental objects. Spiritual and magicoreligious actions commonly used to promote health and healinginclude prayer; reading or recitation of sacred texts; SaintAnne, us!\"); recitation of verbal charms and brief formulaic utterances(such as \"knock wood\" or \" kain ein horeh \") to ward off misfortune or evil influences; protective gestures such as making the sign of the cross, or spittingbetween the rst two ngers or extending the index and little ngers to wardoff the evil eye; meditation and spiritual contemplation of a variety of types;laying on of hands or use of the hands near the body to remove illness andnegative influences or energies; petitions and offerings to or bargaining withspiritual entities; visits to holy sites and healing shrines; temporary intern-ment in places of worship or spiritual contemplation; burning of incense andof \"spirit money\" or joss paper; spiritual cleansings of a variety of types(including herbal baths, and \"sweepings\" with plant and animal substances);soul callings and restorations; preparation of gurines and magical packets;and use of amulets and other protective items, among innumerable other pos-sibilities. Prescription or administration of botanical and other naturalmedicaments, as mentioned, may occur in a religious healing setting, with28 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 28spiritual instruction or guidance, or with spiritual or metaphysical health out- comes in mind. Natural substances. Ethnic and regional cultures almost without exception have developed a materia medica of locally available natural substances\u2014botanical, animal, and mineral. Therapeutic goals and modes of use of thesenatural medicines are determined by the tenets of a wide variety of theoreti-cal models, and pharmacological and biochemical models do not necessarilyapply (O'Connor 1986 ). Herbs and other natural medicinals are used for their physical actions and effects, but also (among other purposes) for metaphysi-cal properties such as hot and cold or yin and yang qualities and effects; forspiritual qualities with which they are associated, such as purity, patience,inner strength, or calm; for effects they will have on the quality and functionof the body's vital energy; or for their capacity to absorb and carry away neg-ative influences. Natural medicants are taken orally as teas or soups and are cooked into foods, both primarily as medicines, and as culinary herbs intended to provideboth gustatory and salutary benets. They are used as inhalants and as ingre-dients in sweats, and wet or dry packs, massagecompounds; and in moxibustion (the burning on or very near the skin sur-face of tiny amounts of dried compressed plant material). Specic substancesmay be used to \"sweep\" the body in ritual cleansings, drawing out disease-causing malignancies. Eggs or small live animals are also used for this purposein many settings, because their life force may successfully substitute for thevital essence of the patient as a target for malign forces, possessing spirits, andother agents of ill health which may be transferrable out of the patient. Any natural substances, in any of their multitudinous modes of use, may be used to achieve physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual healing objectives.An herb taken internally is as likely to be intended to bring about changes inthe state or motion of vital energy, to imbue a quality of character or state ofmind, or to enhance or restrain specic bodily functions, for example, as it isto alleviate a physical symptom. An herbal rubdown or sweeping may be usedto draw out a fever or put an end to respiratory distress as well as to deal withspiritual or metaphysical aspects of illness. Physical therapies. Various forms of massage, stroking, and rubbing are physical therapies found in numerous folk medical traditions. As with herbsand other natural medicinals, the therapeutic goals are varied. For example,abdominal massage is used in Mexican-American folk healing to achieveUnderstanding Folk Medicine 29Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 29specific physical ends: alleviation of intestinal gas or of muscle pain and cramping, or release of \"stuck\" digestive products that are thought to adhereto the stomach lining, causing the folk illness empacho (Schreiber and Homiak 1981;T r o t t e r 1981a, 1985). Pinching and lifting of the skin may serve a similar purpose, while other forms of massage and physical manipulationare intended to ameliorate the flow and functional status of vital energy, orto promote states of physical relaxation or mental or emotional calm or clar- ity. In some Southeast-Asian traditions, dermabrasive techniques such asrubbing the skin with a lubricated metal utensil or coin (hence the Englishname, \"coining\") have as their goal the release of \"wind\" (Y eatman and Dang1980;D u o n g 1987), an etiologic factor in a variety of illness states. Cupping is used in folk medical traditions of a wide range of ethnic and cultural ori-gins. This entails placing on the skin (most commonly on the back andupper shoulders) small cups or jars which adhere by means of a vacuum cre-ated when they are first heated. Depending on the tradition within whichthis treatment is undertaken, it is intended to draw impurities, excesshumors, \"bad blood,\" or \"wind\" out of the body; if blood is specifically to bereleased, small cuts may be made in the skin before placement of the cups. A number of folk medical traditions also include physical actions which are intended to achieve their therapeutic ends through essentially magical ormetaphysical means. These include such practices as \"measuring\" (sometimesusing a specic type or color of ribbon or string), and \"passing through,\" apractice in which the sick person (most often a child) is passed through a forkor other opening in a tree, during which process it is intended that the sick-ness or other negative energy or undesirable influence will be drawn out(Hand 1980 ). Interactions with Other Systems Most people\u2014even those for whom a single health care system is dominant\u2014 use a wide variety of home treatment and prevention strategies far more oftenthan they seek the services of any kind of practitioner (Levin et al. 1976; Dean 1981). If they do consult a doctor or other healer, these self-care practices often continue in some way to be used together with newly prescribed regimens. Theherb teas taken to promote relaxation or sleep during an episode of disablingback pain, for example, are not necessarily replaced by the treatments of a chi-ropractor, the prescriptions of a physician, or the ministrations of a religioushealer, but used concurrently with the practitioner's services. Indeed, allof these resources may be used simultaneously without causing any sense of dis-sonance or conflict for the patient: each may be seen to address a specic aspect30 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 30of the problem, or all may be felt to complement and support each other in a well-rounded therapeutic plan (Hufford 1992; O'Connor 1995a, 1995b). Self-care efforts are typically informed by a mixture of folk and \"ofcial\" belief, gleaned during an individual's life through a variety of exposures andexperiences. These are incorporated together into a coherent, if sometimesquite eclectic, personal system (Hufford 1988a), and involve beliefs that shape the manner in which any practitioner's advice is interpreted and pursued. Forexample, for adherents of a folk healing system incorporating a hot-cold theory, use of a medical doctor or other healer is common. If an herbal orpharmaceutical medication classied according to the folk taxonomy as \"hot\"is prescribed for a disease or symptom classied as \"cold,\" it is likely to beaccepted readily because its use is consonant with the patient's model ofhealthful balance. If \"hot\" symptoms or side effects then develop, however, itis likely that the dosage will be reduced or the medication discontinued: thehot medicine may be thought to be creating too much internal heat in thebody (Harwood 1971), or the hot symptoms may be an indication that the body's balance has shifted and it is time to stop the treatment. If other typesof treatments provided by a folk or \"alternative\" practitioner produce symp-toms or reactions indicating disturbance of hot/cold balance, these too arelikely to be suspended or amended to become congruent with the individual'sdominant model. For different patients the number of resources and the order in which they are brought to bear will vary depending on the availability of each optionand other features of the sickness context, including the advice and opinionsof trusted others and the nature and severity of the illness. The same personis likely to activate different health resources, or to come to them in a differ-ent order, for each particular health problem. Many people will try a folk rem-edy or have a folk healer treat them for warts much more readily than they willseek out a physician for the same purpose. The same individual may see a chi-ropractor for neck pain or chronic headaches but never for severe gastroin-testinal symptoms, which are instead presented to a medical doctor. Theservices of the folk healer may be (re-)added if other treatments seem not tobe working. If a diagnosis or prognosis is sufciently alarming, it may movethe patient to use modalities or practitioners which have been a part of his orher broader cultural repertoire, but of which he/she was previously fearful orskeptical. Entirely new and previously unfamiliar options may be sought outif new information has recently been acquired through the media, or throughthe patient's social network\u2014a source of abundant health-related informa-tion and advice at almost any time, but especially so when one is known tohave a health problem.Understanding Folk Medicine 31Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 31The precise patterns of folk medical use are highly individualized and case-specic. Folk medical systems have constant interactions with conven- tional medicine, though often without the knowledge of the medical profes-sion. Many folk healers freely refer clients to medical doctors, even insist thatthey go, and they sometimes come into hospitals to continue to provide treat-ments for their patients (Hufford 1988 a). The conventional medical model can be incorporated rather easily along with folk models of illness, and in someinstances may even serve to reinforce them (Helman 1978). Predictions that folk medicine would (even \"should\") die out in the face of scientic medical advances have been made in the United States for well over a century. They clearly have not been borne out to date, and there is noreason to suppose that they will be realized in the future. These healing sys-tems are dynamic and flexible, readily incorporating new content and adapt-ing to changing conditions while preserving many traditional elements,including some ideas and practices considered outmoded in parallel healingtraditions. Folk medicine remains vigorously active in the United States, con-tinually attracting new proponents who nd the systems effective, broadlyaccessible, and often comfortably consonant with their general worldviews. Itis fair to say that folk medicine is an important part of the total pool of healthcare resources upon which people draw for both therapeutic and preventivepurposes. From herbalism to food customs to the use of prayer in preservingand restoring health, folk medicine is in fact the most basic and persistentdimension of the pluralistic health culture of the United States.

Polk, with Ysamur Flores-Pe\u00f1a and Roberta J. Evanchuk The extent to which folk medicine is practiced today by Hispanics is not clearly established. Probably its popularity varies in different regions of thecountry. . . . But the one thing that is denite is that faith healers are apart of the Hispanic culture and that some Hispanics do utilize their serv-ices. This alone should be reason enough to look to faith healers as apotential reserve when considering the most effective ways for providinghelp to Hispanics. (LeVine and Padilla 1980, 150,186) their existence scarcely noted by medical and cultural researchers, bot\u00e1nicas have burgeoned in recent years not only in Los Angeles but throughout the country (principal works on the subject include Borrello andMathias 1977; Fisch 1968;G e o r g e 1980 ;M u r p h y 1988; and Suro 1991 ). For many Latinos and African Americans in Los Angeles, they are a point of entry intothe community, the source of familiar sacramental items, a mainstay of spiri-tual, family, and personal counseling, and the provider of crucial herbalpreparations for various illnesses. Associated with such ethnomedical andspiritual systems as Santer\u00eda, folk \"conjure\" bot\u00e1nicas sell herbal prod-ucts, ritual implements, and sacramental goods as well as provide medical andspiritual consultations. As such, they are an urban, community-basedresource serving a variety of immigrant and migrant groups. Bot\u00e1nicas also /ornament21 39/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 39attract the general populace dissatised with conventional medi- cine, in search of holistic healing, or seeking alternative therapies. Bot\u00e1nicas as an alternative health care provider are important because of several facts about the population of southern California. First, the fami-lies of nearly half of Los Angeles County's 8.8million residents came from Latin America, the Caribbean, and the American South. According to the1990 census, some cities consist almost entirely of Latinos, African Americans, or both. The rst account for three-fourths of El Monte's popu-lation of 106,209. Huntington Park's residents include 51,496 Mexicans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, and Puerto Ricans. A quarter of a century ago Compton was 5 percent Hispanic and 93 percent black; among the 90,454individuals now dwelling there, 39,510are Latinos and 49,598are African Americans, about one-third of whom migrat- ed from southern states. Many African American businesses in Compton have yielded to Latino storefront churches as a result of these changingdemographics (Weightman 1993, 8). More than one-fourth of California's population is foreign born, most of whom are from Mexico and Asia. TheLegislative Analyst's Ofce estimates that between 1990 and 2010, California's Hispanic population will double and the state's Asian population will growby two-thirds (www.lao.ca.gov). Another reason bot\u00e1nicas need to be studied is that according to public health surveys 6.6million Californians lack health insurance, 1.8million of whom are children. Those without insurance include 38percent of the state's nonelderly Latino residents and 22percent of African Americans. Los Angeles County has the largest portion of uninsured residents, most of whom work inmenial jobs with no fringe benets or at a wage too low to afford premiumswhen available. Without insurance, they have limited access to preventivemedicine and often must delay professional treatment (Edelman, Lazarus, andSalisbury 1998; Maugh 1998;P y l e 1999 ; also see www.ph.ucla.edu). Given these two sets of conditions, it is crucial to consider the services that bot\u00e1nicas provide to the many people who rely on them in the absence ofother health care resources. How, exactly, do bot\u00e1nicas and healers associatedwith them address the medical, spiritual, and social needs of clients? The pur-pose of this chapter is to explore ways that many immigrant as well as somemainstream populations in southern California utilize spiritual and herbalhealing centers for a wide variety of problems. Knowledge of traditional pre-cepts and practices can help health care professionals better understand theorientation of many of their clients with a view toward enhancing the careextended to them. Information about alternative ethnomedical and spiritualapproaches also has ramications for public health programming, including40 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 40the utilization of community-based, traditional practitioners as important resources and helpful intermediaries. Research on Ethnic Health The medical literature on Latinos and African Americans in Los Angelesranges widely. Some of the 250or so articles, based largely on quantitative and clinical research, indicate the need for more intensive, qualitative research onethnic health status and community-based healing traditions. For example, anumber of epidemiological works that point to ethnic differences and ethnic-specic patterns of behavior associated with morbidity urge further explo-ration of linkages (see Newell and Mills 1986 on cancer; Norris et al. 1993 on heart disease; Zambrana and Scrimshaw 1997 on substance use during preg- nancy; and Brekke and Barrio 1997, Shrout et al. 1992, and Vega et al. 1998 on mental illness). Some studies present statistics on differential rates in the useof screening, diagnosis, and treatment apparently related to ethnicity; theyoften report underutilization by Latino and African American populations forreasons not yet determined, for example, mammography (Carlisle, Leake, andShapiro 1995; Bastani et al. 1995), psychiatric diagnosis (Flaskerud and Hu 1992; Sue et al. 1991), breast cancer diagnosis (Richardson et al. 1992), prenatal care (Taggart and Mattson 1996; Zambrana, Dunkel-Schetter, and Scrimshaw cardiac procedures (Carlisle, Leake, and Shapiro 1995;E l l e t al.1995). Several works describe novel public health interventions among eth- nic populations based on the growing belief that culturally relevant programsare needed to maximize diffusion of information (Flaskerud and Nyamathi1990 ; Parker et al. 1996). The only recent study that deals directly with some aspect of folk med- icine in Los Angeles is Becerra and Iglehart's essay ( 1995) comparing the use of home remedies among African Americans, Mexican Americans, ChineseAmericans, and non-Latino whites (see earlier works by Dwyer 1987 on Hmong; Edgerton, Karno, and Fernandez 1970 on Curanderismo; George 1980 on Santer\u00eda; and Roeder 1988 on Latino traditions). The authors note the extensive use of folk medicine concurrently with biomedical care\u2014contraryto long-standing assumptions that folk medicine is limited to rural settings orhas nearly died out, and that the utilization of folk medicine and biomedicineis mutually exclusive. Among the fourteen articles on the spiritual and herbal aspects of Latino health care listed on PubMed (the National Library of Medicine's internet bibliographical service of more than nine million entries), half adozen based on research in other states relate to concerns in the present study.Invisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health ( 1994 ) reports that 81percent of Latinas relied on home remedies to manage their children's health problems and 17percent sought help from a folk healer. According to Keegan ( 1996), nearly half of Mexican Americans responding to a questionnaire had used an alternative practitioner one or more times during the previous year\u2014mostly herbal medicine and spiritualhealing, including visits to a curandero or curandera\u2014two-thirds of whomnever reported these visits to their primary care provider. Zuckerman andothers ( 1996) found Latinos far more likely than Anglos to self-medicate bowel problems with herbal teas and other folk remedies, the perception ofhealth and bowel function in part determined by ethnicity. Suarez, Raffaelli,and O'Leary ( 1996) discovered through interviews that nearly two-thirds of their Latino subjects with AIDS engaged in folk healing, either Spiritism orSanter\u00eda, and three-fourths believed in good and evil spirits, with nearly halfstating that spirits had a causal role in their infection. Desired outcomes offolk healing included physical relief ( 44percent), spiritual relief ( 40percent), protection from 23percent). Zaldivar and Smolowitz ( 1994 ) surveyed the role of spiritual and folk medical beliefs in perceptions of diabetes and treatment choices and found that 78percent of their Latino subjects believed they had diabetes because it was God's will and17percent reported using herbs to treat the disease. These studies indicate that the health-related perceptions and behaviors of many Latinos are an integral part of cultural systems of religion and heal-ing traditions (for African Americans, see Frankel 1977; Hyatt 1970-78 ; Jackson 1976;K e r r 1993; Mathews 1987;S n o w 1974, 1977, 1979, 1993;T e r r e l l 1990 ; and Weidman 1978). In regard to interventions, therefore, Stolley and Koenig (1997 ) posit that knowledge of the impact of spiritual beliefs among ethnic groups can help in designing culture-specic strategies for professional healthcare (see also Fishman et al. 1993; and O'Connor 1995, 1997). That ethno- graphic research and training based upon it are desperately needed is under-scored by Brooks's ndings (1992 ) at the Martin Luther King County General Hospital in Los Angeles: most personnel lack knowledge and understandingof the dominant Latino and African-American population treated at this facil-ity, medical complaints from patients are inadequately communicated tohealth professionals, and instructions are not sufciently related to thepatients. While part of the problem is language competency, much of it is lackof cultural knowledge and sensitivity by health care workers. If the absence ofinsurance looms large as a barrier to accessing professional health care, addi-tional obstacles result from the actions of providers themselves (Flores andVe g a 1998). What other resources can ethnic populations avail themselves of, either instead of or (more commonly) in addition to biomedicine?42 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 42Bot\u00e1nicas as Spiritual and Herbal Shops \"Bot\u00e1nica\" is a term rst used in Cuba and later Puerto Rico by practitioners of the Afro-Cuban religions Santer\u00eda, or Lucum\u00ed, and El Palo Mayombe(Stevens-Arroyo and P\u00e9rez y Mena 1995). Although immigrants from other parts of Latin America far outnumber those from the Caribbean in southernCalifornia, almost all of the spiritual-herbal centers bear the name bot\u00e1nicarather than yerberia (specializing in herbs) or perfumer\u00eda (a source of candles, incense, and other sacramental objects) commonly found in Mexico (Trotter1981). Bot\u00e1nicas recall the stalls in village or town markets in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, and other Latin American countries that sell herbs andsacramental items as well as those in African countries catering to the herbalrequirements of traditional healers (in Nigeria called kemwin-kemwin: \"any- thing and everything\" shops; see Nevadomsky 1988). They also resemble African-American spiritual goods stores, occult stores (Winslow 1969), and \"conjure shops.\" The latter is described in a 1930s account of a store inJacksonville, Florida, \"as just an ordinary store from the outside, but uponentering one is confronted by the exotic odor of soothing incense that evokesvisions of foreign lands. Roots, herbs, oils, magic powers, charms, and spirit-chasing powders catch the eye among the thousands of labels on boxes andbottles arranged in neat rows on the long shelves\" (McDonough 1993, 85). They have quickly proliferated throughout the Americas, for instance inBrazil, where they are known as casas da umbanda , and in Haiti among Vodou devotees returning from the U.S. As \"omnibus stores\" or \"supermarkets\" ofreligious and herbal goods, bot\u00e1nicas play a pivotal role, integrating multiplereligious and healing traditions of their owners and clients through the variedritual items, medical treatments, ceremonial preparations, and ecclesiasticalinstruction that they offer (Polk 1998). Among other shops in Los Angeles are those devoted to religious articles, \"occult\" stores (sometimes as part of store-front churches such as Winslow describes in Philadelphia [1969]), and the cen- tro espiritual featuring readings and religious articles in the Spiritualist tradition associated with Allan Kardec. The mere word bot\u00e1nica on a sign or window signals to the community that spiritual work is done here. Names like Bot\u00e1nica Obatala, Bot\u00e1nica Catholicism; and ElPalo Mayombe, respectively. All spiritual and herbal centers, however, offerassistance within a panoply of traditions. (Because these religions areembraced by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, we capitalize theInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 43Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 43names as is customary for Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, et cetera, but use lower case when referring to religious functionaries such as priests,paleras , and espiritistas .) Various sources place the number of these stores in Los Angeles from one hundred to one thousand or more (Quintanilla 1990; Sanchez 1997; Weightman 1993). Reasons for the disparity in estimates are that no one has systematically documented these centers, new ones spring up frequently, andsome operate in homes rather than commercial shops, or they begin as store-fronts, attract a clientele, and then move into the home. Their existence scarce-ly noticed by medical and cultural researchers, these religious-herbal centersappear to serve as community hubs and meeting places, \"natural support sys-tems\" (Delgado and Humm-Delgado 1982), and sources of information, refer- rals, personal and family counseling, and medicinal plants and treatments.They are usually open from 9 A.M.t o 6P.M. Monday (the least busy day) through Saturday (the busiest day, in preparation for rituals and ceremonies). Judging from published lists, Los Angeles seems to have the most bot\u00e1nicas. Some store owners or counselors and herbalists claim the identityofcuranderos (male) or curanderas (female) in the Mexican tradition. Many others call themselves espiritistas orspiritists as they practice Espiritismo. Y et others are orsanteras indicating Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda, orpaleras associated with El Palo Mayombe. A number of them refer to themselves by several terms at once, depending ontheir familiarity with different religious systems and the needs of their clients.In a sampling of ten spiritual-herbal centers in downtown and east L.A., forinstance, the man who operates one bot\u00e1nica is a santero and his wife a spiri-tist, the husband-wife owners of another are both a santero/a and a palero/a.One woman is a palera and santera as well as a spiritist while other healerspractice only Santer\u00eda or El Palo; some are also herbalists called yerberos or yerberes following the Curanderismo tradition or osainistas within Lucum\u00ed. Inside a Bot\u00e1nica The sidewalk in front of Bot\u00e1nica la Sagrada (pseudonym) is crowded and bustles with activity. As usual, street vendors have set up their small tables infront of the large, red brick building that houses the bot\u00e1nica and severalother small shops. Carefully positioned in the narrow strip of shade that runsalong the building's facade, they boisterously hawk candy, clothing, and asundry of other goods to passersby. Behind them the bright glare of the sunlls the bot\u00e1nica's windows with reflections making it almost impossible tosee the large, colorful statues of Catholic saints that announce the shop's tradein religious articles.44 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 44Like many other bot\u00e1nicas in southern California, the exterior of Bot\u00e1nica la Sagrada is relatively nondescript and easy to overlook. Nevertheless, a steady stream of people enter and exit the store. Upon entering this bot\u00e1nica, one isstruck by how distant the interior seems from the din of trafc, the rush ofcurbside commerce, and the stifling vapors of automobile exhaust. Inside it iscool and quiet. The air is infused with enchanting aromas from the numerousperfumes, colognes, incense sticks, and scented oils lling the store. Each breathseems to bring a new sensation. Even the names of the products are captivating:Patchouli D'Amor, Secret Fruit Lotion, Ivory Elephant Spray, and Seven AfricanPowers Incense. The store's many shelves and display cases are packed to the ceiling with religious paraphernalia and, as you look around, your gaze is drawn to oneicon, image, or statue after another, each seemingly more esoteric and fasci-nating than the last. The paneled wall behind the cash register is literally plas-tered with colorful chromolithographs of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, andvarious Catholic saints. A shelf directly below these holds statues depictingsaints in their respective poses of grace and divinity. Replicas of St. Anthonystare in wonder at the Baby Jesus resting in the saint's arms while those of thecrippled and gaunt St. Lazarus remain steadfast and resolute despite obviouspain and misery. In the midst of these, and seemingly out of place, is a care-fully arranged line of ceramic Native Americans. Some are on horseback whileothers stand with their arms outstretched and heads turned heavenwards as iffrozen in the act of summoning the spirits of the sky. All around these, hang-ing from hooks on the shelves and walls, are a vast array of rosaries, woodencrucixes, beaded necklaces, and attractive charms made from colored fabricand small images of Catholic saints. At rst glance, the bot\u00e1nica seems to be little more than a retail outlet for an incomprehensible jumble of religious icons, mystic symbols, and plas-tic bags of plants. In Santer\u00eda: An African Religion in America (1988 ), Joseph Murphy addresses the confusingly complex accumulation of artifacts, sacra-mental objects, and herbs. He writes: \"T o the uninitiated, their merchandisemust look mysterious indeed: candles and beads, herbs and oils, cauldronsand crockery, and plaster statues of Catholic saints. Y et, for those who knowtheir meaning, each of these items has a part to play in santer\u00eda\" ( 39). The many disparate images and icons that are brought together in the bot\u00e1nicatypify the process of artistic and ritual synthesis that is the hallmark of Africanand Afro-Caribbean religion. A place of spiritual consultation as well as an outlet for ritual and sacra- mental objects, the bot\u00e1nica is best understood as a combination of communi-ty center, herbal shop, and religious supply house. Inside, a person encountersInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 45Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 45retail display cases bearing the amazingly wide variety of goods that are either used in ceremonies and rituals or utilized in the creation of altars and shrines.In addition to candles, statues, and so on, one shop in east Los Angeles ownedby a Mexican woman in her fties who is a santera (Lucum\u00ed) as well as a palera(El Palo Mayombe) displays the following items, whether herbs or productsmade from herbal oils and essences (quantities are approximate): 145packaged herbs stored in covered plastic containers on shelves on two walls 50loose herbs from an herbalist, stored in plastic containers above a counter on the back wall more than 100plastic containers and boxes of herbal capsules 50or more small bottles of different kinds of tincture at least 40bars of herbal and perfumed soaps 25or more containers of herbal lotions and bath oils 80containers of powders Almost all bot\u00e1nicas are divided into two sections, front and back, each having distinct ritual, aesthetic, and commercial qualities. The front is usual-ly more spacious. The majority of the merchandise for sale is displayed here.Proprietors often use this space to erect a variety of public and semiprivatealtars that clearly indicate the spiritual traditions to which they adhere and towhich clients may look for help. For example, bot\u00e1nicas in which Lucum\u00ed isthe principle religion will invariably have an altar for Eshu-Eleggua locatednear the front door. The rear of the store is usually where the owner counsels clients who come for advice or ritual assistance. This area is customarily separated fromthe front by a door or curtain offering the owner and client condentialityduring consultations and demarcating public and private space. Chairs, stools,or small benches are placed near the entry to the back section and are oftenoccupied by individuals awaiting their turn to see the owner or the friends andfamily members of those who have come for consultation. In some stores, therear section takes on the appearance of a doctor's ofce, complete with wait-ing room, water coolers, and coffee tables stocked with popular magazines.Because the back is normally the place of consultation, this is usually wherethe altars dedicated to the spirits or divinities with whom the owner most fre-quently works are located. Walls are often adorned by chromolithographs, notonly of saints but also Native Americans who are thought to be particularlyknowledgeable about herbs and therefore powerful allies in health (eight largeimages of Indians adorn the walls of one small consultation room, either por-traits in full headdress or men on horseback).46 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 46There are also several wholesalers. Customers often refer to one of them as \"the supermarket of bot\u00e1nicas.\" Huge by standards of religious goods stores, they do indeed resemble supermarkets, down to the wheeled grocerycarts. Goods include several hundred books in English and Spanish on reli-gion, divinities, and herbs as well as tarot cards, bath crystals, bath salts, floorwashes, soaps, herb baths, shampoos, candles of varied size and color,colognes, lotions, plants, herbal teas, incense (hundreds of different sticks,powder, and aerosol sprays), scented oils, perfumes and sachets, jewelry (tal-ismans, good luck charms, apotropaic pendants), wizards), crucixes, rosaries, chromolithographs of saints, holywater, empty containers with which to mix and store one's own preparations,and a wide variety of ritual implements from incense burners to Ouija boards.Some wholesalers specialize in herbs. Over the course of a year one shop car-ries more than three hundred different plants from both arid and tropicalregions of North and Central America, freshly harvested and ready for resaleor immediate use. Services Provided by Spiritual-Herbal Shops The demand for the services provided by bot\u00e1nicas and the sacramentalobjects and medicinal plants and products that they stock has increased dra-matically in recent years. Although bot\u00e1nicas tend to be located in neighbor-hoods with large numbers of immigrants from throughout the Caribbean andLatin America, the full clientele of each shop reflects the broad ethnic diversi-ty of the city where it is located as well as the specic demographics of itsneighborhood. In Los Angeles, for example, Guatemalans and Mexicans con-stitute a signicant percentage of bot\u00e1nica owners and customers (althoughthere are Puerto Rican and Cuban owners as well). In New Y ork and Miami,the presence of Haitians, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans is more signicant.(Now, however, Mexicans are New Y ork City's third largest Latino group; seeAlonso-Zaldivar 1999 .) Bot\u00e1nicas in every city are also frequented by mem- bers of many other ethnic groups including Anglo-Americans, Armenians,Chinese Americans, and Filipinos. People require the services provided by bot\u00e1nicas for two basic reasons. Some come in order to obtain materials that will help continue ongoing inter-actions with the divinities they worship. For instance, a Cuban man knows hemust light a special candle on the day sacred to Afro-Cuban deity Ogun or aGuatemalan woman believes that she will be able to become pregnant if sheobtains a statue of San Simon and places the appropriate offerings in front ofit. Others enter bot\u00e1nicas with a specic goal in mind but do not know whatpath to take to achieve it. Is there an oricha (Lucum\u00ed deity) who can help meInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas Care 47Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 47nd a lover? T o which saint should I pray in order to heal my sick child, and what herbal remedies should I administer? One woman's simple but eloquentwords conrm this role: \"I came to the bot\u00e1nica looking for a spirit to guideme.\" In short, people turn to these centers in order to obtain specic sacra-mental objects or to nd solutions to troubling medical, social, and spiritualsituations most often by way of divination or trance mediumship. One santero who operates a bot\u00e1nica estimates that a fourth of client encounters are for advice in business and personal decision making. The fol-lowing description of a divination session exemplies both the context andprocess of the ritual prognostication he performs (see also Mason 1993): In October of 1996, Olivia (pseudonym), a regular client, was forced to make an extremely difcult personal decision, one she felt unable to make withoutspiritual guidance. Like many other immigrants from El Salvador who hadcome to Los Angeles in search of a better life, she and her husband had beenunprepared for the realities of urban America. After years of struggling tosecure a stable income and to establish a safe home environment, the couplecame to the conclusion that they could no longer remain in the dangerous andimpoverished neighborhood where they lived. They decided to return to theirnative country. Before nalizing their plans to relocate, however, Olivia insist-ed on consulting the santero to whom she had been going for many years. Hoping to determine whether or not the decision to leave the United States was a prudent one, Olivia asked the santero to perform a \"reading\" shell divination system known as diloggun . Should she and her husband go back home? Or should they stay in California? Basedon the interpretation of patterns formed by sixteen cowrie shells ( caracoles ) when tossed onto a mat or tray by the diviner, diloggun is considered byLucum\u00ed santeros to be one of the most direct means of obtaining sacred knowl-edge. In order to \"read\" the messages conveyed by the cowries, the divinercounts how many shells land open side up and how many land on the closedor \"mouth\" side when they are thrown\u2014a simple binary system. Each of thesixteen possible congurations that can be formed by the shells is referred to asanoddu. Associated with each oddu is a proverbial expression and several mythological narratives ( pataki ) that will ultimately be used to solve the client's problem. As part of their training, diviners memorize the large corpus of say-ings, myths, and legends associated with the oddu and must be able to reciteand interpret these when they are indicated by the arrangement of the with divination by an espiritista described by Garrison 1977). Also associated with each oddu are a number of auxiliary divination tools (igbo ) that are used in pairs. After the initial toss of the cowries, the48 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 48diviner employs the igbo, each of which has a specic positive or negative con- notation, to more accurately interpret the meaning of the oddu that has beencast. The primary igbo are a black stone (otan), a ball of chalk ( efun), a seashell (aye), a piece of bone ( and a plastic doll's head ( ori Once the oddu has ascertained, santero hands the appropriate igbo to theclient and instructs her to shake them together and then separate them, hold- ing one tightly clenched in each st. The santero then picks up the sixteencowries, touches each of the client's hands, asks a yes or no question of theoracle and tosses the cowries. As with the determination of the oddu, the pat-tern formed by the cowries signals whether the client's right hand or left handshould be opened to reveal an igbo that will provide either an afrmative ornegative answer to the question posed by the diviner. If, for instance, the blackstone (otan) is revealed, the answer is no. If the shell or white chalk is presentthen the response is positive. Using the cowries and igbo, santeros will gener-ally work through a series of yes and no queries that clarify the meaning of theoddu and suggest the necessary course of action. Upon arriving at the santero's bot\u00e1nica, Olivia was led to the consulta- tion room where the priest performs the diloggun. He instructed her to sitdown on a chair in front of his wooden desk. The divination instruments,cowries and igbo, were carefully arranged on the desktop. First the santerolled out the biographical data section of a blank client information sheet,making sure that his information was up to date. He then dipped his rightmiddle nger into a small container of water and sprinkled a few drops on thefloor as a purication rite. Next he recited a litany of prayers invoking both hisancestors and the orichas he worships. The rst oricha entreated was Elegua,who facilitates interaction between humans and the supreme deityOlodumare, as his assistance is believed to be most critical in the process ofdivination. Following this, the santero picked up the cowrie shells in one handand touched Olivia's forehead, hands, and knees in order to create a psychicconnection between the client and the cowries. He then tossed the cowries toascertain the oddu that would address Olivia's problem. On the rst cast, nine cowries landed mouth side up. This indicated that Olivia's oddu was osu\u2014a conguration that warns of troubles or danger. The santero threw the cowries a second time in order to determine which patakiassociated with the oddu should be recounted. Again nine cowries landedmouth side up. Acting accordingly, he recited a story about two friends whoseargument over land brought ruin to both of them. He asked Olivia how shethought the events of the story applied to her situation. Using the igbo, he thentried to better determine the nature of the warning. Was it truly an ominousportent? He handed Olivia two igbo\u2014the black stone and the Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas Ethnic Health Care 49asked if the oddu signied good fortune ( ire) or misfortune ( iku) and then cast the shells. The resulting pattern designated the hand in which Olivia had con- cealed the black stone. The santero advised Olivia that the immediate implica-tion was that the planned move could be disastrous, perhaps resulting in death.He suggested that she postpone the relocation at least until another reading ofthe oracle indicated that it would be safe to leave the U.S. In order to nd out if misfortune was unavoidable or if there was a way to elude it should she and her husband decide to leave the country in spite ofthe warning, the santero handed Olivia two other igbo, the bone and the shell,and then tossed the cowries. The resulting pattern pointed to the hand hold-ing the shell igbo suggesting that the orichas could provide a solution ( ilesi ocha) to Olivia's dilemma. Subsequent casts of the diloggun indicated thatofferings ( ebo) to two female spirits within the Santeria pantheon, Ochun and Y emaya, would prevent death or some other calamity from striking her. Because the sacred narratives associated with each oddu contain explic- it descriptions concerning the appropriate ebo that should be carried out bythe diviner or his client, the santero immediately provided Olivia with a pre-scription of the necessary rites that should be performed. She was instructedto undergo two separate spiritual cleansings: one for three days using materi-als (herbs, oils, et cetera) sacred to Ochun and the other employing objectsconsecrated to Y emaya. Additionally, she was required to take an offering offood to the ocean, the domain of Y emaya. Two casts of the cowries were madein order to assure that the prescribed ebo would be accepted by Ochun andY emaya. The answers were afrmative. Finally, the santero asked Eleggua ifeverything that could be done to help resolve Olivia's dilemma had, in fact,been determined. Again the answer from the oracle was yes. The santero per-formed a cleansing ceremony to Ochun with Olivia; later Olivia undertookher own cleansing with Ochun (\"who knows the language of death,\" said thesantero) using a sacriced rooster and then made an offering at the beach offood for the angel of death so that death would not strike her. Her husbanddid none of these things. Olivia remained in Los Angeles. Her husband left forEl Salvador. Two days later he was murdered. This complicated example suggests the larger complexities of the system of divination as a whole. Specic remedies are associated with each of the six-teen oddu as are a large number of proverbs and stories that the santero mustmaster. Santeros never ask clients to \"tell me where it hurts,\" for it is up to theoracle to discover the nature of the problem and its possible solution. A div-ination is carried out whether the client seeks personal advice, family coun-seling, or treatment for a medical condition. A reading can last an hour andcost ten to fty dollars depending on the stature and reputation of the santero.50 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 50Special ceremonies as well as herbal preparations and subsequent divinations might be required. Ethnomedical and Religious Systems Individuals seeking treatment may select from multiple and competing sys-tems of healing. As Brodwin ( 1996, 13) notes in his study of medical pluralism in Haiti, \"There are very few settings which offer only one way to conceive ofthe body and its suffering, or where people have recourse to only one brandof treatment.\" In Los Angeles, the bot\u00e1nica, best understood as a locus of coex-isting and competing discourses on affliction and healing, provides healthseekers with access to several ethnomedical systems or health care strategies.As a result bot\u00e1nicas provide a unique vantage point for the study of the waysthese belief systems are shaping medical pluralism in contemporary, urbanAmerica. In general, the religious and ethnomedical belief systems served by bot\u00e1nicas whether in Los Angeles or elsewhere can be said to share severalfundamental precepts: The belief in supernatural beings who interact with humans The assumption that disease can be the result of natural causes, divine ret- ribution, or sorcery The supposition that healers, many of whom admit to a divine calling, must be able to diagnose and treat illnesses brought on by either natural or super-natural causes The use of ceremonial and herbal therapies T o elaborate on the second point, each religious system postulates not only a supreme being but also spirits, whether the souls of the deceased or a pantheon of divinities. The body can fall ill on its own, requiring attention bya physician (the \"material\" world), but disease may also be provoked by sor-cery. Moreover, spirits can mimic a disease or aggravate the condition; hencethe notion of \"traveling diseases\" or sickness that moves around the bodyrequiring the release of the spirit. As one santero said, \"The spirits have funwith your disease.\" Aside from these basic similarities in beliefs, the mytholo-gies, concepts of disease causation, procedures for diagnosis, and the ritualtreatments of each belief system reflect the diverse cultural and historical con-texts in which the traditions arose. In a multicultural context of dynamicinterchange such as the bot\u00e1nica, however, distinctions blur. We pointed outearlier that stores carry accouterments for several religions, and ritual special-ists often identify themselves with at least two or three different traditions atInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 51Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 51once. A health practitioner does not nd, say, Catholicism, Espiritismo, and Lucum\u00ed mutually exclusive but rather complementary. Summarized below area half dozen ethnomedical systems represented in bot\u00e1nicas by statues, chro-molithographs, and other sacramental items, publications, materia medica,and diagnostic and treatment methods. Santer\u00eda and Lucum\u00ed Practitioners of oricha worship\u2014also known as Lucum\u00ed (a term used in Cubato identify peoples of Y oruba ancestry) or Santer\u00eda (the worship of saints)\u2014posit one god, Olodumare (or Olorun or Olo), who created spirits (orichas,santos) that function as intermediaries in ways somewhat similar to Catholicor Eastern Orthodox saints. Because humans cannot have direct contact withthe supreme being, they must rely on orichas or santos in order to benetfrom the spiritual energy ( ache) of Olodumare. The Santer\u00eda priest or priest- ess is responsible for opening paths to the orichas and thus, ultimately, to God.Initiation into the priesthood is seen as an important step toward the fulll-ment of one's destiny and the attainment of harmony with the universe.Through sacrice, divination, and spirit mediumship, the priest forges directlinks to the divine that will benet him and those on whose behalf he has peti-tioned the divinities. However, it is understood that si Dios no quiere, santos no pueden (if God does not wish, the santos won't be able to act); fortunately, most of the time changes are possible. Adherents of the religion contend that health problems afflict people at any given time, and they recognize six main harmful forces (there are others)that may cause illness. In order of importance, these are iku(death), arun (sick- ness), ina(disaster), ofo(loss), tibo (feeling overwhelmed), and araye (general struggle and strife). Opposing these are the ire or blessings: ire owo (money), ire omo (children), ire ichegun ota (defeating one's enemies), and ire ariku babawa (to become immortal). These elements (both positive and negative) are consid-ered supernatural entities and can affect anyone. The negative forces can afflicta person because of a violation of a taboo, disobedience, and the breaking of alaw (either human or divine). Lucum\u00ed belief holds that only two events in lifecannot be altered: the day you are born and the day you will die. However,because of one's actions, death can come sooner than it normally would. Arun(sickness) may manifest via supernatural causes (curses, sorcery, divine punish-ments) or by natural causes (congenital and acquired conditions). Divination determines the source of a patient's illness and suggests the best methods (both physical and supernatural) to treat the problem. If the cause is supernatural, an ebo or sacrice is required. If the affliction is deemedto be a case requiring the attention of a medical doctor, the oracle will advise52 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 52what needs to be done in order for the physician to more effectively treat the patient. Practitioners of Lucum\u00ed don't rule out the importance of doctors andpharmaceuticals, but they do use the oracle to supplement standard proce-dures. After a person has been treated by a medical doctor, he or she will con-sult a diviner in order to assure that all physical and spiritual problems havebeen resolved (see Brandon 1990 ,1991,1993;C a b r e r a [ 1940 ]1975; Curtis 1982; Murphy 1988; Pasquali 1986 ,1994 ; and Sandoval 1979, 1983). El Palo Mayombe Both Santer\u00eda and El Palo Mayombe are New World religions that arose withEuropean and African Creole society in Cuba during the era of slave trade.Lucum\u00ed, however, derives primarily from traditions of the Y oruba in south-western Nigeria and Benin. El Palo Mayombe draws its impetus from the reli-gious practices of the Kongo or BaKongo peoples of central Africa (Wetli andMartinez 1983). El Palo Mayombe places emphasis on working with the spirits of the dead rather than on interaction with a pantheon of anthropomorphic deitiesas is the case with Santer\u00eda. This is in keeping with the religion's centralAfrican heritage, for Kongo religious beliefs stipulate that communicationwith direct ancestors and the recently deceased are the best avenues by whichhumans can forge a relationship with the ultimate divinity, Nzambi Mpungu.Practitioners of El Palo Mayombe (paleros or paleras) create shrines (ngangas ) dedicated to the spirits of specic deceased individuals and, through themaintenance of the shrines, are able to call upon these entities for assistancein a variety of spiritual matters. In addition to postulating the existence of a creator deity, Nzambi, adherents to El Palo Mayombe recognize the existence of various lesser beingscalled nkisi . These include spirits of the dead, forces of nature (such as wind, lightning, the sea) and environmental elements (trees, plants, rocks, animals).Furthermore, each Palo practitioner has a personal spirit ( nfumbe ) who acts as a \"guardian angel.\" Palo rituals center around the creation and utilization ofanganga orprenda : an iron pot or cauldron lled with dry branches ( palos), vines, roots, animals, and objects that symbolize the forces of nature. Palo accepts the influence of spirits and sorcery as the major sources of disease and interprets sickness as an attack on the body. Treatments involvechanting (manbos), therapeutic ritual designs ( rmas), and, above all, the use of the nganga. The cauldron and its contents are said to be a microcosm of thenatural, human, and spiritual realms in which the nfumbe and nkisi spirits,with whom paleros or paleras work, reside. Using the nganga and communi-cating with the spirits via mediumship and trance possession, the Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas Care 53Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 53attempts to discover the causes of disease (natural or supernatural) and to channel the supernatural forces that will enable him or her to heal the afflic-tion (Cabrera 1986; Montenegro 1994). Espiritismo Espiritismo (Spiritism) is also prevalent in bot\u00e1nicas. It derives from theEuropean Spiritualist tradition of the early nineteenth century influenced by theFrench engineer and psychic investigator Hippolyte Rivail ( 1804- 1869). Using the pseudonym Allan Kardec, he authored a series of books outlining a spiritu-al doctrine that emphasizes the importance of communication with the dead.According to Kardec, the spirits of deceased individuals are able to interact withthe living, and when contacted through a medium, they can offer solutions to avariety of social, psychological, and medical problems. Spiritism diffused to theCaribbean where it syncretized with Native American and African religions.Spiritist altars usually display (in Spanish) Kardec's The Gospel According to Spiritism andThe Collection of Prayers ; the former often replaces the Bible. Subscribers to the tradition contend that the spirit world is arranged in a hierarchy that places the Judeo-Christian God at one end of the spectrumand the restless, wandering souls of those who were unprepared for death atthe other. Between the two is a series of categories representing benign \"pure\"beings such as angels and seraphim, Catholic saints and Afro-Cuban orichas,historical heroes and leaders, as well as the spirits of ordinary men andwomen. A spiritual seance is one of the primary means by which mediums(espiritistas) contact these ethereal beings on behalf of themselves and clients.In Los Angeles, types of spirits often encountered in ceremonies and also rep-resented in the religious folk art of bot\u00e1nicas are African slaves, NativeAmericans, Latin American nationalist gures (for example, Pancho Villa),and ascended masters such as the Buddha. Practitioners of Espiritismo believe that disease may result from a variety of physical and spiritual conditions, some of which may not be counteracted.Some afflictions are thought to have been ordained by God and, therefore,cannot be resolved by any means. Most illnesses, however, are recognized asphysical or spiritual ailments that require treatment by medical doctors andspiritualists, usually in combination. Some maladies are diagnosed as manifes-tations of karmic conditions that were inherited by the soul upon incarnation.Even if these cannot be eliminated, they can be alleviated with rituals, prayers,and moral rectitude. Sorcery causes yet other medical problems. The treatment of disease, physical or spiritual, may require herbs, rituals, other material remedies, and also the intervention of supernatural entitiesknown as \"spiritual protectors\" and 54of Espiritismo, these \"guardian angels\" know how to heal without interfering with the will of God. When patients consult an espiritisto or espiritista, theygenerally seek to ascertain not only the cause of their affliction but also the mosteffective means of treating it. Through the use of various divination implementsand spirit mediumship, spiritists provide answers as to the source of a patient'sproblem and suggest courses of action. Depending on the nature of the prob-lem, recommendations may include spiritual procedures at the bot\u00e1nica, herbaltreatments self-administered at home, or referral to a mainstream health carepractitioner (see Garrison 1977; Harwood 1977, 1981; and Koss-Chioino 1992). Curanderismo Curanderismo, the most common folk medical tradition practiced by Mexican Americans and Latino immigrants in the United States, integrates elements ofpopular Catholicism, Native American medicine, European magic and witch-craft beliefs, Spiritualist doctrines, and contemporary biomedicine. Healerswho follow this tradition (curanderos or curanderas) believe that the ability toheal is God-given and often claim that they began their medical practice as aresult of a divine calling. The healers generally work within a specic neigh-borhood or community and mainly tend to the needs of friends, relatives, andneighbors. Some practitioners, however, have become widely acclaimed fortheir healing abilities and, as is the case with the late Don Pedrito Jaramillo,may even achieve the status of folk saint (see Spirit Doctors 1997). Curanderos or curanderas recognize illnesses of both natural and super- natural causes. The majority of the ailments seen are physical complaints suchas headaches, gastrointestinal problems, or general pain. Folk illnessesbrought on by improper eating habits ( empacho ) or traumatic experiences (susto) are also treated by these healers. Less commonly seen are supernatural afflictions mal puesto (a magical hex) and mal ojo (evil eye). Remedies for physical and spiritual problems require prayer, spirit mediumship, and theutilization of herbs, oils, holy water, and other sacred objects. A fundamentalprecept of Curanderismo is the idea that the patient must actively participatein his or her treatment for it to be effective. Acting as a medical and spiritualadvisor, the practitioner helps the patient to harness the healing power of God(Clark 1959; Eduardo the Healer 1968 ; Madsen 1964 ;R o e d e r 1988;R u b e l 1960, 1966). Hoodoo (Conjure or Rootwork) Understood fundamentally as a system of pharmacopedic practices and spir- itual traditions developed and utilized by African Americans living in theSouth, Hoodoo offers individuals a means of transforming, revising, andInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 55Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 55reenvisioning reality. Largely comprising medicinal and ritual operations derived from African sources, the primary role of Hoodoo is to provide heal-ing alternatives to those who are ill, to nd love for the loveless, to secure workfor the unemployed, and to offer empowerment within an often oppressivesocial environment. As with Curanderismo, the Hoodoo practices are nor-mally family-based traditions that have been passed on from generation togeneration. Although some individuals who practice Hoodoo have garneredreputations as powerful healers within their community, most people whoutilize its remedies and rituals do so with anonymity. Hoodoo, as some prac-titioners say, is a \"quiet\" tradition; a system of healing that generally takesplace in the home and is usually self-administered. There are, however, leg-endary practitioners such as Marie Laveau, Dr. Buzzard, and Dr. John withwhom some modern conjurers claim association or inspiration. Hoodoo isthe most pervasive of the African-based religions in American culture, knownthrough allusion literary works bysuch authors as Zora Neal Hurston, Rudolph Fisher, Ishmael Reed, and AliceWalker; in music by bluesmen like Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson, and Sly Fox;and in art works from quilts and yard displays to easel paintings. Much like El Palo Mayombe, the practice of Hoodoo, conjure, or root- work centers around the use of animal, mineral, and vegetal materials as ameans of affecting the spiritual force or vitality of an individual. Sickness canhave natural or supernatural causes. Treatments for natural illnesses usuallyconsist of herbal teas or other decoctions, poultices, and aromatic baths.Supernatural afflictions, generally thought to be caused by sorcery, are coun- teracted through the use of prayers, candles, cleansing rituals, and apotropaic devices. Supernatural illnesses imply that one's spirit has been \"tied up\" bysomeone working malign, conjure practices. In such cases must bebroken and the spirit \"released\" Jackson 1976; Lichstein 1992;S n o w 1979;M a d u r o 1975; and Mathews 1987 ,1992;f o r works on the related Vodou, see Brodwin and1996; Metraux 1972; Polk 1997; and Straight 1983). Biomedicine Alternately called orthodox, ofcial, professional, conventional, modern, or Western medicine, biomedicine is also a medical system. Some would contendthat it is an ethnomedical system, for it too is part of a culture, embodies a worldview, expresses a set of values, and holds beliefs about health, healing, and the relationship of human beings to nature and the supernatural. While theother systems described above resemble one another in postulating a spiritual56 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 56as well as material world and in assuming the interrelationship of mind, soul, and body, biomedicine differs on both counts. Biomedicine separates mind from body, treating each with distinct methods, and both from the spirit or soul which is left to the clergy to dealwith (if it is treated at all). It focuses on the biological or organic phenome-non of disease, thereby excluding the cultural, social, and psychological con-struction of illness by patient, friends, and family (Clark 1995). Biomedicine is quick to pathologize: the patient is diseased (rather than suffering an illness;see Eisenberg 1977), childbirth and menopause are not natural life-cycle events but pathologic conditions (Clark 1995; Davis-Floyd 1987,1992), and ecstatic states and trances are neurotic or psychotic episodes. Its explanatory modeldwells on the germ theory and on bodily deterioration, a wearing out of parts,which it treats in isolation from other factors using chemicals or surgery.While it can replace hip joints or remove malignant tumors, biomedicine can'texplain why these problems befall us rather than other individuals (Hufford1994 ). This medical system has much to offer (especially inyecciones or injec- tions, which have become a cultural tradition for Latinos; see Gurza 1999 and Reza 1999 ). Many people need more, however, choosing treatments from other systems to complement biomedicine (Cassidy 1995). A Santero at Work Although the religious-medical systems differ owing to cultural and historicalcircumstances, they hold fundamental precepts in common. Already men-tioned is the belief in supernatural beings who interact with humans and whocan affect health. Most of the systems view health as a state of balance or equi-librium; should individuals fall into a state of imbalance, they become ill.Biomedicine's germ theory of disease may explain how people become sick but other systems explain why they do, particularly when other people remain well (Pasquali 1994 ). Restoration of health requires restoring equilibrium, accomplished through ceremonies and herbs (including baths and spiritualcleansings). Prevention of illness is a common concern. When sickness isattributed to supernatural forces, the way of protecting one's health is to neu-tralize the negative ones through moral action, deference or propitiation, andto cultivate the positive forces; in both instances, protective talismans,amulets, candles, incense, herbs, roots, and sometimes the ritual sacrice ofanimals prove useful. Another idea about health and illness fundamental to Curanderismo but also implicit in the Afro-Cuban religions and Espiritismo concerns \"hot\"and \"cold\" properties (having nothing to do with temperature) of the body,Invisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 57Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 57environment, illness, plants, and foods (see Anderson 1987; Harwood 1971). Some \"hot\" diseases or states are acid indigestion, diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy, susto, ojo, and b\u00eclis. Examples of \"cold\" diseases include menstrual cramps, pneumonia, colic, and empacho (however, ethnographic studies indi-cate that opinions differ from one community to another and even withincommunities as to which illnesses, and especially which plants and foods, arehot and which are cold). According to some Hispanics, a woman should avoidlemons, grapefruits, sauerkraut, pickles, vinegar, and tomatoes because theyare cold or too acidic: \"such things make the uterus very cold\" and stop men-strual flow, congealing blood in the uterus to reappear later as cancer (Snowand Johnson 1978). The goal of treatment is to restore harmony and balance;for example, \"cold\" remedies like bananas and lemon juice as well as teas ofpassion flowers or linden are often used for hypertension. This system has ele-ments in common with systems prevalent in Chinese and Ayurvedic tradition(Anderson 1987). Each religious complex differentiates between the \"material\" and the \"spiritual\"; practitioners recommend that clients seek treatment by doctorsfor illnesses in the material realm (Garrison 1977), while they treat spiritual problems and also ailments of a material nature caused or aggravated bysupernatural forces. All the ethnomedical systems have in common the use ofherbal remedies (about one-fourth of the pharmacopeia of biomedicine is\"green medicine,\" derived from plants, albeit in processed form). In Lucum\u00edtradition, plants are sweet, strong, or neutral in one system; but in anothersystem, baths and teas are composed of herbs \"owned\" by a particular orichawhose assistance is needed. Theories of health and illness, principles of diseasecausation, and therapeutic techniques become more apparent when interact-ing with a santero who is also an osainista or herbalist. The data that followderive from interviews and observation (in October and December 1998 , and February 1999 ) conducted jointly by Michael Owen Jones and Patrick A. Polk with a healer in the Los Angeles area introduced to them by Roberta J.Evanchuk. The analysis grows out of discussions among these three individu-als as well as between them and Ysamur Flores-Pe\u00f1a, who specializes inAfrican and European ethnomedical systems, and Donald J. Cosentino, who isan expert on Afro-Caribbean religious systems. Biographical Background and Calling Now middle-aged, Carmello Santiago (pseudonym) grew up in the Caribbeanand moved to southern California in the 1980 s. He opened a bot\u00e1nica within four years of his arrival and has since become a well-established member ofthe Lucum\u00ed community both locally and nationally. Carmello long been58 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 58involved with various religious systems. From the age of nine he has been a healer in the Espiritismo tradition (his father was a noted spiritist medium,his mother a healer). Like many folk practitioners he had the \"calling\" repletewith visions, possession, and visitation by spirits (see The New Believers 1990; Esp\u00edn 1996; Hand 1980 ; and Singer and Garc\u00eda 1989). For three years in his teens he was a Jehovah's Witness. Then he considered entering the Jesuit sem-inary hoping to become a Catholic priest. \"It was very hard soul searching,\" hesaid; \"I didn't know what the hell I was looking for, but my basic question was,growing up as a spiritist, 'Is this it?' It's like you wonder if you're doing theright things, is this what you really want? I just got sick and tired of being aspiritist! I wanted something else. Y ou have to realize, I'd been attendingseances and dealing with people and healing people since I was nine years old,so by the time I was a teenager everyone was looking at me not as a regularteenager but just by what could I do for them. At nine years old I was alreadytaking care of people. So you really get a sense like 'Oh my God, is there some-thing else to life than this?' Y ou really ask yourself those questions.\" At eighteen Carmello suffered a severe injury that conventional bio- medical treatment and other available therapies were unable to cure. As a lastresort he visited a santero. With the help of this traditional priest and healer,Carmello employed offerings and prayers to the orichas as a supplement to hisregular medical treatment and soon regained his health. Later, following hisrecovery, Carmello was initiated as a Lucum\u00ed priest. By the early 1990s Carmello had his own ile(house) or congregation for oricha worship and is now godfather to several score who joined the religion through him, some ofwhom he has initiated into the priesthood by means of a long, complex cere-mony following theological instruction. As spiritist and santero, Carmello lis-tens attentively to knowledgeable individuals around him, taking voluminousnotes that he keeps on his bookshelf near his desk where he confers withclients. Of his adherence to the two spiritual traditions, Carmello states: \"Ihave never left Spiritualism; both practices [Espiritismo and Lucum\u00ed] existtogether. Y ou use both. Spiritism is a tool and I never stopped being a Spiritist,because you never stop being that.\" Carmello readily admits to having suffered some of the same ailments as his clients. For instance, he arrived in Los Angeles on a Thursday. His aunt inWhittier lent him her car to drive to downtown Los Angeles to locate the ofcewhere he was to report for work the following Monday. \"So when I was exit-ing, when I took the ve freeway south, I got absolutely overwhelmed by thesheer amount of cars and people and the sheer madness of it, and I just brokedown, I just pulled over to the side, parked the car and started crying. I want-ed to go back home!\" Weeping hysterically, he couldn't move for more than anInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 59Healing_Logics.v3 He illness of fright (Kroesen 1994 ;L o g a n 1993). \"That was my rst experience with susto, and then I had certain cere- monies that I needed to do to put myself back together again.\" Managing to return to his aunt's home, he called friends in the Caribbean to send him byovernight delivery several fresh herbs (lantana, lemon grass, mint) that heused for a tea in conjunction with the necessary rituals to the orichas. Preparation and Uses of Herbs \"When you're driving, you're always looking to see what herbs are around,\"said Carmello. As Brandon notes (1991 ), the Lucum\u00ed term for plants, herbs, and weeds is egwe . They help human beings through ache that makes them alive with divine power. All plants are thinking entities; all have personalityand temperament, requiring rituals to entice them to give up their power.Some are frightened easily and withhold their powers by refusing to bloom.Others are shy and retiring. Y et others have explosive personalities, requiringgreat etiquette and respect before being picked. The powers of plants fluctu-ate over the course of the day, resting at night but enlivened by morning(Sandoval 1977). All must be gathered properly with prayers and token pay- ment. Wild egwes possess the greatest power for healing. Herbalists collect plants from the local mountains, river beds, and neighborhood sites such as empty, undeveloped, or untended plots of land.According to Carmello, abandoned homes with overgrown yards and weed-lled parking lots are often good sources of herbal materials. \"Santeros workwith weeds,\" he said. As we drove away from a wholesaler's store where he hadjust bought some fresh herbs imported from Latin America, Carmello noticeda certain type of plant growing on the fence surrounding a corner lot. He sig-naled us to stop, hopped out of the car, and enthusiastically began pluckingportions of an orange-colored plant from the fence. It's known as \"holy weed\"he said, and can be used to soothe skin lesions and surgical wounds, reducingthe scarring. He had assumed that the plant was no longer in season.Nonspecialists usually have to rely on bot\u00e1nicas in order to obtain the com-ponents of herbal remedies. However, some basic \"home remedy\" herbs areavailable at sidewalk plant or flower shops throughout east Los Angeles, suchas lemon grass, rosemary, sweet basil, and \"tree of life.\" Individuals often buythese plants as starter or home herbal kits. Carmello is an osainista, dened by Brandon ( 1991, 60) as a priest or priestess \"knowledgeable about the herbs, their prayers, personalities and tem-peraments, and able to collect them from the wild.\" Ritual uses of herbs includeosains and omieros. The latter is the more powerful, not only for cleansing but also for empowering individuals and objects that are about to come in contact60 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 60with the orichas (Brandon 1991). Ordinary herbal preparations may have up to nine ingredients, balancing strong and sweet qualities, said Carmello. Omieros (mixtures of plants associated with a particular oricha; see Cabrera [ 1940 ]1975) are composed of up to 121different egwes. \"Strong\" plants (like camphor) \"increase the to \"dislodge a situation,\" said Carmello; if thebody is very hot (the condition of illness), then \"sweet\" herbs like basil, mint,and camomile reduce the heat through a bath, tea, or poultice. Generallyspeaking, in Lucum\u00ed one seeks to cool things down (in contrast to El PaloMayombe). A knife (iron) is associated with the oricha Ogun. A client will con-sult the oracle to determine if surgery is truly necessary and will prove suc-cessful, and also to invoke the oricha's help to guide the surgeon's hand. Afterthe operation (\"hot\"), the client will return to the santero for ceremonies,herbal baths ( despojos ), \"cool\" the con- dition and aid recovery. Carmello grows, dries, and stores many of his own herbs, collects them from abandoned lots and overgrown yards, purchases others from animporter, and also special orders fresh ones (unavailable or out of season insouthern California) from Miami, Puerto Rico, and other sources in tropicalclimates. He not only utilizes the plants himself but also gives workshops onspiritual herbs and baths in which participants learn to identify the plants bytraditional methods, perform correct procedures of herb collecting and dry-ing, and prepare teas, soaps, tinctures, compresses, and bath salts using infu-sion, decoction, and maceration. As a rule of thumb, \"sweet\" herbs include spearmint, mint, camomile, basil, lavender, and any other herb that is sweetly aromatic. \"Strong\" (or\"loud\") herbs taste bitter or smell pungent or harsh, such as rue, angel trum-pet leaf, avocado, tree of life, and the leaves of most trees. T eas are made byinfusion, that is, by pouring hot water over herbs that steep for ten minutes ormore, releasing some of the oils and curative properties of the leaves. T o makea decoction, Carmello recommends gently boiling water and herbs over amedium re in a covered container, then letting it stand ten minutes or so toallow the steam to settle; this results in obtaining a higher amount of essentialelements, but evaporation causes some loss. The most effective method ismaceration: using a mortar or one's hands to crush the leaves to produce anaromatic liquid, dark green and full of the plant's essential elements as well ascontaining \"personal vibrations.\" Like other osainistas (Brandon 1991,68), Carmello strongly advises against using commercial preparations, for one cannot be entirely sure ofwhat they contain, and they are likely not to have been collected in the wild bya knowledgeable herbalist who, through proper rituals, maximizes theirInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 61Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 61power. Some typical preparations consist of soaps, salts, poultices, and com- presses. Carmello grates pure Castile soap, mixes it with herbs and otheringredients (honey, perfumes, oils), reshapes it, and allows it to dry. T o pre-pare salts he combines an equal amount of table salt, baking soda, and Epsomsalt and then adds perfumed oils, dried flowers, or leaves. A poultice consistsof a moist, hot herb pack made by spreading a thick paste of crushed, freshherbs over a clean cotton cloth and applied to the affected area for severalhours. He makes a compress using a cloth soaked in a hot herbal preparationthat is then wrung out and applied to the skin (he advises leaving both endsof the cloth out of the water for easier handling when applying it). Carmello insists that most herbs be collected before 9 A.M., before the sun dissipates their oils. They should be picked by hand, starting at the top with the newest leaves, and then dried in a shady place on a ventilated object such as anold screen door, turned several times during the drying process, and stored indark containers and in shade. The nal product will be dark green and aro-matic. When needed, the herbs are put in water, the purer the better.Traditional healers, he contends, never mix more than nine herbs in a singlebath; a sweet herbal bath should follow a strong one. Each essence has its owntherapeutic effect. For example, bergamot is refreshing and reduces irritability,anxiety, and depression; it also aids sleep. Calming and refreshing, camomiletreats stress and depression. Frankincense relaxes and rejuvenates and alsostimulates the mind. Lavender is balancing, normalizing, and tranquilizes themind. Myrrh serves as a sedative and also rejuvenates the skin. Orange blossomsoothes nerves. The soothing and relaxing rose helps resolve relationship prob-lems. Spiritually enhancing, sandalwood treats impotency and frigidity. Nomatter the problem\u2014whether social, emotional, or physiological\u2014singleessences and especially combinations of herbs, usually along with appropriaterituals and ceremonies, are often effective in alleviating it. Sometimes a cere-mony alone will sufce. Selected Cases While other santeros and santeras generally keep records for a year, CarmelloSantiago has three ling cabinet drawers lled with cases spanning the pastthirteen years that he has been a practitioner in the U.S. One sheet for eachproblem notes the client's date of birth and ethnicity, the date that the clientcame to him, the divination, the \"prescription\"\u2014the herbal preparations andceremonies recommended by the oracle\u2014and the ultimate outcome of ther-apy. Carmello has told us about a number of cases before, we have talked withseveral clients, and we have witnessed divinations as well as observed a cere-mony conducted by his wife, Lilian (pseudonym), a santera and espiritista.62 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 62Recently we asked Carmello to pull some cases that he considers \"representa- tive\" and to discuss them. These cases are, of course, self-selected. He selectednine from his les, three involving procedures carried out by Lilian. In eachinstance, the problem's nature, cause, and possible resolution were revealedthrough the oracle, in other words, complex Lucum\u00ed divination procedures asin the case described above involving Olivia. Case 1. The rst case is an African-American male born in 1967. He was rst seen 9 January 1990 , last seen 28February 1999 . \"He's been a continuous client of mine. One of the interesting things about this person\u2014he was ahealthy person, he was suffering a bad case of some kind of genital dysfunc-tion, went to his company insurance, they couldn't nd anything wrong withhim. He's a person who played sports in school, he worked out, he's young,and he was having problems ....H e wasn't able to conceive, was unable to even hold an erection, and he was having pain in the genital area.\" Throughdivination the oracle indicated that the problem was \"a parasite, some kind ofbug that lives in the body.\" He was given a combination of (strong) teas\u2014inSpanish, polao\u2014to drink three times a day. Alongside this he was told to drink a combination of juices that are a diuretic in a sense, which are cucum-ber, lettuce, and the like (\"fresh\" or sweet herbs that flush and refresh the sys-tem). After that there was a ritual performed on him with the oricha Ogun.The ritual included the use of a leaf called vencedor . Basically the translation is \"to conquer.\"\"It's a tree that has the tendency to grow up straight regardlessof all the problems. Always shoots straight up.\" \"How did you determine the teas?\"\"Y ou ask the oracle. Basically on your knowledge of what the herbs do, you ask the oracle what combination of herbs is acceptable. So we did thatwith Ogun, and the man was supposed to wash the affected area with theleaves of the tree\u2014meaning his groin. After that, the idea was to bring the bugout, whatever the bug was. Afterwards he went back to the doctor and wasdiagnosed, because the oracle advises you to go to the doctor. It's a medicalproblem, not a spiritual problem. And he was diagnosed with a severe case ofgenital herpes.\" \"And then how did you determine that it was rituals to be performed for Ogun?\" (Ogun is the oricha of the forge and of war; see Flores-Pe\u00f1a andEvanchuk 1994 .) \"Everything is to be asked of the oracle. Y ou don't make a decision on your own. Y ou have to ask the oracle if what you think, your particular choice, is acceptable.\" The teas (polao) had to be strong because Ogun is a hot deity.The symbolic signicance of rubbing the genitals with AM Page 63that grows erect\"\u2014is obvious. The man was treated by a doctor. He had rst sought Carmello's aid in 1990 , then he was initiated into the religion. By exact count of case notes, he has seen Carmello eighty times in nine years, mainlyfor help in personal decisions, social problems, and work-related matters. Case 2. Case 2is a Mexican-American businessman, born in 1964 ,w h o came to Carmello for a single treatment on 3November 1991. \"He was dis- charged from the hospital after a month with inconclusive diagnosis\u2014lack ofstrength, unable to stand, he needed to be held or carried in a wheelchair. Alsohe could not hold anything in his stomach. He was expectorating a lot eventhough he was not producing anything. Recently married at the time, and nowhe has two children the last I heard. He was diagnosed as being bewitched.\" \"Diagnosed by divination?\"\"Y es. The divination established that something was put in his food. He was to have the equivalent of an exorcism with Osain [the oricha of herbal-ism, magic, and the power of nature] as a major cleansing: rompemiento ,' t o break.' After that he was given a . . . it was suggested that he drink somethingto flush his kidneys because the oracle asserted that the problem was in the kidneys, not in his stomach. Contrary to what he was saying, that it was hisstomach that hurt, it was the kidneys.\" The man had been hospitalized for a month, and every conceivable test had been performed with no insights into his problem. \"According to the ora-cle, what happened was that whatever spell was put on him was hindering thedoctor's effort to see the disease.\" The ceremonial rompemiento was to breakthrough that blockage. The man was required to sleep in old clothes in orderto \"pick up the humors of the body\"; the clothes were then ripped (\"broken\"), and while he was naked Carmello and another priest cleansed him with herbs,a bath, coconuts, colored cloth, and cigar smoke. The clothes, candles,coconuts, and cigar smoke were wrapped together and sent to a cemetery forburial. Carmello gave him a tea of aloe vera gel and brazil bark to drink for f-teen days in order to flush the kidneys. The man was told to also drink a mix-ture of mint and warm milk before going to bed and on arising in themorning. Carmello instructed him to then return to the doctor; he was diag-nosed with an early case of cirrhosis of the liver. \"See, usually the oracle distinguishes between different stages of the disease: the disease created by magic [sorcery], the disease created by pun-ishment from divine forces, and the disease created by one's own actions.When the disease is created by physical conditions, [such] that it requires theintervention of the medical establishment, the oracle itself will acknowledgethat. So the oracle becomes sort of like a triage, clarifying and clearing away64 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 64what the doctors cannot see. Like my old teacher used to say, 'Machines can- not see spirits.'\" An individual can bring punishment upon himself or herself by violat- ing a taboo or offending a divine force. Or sometimes \"you did something thatbrought that disease to you. For example, in the middle of winter you walk outwith no shirt and you get pneumonia. Well, you brought it upon yourself.\"One may also inherit genetic conditions or predispositions. \"The divinerneeds to ask if he can intervene to cure the whole thing with rituals and med-icine [herbs], or if there's a need for the person to see a doctor. If the personneeds to see a doctor, then the oracle will say you do this, and see a doctor; ifthe case is beyond [spiritual work], the diviner will just say forget it, go to adoctor, there's nothing I can do for you.\" Finally, \"some sicknesses cannot be cured and the oracle acknowledges that too. There's the case of a young Belizean woman. She came because of adiagnosis of cancer. And the oracle asserted that there was nothing to be donebecause it could not be stopped or cured, so basically the only thing you coulddo was alleviate it. So sometimes the oracle acknowledges that the body isalready in such bad shape that it is impossible. All you can do is two things:alleviate the condition and prepare the person for death. There is cleansing,you talk to the person, there's all this preparation for death. The personreceives ceremonies and rituals of Babal\u00fa Aye, the oricha of infectious dis- eases, and she receives beads of Babal\u00fa Aye. The cancer, like it often does, wentdormant for about a year and a half, and then it came back again and shepassed on. But she knew, we knew, everyone knew that what we were doingwas basically getting things ready. Many times the oracle acknowledges thatthere is nothing to be done at all.\" Case 3. Case 3is an African-American female born in 1959, last seen 25 February 1999 . \"This pertains to Lilian [the santero's wife, an espiritista]. Complaint: unable to conceive a child. Been through every fertilization tech-nique and clinic there is, with no results. No other complaints, healthy, noaddictions to anything. Two santiguos was the prescription. One with Ochun, the other [one month later] a santiguo espiritual\" (see Evanchuk 1999 ). The rst consists of songs, prayers, and incantations as well as the ritual massag-ing of the abdomen with a squash, gourd, or pumpkin; Lilian learned it fromCarmello's mother. \"The style of the second is completely different. It involvesflowers, it involves certain perfumes, certain combinations of oils, that'sdirected by the spirit\" and performed not in front of the orichas but in frontof Lilian's spiritual altar. Seven days later the woman was to have a cleansingwith Babal\u00fa Aye using a guinea hen sacriced to this oricha concerned withInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas 11:43 AM Page 65disease. \"According to Lilian, she had an inflammation that prevented the egg from doing what it was supposed to do. She did it [had the rituals], she gotpregnant, and she had a kid. Lilian asserted that her ovulation was a mess, itwas completely off rhythm. She was also supposed to receive a charm to carrywith her and she did, a niche , just a charm for her protection. Lilian also thought that her desperation was preventing her from getting pregnant. Herown desperation of getting pregnant. And then the inflammation plus that, itwas just a mess. So she did that [took part in the ceremonies], she's got a kid,she's thinking of having another one, she became initiated and became a wor-shiper.\" Lilian also had the woman drink (one time only) a combination ofseven different oils. One was \"egg oil\" (in other words, a beaten egg yolk thathas sat awhile) \"as a purgative but also to bring down the inflammation.\"According to Carmello, \"She has paid in excess of fty thousand dollars get-ting pregnant. And she almost had a heart attack because she ended up spend-ing here about three hundred dollars and she got pregnant.\" (Recently sheconceived her second child.) Case 4. \"Mexican female, two years of age. Diagnosis: susto. Constant cry- ing, not eating, losing weight, not sleeping, always scared of everything. First of all she was taken in front of the orichas and she was cleansed with whiteflowers. The whole pantheon of orichas. Into the altar room [where theshrines are]. Then she was left standing there for a second\u2014because you haveto combat susto with susto\u2014so when she was standing there, and when she'sbusy looking at everything, the person is supposed to grab the kid, throw it up,turn it around and bring it down.\" After frightening the child to break the hold of susto, the santero pre- scribed a beverage containing orange blossom water and honey to be drunk for twenty-one days, and a bath at the same time consisting of white flowersand water that had been left outside to \"pick up the dew.\" She had recoveredthe last time Carmello saw her in June 1997, when her parents brought her back for treatment of colic. \"The prescription: change diet. T oo much frijoles.She was developing gas, and that hurt, so drop the frijoles. Which is a prob-lem because at the same time this is a family of very limited resources. So ifyou tell a family, don't give them frijoles, what are they going to feed her?\"Other family members who had consulted Carmello about their own ailmentsinclude the mother, the father, the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law. \"I wasreferred by the sister-in-law.\" \"Any idea what caused the susto?\"\"Crossing the border! That will scare the wits out of anyone. The whole family is illegal.\"66 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 66\"Is that a common source of susto that you treat?\" \"Most of the susto cases that I treat, I don't even have to look at the ora- cle, I just can tell immediately that they probably just crossed the border. Male,female, kid, whatever, the ordeal of crossing the border, the ordeal of hidingand then adapting to this city. Even if they don't develop it when they cross theborder, just living here in fear of being arrested and in fear of not being ableto fulll their obligations to pay the coyote and the whole thing is enough togive them susto.\" Case 5. \"Another female kid, born 1990 , Mexican, born in Los Angeles of illegal parents. She developed a rash, the skin will dry up and then break. Verypainful, she was a living sore. It was all over, it was horrendous. Y ou cannotpick up the kid, because whatever you did to her will hurt. She was kept basi-cally naked, she could not wear clothes. Taken to the hospital, diagnosisinconclusive for fungus. The doctors did not know really if it was a fungus, aviral infection, nothing. Everything was inconclusive, they were just trying dif-ferent treatments to see if one them will score.\" The parents brought the child to Carmello. The oracle prescribed a treatment \"with Babal\u00fa Aye [oricha of infectious diseases] and three baths,made with omiero. Omiero is a ritual preparation done with incantations andspecic herbs to the oricha, with a minimum of seven herbs and then it is 'sea-soned' with different things like roasted corn, palm oil, honey, rum, guineapepper\u2014it's a heavy preparation. Omiero means 'water that cools,' and it'sused for consecration, usually, to consecrate sacred items. And also for medi-cine she was advised to take three baths in a seven-day period. She was sup-posed to take that and then make a mixture with aloe vera gel, palm oil andhoney, and to smear the body to ease and prevent the skin from cracking. Afterthat she was supposed to be cleansed with gun powder in front of Osain [theoricha of herbalism, magic, and medicine]. Y ou blast the gun powder andwhen the smoke comes up you cleanse the person in the smoke of the gunpowder. The kid got better, skin cleared, diagnosis from the laboratory incon-clusive still. They don't know what she had, and to be honest with you, neitherdo I. In this case she didn't need to go back to the doctor, but I sent her backto the lab because we were curious about what the hell she had.\" \"The baths with omiero, what were the ingredients?\"\"Seven different kinds of herbs. Y ou have fern, boton de oro , sage, romer- illo,tree of life, [unclear], the other one is angel trumpet, and that was it. It's a combination of both sweet and strong.

This is a preparation for the omieroInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Page 67and omiero doesn't go by sweet and strong category. The same plant that you might take in one place for sweet or cold or hot or strong doesn't feature inthe omiero because the omiero goes by oricha. Whatever oricha owns theplant, that's what you use, not because of their qualities. If you're workingwith the plants on their own as plants and herbs, there's a set of rules that youfollow. If you're dealing with them within the Lucum\u00ed tradition, or Palo, orany form of religion, there's another set of rules. And you don't mix both.\" Case 6. \"Next case, Salvadoran male, born in 1967, came here on 7October 1993, last time here was 6January 1999 . Working man, brought here by wife [whom Carmello had treated previously]; impotency. Prescription was a rumrompemiento, and also there was a cream made for him to apply to the affect-ed area.\" The cream consisted of aloe vera, sage, honey, snake oil (the render-ings from a fried snake). The prescription included a bath with Elegua omiero,in other words, herbs (plus appropriate \"seasoning\" in the form of honey,roasted corn and so on) that are owned by the divinity Elegua (also known asEshu or Elegba), the oricha that stands at the cosmic crossroad between thehuman and the divine; his goodwill must be obtained for projects to succeed(Flores-Pe\u00f1a and Evanchuk 1994 ). Because Elegua's number is three, the man was to bathe three times in the omiero consisting of a long list of herbs \"seasoned and prepared accord-ing to the likes of the oricha.\" An oddu (a conguration of the sixteen cowriesused in divination) indicated that he was to rub himself with a whole coconutthat later was disposed of in a cemetery. \"The idea is that the coconut will pickup whatever inflammation is in there to nd out what was preventing the doc-tor from nding it.\" Because \"the oracle said he had some kind of physicalcondition that was affecting everything,\" Carmello sent the man back to theurologist who then found a hernia high on the testicles that prevented the pas-sage of sperm. \"He's scheduled for surgery next month.\" Case 7. \"Another case is a Salvadoran female, she was born in 1952 , came here [recently] complaining of excessive bleeding, she was diagnosed by a doctor as having broids and scheduled for an operation: hysterectomy. Came for divina-tion and was advised that two days apart] performed withOchun [conducted second one] she had a hemorrhage\u2014very, very heavy\u2014taken back to the doctor, taken to the hospital, broids had dissolved, she was discharged, the surgery was canceled, she's ne.\" Vivian Garrison (1977) describes the \"spiritual working\" on behalf of clients with organic gynecological disorders through the use of a rogaci\u00f3n (petition) to Ochun (the oricha of love, fertility, and the beauty of life, she68 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 68is a demanding lover and compassionate mother, the favorite daughter of Olodumare, the supreme being [see Flores-Pe\u00f1a and Evanchuk 1994]). It consists of a ceremony of songs, prayers, and incantations as well as the rit-ual massage of the abdomen with a squash or gourd (representing theabdomen and all of its internal organs). According to Garrison, as thesquash rots, so too does the inflammation and sickness of the abdomen thathas passed into the squash dissipate and disappear. Writes Vivian Garrison(1977, 146): \"Most of the time, this ritual is a harmless procedure which serves to alleviate anxiety while the woman awaits her next menstrual peri-od, visit to the doctor, or other, more decisive answer to questions about hergynecological condition. In the cases I know about the women continued tosee a gynecologist as well, but the santera claimed a 'cure' effected by Och\u00fan when the matter was resolved. In this way the espiritistas or santeras do claim to 'cure' infections and 'tumors' which purportedly 'the doctor could not cure,' and to prevent 'unnecessary operations.'\" The author adds, however,that there are in fact frequent exploratory operations and unnecessary hys-terectomies, a situation that promotes the search for alternative or comple-mentary treatment. Case 8. \"The daughter of this woman is the next case, Salvadoran female, born 1968 . She had a miscarriage in an earlier pregnancy. Santiguo made, it was done, to help her womb get back into shape. She was advised to, by div-ination, not to get pregnant soon. Still she did. She was advised to come backfor divination because the pregnancy was problematic, and the kid was prob-ably not going to be healthy. Did not come back. Kid is ten months old, diag-nosed with Down's syndrome. The oracle told her not to get pregnant,because it was too soon and if she got pregnant the kid was not going to behealthy. She just got pregnant and the kid was diagnosed with Down's syn-drome. She came back to see if we could do something with the kid. But thatwas it. How can you reverse Down's syndrome?\" Case 9. \"Husband and wife, Mexican American. The female was born in 1975, diagnosed with a severe case of broids, scheduled for hysterectomy six months before her wedding.

And left there. She was advised to drink Elegua's omiero, half a cup inthe morning, and she had to wear the beads of Babal\u00fa Aye.

I don't know what he saw. Something he saw.

And he was cleansed with Osain,with gun powder. Lived happily every after. Okay? Those are the cases that Ipulled for you.\" Discussion Many observations can be made about these cases. All were word-of-mouth referrals, whether from bot\u00e1nicas or other clients. None of the clients was amember of Carmello's ile (or congregation), although two (one man, onewoman) later asked to be initiated into Lucum\u00ed; both have sought the help ofthe oracle on average once a month, usually for advice in social relations andwork-related problems (such as nding, keeping, or changing jobs). Mostclients are Latino or African American. They are from all age groups. Severalare illegal aliens or their children are. Nearly all came to Carmello Santiagoout of desperation when biomedical treatment proved unavailable, inade-quate, or inappropriate. The illnesses include erectile dysfunction, infertility,sexually transmitted disease, hernia, general debility, sorcery, cirrhosis of theliver, an extreme rash, susto, colic, irregular periods, and broids. Treatmentconsisted of ceremony only (with prayers, songs, and incantations) or a com-bination of rituals (by Carmello, the patient, or both together) along withherbal baths, teas, ointments, and poultices or compresses. Carmello identiesthe plants by common name, some in English, others in Spanish, and yet oth-ers in Lucum\u00ed. Several herbal preparations follow the system of sweet andstrong while others have been recommended by the oracle because of theirassociation with particular divinities that own them (the latter are omierosthat both cleanse and empower, refreshing and preparing individuals andobjects for contact with the orichas). The numbers three, seven, and nine, orcombinations of them, occur frequently and have religious signicance. Anumber of individuals, especially those who have become members of his ileor congregation, return regularly to consult the oracle in regard to personaldecision making. For example, in case 1, the African-American male who rst sought Carmello's help with erectile dysfunction has seen him eighty times innine years; in case 3, the African-American female initially unable to conceive has also sought his help seventy to eighty times for other matters.70 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 70Carmello does not know how many cases he has seen, even those in the past thirteen years in California, for he has not counted all those in his les. Other priests call with difcult cases, some locally and others around thecountry, several of whom he schedules to see when in another city to performlengthy and complex initiation rituals; these he does not record or keep onle. \"I see about eight cases daily. I don't like to see more than that because ifit's more than that I won't be able to give enough time to each case. Right nowI'm working Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. That doesn't includethose cases where I go to Concord or San Francisco, or when I go to Chino,when I go to San Diego, when I go to New Y ork. Now I'm just starting to openT exas. It really gets problematic! I work from 2:30 to 6:30, but that's not the end of my day. At seven I might be jumping in my van to go to some priest orpriestess's house to keep working, and I'll be back around 11,12o'clock.\" As far as the socioeconomic standing and education of clients are con- cerned (as suggested by the sample cases as well as other data), \"I have peoplefrom all walks of life, and I think it balances itself out. I have everything, fromillegal immigrants to the well-established movie producer that will come here.And of course these are the type of people that will come as needed, but I willhave engineers, accountants, and people in the medical industry as well, forexample, nurses. People who are very well read, very well educated. We dealwith Hispanics, followed by African Americans, followed by Anglo-Americans, and then in the way, way back, Asians. We deal with people oflower income, medium, high income. The classic case of high income was thisgirl who was\u2014I told you this story\u2014she was chasing me and calling me des-perately because she needed to make a huge decision, and she didn't knowwhat to do, and she needed to see me. So nally I said well this will be impor-tant! So when she came she said she needed to ask Elegua; she had this bigproblem: her sales had been so good that she had this big surplus of money,and she had to decide whether to buy a Maserati or a Porsche. And that was areal big problem that she had! And I just look at her like, 'Is that your prob- lem?' She said, 'Y eah, I need to know!' And she meant it. She was frantic. So aweek later she went and bought a Porsche, and she brought the Porsche hereto be blessed. I said,'Do you realize that this is the type of problem that I hard- ly see here?'\" In commenting on the sample cases, Carmello often remarked on the desperation that each of the clients felt at the hands of professional health careproviders. \"They feel that they've been used as guinea pigs, that the doctordoesn't know what he or she is doing, so let's try this to see if it works. And inthe meantime what they fear is that the remedy is going to be worse than thedisease! So basically, when they come in [to me], they realize that they are sick,Invisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 71Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 71that something is not right, but the medical system is not able to understand their complaint. ...T h e p e r s o n i s g e t t ing more frustrated, and that is when they decide to go and see someone. And at that time when they come to me,they're just on the edge of desperation. For example, the Salvadoran male thatI gave you, the sixth case [impotency], when he came he was brought by hiswife, and when I told him what was happening and what we should do, he toldme something like,'I'm glad you told me because if you couldn't help me I wasgoing to shoot myself.' And he had a gun with him and he showed it to me.\" Carmello emphasized a second point regarding the complementary role of his practice. \"The idea is that this is a system that is not at war with the medical establishment. We don't have the slightest intention of proving we'rebetter than the doctor. They have their job, we have ours. But we refer peopleto them even though they don't refer people to us, but that's okay.\" AsCarmello sees it, \"The person needs to clarify a situation ....W e j ust map, we map the way to whatever is to be done, and that's what we do.\" The santero or santera will send the client to a doctor, for \"we cannot prescribe medicines,and sometimes the person is just sick and he needs medicines and that's it!\"He notes that many of his clients have already seen a doctor anyway, but oftento no avail as most of the sample cases indicate. One last point: when discussing instances of clients scheduled for sur- gery who come to him for a reading or the blessing of the orichas, Carmellosaid, \"The power is that if the diviner tells a person, 'Don't get the surgery,'they won't! No matter how sick, they won't, because they understand thatthey're not going to come back alive. And if the diviner tells them, 'Y es, do getyour surgery,' they will do it. And even if the doctor prescribes a surgery, theywill come to us to nd out if that surgery is needed. They will come and askthe oracle. This is the second opinion, and the heaviest one. In this commu-nity the second opinion comes from the oracle. So the power of this table isamazing. The person sitting doing the consultation has this very awesomepower because he's speaking with the oracle, with divine force ....S o w h e n t h e doctor says, 'Y ou need to have a surgery,' they say, 'Uuhhhh,' and they comehere. So the second opinion in Los Angeles usually is not a doctor, it is a diviner .\" Conclusion and Implications for Health Care Delivery Latino and African-American communities have many sources of health care available to them, some more and others less visible. They range from self-treatment with home remedies and over-the-counter drugs to a variety of tra-ditional healers to clinics and medical centers (Baer 1982; Mikhail 1994 ; Roeder 1988 ). A major source, rarely acknowledged much less described in the72 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 72medical and ethnographic literature, is the spiritual-herbal center known gen- erally by the Caribbean name bot\u00e1nica. This store dispenses sacramentalobjects as well as herbs and herbal products. It also serves as community huband meeting place, a \"natural support system,\" a referral center and, in theback room, an ofce for spiritual consultations, family counseling, psy-chotherapy, and treatment for various physical maladies. Many reasons have been given for using home remedies or consulting traditional healers. Most are discussed by Beatrice Roeder in Chicano Folk Medicine from Los Angeles (1988 ). They range from necessity (no physician available) to economics (high cost of professional medicine and lack of health insurance), psychological factors (fear of doctors and hospitals; emotionalsupport given through personal attention by the folk healer), culture (folk-dened illnesses, belief in witchcraft, integration of health and religion or cus-tom as the path of least resistance), dissatisfaction with biomedicine(treatment failures, no known cure, not appropriate to nature or cause of ill-ness, communication problems, modesty and embarrassment, lengthy wait inclinic, distance and transportation difculties), education and attitudes ofparents, gender (women are more likely to learn herbal remedies), condencein the effectiveness of traditional medicine, continued contacts with influen-tial believers and practitioners, ethnic pride (determination to maintain eth-nic traditions versus the desire for acculturation), and the influence of thesymbolic (for example, the impact on opinion and decision making by per-sonal experience narratives told by others and by the drama of ritual and cer-emonies entailed in some forms of traditional therapy such as Lucum\u00edillustrated above). What accounts for the apparent underutilization by Latinos of profes- sional health services? By the 1980 s a controversy raged over cultural versus socioeconomic and political factors (Roeder 1988), that is, whether Hispanics so often number fewer among those treated in hospitals and clinics because of a reliance on tradition and custom or owing to a structure of domination,exploitation, and inequality. Van Oss Marin and others ( 1983) cite the ndings of a study of one hundred Mexican Americans in Los Angeles that the mostimportant reasons mentioned by respondents for not seeking professionalhealth care were \"people don't have enough money\" and \"people don't havemedical insurance,\" which implicates issues of equity. Other reasons includelack of proper documents and fear of deportation, problems arranging childcare, inability to leave work, long waiting times, and difculties with English(Van Oss Marin et al. 1983), too few community clinics, and a mind-set that doesn't assume entitlement to quality health care (Kim 1997). Along more cul- tural lines, going to a traditional healer is often less intimidating becauseInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 73Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 73clients are seen in homes and stores, often at any time (Kim 1997); it is famil- iar and comforting, affordable, and the atmosphere of bot\u00e1nicas, with their scent of incense, flickering candles, and statues of revered saints, remind manycustomers of a church (Quintanilla 1990 ). Religious health care systems like Lucum\u00ed put names on fears, explain why things go wrong, and offer specicmeasures for people to regain control over their lives often through the mobi-lization of benecial supernatural forces, thus reducing stress and facilitatingdecision (Borrello and Mathias 1977, 67,72; Fisch 1968, 380; Pasquali 1986 ,15). Although some researchers contend that Latinos are less often served by professional facilities because of their dependency on folk medicine, data suggests a dual use with little competition between these two forms of healthcare (Mayers 1989,291; Mikhail 1994 ). Certainly the sample cases discussed by Carmello Santiago indicate the use of both systems, sometimes because of biomedicine's failures and other times as a complement because \"machinescannot see spirits.\" A study of Curanderismo in urban Los Angeles thirty years ago posits its diminished role in the future (Edgerton, Karno, and Fernandez 1970), a prediction that has not been borne out (see Alvarez 1997; Mozingo 1998; Quintanilla 1990; and Sanchez 1997). The authors' anticipation of the demise of tradition coincided with notions at the time that folk medicine will declinewith acculturation, less interest among the young as well as greater accessi-bility to formal health care. However, traditional knowledge is durable(Bhopal 1986, 105; Hufford 1992, 1994) and barriers to health care persist, such as lack of health insurance and regular sources of care along with obstaclesresulting from the actions of providers (Flores and Vega 1998;S n o w 1974; Stekert 1970). New waves of immigrants and migrants along with trips back and forth from the U.S. to the home country and extensive travel by highlysought-after ritual leaders and noted herbalists like Carmello Santiago rein-force traditional patterns of behavior (Borrello and Mathias 1977). Moreover, recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in alternative medicine aswell as the proliferation of internet sites enabling practitioners to exchangeinformation and helping healers and patients to make contact. Santer\u00eda hasbecome known to many through Latin jazz and other popular music by TitoPuente, La India, Eddie Palmieri, Conrad Herwig, David Byrne, MiltonCardona, Celia Cruz, Francisco Aguabella, and even Paul Simon, whosemusical \"The Capeman,\" in which santeros were cast to sing and drum theirprayers to the orichas, opened on Broadway in 1997 (he has also released an album titled Rhythm of the Saints ; and in the 1950 s when Desi Arnaz as Ricky Ricardo sang \"Babalu\" on the I Love Lucy show, he was referring to Babal\u00fa Aye, the oricha that presides over disease). The result of all this is a rapid74 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 74increase in the number of bot\u00e1nicas whose spiritual and herbal therapies appeal to a diverse clientele. This is not to suggest that all instances of folk healing and alternative medicine are efcacious, that every healer can always differentiate successful-ly between illnesses in the spiritual and material realms, or that each folk prac-titioner unfailingly insists that clients seek professional health care forailments of a material nature. Nor do we contend that all traditional healersare conscientious and well intentioned. All four of the authors have utilizeddifferent forms of alternative and complementary medicine to varyingdegrees and three have been treated by folk practitioners (including healersrepresenting traditions in this study); regardless of sympathy toward someforms of alternative medicine, we are aware that exploitation and harm mayoccur within any medical practice. A product sometimes sold in bot\u00e1nicas forritual use can result in mercury poisoning (Zayas and Ozuah 1996). Questions have been raised about whether the use of herbal remedies delays treatmentby professional practitioners and whether the use of plant medicines in con-junction with pharmaceuticals might compromise the latter's efficacy.Obviously there is a need for more qualitative research on traditional healingsystems and health practices. Assuming, however, that much alternative medicine is effective or at least is not harmful, then the question remains as to what uses studies of folkmedicine can be put. How might traditional healers and their methods par-ticipate more fully, and with greater understanding and respect, within a med-ically pluralistic system? Frequent suggestions from the late 1970s to early 1990 s included inform- ing professional medical personnel of typical beliefs and practices of ethnicpopulations that would interfere with patient compliance, and instructing thephysician on how to elicit home remedies that the patient is using with a viewtoward eliminating harmful practices while leaving the harmless ones in thetreatment plan. The notion that compliance is the goal has been challenged inrecent years, especially by folklorists such as Hufford ( 1994 ). Ascertaining what is harmful or harmless is difcult at best, and ignores practices that maybe benecial because of suggestion or the placebo effect, psychotherapeuticresults or, in the case of herbs, pharmacological properties (or a combinationof all three). These approaches stereotype patients (O'Connor 1997 ) and promulgate a \"decit model\" rather than identify and utilize cultural strengths(Delgado and Humm-Delgado 1982, 88). On the other hand, more recent pro- posals to \"integrate\" traditional medical practices within the biomedical sys-tem run the risk of co-opting the former, weakening the very concept ofpluralist medical systems whose advantage is the gamut of \"cultural adaptiveInvisible Hospitals: Bot\u00e1nicas in Ethnic Health Care 75Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 75strategies necessary for survival and the management of disease and illness\" (Pedersen and Baruffati 1989,494). We suggest four applications, three of which have been recommended by others to varying degrees. One is to document more extensively the plants uti-lized in herbal preparations, including those for ceremonial purposes (whichsometimes are also drunk, inhaled, or applied to the body in some fashion; seeBrandon 1991). The search for potentially new drugs to prevent, treat, or cure illnesses can benet from folk medical knowledge as a mode of screening,which is certainly superior to random experimentation (Spjut and Perdue1976), although it raises potential ethical issues regarding exploitation of tradi- tional healers and a country's ecosystem (Barton 1994; Houghton 1995; King and T empesta 1994). A number of articles in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology report efforts to identify plants used in traditional medical systems (Laguerre1987, 89; see, for example, Appelt 1985; Kelley, Appelt, and Appelt 1988; and Trotter 1981), but rarely does such documentation occur in the U.S. or within the religious-health traditions considered in the present essay (for methods her article on Hispanic mothers' practices regarding children's health problems, for instance, Blanche I. Mikhail notesthat herbs commonly used by the study sample have known pharmacological-ly active ingredients: camomile has has antiseptic, expectorant, and astringent qual-ities (1994, 635). But many other plants have not been studied (for possible models for eld research, see Browner 1985 and Halberstein 1997). The research needs to pay careful attention to which parts of the plant are used in particu-lar preparations and for which ailments, how and when the plants are harvest-ed, whether they are used fresh or dried, how they are stored, and precisely howa remedy is prepared and administered. A second application, often remarked upon in the literature, falls into the area of education and sensitivity training, based on the assumptions thatfolk medicine is engaged in by most of us anyway (from home remedies toreligious interventions) and that it may be as effective as some forms of bio-medical care (Applewhite 1995). Knowledge about traditional practices helps professionals in the medical system better understand the orientation towardhealth and illness that may be held by patients (DeSantis and Thomas 1990 ; Laguerre 1987). But knowledge must be accompanied by a degree of empathy and respect (Pasquali 1986 ; O'Connor 1995; Scott 1974), lest health care work- ers generate fear, distrust, or rejection of their services (Krajewski-Jaime 1991;76 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 santero Carmello Santiago emphasizes this very issue: clients came to him out of desperation, distrustful of the medical establish- ment, and displeased by their treatment; for many in southern California, thesecond opinion comes from a diviner, not a doctor. One Lucum\u00ed priest remarked,\"If a person comes and sits down and says, 'I'm feeling sick, and the doctor orders a battery of tests and they all comeback negative, they'll say, 'Look, you have nothing. Go home.' Or worse, they'llsay, 'Go see a psychologist,' which in Spanish culture is like a real bad thing todo, because that tells everybody you're 'nuts.'\" Religious health care systemsinvolving mediumship or and Santer\u00eda (Sandoval 1979) have often been interpreted as forms of psychotherapy. Garrison goes so far as to contend that \"people donot seek the help of the spiritist with organic disorders\" and \"the mediumsstudied do not treat [organic] disorders,\" only mood and feeling states associ-ated with diagnosed organic disorders or psychophysiological conditions andintrapsychic and interpersonal disorders ( 1977, 71), an observation not borne out by our own study in which it appears that a santero treats not only emo-tional states and processes but also some organic disorders as well as per-forming a type of \"triage\" in which patients are assessed by divination as towhether they have spiritual (and hence to an extent, emotional) or material(organic) problems, or a combination of the two. The third application, therefore, involves the folk practitioner actively engaged in a patient's emotional recovery. Since medical practitioners have\"rst chance\" at the treatment of spiritist clients, writes Garrison ( 1977,164), \"I would place the onus upon physicians to make it as clear as possible topatients when there are organic or psychological explanations for complaintspresented. And I would weigh against the possible detrimental effects ofEspiritismo, the role that spiritists play in treating the psychological compo-nent of illness and encouraging clients to receive necessary medical care \" (emphasis in the original). Garrison (165) notes that spiritists already partici-pate signicantly in the professional health and mental health care deliverysystem whether or not this is recognized by professionals, an observationborne out by our study as well. \"Therefore, it would seem clear that somestrategy for bringing the general medical services, the mental health services,and the spiritists into closer integration would clearly benet the Puerto Ricancommunity.\" As an example, she took three healers \"to make presentations toprofessional audiences, to 'consult' to clinicians regarding patients, and to par-ticipate in clinical team case conferences regarding specic patients who werealso deeply involved in Espiritism Care 77Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 77She warns, however, that such participation must be done in a way that pre- vents the folk healers from being co-opted to the professional system, dis-crediting their own distinct specialty (see also Koss 1980 , who describes a therapist spiritist training project in Puerto Rico as an experiment to relate thetraditional healing system to the public health system). In an article on \"natural support systems\" in the Hispanic community, Delgado and Humm-Delgado (1982, 88) write that \"outreach could be done at bodegas [grocery stores], botanicas, and churches.\" The santero Carmello Santiago contends, \"We don't want to antagonize, we can be a great asset tothem [professional health care workers] and it would cost them nothing.When they were doing the vaccination of the kids [measles epidemic, late1980 s], I got calls here. People don't trust the system. And whatever new tech- nique comes in, they feel that it's not proven so they're going to use it even ifit kills, it's just one less Mexican. They tell me that!\" Because of the authorityand trust so often accorded the traditional healer, a fourth applicationinvolves the practitioner and bot\u00e1nica as intermediary between the medicalestablishment and the public, providing information and referrals as well asurging action regarding health care issues (for example, the need for inocula-tions and screening for cancer, cholesterol, hypertension, and sexually trans-mitted diseases). We end this essay with a modest example of how the fourth application involving bot\u00e1nicas and healers might serve an intermediary role. About one-quarter of California's residents lack health insurance, a disproportionatenumber of whom are Latinos. Children have the poorest health status andhighest health risks as well as least access to desirable prevention and healthpromotion programs. On 1 July 1998 the state initiated a ve hundred million dollar Healthy Families program offering low-cost health benets to morethan four hundred thousand children whose working parents are too impov-erished to buy insurance but not poor enough to receive welfare benets. Thestate has a twenty-one million dollar education and outreach campaign pro-moting the program that includes billboards, radio, and TV spots. A localassemblyman in the Southland organized an educational forum in El Montewhere three-fourths of the population of 106,209 is Latino; it is also home to numerous bot\u00e1nicas and traditional healers such as curanderas, paleras, san-teras, and espiritistas. \"After two hours, most chairs in the auditorium [still]sat empty. The formal presentation was scrapped\" (Marquis and Ellis 1998, A24). The sparse attendance indicates that many families did not know of the program, including the santero Carmello Santiago. Recognizing the potentialvalue of the enterprise, he insists, he would have urged qualifying clients toattend if he had been informed about it, and further, other practitioners and78 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 78owners of bot\u00e1nicas would have done likewise. T o most agencies and researchers outside the community, however, these spiritual-herbal centers areinvisible; yet every day their waiting rooms are lled with clients seeking care.

Tim Waggoner wrote The Poor Man's Medicine Bag \"to help people who couldn't afford to go to the doctor\" and to preserve someof the traditional knowledge of southern Appalachian folk medicine still cur-rent during his childhood. Realizing that he \"just got in on the last of this greatthing\" (meaning traditional Appalachian folk medicine), Tim took on the roleof native folklorist, interviewing approximately one hundred of his friends andneighbors concerning herbs and home remedies. The Poor Man's Medicine Bag , however, is much more than simply a compendium of Appalachian folk reme-dies; it represents the confluence of diverse streams of medical tradition, old andnew, local and exotic, distilled from popular literature as well as oral tradition,all of which Tim considers to be empirical therapeutic alternatives. /ornament21 88/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 88Tim Waggoner still lives in the Third Creek section of Knoxville where he was born and raised. His parents, Tillman Hollis Waggoner and Lillian Omeda Waggoner, were hardworking east T ennessee country people whomoved to Knoxville from small rural communities in Union and SevierCounties, respectively, in the late 1930s. The third of seven children, Tim nos- talgically remembers his formative years as a time when a genuine sense ofcommunity still prevailed, an era when neighbors helped out in time of need.Following the old pioneer adage of \"make do or do without,\" Tim recalls thathis family and their neighbors made extensive use of botanicals and other tra-ditional materia medica. However, medical knowledge in the Marble Citycommunity was not exclusively passed along via oral transmission, contraryto prevalent romantic stereotypes of southern Appalachian folk culture. Someof the Waggoner family's herbal knowledge came from ofcial rather than folksources: Tim's mother (actually his aunt: see afterword) often referred to aU.S. Department of Agriculture monograph dealing with the collection,preservation, and medicinal uses of botanicals. Practical in all aspects of theirlives, Tim's family and neighbors were by no means opposed to ofcial medi-cine, as long as they could afford to pay for it. Tim notes that he was hospital-ized twice during his childhood, at the age of two for diphtheria and again atve for spinal meningitis. Two of Tim's sisters are now practicing nurses. During his teenage years, Tim became acquainted with two older men, Doc Harris and Dewey Lincus, who sparked his budding interest in herbs andtheir medical uses. Not a licensed physician, Doc Harris was a self-taughtherbalist who sold his botanical concoctions on Market Street in downtownKnoxville. According to Tim, Dewey Lincus was \"an old mountain man from Rogersville\" (the county seat of Hawkins County, T ennessee), who was wellknown around south Knoxville as an especially adept herb doctor. Lincusmade the greatest impression on the young Tim Waggoner. He recalls thatDoc Harris was somewhat secretive and unwilling to reveal the ingredients ofhis herbal preparations, which he prepared and sold commercially like somany other old-fashioned herbalists and medicine-show men. Dewey Lincus,however, was a generous and amiable old soul who was glad to have the youngWaggoner accompany him on his forays into the nearby Great SmokyMountains to gather herbs. Tim spent countless hours on the front porch ofLincus's shack soaking in the older man's knowledge of herbs and home reme-dies. Seemingly a reclusive folk mystic, Lincus was \"close to nature\" and couldcommunicate with animals, bringing to mind St. Francis of Assisi, who couldallegedly talk with birds. Tim Waggoner insists that \"Dewey talked to animalslike I talk to you . . . I have sat down on his porch with him and they wouldcome in to be healed\" ( 1995a).The 89Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 89Shortly after graduating from high school in 1958, Tim joined the U.S. Army. Returning home from the service, he married Joyce Ann Boles and began working for a grocery chain and later took a job with TRW Plastics,where he worked for thirty-three years. A few years after his marriage, TillmanWaggoner received a spiritual call to preach the gospel and was subsequentlyordained as a Missionary Baptist minister. From early childhood, he wasintensely religious and a regular churchgoer, even though his own parentswere not always so inclined. He has ministered to a small congregation in theMarble City neighborhood for many years and at one time had a religiousprogram on a Knoxville AM radio station. Though profoundly religious inorientation, Tim's philosophy of medicine (described in detail in part II) isboth highly eclectic and pragmatic. Rather than relying solely on faith healingas do adherents of radical fundamentalist sects, who are actually only a smallif highly sensationalized segment of the southern Appalachian population,Tim's predominantly naturalistic and empirical medical beliefs and practicesare arguably closer to the Appalachian norm and the American cultural main-stream in general. Tim Waggoner is hardly typical in any other respect, however. Few ordi- nary people could have mustered the energy required to work a regular indus-trial job, minister to a small church, conduct his own radio program, helpraise a family of three children, and still nd time to read about herbs andhealing. Tim began frequenting an area health food store in the late 1970s, where he acquired books, monographs, and pamphlets dealing with herbs andnutrition. Prevention magazine remains one of his most valued sources of alternative health care information. Three popular health books particularlyinfluenced Tim's ideas about health and natural diet: John Lust's The Herb Book (1974), Jethro Kloss's Back to Eden ([1939 ]1970), and D. C. Jarvis's Folk Medicine (1958). The Herb Book introduced Tim to a wider range of medicinal herbs than those customarily used in southern Appalachian folk medicine. Written by aVermont physician, D. C. Jarvis's national best seller Folk Medicine extolled the salubrious health benets of honey and vinegar. Though popularized by aVermont Y ankee, the honey and vinegar regimen was quickly incorporated intocontemporary southern folk medicine, not only by Tim Waggoner in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag but also by an Alabama entrepreneur who promotes a commercial honey-vinegar health drink called \"Jogging in a Jug.\" (Recent TVads repeat the statement that honey and vinegar have no ofcial proven healthbenets, strongly suggesting that the FDA may have warned the makers of\"Jogging in a Jug\" to tone down their advertised health claims.) However,Jethro Kloss's Back to Eden had the greatest influence upon Tim Waggoner's90 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 90personal philosophy of health and healing, highly consonant with Kloss's con- tention that \"the fundamental principle of true healing consists of a return tonatural habits of living\" ([ 1939] 1970, iv). The return to natural habits of living has been a recurrent theme of health reform movements in the United Statesand elsewhere at least since the early nineteenth century. Early health carereformers such as Sylvester Graham and authors of popular home healthguides like Wooster Beach and John C. Gunn espoused what would now betermed a \"holistic\" approach to preventive health care, largely based upon diet(primarily or exclusively vegetarian), rest, exercise, and stress management.Some early health care reformers were purely naturalistic and rationalistic;others, like the founders of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and the Latter-day Saints, equated return to natural diet with spirituality and the rejection ofworldly corruption, articiality, and impurity. Back to Eden by Jethro Kloss is a twentieth-century expression of this ongoing tradition of American religioushealth care reform. Health reform is dened in religious terms. According toKloss, \"natural habits of living\" were established by God to enjoy a life freefrom illnesses which stem from the rejection of divine wisdom. If humanswould only follow the principles Kloss terms \"simple laws of health,\" includingpure food, pure water, fresh air, sunshine, rest, nature's remedies, herbs,etc.\"([ 1939] 1970, ii), then natural good health can be restored. Kloss's influence on Waggoner is evident in this excerpt from a taped interview Jackie Sluder recorded with Tim: Y ou see, a lot of people don't understand this but everything comes from God. Every disease, they don't come from the devil. The devil didn't cre-ate anything; they come from God. Of course, Satan uses the law ofnature to let you catch them. ( 1995b) Tim's statement echoes Kloss's theories concerning the divine nature of healing clearly expressed in the following excerpt from Back to Eden: God has provided a remedy for every disease that might afflict us. Satancannot afflict anyone with any disease for which God has not provided aremedy. Our Creator foresaw the wretched condition of mankind inthese days, and made provision in Nature for all the ills of man. Manywho violate the laws of health are ignorant of the laws of living (eating,drinking, and working) to their health. Until they have some kind ofsickness or illness, they do not realize that their condition is caused bythe laws of nature and health. ([ 1939] 1970, ii-iii). Waggoner elaborates on his view of some of the basic tenets of the law of Nature in his preface to The Poor Man's Medicine Bag:The Poor Man's Medicine Bag 91Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 91First, let me say that I believe in doctors and the medical profession. Now, let me say that I want to go to heaven as bad as anyone else, but I will takeevery pill that I can take to help me stay longer. This is the will to survivethat God has placed in man. Without it, a person would not want to over-come the second death either. It would be stupid to say that there is nodivine healing, just as it would be stupid to say that there is not naturalhealing which includes the aid of doctors and the medical profession. Goto a hospital and see for yourself. It happens everyday. It doesn't matterwhether it is divine healing with God's intervention, or whether it is natu-ral healing with the aid of doctors. God does all the healing. He made ourbodies and it would be stupid to say that He cannot heal them. The worldin which we live is ruled by the law of nature. This is God's law in whichhe lets nature take its course except where He would intervene. Nothingcan break the law of Nature except God. ( 1984,2) Tim promoted his philosophy of health on his radio programs, encour- aging listeners to acknowledge and conform to the divine law of Nature while dispensing practical advice concerning the health benets of herbs, fresh air,exercise, proper nutrition, and the like. Occasionally, he advertised some of hisherbal preparations (tonics and liniments) on his radio show. Seeking toexpand his audience, Tim also became a regular contributor on health adviceto the editorial pages of Knoxville's two daily newspapers. By the 1970s, Tim began taking what he calls his \"traveling herb wagon\" to local fairs, flea markets, and community festivals in and around Knoxville.He assembled a portable table display including herbs, tonics, liniments, and\u2014after its publication in 1984 \u2014The Poor Man's Medicine Bag, and offered advice concerning healing through following God's law of Nature. Tim nal-ly gave up traveling around with his herb wagon around 1985, but not before he had attracted the attention of folklorists who rst recruited him as a par-ticipant in the Stokeley Folklife Festival at the Knoxville World's Fair in 1982, which in turn led to his selection as a member of the T ennessee contingent atthe Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C., in 1986. T oday, Tim looks back at his traveling herb wagon as an effort to educate thepublic concerning the law of Nature. Following the example of his old men-tor Doc Harris, Tim's herb wagon and his radio advertisements for tonics andliniments represent a continuation of an old entrepreneurial medicine showtradition which still survives here and there throughout the southern UnitedStates, despite the advances of modern medicine and the regulatory efforts ofthe Food and Drug Administration. While making the circuit with his travel-ing herb wagon, Tim came to know and learn from other vernacular healers.He particularly respected and admired Chief Two Trees, a Native American92 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 92healer from Old Fort, North Carolina, who claimed success in treating vari- ous forms of cancers. Waggoner attended several seminars by Chief TwoTrees and was so impressed by him that he referred several friends andacquaintances to him for treatment. Though Chief Two Trees eventually suc-cumbed to prostate cancer, this did not diminish Tim's condence in him. Ashe told Jackie Sluder, \"He could have probably cured himself. Knowing him,he smoked, he ate what he wanted, he lived like he wanted, and he died likehe wanted\" (1995c). Though Tim began receiving a degree of ofcial validation for his herbal work in the mid- 1980 s, not only appearing at major folk festivals but also giv- ing guest lectures on herbalism at the University of T ennessee in Knoxville onseveral occasions, he actually quit taking his traveling herb wagon to areagatherings by 1985. Holding down a full-time job while promoting natural healing on the side was becoming too stressful; besides, Tim's herb businesswas never protable enough for him to support his family. Nonetheless, peo-ple kept seeking him out for advice on herbs and healing, and he would notturn away anyone in need. The Poor Man's Medicine Bag became his primary instrument for educating people about the law of Nature and common-sense,God-given knowledge about maintaining health. Though Tim says that he believes in doctors and official medicine, his attitude towards official medicine, like that of many other unorthodoxhealers (see Gevitz 1978, 18-21), is highly critical. Basically, Tim's attitude to official medicine is in accord with the adjuration to Christians to \"renderunto Caesar what is Caesar's.\" While he does accept the value and efficacyof conventional medicine in coping with critical life-threatening ailments,particularly sexually transmitted diseases, he believes along with JethroKloss that healing ultimately comes from conformity to God's law ofNature, not from human cleverness or ingenuity. In Tim's estimation, offi-cial medicine is fundamentally misdirected; its technological achievementshave had the unfortunate consequence, he believes, of further alienatinghumankind from the law of Nature. Like many Americans, he considersprofessional medicine corrupt, motivated by monetary gain rather than thedesire to ease human suffering. Doctors are less interested in curing peoplethan in making them drug-free. In Tim's opinion, the United States is \"anation of drug addicts.\" Hospitals are \"slaughterhouses\" where muchunnecessary surgery is performed. Doctors would not be needed if peoplewould only follow the law of Nature. Like Jethro Kloss, Tim Waggonerfirmly believes that medical science ought to devote itself to understandingthe therapeutic powers of God's law of Nature, which is the basis of health-ful living.The Poor Man's Medicine Bag 93Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 93Part II. Analyzing the Contents of The Poor Man's Medicine Bag Published in 1984, two years after Tim presented his program on herbs and natural healing at the Stokeley Folklife Festival at the Knoxville World's Fair, The Poor Man's Medicine Bag includes a variety of remedies, recipes, useful advice, and homespun philosophy leavened with Tim's tongue-in-cheekhumor. Part I of The Poor Man's Medicine Bag is devoted to remedies; part II includes recipes for food and wines, also advice on planting by the signs of thezodiac, bringing to mind The Old Farmer's Almanac and that longtime south- ern favorite, Moore's Almanac . Waggoner includes a few astrological heath care tips as well. When is it best to break bad habits such as smoking, drinking, orovereating? \"When the signs come down out of the bowels, quit the next day.It will be easier than you think\" ( 1984,74). Similarly, Tim recommends puncturing a burn or blister after sundown to promote healing. This is analogous to healing by signs of the zodiac, basedupon belief that there is a natural rhythm and order pervading all of God'screation. Following the natural order leads to healing and increase; disorderlyliving leads to sickness and decay. Possibly the principle of sympathetic magiclinks the setting of the sun and the dwindling of the burn or blister, which iscongruent with a literal belief that to everything there is a season, includingthe correct time of day or month to undertake the sowing of a eld or thehealing of a wound. Though Tim does not use the term, his approach to health and healing can be characterized as holistic. This is particularly evident in his discussionof alcoholism and alternative treatments for it. Tim recognizes that alco-holism is a complex condition, entailing psychological and social factors aswell as chemical dependency. He recommends that the alcoholic needs to bekept busy, but also suggests that goldenseal tea, eating apples, and drinkingapple cider vinegar, or an infusion of Virginia creeper leaves, can also help killthe craving for strong drink. Reading like a nineteenth-century domestic medical book, The Poor Man's Medicine Bag is a compendium of homely knowledge derived from a variety of sources, including oral tradition and popular publications. Oneindication of Tim's wide-ranging reading of health care literature is his use ofexotic medicinal plants such as archangel root and palmetto berries, not typ-ically associated with southern Appalachian folk medicine. Use of exoticbotanicals by southern Appalachian herbalists is not necessarily a recentdevelopment. In the nineteenth century, domestic medical books typicallyincluded sets of botanical illustrations and descriptions of the curative prop-erties of various plants. One of the oldest established commercial botanical94 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 94companies in the United States, the Indiana Herb Company (established in 1910 and now known as Indiana Botanical Gardens), not only bought medic- inal roots and herbs in bulk from pickers in various parts of the U.S., but itsfounder and proprietor Joseph E. Meyer ( 1878-1950 ) even published his own pocket-sized herb-picking guide, The Herbalist , rst published in 1918 and reprinted as recently as 1960, which doubled as a mail-order catalogue, includ- ing advertisements for exotic medicinal botanicals and also magical roots andaphrodisiacs. Here again, it is important that scholars concerned with nonof-cial medicine recognize the importance of various forms of vernacular (non-professional) literature in addition to oral transmission in the continuingevolution of pluralistic health care belief systems like those converging in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag . Some of the popular health theories Tim advocates include nger acupuncture ( 1984,7), reflexology for headache ( 7), and color therapy to calm emotional distress (24 and 75). While some proponents of ofcial medicine might be tempted to laugh off some of the medical theories Tim espouses, atvarious points Tim appears to have picked up a few ideas through his readingin health care literature which have since been validated by systematic scien-tic research, especially his advice to drink red wine daily to lower high bloodpressure. An exhaustive item-by-item survey of 650remedies listed in part I (see appendix) reveals the pluralistic character of Tim Waggoner's empirical healthcare options, summarized below: herbal: 276 home remedy (nonherbal): 246 over the counter: 42 diet: 18 consult professional: 16 inhalation (steam, vapors): 9 conventional rst aid: 7 conventional medicine: 7 magical: 6 massage: 4 fumigation: 3 popular health theories: 3 cold therapy (ice packs, et cetera): 3 warnings against traditional remedy: 3 avoid strenuous exercise: 2 mind, body, and health: 2 old folk remedies or medical history: 2 environment: 2The Poor Man's Medicine Bag 95Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 95 warning regarding dosage: 1 warning against popular remedy: 1 emetics: 1 enemas: 1 exercise: 1 heat therapy (heating pads, et cetera): 1 prayer or faith healing (recite Ezekiel 16:6 or blood stopping): 1 Discussion of Results Our analysis of these items listed in part I of The Poor Man's Medicine Bag shows that the ten leading types of remedies advocated by Tim Waggoner fall into four major categories: A. Noncritical naturalistic 1. Herbalism 2. Home remedies3. Over-the-counter remedies4.D i e t5. Massage or physical therapy6. Popular health theories B. Critical naturalistic 7. Conventional medicine 8. Conventional rst aid C. Noncritical supernatural 9. Magical remedies D. Critical supernatural 10. Prayer or faith healing Tim believes people ought to use their God-given intelligence and com- mon sense to take care of their ailments and inrmities. For the most part, The Poor Man's Medicine Bag provides naturalistic remedies for noncritical health care problems. Herbal remedies are the leading category, closely followed by nonherbal home remedies making use of items normally used for cooking orother domestic purposes or generic nonprescription materia medica such ascastor oil, Epsom salts, and mineral oil. In accord with his eclectic, empiricalapproach, Tim also recommends over-the-counter remedies he believes to beeffective as convenient alternatives to herbal preparations or nonherbal homeremedies. Over-the-counter medications Tim particularly advocates includePepto-Bismol and Save the Baby, a patented expectorant he discussed at con-siderable length in a taped interview with Jackie Sluder. Tim consistentlyadvises his readers to seek professional attention and to use conventional rstaid techniques in critical situations.96 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 96Despite the predominantly naturalistic orientation of The Poor Man's Medicine Bag , Tim does advocate a few magical cures, though he is well aware that many people dismiss them as superstitious nonsense. He prefaces these magical remedies by saying, \"Now some people may laugh at this . . .\" beforeproceeding to give well-known cures for warts, including rubbing warts withsliced potato and tying knots in wool, rubbing nine times on each wart, andthen burying the wool, a form of sympathetic magic. Having a seventh son or an orphan blow into an infant's mouth to cure thrush is also another well-documented Appalachian folk remedy. Tim's eclecti-cism is clearly evident in the various alternatives he offers as cures for this con-dition: \"Thrash is a yeast infection which causes small white blisters in themouth. For a cure have a seventh son of a seventh son to blow in the mouth, orsomeone who has never seen their parents, then use over-the-counter gentianviolet or purple medicine\" (1984 ,74). Tim also gives these alternative cures for the same condition: \"Drink water from a shoe, or go to a doctor\" ( 74). Tim seemingly makes fun of belief in the inherent magical healing power of seventh sons in hishumorous parody of a well-known traditional folk remedy: \"For headache, havethe seventh son of a seventh son blow in ear and then take two aspirin\" (7 ). From the folklorist's point of view, it is ironic that Tim describes vernac- ular medical practices he considers bizarre and outmoded as \"old folks reme-dies,\" such as putting warm urine in the ear to ease earache, or cutting off a blackchicken's head and smearing its blood on the affected skin to cure shingles.Variations upon the motif of killing or drawing blood from a black animal (gen-erally a hen or cat) and using its blood to cure shingles can be found through-out the South (Hand 1980, 192; Waller and Killion 1972, 87; Clark 1970, 78). Waggoner nds these medical curiosities amusing, but he does not recommendthem to his readers; they are not effective therapeutic alternatives in his view. Surveying the individual items included in Tim's remedies reveals the open-ended eclecticism of his approach to healing. Honey plays an importanttherapeutic role as an ointment and for other healing properties. Honey appearstwenty-four times, in six cases mixed with vinegar following the practice of D.C. Jarvis. Vinegar appears twenty-eight times, used for a wide variety of pur-poses. Sassafras is mentioned ve times, once with the warning that some doc-tors believe it may cause cancer. Ginseng is mentioned twice, as a remedy forimpotence and also rheumatism. Kerosene occurs three times, as a mosquitorepellent, applied as a poultice for croup, and once with the warning notto apply it to cuts or wounds as an antiseptic but to use hydrogen peroxide instead. Timadvises against the medicinal use of kerosene, once a common southern folkpractice, along with turpentine. The burning, astringent properties of keroseneand turpentine are of positive value according to the antiquated medical The Poor Man's Medicine Bag 97Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 97doctrine known as counter-irritant theory. Like the use of purgatives to which it is historically and conceptually related, counterirritant theory is quite literal-ly the medical expression of the idea of ghting re with re, sometimes bydeliberately raising blisters and creating irritations believed to draw out the nox-ious humors causing various diseases, particularly congestion of the lungs,which is remedied by the application of poultices. Regarding the empirical ther-apeutic validity of counterirritant theory, it is worth noting the increasing useof capsicum oleoresin found in chili peppers as an active ingredient in over-the-counter liniments and rubs, which creates a mild topical irritation stimulatingthe production of pain-relieving endorphins. Red clover is recommended for use as a healing ointment and as blood purier. Waggoner also advocates drinking a gallon of red clover tea daily fora year to cure cancer (1984 ,80), a treatment he likely acquired from Kloss. Some other items recommended in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag and their respective frequencies include: castor oil: 8 plantain leaves or sap: 8 baking 5 9 2 vitamins: 2 aspirin: 3 foxglove (digitalis) tea (for heart condition, with warning regarding over- dosage: 1 WD-40 lubricant spray (to relieve arthritis): 1 Though Tim advocates WD- 40for arthritis pain in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag , he later disavowed it on the grounds that the lubricant spray intended for use on mechanical joints contained harmful substances which gointo the bloodstream. Researchers have recorded use of WD- 40as an arthritis remedy in southern Appalachia. (Lang et al. 1988; Cavender and Beck 1995). The most common herbal remedy for arthritis and rheumatism in the south-ern Appalachians is to drink pokeberry tea or wine (see Waggoner 1984,69). Summary and Conclusion This brief overview of the healing knowledge contained in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag illustrates the diversity of Tim's materia medica, his consistent ethical concern for the welfare of readers making use of these remedies, and hiscritical evaluation of traditional home remedies. Tim points out ill-founded or98 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 98harmful traditional remedies and consistently warns his readers against com- mon practices such as putting butter on burns or daubing insect stings withmoist tobacco. Though his remedies are largely naturalistic, Tim advocatesprayer as the last resort in case of severe bleeding. This set of remedies fromThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag graphically illustrates Tim's fundamental hierar- chy of beliefs: 1. Stop bleeding: apply instant tea to wound 2. Stop bleeding: in dire cases, apply spider web to wound3. Stop bleeding (serious wounds): apply tourniquet 4. Stop bleeding: as last resort, recite Ezekiel 16:6, inserting the name of the victim as directed. ( 1984,17) Tim Waggoner believes that critical health problems call for profession- al care and conventional rst aid techniques, or if all else fails, prayer. Noncritical health problems can be treated with inexpensive home remedies,herbal infusions, or commercial over-the-counter preparations. A few magicalremedies are effective; some traditional naturalistic remedies are harmful andshould be avoided. Proper diet, stressing fresh fruits and vegetables as well asvitamin and mineral supplements, is also essential to good health. Like modern people in general, many people in the southern Appalachians today probably share a largely but not exclusively naturalisticattitude towards health care. Cavender and Beck's recent systematic survey ofremembered and current health care beliefs and practices of a rural commu-nity in Scott County, Virginia (the home of country music's original Carterfamily), strongly indicates that these longtime residents of southernAppalachia are quite pragmatic concerning their health and consistently seekout the most effective care they can afford ( 1995). Though most older com- munity members were well acquainted with herbs and home remedies likethose described in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag , few still relied upon them, nor would very many hesitate to avail themselves of ofcial medicine if theyfelt they needed it, regardless of romantic, misinformed stereotypes ofAppalachian antimodernism and fatalism. Tim Waggoner is denitely not fatalistic, nor is he necessarily antimod- ern, though he, like many modern Americans, is critical of ofcial medicine.However, as our analysis of The Poor Man's Medicine Bag shows, Tim is also critical of ill-founded and dangerous folk or popular remedies which are notempirically benecial and effective. Rather than being fatalistic and antimod-ern, Tim Waggoner's medical beliefs and practices are actually both pluralis-tic and dynamic, deriving from a diversity of cultural traditions and sourcesand open to innovations with demonstrable therapeutic value. In this regard,The Poor Man's Medicine Bag 99Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 99Tim Waggoner is like many other Americans for whom ofcial medicine is neither their rst nor their last therapeutic option but rather only one of arange of alternatives (see Blaustein 1992). Waggoner's eclectic and empirical approach to healing is shared by other notable folk herbalists in the region,including the late A. L. T ommie Bass of northern Alabama (Crellin andPhilpott 1990 ) and Clarence \"Catsh\" Grey of West Virginia (Green 1978). Earlier we described Tim Waggoner as a man of many parts. A close readingofThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag reveals its author to be a true populist educa- tor, a man of the people without advanced formal education who hasnonetheless become a self-taught scholar whose mission it is to bring bene-cial knowledge to the community he serves. Interpreting Tim Waggoner'sideas and practice within the broader history of the American health carereform movement and the particular context of the Christian naturalistmovement in the United States helps us to better appreciate the pluralistic anddynamic character of unofcial medical beliefs and practices in the modernworld in general. Afterword: A Conversation with Tim Waggonner We thought it would be valuable to invite Tim Waggonner to read our essayand comment upon our interpretation and presentation of his medical theo-ries and practices. Happily for us, Tim also thought this was a worthwhileidea. On Friday, 15May 1998, we visited Tim at his home in Knoxville where we taped our conversation with him. Tim had anticipated our questions bypreparing the following written notes: 1. The main reason I quit seeing people medically\u2014people will not do what you tell them. I still lecture.2. One of the main reasons for my driving effort for knowledge is that Iam a poor man, and I hate to pay someone to do something I can domyself. People today have become lazy. There are over 5million people who weigh over 500pounds. Don't take me wrong, because being a few pounds overweight can be healthier than being underweight, but peopleare getting so lazy that they cannot function. Others will not work sim-ply because it takes less energy to steal. This I blame on John F. Kennedywho put millions on welfare instead of requiring people to work. A per-son will not let himself starve. He will work if he is made to. My driving force which has caused me to work has been a Bible verse which says that a man who will not provide for his family is worsethan an indel. I'm here to tell you. I have made many blisters. My approach to medicine is God. God made this world, and he has told us in the Bible what we should & should not eat to make us healthy.100 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 100He has also told us to work. I believe in exercise, but I believe in it in the form of work. Put your energy to good use, and something gets accom-plished. Y ou may not like this, but if you don't ever accomplish anything,there is really no need for you to be in this world. Y ou are a disease carri-er of a different kind. Many people only get in tune with God when they need something, such as a miracle. They throw the ball into God's court, and many peoplehave died praying for a miracle, but it was not God's will that theyshould receive it. Probably due in part to broken promises, etc. However,this is not the approach I take. I let God throw the ball into my court,which he has done. God has said, \"My grace is sufcient to overcome allthings.\" I let the church pray for a miracle, mainly because I feel unwor-thy of one but since I have the ball instead of God having it, I play thegame to test God's grace. Read and study about the ailment. Quit eatingthings that are bad for it, and start eating things that help cure it, etc. In his taped conversation with us, Tim elaborated on these key princi- ples of his medical beliefs and practices for nearly an hour. Edited excerpts of this transcribed conversation of the record, T ony [Cavender] and I have gone ahead and written this piece about your work and have sent you a copy in themail. Y ou've been very charitable with us: it looks like we have a few typosand a few spelling mistakes that you also helped us identify. Otherwise Iwould be very interested to know what you think of how we have describedyou, how we have described your approach to medicine and such things. TW: Well, my approach hasn't changed a whole lot. It's still religiously based, which needs some more clarication: I think God made the world, I think he created the body, and I think it's up to him to cure it. Now, I talk to you inthe book about the law of Nature, which is God's law, and nothing can stopthe law of Nature except, of course, God. And when he stops it and reachesdown and heals the body, it's a miracle. That's what we call a miracle. Now there are people dying every day\u2014they do nothing but pray for a miracle. Seemingly the doctors cannot help them, and they die praying for a miracle. And you wonder why that happens: well, personally, I don't feelworthy of a miracle. I don't think I'm going to look for one when there'ssomething medically wrong with me. I take God's other approach. Rather than dying begging God to perform a miracle, I take the approach that God's grace is sufcient to help me over-come all things. And I believe that. In other words, when you pray for aThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag 101Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 101blessing\u2014I mean a miracle\u2014you throw the ball in God's court. When you believe that God's grace is sufcient to help you overcome all things, theball's in your court. Y ou see what I am saying? The thing for you to do isnot give up praying for a miracle, get the church to do that. And start read-ing and studying and learning what's wrong with you. I'm not one of thesepeople that ...I b e l i e v e that anything can be cured. My great-great grandfather looked out at nature, and he said, \"There's a cure there for everything.\" If I'm going to waste my time, I'm going to wasteit hunting a cure for what's wrong with me, see what I'm saying. I'm goingto read, study, take other people's opinions . . . I'll take every pill I can taketo stay in this world. I want to see the Lord as much as anybody else, but Iain't in no hurry. But there are things in the Bible that lead me to believe ...w e l l ,flat out, God said to let your medicine be herbs, and flat out he said you can short-en your days or you can lengthen them. And I read and study these things.Y ou're not going to live forever. Something's going to take you out of thisworld. But, if we can try and do live longer, we've left this world a betterplace, because it'll help the next fellow that's got it, you know. But I justdon't see us a-layin' and a-prayin' for a miracle, 'cause rst of all, I'd be therst to admit that I'm not worthy of no miracle. And I guess ninety percentof the people feel the way I do. TC: But yet some people are worthy of a miracle, but the miracle doesn't come. TW: That's right. Like the law of Nature, God's got two or three wills. It's not his will in the rst place for you to be sick, but he permits it, according to the law of Nature, you see. He permits you to be sick. He's got a will, anda permissive will. And if it's his will to give you a miracle, and if it's his willthat you be healed, it'll be there. But if it's his permissive will to let you die,that's just following the law of Nature. So the only thing you can do is easeyour pain till your time to go. TW: There are several reasons I quit seeing people. I've not completely quit; I still tell folks things, you know. But I used to have them come here,you know, and I'd see 'em. Two main reasons\u2014I'm a poor man. The reason I got interested in this in the rst place: I don't believe in paying anybody for anything I can do myself. And if you look at the medical profession, it's expensive, and a poorman cannot afford it. Now, that's the reason I got into it. Now the reason I quit seeing people, there's two reasons. They will not do what you tell them to do. When I tell you what to do, I want it done exactlylike I tell you [ laughs]. And I'll give you an example, my own mother, she102 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 102wanted a laxative\u2014gentle, soothing laxative. She couldn't get one from the doctor; nothing she tried worked. So I told her, \"Y eah, I can help you.\" I tooksome out; I preached to her for fteen minutes. I said, \"Momma, onetea- spoon.\"When it come time to take it: \"Ah, I feel so bad I'll take two teaspoons.\"Well, she was using the vacuum and the pain hit her, and she just had to throwit down and run. It nearly turned her inside out. TC: What kind of laxative was it? TW: It was already premixed; you can buy 'em at the health food store. But another thing, like my son, he was getting married and they wanted me tomake a gallon of my sex tea to take on their honeymoon. Well, at the timeall I had was a quart jar. My recipe called for a gallon. I set him down and...a n o t h e r f t e e n m i n u t e s ,\" M a k e this into a gallon!\" So I made it into a quart and told him all he had to do was add water to make a gallon. Theygot on their honeymoon: \"Well, we'll just drink it like it is!\" Well, you canoverdose on herbs. That's what happened to him: he overdosed. She wassmokin' like a cheap cigar; he was sick for [ laughs ] . . . three or four days, you know. But the list goes on and on and on. And if you're not willing todo what I tell you, I don't want to see you. I don't want to harm you[laughs ]...o r m a k e y o u w o r s e . But you've got to do what your doctor says, regardless of who it is, you know. If they won't take my word for it, they'll just have to learn by experience. TC: So that was the main reason, people not complying with you . . . TW: Y eah, going back to what I was telling you, the reason I got into this\u2014 this is an interesting theory, too\u2014way back when I got into it, there were few doctors making house calls, not many. Like I said, I was always a per-son that if I could do it myself, I wouldn't pay for it. That's the way the old-timers used to be. My daddy could do anything to a house or a car oranything else, you know. He was a walking book of knowledge, the smartestman I ever knew. All the men of that day were; they knew how to do every- thing . And they didn't pay for anything they could do for themselves. People have gotten away from that. TC: We've become specialists. TW: We've become fat and lazy. There's over ve million people over ve hundred pounds in this country because of it. Got the wrong mental out- look, they're not willing to work ...c o u r s e ,I b lame John F. Kennedy for that. TC: Why's that? TW: Put 'em all on welfare. He's the one who started all that stuff. Now they're too lazy to work. But that's my opinion, you know [ laughs]...p olitical. I'll give you a good comment to go with that: if you're not willing to work andThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag 103Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 103make this world a better place, then we don't need you in this world. Y ou're a disease carrier of a different kind. Y ou know what I'm talking about. And theonly remedy I get for that is just to get a job. Now if you want to know what I have accomplished that I am real proud of, I have read all the books by the Bible scholars, highly educated, andnone of them seen the truth. And as a dumb hillbilly, I'm going to be ableto show 'em [laughs ]. I've about got my book nished; I lack about four or ve paragraphs. It cannot be denied. RB: What is the title of this book? TW: Looking for a City, I believe it is. I've changed it so many times; I've wrote it four or ve times; didn't like it. TC: Y ou've been working on this for several years? TW: Oh yeah. They've not been able to see it, and for a dumb hillbilly to show scholars, you know, to me, that's an accomplishment. But that'swhat's wrong with the world today. We've got disease; men are not willingto make the world a better place for the people. Course, that goes back toenvironment and everything else ....T hat goes right back to the Bible. The devil, he wants everything concrete, he wants it to be pavement. He wantsbuildings sitting on it so you can't see the handiworks of God. He's no fool;got to give the devil a little credit. Y eah, he's shrewd. People can't see it. What scares me, though, the Bible says over in Revelations, I forget the chapter, but the reason he is coming\u2014talking about Christ\u2014to destroythem that destroy the earth. And it's in there in black and white. I don't even like to dig in the earth. We've dug in the earth. The earth has given us and given us and given us, and we've given nothing back. Keep onraping and plundering. But it's sad. In the process, we're destroying the verythings that can cure us. There's so many species of animals, species ofwildlife that are disappearing every day. Somewhere out there, we're justdestroying the very things it's going to take to cure us. I like things natural,not synthetic. The body gets sick naturally. If you eat the wrong things, you're going to be sick. And that's what's happening in America: we've got a sweet tooth,and ninety percent of what we eat is sugar. Or it's salt or pepper. Now, redpepper is good for you, but black pepper is not. And they worry about cigarettes. More people are going to die of dia- betes than have tobacco cancer. Course, when I was a young man\u2014talkingabout tobacco\u2014you never seen people dying of cancers; very rare. But theyput all this junk in cigarettes today: ammonia, make it go to your brainfaster. If they went back to just smoking tobacco just like it was, you know,104 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 104they wouldn't have much of a problem. T obacco companies are killing themselves. In fact, some forms of tobacco, Life Everlasting, what they call \"rabbit tobacco,\" has been smoked for centuries for asthma. But we're too involvedin politics to see straight of anything, really, in this country. We just can'tstand to see a bunch of woods or a eld; got to build something on it. It irksme no end for every tree I see cut. God put 'em there for a reason. Course,now we're nding out why he put 'em there! Look at the Bible ...a l l t h e fruit-bearing trees, eat the fruit thereof. And you're talking about the fruitsand the vegetables and the medicines, things, you know, berries. We'd behealthy as a horse if we left alone what God says. Pork! We're nding outeverything he said to eat is good for us, and everything he said not to eatwill kill us. I can't match wits with God. I've got to gure out what I can,you know. TC: It sounds like your philosophy of healing that we wrote about in that paper hasn't ou still adhere to the basic tenets you talked about in your interviews with Jackie Sluder and that you elaborate on so eloquently in your book, The Poor Man's Medicine Bag . Is there anything about The Poor Man's Medicine Bag you would change if you were to do it again? TW: Probably . . . TC: What would that be? TW: Well, I've a vast knowledge accumulated. Started writing another book. There's so much in my mind, it'd be that thick. TC: What would you add? TW: Well, like . . . cancer scares us to death, you know. Y ou mentioned one, red clover tea a gallon every day for a year. Well, my increase in knowledgewould add other things to it, you see. Stuff like that. TC: So, basically adding and rening additional bits of information. TW: Y eah. TC: Y ou've always been an avid . . . TW: Still, gold's where you nd it. We get information from other people, we get it from reading, and by trial and error. So I guess that your vastknowledge that you can call a concrete foundation is trial and error. I liketo know whether it works or not before I comment on it. Now, I'll give you a little piece of information. Y ou're getting older. I've tried everything . . . your ears begin to itch as you get older. Take you a Q-Tip, dip it down in brown vinegar, shake it off. Bacteria can't liveThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag 105Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 105where vinegar is. Ear infection, the whole works; just one minute. Now, that I'd like to put in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag. I've got a million of them! They have now come out with a solution that you put in your ears,but you can't beat straight vinegar. TC: So those are the kind of things you would add to it. But your underly- ing philosophy of healing has remained intact. TW: Oh yeah. TC: Like the laws of Nature: our responsibility to Nature, our connected- ness to God. TW: Well, let's face it: the Bible says he's got us on a string. We're like pup- pets, and he puts the fuel in us to make us move. We're a machine. Hemakes us move, but he's still got it in his hands. He can cut it anytime hewants to. Well, that's a clear picture of the Bible. T o me, he's God, and herules the world. There've been a lot of fools didn't think so, but they foundout when he cut the rope. That's an interesting theory; I don't know if youever thought about that or not. But he's got us each individually from theheart on a string. We're individuals. When he cuts that string, just one person dies, the one that's on that string. So each person's got a string, and he moves usaround in this world the way he wants us to go\u2014usually. He always givesus some freedom of choice. We choose to stay around people we get alongwith, but we need the other people. We cluster for sex and survival andwhatever. I don't know if you ever saw it that way or not, but really that'sthe way it is in the Bible. When you see that, and you're reading and study-ing the Bible, everything begins to make sense to you ....B u t t h e r e i s a cure for everything, if we just take time to nd it. But we got to learnwhich direction to look. RB: How do we recognize these things, how do we know these cures, how do we sort out the good ones from the bad ones, the effective ones from the ones that aren't effective? TW: Y eah, all of that's got to be found under what I call the law of Nature. Sometimes you can make a little scratch, my dog's got me pretty good, andyou just leave it alone. They'll heal theirselves\u2014most of the time.Sometimes they get infected. A little scratch has caused people to lose theirarm, even their life, you know. Sometimes it turns sour. Under the law ofNature, we've got to nd a cure. Outside of the law of Nature, of course,that's a miracle. RB: What you seem to be stressing in The Poor Man's Medicine Bag is most- ly naturalistic cures AM Page 106RB: Except for the one cure for the blood stopping, they all seem to be nat- ural cures [ aside from six noncritical magical folk remedies]. Why is that? TW: Well, I think the body eats natural things. I found out through the years that you can cure practically anything by what you eat, or you can pre- vent it, you know. So, to me, science is way out on a limb. Instead of look-ing at the natural things that we do everyday, it's got to be in the natural. RB: I guess what I was thinking was there are some people who would put more emphasis on prayer than you would seem to in this book. I'm justcurious about that ...i t ' s not that you're not religious, because you are very religious, but why do some people put so much emphasis on healingthrough prayer while you seem to be emphasizing common sense? TW: Well, we know that we need to pray, but we also should know .... Reason . . . there are a lot of religious fanatics that do not believe in goingto the doctor but we need to reach these people. If they won't go to the doc-tor, at least they need to know a few fundamentals about healing them-selves, you know what I'm saying? But to be frank with ye, I think Godhelps them that helps themselves. RB: Y eah, that's what you seem to be saying in this book. TC: One of my acquaintances up in Scott County, Virginia, said God wants you to do everything that's possible when you're ill, and that would includelearning all you can about yourself, your body, medicines to use, as well asgoing to the doctor if necessary. She said a person should do all they canthat's possible and let God take care of the impossible. RB: That's well put. TC: She's a Methodist. She said, \"God doesn't like a lazy Christian.\" God doesn't want you to sit back and let God do all the work. God put a brain in your skull . . . TW: That's basically what I believe. TC: And you would say God laid out the laws of Nature, and it's up to you to get out there and learn what those laws are. TW: Y ou can't stop 'em; you just have to learn to live with them. And to learn to live with them, sometimes we have to ...S e e ,w e ' r e not all per- fect. We make mistakes. We eat things and we do things in our lives that we shouldn't do, and we're going to pay for them, sure as we see anotherday coming around to us; that's how positive that it is you're going to payfor it. TC: Can you think of any other comments you would like to make about our paper? TW: My momma, you mentioned her; she used a lot of home remedies. My interest in home remedies came from her. [ Tim dedicated The Poor Man'sThe Poor Man's Medicine Bag 107Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 107Medicine Bag to his mother ]. Now her aunt is the one who read about the herbs and all. She was . . . oh gosh, what's Midwife! TW: Midwife. She was a midwife and everything else. They said it was amazing what she could do with colds and flus. Read an interesting article: they've about got the flu conquered. They've got it conquered in mice. Butevery flu they tried it on, it worked. I don't know what they made it out of,natural or anything else. But thank God for miracles! They work the otherw a y ,t o o... RB: I don't know if I've got any more questions if you're reasonably satis- ed with what you've seen. That really was the main concern: do you feelthat this is reasonably accurate? TW: Sounds good to . TC: . . . We wanted to make sure that we were representing you fairly and a c c u r a t e l y .... TW: I love your wording. It's down-to-earth; I can read it. RB: This makes me feel very good, Tim, because seriously, the two of us are very conscious about trying not to fall into that trap ...[ e x c essive use of academic jargon which cannot be understood by nonspecialists] [laughter ]. TW: I'm a self-educated man, and a lot of that stuff I haven't gotten to yet! I enjoyed it. Everything I corrected [ referring to misspellings and typos ], except the one I just told you about my aunt. Mom, she was into homeremedies. She really wasn't into herbs; maybe one every once in a while.Now, she could tell you the home remedies, my mom. Everything fromconstipation. They had a big old water bag, you know, for enemas. All sortsof stuff. But I've helped a lot of people. An old man came to me one time. He had emphysema, couldn't walk across the street. I had him walking all over theneighborhood with just a simple little remedy: get out in the front yard . . . RB: We just wanted to make sure you're represented accurately and honestly. TW: Hey, that's one of the best ones I've seen. It's down-to-earth where I can comprehend it. RB: Then we've succeeded . . . [in presenting Tim Waggoner's beliefs and ideas in terms that make sense to him]. TW: My head is full of knowledge, but it's not \"above my raising,\" you know.

Adler as students of folk medicine are well aware, the uneasy coexistence of diverse health belief systems in the United States is nothing new. Popular interest in these various healing systems seems to have increased with thedevelopment of patient empowerment and medical consumerism, as well asrecent changes in the organization of health care delivery, particularly man-aged care (Adler, McGraw, and McKinlay 1998). Despite this widespread pub- lic interest, researchers noted in 1992 that \"most physicians are unaware of [alternative medicine's] popularity, much less that many of their own patientsare also being cared for by practitioners of alternative medicine\" (Murray andRubel 1992). Only one year later, many physicians became aware of the \"invis- ible mainstream in the U.S. healthcare system\" (Eisenberg 1997) with the pub- lication of Eisenberg and others' seminal article on the prevalence and cost ofcomplementary and alternative medicine ( 1993). The rate of usage and amount spent on complementary and alternative medicine, although surprisingly highto many biomedical scientists, were not the only signicant ndings\u2014the investigators revealed that \"72 percent of the respondents who used unconven- tional therapies did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so\"(1993, 246). Four subsequent studies (including Eisenberg et al. 1998 as a fol- low-up) conrmed the high rates of patient and Bell 1996; Elder, Gillcrist, and Minz 1997; Eisenberg et al. 1998), but until now very little has been known about patients' own reasons forsharing or withholding information about their own alternative treatment use. /ornament21 115/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 115Contemporary Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Health belief systems have been explored by scholars from diverse academic backgrounds, including folklore, medical anthropology, sociology, history ofmedicine, public health, nursing, and biomedicine. This diversity of theoreti-cal and methodological orientations is evidenced by the myriad disciplinaryterms that are presently used\u2014for example, folk medicine, ethnomedicine,traditional medicine, unorthodox medicine, and unproven remedies, to namea few. My own training and research in folkloristics and medical anthropolo-gy results in my being most comfortable with terms and denitions that areappropriate to healing systems and practices in any location and at any pointin time. The denition developed by a multidisciplinary panel convened bythe National Institutes of Health Ofce of Alternative Medicine (recentlyrecongured as the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) comes closest to doing justice to this large, diverse, and dynamiceld of research: \"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broaddomain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities,and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than thoseintrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society orculture in a given historical period\" (Panel on Denition and Description1997). 1I have selected this denition of CAM to inform my ongoing study of women's treatment choices for breast cancer. For the purposes of this research,therefore, all nonbiomedical healing strategies used in the contemporaryUnited States will be referred to as CAM. I conceptualize folk medicine as asubset of CAM, distinguished by its dependence on oral transmission, infor-mal structure, and lack of commercialism (Hufford 1997). The extensive use of CAM in the United States has been documented by a number of studies. Estimates of the percentage of adults using CAM cancertreatments in a variety of populations have ranged from 9 percent (Lerner and Kennedy 1992) to 50 percent (Cassileth et al. 1984). 2My own research, based on face-to-face interviews with women with breast cancer, indicates that 72 percent use at least one CAM treatment in the rst few months after diagno-sis (Adler 1999 ). The notion that the majority of patients a doctor sees are engaging in CAM usage on a regular basis has caused concern on the part of many physi-cians. Although it is always benecial for doctors to be alert to their patients'health-related beliefs and practices, many argue that the importance of thisawareness is elevated in the context of CAM usage: \"The medical literatureexpresses a number of primary concerns about alternative therapies: that theyare incorrect and unfounded; that they will cause direct harm; that they will116 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 116delay or replace use of conventional medicine, thus causing indirect harm; and that they are perpetrated by quacks and frauds motivated by proteeringimpulses\" (O'Connor 1995; see Guzley 1992 for a representative example of this type of thinking). A more neutral portrayal of the reasons for physiciansto stay aware of patients' use of different treatments is that \"certain CAM ther-apies have demonstrable benecial effects; some can be harmful under certainconditions; and others may interact with pharmacologic therapies in clinical-ly signicant ways (Lazar and O'Connor 1997). The overwhelming majority of users of CAM also use biomedicine, either concurrently or serially. This is a remarkable situation, in which vast numbers of patients consistently participate in complementary and alterna-tive healing practices outside of their physician's purview\u2014and usually with-out his or her knowledge. Previous Approaches to CAM Use For purposes of expedience (Sharma 1993), most researchers have selected CAM cancer treatments to study based on two criteria: the treatments have been limited to a specic number of therapies derived from the literature,from pilot studies, or intuitively (Eidinger and Schapira 1984 ; Eisenberg et al. 1993; Faw et al. 1977; Harris, Louis, and Associates 1987; Y ates et al. 1993); and the selected treatments tend to be those with the greatest structural similarityto biomedicine (practitioner-dependent and clinic-oriented). Investigators'catalogs of CAM treatments most often reveal an exclusively etic perspective,with no evidence of informants' actual knowledge or usage. Many of the sameproblems that plagued earlier folk medical studies have been present in CAMresearch, with the result that patients' behavior is made to appear foolish,risky, and illogical. Historically, folk medical research in the United States hasbeen conducted among marginal or peripheral communities, to the exclusionof more mainstream groups. The long-standing scientic misconception ofthe distribution of nonbiomedical practices is in large part a result of earliernotions of where populations of users of folk medicine could be found forstudy. From at least as early as the beginning of the present century, the beliefhas been widespread\u2014in both the health professions and much of nonmed-ical academia\u2014that folk and popular healing systems were in the process ofgradually dying out with the advent of modern, Western medicine. An evolu-tionary model of the development of health systems has been to a large extentresponsible for the perception of the waning popularity of nonbiomedicalhealth practices. \"Progress\" implicitly dened as \"increasing similarity to theculture of the scholar\" (Hufford 1983, 307) was viewed as a natural andIntegrating Personal Health Belief Systems: Patient-Practitioner Communication 117Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 117inevitable process. Discarded, obsolete ideas drifted down and were preserved in the sediment of the lower layers of culture\u2014 gesunkenes Kulturgut (Hufford 1988,228; Hultkrantz 1960, 158-59). The legacy of nineteenth-century social theories, which incorporated positivist assumptions of the unilinear evolutionary process of humanthought, remains remarkably influential today. In this context, the persistentfascination with recent reports of the high prevalence of CAM usage(Eisenberg et al. 1998) and the \"conventional\" and \"mainstream\" characteris- tics of CAM users (Cassileth et al. 1984; Eisenberg et al. 1993; McGuire 1988) becomes clear: research ndings challenge the still-prevalent view of the mar- ginalized user of nonbiomedical therapies. Evolutionist and survivalist assumptions have sustained a series of stereotypes of participants in nonbiomedical health systems as being socially marginal. The stereotypes of marginality typically include one or more of thefollowing features: geographic remoteness or isolation (the image of ruralAppalachia is frequently invoked); recent immigration or minimal accultura-tion to core American culture; ethnic minority membership or strong ethnicself-identication or group afliation; poverty or low socioeconomic status;low formal educational attainment; mental or emotional imbalance; or des-peration induced by grave illness or poor outcomes of conventional thera-peutic efforts (O'Connor 1995, 17). I add three characteristics to this list of common stereotypes: being a woman, being elderly, and being gullible (seePepper 1984 for classic examples of belief in these stereotypes). I think that this view of marginality has contributed to the fact that many physicians feel thattheir patients' use of CAM is intentionally enveloped in secrecy (Gray et al.1997). In the medical literature, patients have been portrayed as willfully with- holding information about their health beliefs because they are \"afraid to'confess' to the general practitioner their contacts with non-medical practi-tioners\" (Guzley 1992,523). Scientic research has also contributed to the stereotype of the CAM user by focusing on nonrepresentative groups of people (Brown 1975; Ingelnger 1976; Durant 1991). Convenience sampling has resulted in study populations that are poorly differentiated in terms of ethnicity and age.Prevalence studies have included people who use CAM for a variety of differ-ent conditions\u2014from short-term discomforts to chronic or life-threateningillness\u2014thus confounding the informants' reasons for and satisfaction withthe choice of CAM treatments. Additionally, clinic-based samples, which con-tinue to comprise the most common study populations, can introducerecruitment bias in terms of the types of patients that physicians allowresearchers to approach (\"compliant\" patients). Finally, there is also a \"context118 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 118bias\" that can arise when informants are interviewed in a clinic or hospital, locations at which \"an adherent is least likely to feel at ease discussing beliefsand practices deemed 'deviant' by the larger society\" (McGuire 1988). Another problem in CAM research has been the difculty of ascertain- ing accurate prevalence estimates. The broad range of reported prevalencerates (from 7 to 50percent in the U.S.) appears to be directly related to each project's chosen methodology. The continuum of research ndings from lowto high rates of usage is paralleled by a methodological continuum rangingfrom quantitative telephone survey research to qualitative, face-to-face inter-views. Also, not surprisingly, studies that rely on narrow denitions of CAMculled from the biomedical literature report lower prevalence of usage thaninvestigations that utilize broader, emically derived denitions. Problems dueto unclear denitions, nonrepresentative study populations, and underesti-mated prevalence rates have hindered progress toward a better understandingof the nature of people's use of CAM. The Women's Breast Cancer Treatment Choices Study The ndings discussed in this chapter are based on two cycles of interviewsfrom an ongoing ve-year qualitative study of treatment decision-making onthe part of women with breast cancer. In order to interview a representativegroup of women as soon as possible after their breast cancer diagnosis, par-ticipants were recruited using a unique population-based rapid case ndingmethod. A team of case nders from the Northern California Cancer Centerwas sent to the medical records ofces of each hospital in San FranciscoCounty biweekly for thirteen months. The team assembled a list of all newcases by reading pathology reports, supplemented by hospital records. Afterpatients' physicians were contacted, the women were sent introductory letters,followed by a recruitment telephone call. Eligibility requirements for study participants included the following: ages 35-49and 60-74, inclusive; residents of San Francisco, California, at the time of diagnosis; ability to be interviewed in English, Spanish, or Chinese(Cantonese or Mandarin); histological diagnosis of breast cancer (in situ orinvasive); diagnosed at a hospital within San Francisco County; and diagnosedduring the thirteen-month period of case ascertainment (May 1995-May 1996). Exclusion criteria included recurrent breast cancer and patients whose physi-cians refused to grant permission for them to be contacted. A total of eighty-six women were enrolled ( 87percent of those known eligible). Data is being collected through a series of four in-depth, face-to-face inter- views. Informants are initially interviewed within a few months of diagnosisIntegrating Personal Health Belief Systems: Patient-Practitioner Communication 119Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 119(two to four months average) and again after six months, eighteen months, and thirty months. The interviews take place in participants' homes or at privatelocations of their choosing. The study utilizes a semistructured interview guidethat is specically adapted for each of the four interview cycles. The open-endedquestions are designed to encourage informants to articulate their personalunderstandings of their beliefs and practices regarding health and illness. Thedomains of questions asked during the initial and rst follow-up interviewsinclude: (a) conceptualizations of health and illness; (b) the process of discoveryand conrmation of the breast cancer; (c) the individual's views on the cause,nature, and extent of her illness; (d) biomedical and/or CAM cancer treatmentsutilized to date; (e) experiences with and attitudes toward physicians and alter-native practitioners; and (f) interactions regarding CAM and biomedical treat-ment use with physicians and alternative practitioners, respectively. In order toelicit answers with unbiased questions, informants were asked to describe allaspects of their health beliefs in their own words: potentially etic terms or con-cepts, such as cancer or alternative medicine, were not used by the interviewerunless introduced by the informant. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish interviews were translated by the interviewers andthen transcribed. Concurrent qualitative text-based analysis is conducted withthe use of QSR NUD*IST software. The data related to patients' disclosures oftreatment use and interactions with physicians and alternative practitionerswere analyzed separately. Transcripts were reviewed and coded by two personswho did not conduct the interview. After the identication of topics andthemes that repeatedly appeared in the data, codes were developed, and sub-sequently assigned to the transcribed interviews. The data set was then ana-lyzed and interpreted in terms of linkages between the derived concepts andrecontextualized data. Logics of Disclosure Of the patients simultaneously being treated by an alternative practitioner, 54 percent discussed their CAM use with their physicians.3Conversely, 94per- cent of the participants seeing alternative practitioners discussed details of their biomedical treatments with these providers. These quantitative rates ofdisclosure, however, can be misleading. In the vast majority of cases, patientswho are using self-treatment are much less likely to initiate discussions ofCAM use with their doctors than those who are seeing a practitioner. Also,even among those patients who actively seek to initiate discussion, many donot achieve their goal of prompting an interaction or receiving feedback.120 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 120Therefore, even more signicant than the number of patients who disclose CAM use to their physicians is the nature and quality of any subsequent dis-cussion. In the biomedical encounter, this interaction was frequently brief andsupercial, while discussions with alternative practitioners were quite com-prehensive, often including a review of biomedical data, such as laboratorytests and pathology reports. Patients' disclosure of CAM usage was cautiously modulated and care- fully adapted, even by those who would welcome an open discussion withtheir physicians. Informants who chose not to reveal their CAM practices gaveone or more of the following reasons for their decision (listed in decreasingorder of participant emphasis): the impression of physician disinterest; theanticipation of a negative response; the conviction that the physician isunwilling or unable to contribute useful information; the perception that theCAM therapies used are irrelevant to the biomedical treatment course; andthe patients' views regarding the appropriate coordination of disparate heal-ing strategies. Although a few participants implicated insufcient time as abarrier to disclosure, it was considered a relatively minor impediment. Anabbreviated appointment was seen as contributing to the problem of poorcommunication, but was not viewed as a primary or determining factor. The reason for lack of disclosure most frequently cited by informants was the feeling that the physician was simply not interested in a patient's useof CAM: \"He'd think it was frivolous ...I think he wouldn't take it very seri- ously.\" Even when patients did attempt to initiate discussion, their effortswere frequently not reciprocated: \"The oncologist knows ...b u t s h e ' s n e v e r asked me for details\" and \"Y eah, I told him\u2014I don't know if he remembersor not.\" Unresponsiveness was taken as a clear message that the physician didnot want to hear more about the patient's practices: \"I don't feel that they'rei n t e r e s t e d...I did tell the oncologist . or 'Okay,' or anything. It's kinda like, 'We're looking at the plateletshere, and the white count\u2014let's not get too far aeld! [laughs].\" The impres- sion of physicians' disinterest\u2014even on the part of women who had initiallyvolunteered information\u2014often prevented further discussions. Patients are aware of the persistent ambivalence and occasional hostility of some biomedical practitioners towards CAM (Lazar and O'Connor 1997; Adler and Fosket 1999): \"When to my oncologist, 'I've used shark carti- lage,' he almost laughed me out of the ofce.\" Because patients sometimes feara negative response from their physicians, they carefully assess the potentialreceptivity before disclosing information about their practices: \"My Chinese- American doctor is very against qi gong ...H e t old me that qi gong is really just full of it\u2014that it is really a scam. I think that's somewhat biased, so I didn't talkIntegrating Personal Health Belief Systems: Patient-Practitioner Communication 121Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 121to him about my practicing of the qi gong\u2014that I went back to China to learn more\u2014'cause I don't want him to make me feel bad.\" The same partic- ipant, however, did disclose her CAM use in another context: \"My radiationoncologist\u2014he's a white person, but he knew something about qi gong. Heseemed to be a lot more open.\" A physician's indiscriminate disapproval canbe viewed as having a broader scope than merely discouraging the use of aspecic CAM treatment: \"When I raised the subject of alternative medicine,my oncologist would really pooh-pooh it. It isn't that I need him to believe init\u2014I just don't want someone to dismiss it all . . . and thereby, in some ways,be disrespectful Informants' perceptions of physician disinterest andambivalence echo ndings from a preliminary study of physicians' attitudestoward patient use of CAM. Among the physicians interviewed, \"there was lit-tle interest in initiating communication about unconventional therapies, withmost seeing such discussions as a poor use of their time\" (Gray et al. 1997,14). Another common reason for withholding details about personal CAM use was patients' conviction that disclosure would not yield any benet.Whether the physician was felt to be unable to help because of inadequatetraining or unwilling to help due to a bias against alternative health systems,the unlikelihood of a useful outcome was a sufcient deterrent to pursuingfurther discussion. As one participant recounted, \"When I started taking theseherbs, I gave my primary care doctor a description of what was in them andwhat they were supposed to do\u2014and she never said, 'I think it's good' or 'Ithink it's bad.' She looked at them and just goes, 'I don't see anything in herethat's harmful.' ...M y C hinese herbalist requested that I get copies of my [lab] tests, which I did. My medical doctor gave me copies, but, again, without anycomment or questions\u2014indicating to me a sort of unwillingness to work withthis alternative doctor.\" Patients may feel that their use of CAM is not germane to the process of medical decision making. Some participants believed that the CAM therapythey used was not directed at the same target as concurrent biomedical treat-ments and therefore could not cause a harmful interaction: \"I'm just using itto strengthen my antibodies\" or \"I really just took [the herbs] to control thespread of the tumor before my surgery. It really wasn't for treating my cancer.\"One participant who felt it unnecessary to inform her oncologist of her CAMusage, however, was concerned enough about potential cross-reactions tokeep her herbalist informed about her biomedical treatment: \"Just in casewhen the Chinese herbalist gives me herbs they might have some side effecton the Western medical treatment that I'm receiving. Y ou know, you don'twant to be mixing Chinese herbs and Western medicine, because the combi-nation of the two could be pretty lethal. Y ou can't just combine them.\"122 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 122Participants also based disclosure decisions on their understanding of the proper roles for the various practitioners in their therapeutic encounters. For women who thought of their CAM use as a personal healing strategy\u2014\"Just something positive that I'm doing for myself\"\u2014there was a sense of pro-tectiveness regarding their treatment choices. Other participantsdistinguished between the realms of knowledge and authority of physiciansand alternative practitioners: \"I didn't bring it up with the surgeon ...I d o n ' t feel like that's why I go to her. That's not really her job.\" Perhaps most inter-esting, though, are the cases in which patients perceive the value of integrat-ing and coordinating their care, but choose to focus their efforts entirely onthe alternative practitioner: \"I send my acupuncturist my pathology reports\"and \"When you do surgery, of course you listen to your Western doctor\u2014butI also went to my Chinese herbalist. I actually took my pathology report tohim, and he looked at it, and felt that it's a good idea to have a surgery.\" Not unexpectedly, the preliminary data available on doctors' attitudes toward CAM usage presents an entirely different picture of the context of dis-closure. In discussing barriers to communication, the majority \"identied theproblem as being with the patients\" (Gray et al. 1997, 17): \"[patients'] unrealistic expectations of their physicians, inability to tolerate reality, hostility or denial inthe face of bad news, disorganization in seeking information, and secretivenessabout use of unconventional therapies\" ( 18). Some doctors identied systemic communication problems associated with an overloaded health care system,such as limits on time. In general, \"learning about, or having access to informa-tion, seemed to be much more important to physicians than actually discussing[CAM] issues with or passing the information on to patients\" (18). Finally, in order to understand better patients' disclosure decisions, it is helpful to consider the factors that promote discussion. When study partici-pants did choose to reveal details about CAM treatment use it was becausethey perceived their physician to be respectful, open-minded, and willing to listen. Patients found it easier to discuss their alternative treatments when theybelieved that their physician expected them to be using some form of CAM.Participants also were particularly impressed by the few instances in whichphysicians opened a dialog with patients' alternative practitioners (most fre-quently by recommending or trading journal articles). Participants mentioned different reasons for discussing their use of bio- medical treatments with their alternative practitioners: concerns about bio-medical/CAM treatment cross-reactions; the desire to target specificbiomedical treatment side effects; and the view that alternative practitionersare relatively more \"open-minded\" and more adept at integrating diversestrategies than physicians are: \"[My acupuncturist] always 123Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 123down in her chart when my next [medical] visit is. When I go to see her the next time . . . that's one of the rst questions she asks me. So, she's really up onwhat other people tell me or what I've done. And in any other area, she's real-ly good at wanting to know about it, what I've been told.\" The nature of theinteraction after a patient describes her biomedical treatment use to her alter-native practitioner is thus often qualitatively different than in the medicalencounter. Personal Integrated Health Belief Systems and Virtual Collaborators Interest in CAM use may be prompted by a wide range of factors, from the desire to avoid the invasiveness of a biomedical procedure to the fact that aparticular healing modality is a part of a patient's cultural (Lazar andO'Connor 1997; Hufford 1992; O'Connor 1995). The signicance of a patient's use of CAM, therefore, is not limited to the impact of the discrete treatmentitself; it usually indicates (concurrent) belief in at least one nonbiomedicalexplanatory health model (like the influence of the mind on the body, theimportance of holistic healing, or the role of spirituality in medicine). Aphysician's indiscriminate criticism of alternative treatment use has broadimplications for the medical encounter, as well as patient outlook and hope.Respectful discussion of CAM, however, \"sheds light on patients' worldviews,values, explanatory models, lifestyles, health beliefs, and goals for care\u2014all ofwhich are clinically relevant and contribute to the ongoing development ofeffective and mutually rewarding doctor-patient relationships\" (Lazar andO'Connor 1997). The interviews emphasized patients' spontaneous, that is, unsolicited, disclosures of CAM use. It is likely that some women would haveovercome their hesitation to discuss CAM if their physician had asked them adirect question. It is telling, however, that, even in a part of the country witha reputation for open-mindedness regarding health care diversity, physiciansrarely initiated discussion of CAM use. The emic perspective that the informants provide reveals that an intri- cate framework of logic underlies their health behavior. A patient's integrationof biomedical and various CAM therapies is, of course, not desperately hap-hazard, as sometimes portrayed in the medical literature: patients' integrativehealing systems involve deliberate and complex strategizing. A helpful con-struct for the study of complementary and alternative medicine is personalintegrated health belief systems, in which individuals combine disparate ele-ments\u2014from what may appear to be mutually exclusive health traditions\u2014into a syncretic whole. In order to understand better the intricacies of these124 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 124unique syncretic healing systems, the individual's own health beliefs must be studied as the locus for integration. As is often the case, the different biomed-ical and alternative health traditions may only appear to be irreconcilable\u2014their apparent inconsistencies are either not viewed as such or are deemedinsignicant from the individual's perspective. The interviews with women with breast cancer revealed that accurate models of patient decision making regarding breast cancer treatments, evenexclusively biomedical therapies, must take into account the role of alternativepractitioners. The conventional view of the dyadic patient-physician relation-ship only reveals one side of a potential triangle of patient and practitioners.In actuality, the majority of physicians are engaged in a virtual collaborationwith patients' alternative practitioners. Although the \"partnership\" is fre-quently invisible, its effects are not. Folkloristics and CAM Research T o conclude, I would like to emphasize that folkloristics is ideally situated toinvestigate the wide variety of CAM systems, including modalities, practices,theories, and beliefs. As Claire Cassidy explains, qualitative research method-ologies display a high degree of \"model t\"; that is, they comprise \"researchdesign and techniques [that] t the explanatory model/s of the study popula-tion/s\" (Cassidy 1995, 35). By sharing what amounts to a common perspective with many CAM systems, folkloristic inquiry avoids many of the problemsthat can arise with mismatched methodological techniques. Another strength of folkloristics is its \"populist\" orientation (Hufford 1992)\u2014an approach that links well with the patient consumerism that is soinfluential in the phenomenon of complementary and alternative medicine.Folklorists emphasize\u2014or, more accurately, insist on\u2014taking into account theemic perspective. As David Hufford observed, \"ordinary people tend to beunderestimated and . . . their knowledge tends to be discredited by authorities\"(1992). By promoting participants' views and understandings, folklorists and other qualitative researchers can interpret CAM phenomena in terms of themeanings that people bring to them. Through the use of unstructured or semi-structured interviews, informants are given the opportunity and encouraged todescribe their beliefs and practices using their own logic and terminology. The holistic nature of qualitative inquiry blends well with the holistic model of many CAM healing systems (Cassidy 1995). Just as many CAM sys- tems do not involve the traditional biomedical hierarchy of doctor andpatient, for example, in qualitative inquiry the researcher-participant dyad isconstructed to promote a more egalitarian relationship. Perhaps the mostIntegrating Personal Health Belief Systems: Patient-Practitioner Communication 125Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 125important contribution a folkloristic approach can make to CAM studies is the valuing of participants' \"subjective\" views as expert and the integration ofinformants' conceptualizations and models into research design and analysis. Notes This research has been supported by joint funding from the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Aging (CA 64634 ) and a grant from the University of California, San Francisco, Academic Senate Committee on Research. Cancer incidence data used in this research have been collected by the NorthernCalifornia Cancer Center under contract N 01-CN-05224/ 25482 with the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, and under subcontract0501-8701/8708-S0207 with the California Public Health Foundation. I am grateful to the women with breast cancer who are generously sharing their thoughts and expe-riences by participating in this project: their altruism makes this research possible.1. \"Complementary and alternative medicine\" is dened as \"all health care resources to which people have recourse other than those intrinsic to biomed-icine and the specic theoretical and practice models of biomedicine\" (Panelon Denition and Description 1997). 2. Studies of patients in a variety of populations outside the U.S. have shown that between 9percent and 75percent of adult patients with cancer use CAM (Lerner and Kennedy 1992; Gray et al. 1997; Eisenberg 1997; La Valley and Ver ho ef 1995; Hufford 1997; Clinical Oncology Group 1987 Schapira 1984; Himmel, Schulte, and Kochen 1993; Millar 1997). 3. Overall disclosure for women using CAM generally was 33percent, similar to reported ndings in the general population. References Adler, Shelley R. 1999 .

Goldstein \"risk\" is a word we hear a lot these days, whether it be in academic dis- cussions of \"risk assessment,\" \"risk analysis,\" or \"risk as \"environmental risks,\" \"nancial risks,\" or\"public health risks.\" AIDS literature uses the word \"risk\" perhaps more thanany other term and, in fact, a signicant moment in the epidemiologicalunderstanding of AIDS is marked by the change in reference from \"riskgroups\" to \"risk activities.\" The notion of \"risk groups\" (such intravenous drug users) rather than \"risk activities\" (suchas sharing needles or sex without a condom) was seen in the mid-1980s to stigmatize specic groups while simultaneously allowing individuals to dis-associate themselves from perceived vulnerability by disavowing member-ships in identied risk groups. The logic of this change in usage is clear,shifting the focus from groups to specic behaviors. The shift in referenceand in thinking would seem to be both a public health and a human rightsvictory. And indeed, it was. Still, the stigmatizing nature of \"risk\" theory did not simply disappear. While \"risk groups\" were no longer in academic discourse, \"risk activities\"were, and the popular association of specic behaviors with specic groupsremained. Sharing needles, for example (or even access to used needles), gen-erally occurs in certain contexts; contexts require participants, and partici-pants make up groups. Cindy Patton observes, for example: Despite efforts among activists to shift the terminology from risk groups to risk behaviors, AIDS education information concerning risk reduction /ornament21 129/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 129was directed almost exclusively toward gay men, and soon (though much less consistently and effectively) toward injecting drug users. ( 1994 ,14) But other issues exist in relation to the fragile attempts at disassociation of risk activities from groups. As Mary Douglas notes in her book Risk and Blame: Essays in Cultural Theory , the word \"risk\" has been removed from its older con- notation involving choice to a generalized notion of danger. Douglas notes: \"Risk\" is the probability of an event combined with the magnitude of thelosses and gains that it will entail. However, our political discoursedebases the word. From a complex attempt to reduce uncertainty it hasbecome a decorative flourish on the word \"danger.\" ( 1992,40) This association of danger with the sense of risk distanced the notion from issues of cultural understanding involved in weighing of gains and loss- es used in personal risk assessments. Risk activities (translated in Douglas'sterms as danger) tend to be seen in institutional terms as generalized, prede-termined, and unquestionable. Richard Stoffle et al., in writing about envi-ronmental risks, discuss this institutional imposition of risk estimation. Theynote: Often, the specialists who conduct these assessments believe their esti- mates reflect the \"real risks\" of a technology or project because the esti-mates derive from scientic calculations. These \"real risks\" typically arepresented through formal processes, such as public meetings, in whichinformation flows one way, from risk communicator to the public withlittle or no exchange of information between these two groups. ( 1991, 612) The emphasis on \"real risk activities\" as predetermined areas of danger framed risk assessment in etic, externally dened values and concerns; leaving emic, locally dened concerns out of the picture. Risk assessments which arebased on emic criteria focus on risk as it is perceived and evaluated by the laypublic. The tendency to ignore perceived risk as a valid component in theassessment of risk is based on the notion that perceived risks are neitherobjective nor scientically derived. The failure here is in not recognizing that allnotions of risk are cultur- ally constructed based on socially and culturally shaped concepts and statis- tics. Such a view is not intended to be nihilistic (arguing that there is norisk reality) but rather, social constructionist (arguing that concepts such as riskhave been constructed in such a way that they appear devoid of ideologicalcontent, and therefore are self-evident). Social constructionist theory\"assumes that social categories have been constructed through historical and130 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 130social processes . . . in such a way that the ideological and institutional inter- ests served by a particular construct are erased and the categories appear nat-ural\" (Patton 1994 ,4). Social constructionist theory lends itself easily to HIV research because the epidemic is worldwide while the bulk of research and policy comes fromthe West. The social constructionist questions the categories of epidemiologyattempting to demonstrate their culture-bound, political, or moralistic basisor examining their general applicability. In striking contrast to public healthrisk associations and \"prostitution,\" for example, Patton demonstrates: Evaluation of sex worker risk reduction projects suggest that women who sell sex are more likely to adopt prevention measures (especiallycondom use or avoidance of intercourse) than are women who simplyhave sex in the context of recreation, love, or other socially condonedsexual arrangements. But the strong separation between sex for hire andsex for \"love\" also results in a bifurcation of sex workers' risk reductionstrategies. Women who sell sex are more likely to engage in preventionbehaviors while having sex in the context of \"work\" than in their domes-tic relationships. ( 1994 ,53) The social constructionist argument is that risk categories are only made meaningful in social context and that the categorization systems must be ana- lyzed, not simply adopted. The Medical (Mis)Use of Ethnography Taking this approach, I intend in the remainder of this paper to examine theuses of ethnography in the medical construction of African AIDS risk cate-gories, represented in articles and letters found in a variety of medical researchjournals such as the Lancet, the British Medical Journal, Science , and the New England Journal of Medicine . Focusing on African \"high risk activities\" these articles use ethnographic information to foreground aspects of traditional culture, emphasizing the failure of Africans to adjust to the conditions ofWestern civilization. Heavily stereotyped and abstracted from social, histori-cal, or cultural context, these studies condemn traditional culture through anemphasis on the risks intrinsic to such practices as blood brotherhood, ritualscarication, and traditional healing techniques. By highlighting the dialogueon African risk, this chapter will attempt to outline and illustrate the speciccultural misunderstandings found in medical researchers' uses of ethno-graphic data, misunderstandings which allow research on risk to become adialogue on neocolonialism.Competing Logics and the Construction of Risk 131Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 131Although the medical use of ethnographic materials would seem to sug- gest a sensitivity toward locally constructed perceptions of risk, this is not the case. Ethnographic data\u2014the folklorist's guide to vernacular perception\u2014atthe hands of medical researchers appears to become grist for the \"real risk\"mill. Rather than being constructed as information to be used in weighinggains and losses or being measured statistically in terms of actual incidence ofinfection, the data is piled into the unexamined \"danger category\" suggestedby Douglas. The inclusion of ethnographic material in these danger areas,while problematic in that it is unweighed, unexamined, and not part of a dia-logue with the lay public, might still be an improvement over total ignoranceof cultural data, were it based on sound ethnography. The selection of ethno-graphic material, however, is a signicant part of the problem. Due in part to the demographic prole of the AIDS crisis, the greater awareness of medical consumerism, and the strengthening of voices in themedical humanities and social sciences, medical researchers are becomingincreasingly aware of the need to take account of cultural issues in health careand public health education. While this newfound awareness is commend-able, it points out problems intrinsic to unskilled collection and interpreta-tion of ethnographic data. Having received no training in the discursiveaspects of cultural representation, medical researchers generally are unable toweed out ethnographic accounts which are unsystematic, patchy, inaccurate,or incomplete, and do not recognize the problems inherent in materialswhich have been collected and interpreted in a context of condemnation.Unfortunately, using such data, they construct images of the diseased or \"atrisk\" cultural \"other,\" and in turn, produce their own seemingly authoritativeethnographic texts. African AIDS1 The literature on African risk for AIDS generated over the last fteen years isenormous. Most of this literature focuses on what are seen as two very differ-ent epidemiological patterns. \"Pattern One AIDS,\" found in the United Statesand Europe, affects largely the male population at a male to female ratio of 8 to 1. \"Pattern Two AIDS,\" found on the African continent, has a reported sex ratio of 1to 1(Hunt 1996, 1345). The contrast between Pattern One and Pattern Two epidemiologies has caused considerable comment on African paths oftransmission and risk factors. Further, while 10percent of the world's popula- tion lives in sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that about 55percent of per- sons with the HIV virus live there, including over 80percent of the world's seropositive women (Goldin 1994 ,1360). While estimates of prevalence of the132 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 132virus in Africa differ and while the worldwide AIDS statistics are constantly changing, it is clear that the magnitude of AIDS in Africa is signicant. Though the epidemiological statistics suggest heterosexual transmission in Africa, AIDS researchers and writers continually push for more exoticexplanations of African AIDS. 2Simon Watney notes: African AIDS must ...a l w a y s b e p r e s e n t e d a s s u i g e n e r i s ,a c o mpletely different disease from AIDS in the First World. Indeed, most commenta- tors have preferred almost any explanation of the 1:1AIDS ratio of men to women in most African countries other than that of heterosexualtransmission. (Watney 1990 ,96) Even when heterosexual transmission is granted as the major route of infection, the construction of risk takes a shape of \"otherness.\" In an article entitled \"Reassuring News about AIDS: A Doctor T ells Why Y ou May Not Beat Risk\" published in Cosmopolitan, Robert E. Gould writes: The data I gathered concerning heterosexual intercourse in Africa show marked differences from the way it is usually practiced in the UnitedStates ...M a n y m e n i n A f r ica take their women in a brutal way, so that some heterosexual activity regarded as normal by them would be closerto rape by our standards and therefore be likely to cause vaginal lacera-tions through which the AIDS virus could gain entry into the blood-stream. ( 1998,147) Although the Gould excerpt may appear easy to dismiss by virtue of its publication in a popular magazine, it is indicative of the wider medical pic- ture. A search through computerized medical indexes for articles on AIDS inAfrica betrays a widespread evolutionary paradigm. While AIDS researchersclearly recognize that African cultural beliefs and practices have to be account-ed for in any discussion of the disease and its African ramications, the beliefand practices which are discussed are stereotyped heavily and are abstractedfrom any kind of real context. Medical researchers of African birth are con-tinually writing in to the journals to head off overzealous Western researchersmaking uncontextualized pronouncements about African traditional life andculture. The following controversy, which took place in the letters and com-mentaries section of the Lancet in1987, is representative of these debates. The rst letter, entitled \"AIDS and the Witch Doctor,\" was printed as follows: Sir,\u2014The reassurance given by the Medical Acupuncture Society (May 30) about the risk of contracting AIDS is welcome. In Africa, however,the use of non-sterile instruments is widespread among witch doctors,who are often consulted initially by patients.Competing Logics and the Construction of Risk 133Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 133Many patients presenting to hospital with pain or swelling are seen with small lacerations over the affected area, indicating that the witch doctor has been at work. One patient recently seen with chest pain . . .had 150of these markings. Witch doctor induced gastrointestinal disorders are commonly seen in this hospital, but many psychiatric patients benet from seeing thewitch doctor. The methods of traditional healers are thought to be simi-lar throughout Africa, and in view of the huge population consultingsuch healers I suggest their name be added to the possible risk factors forthe transmission of HIV infection. (O'Farrell 1987,166) A response was published one month later, entitled \"AIDS and the African Healer\": Sir\u2014In rural Africa most people who feel ill rst consult traditionalhealers, herbalists or as Dr. O'Farrell calls them witch doctors, who oftenapply concoctions of herbs, roots, and leaves to skin that has been scari-ed around the suspected lesion. O'Farrell fears that through use of non-sterile instruments these traditional healers might contribute to thespread of AIDS in Africa. O'Farrell seems unfamiliar with the methods of traditional healers and the limited capability of HIV to survive outside the human organ-ism. For scarications only razor blades or similar cutting devises areused, never needles or other hollow instruments where blood might stayinactive for longer. It is very unusual for scarications to be done on sev-eral people one after another, the only way that might permit transmis-sion of HIV . In Tanzania a complete treatment by an herbalist takes20-60 minutes and by the time the razor blade is used again the retro- virus should be destroyed. (Schmutzhard 1987,459) As the second letter points out, the problem with much of the disinfor- mation about Africa and AIDS is a lack of proper contextualization. A piece of social data is simply matched with a risk category. Issues of sexuality were the focus of many of these articles and contro- versies, portraying African sexual practices based on questionable ethno- graphic information or taking a practice recorded at one place and time andgeneralizing it to the whole of African culture. Again from the Lancet, a med- ical researcher warned: In his book on the sexual life of people in the great Lakes area of Africa, Kashamura writes: \"to stimulate a man or a woman and induce them tointense sexual activity, monkey blood for a man or she-monkey bloodfor a woman was directly inoculated in the pubic area and also in thethighs and the back. These magic practices would therefore constitute an134 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 134efcient experimental transmission model and could be responsible for the emergence of AIDS in man. (Noireau 1987,1499 ) While the author of this article is to be commended for considering actual ethnographic studies of African life and culture in his commentary, the study he has chosen is based on observations reported in 1927 with no more recent data. The data is not given its proper historical context, but rather pre-sented as current practice. Geographical generalizations provide the same difculty. Africa is taken as one culture without variation over time and space. Little attention is paidto urban and rural differences, differences by district, or differences withinpopulations. Debates over female circumcision have focused on exactly thisissue. The journal Science published the following debate: The high incidence of AIDS among men and women in Africa has led to the suggestion that a different mode of transmission may be at work there.Colin Norman echoes this view in his summary of the internationalSymposium on African AIDS. In fact the spread of the disease among het-erosexuals in Africa and homosexuals in the West may point to a commonfactor in their sexual practices. Contact with blood during intercourse isthought to be largely responsible for the transmission of the virus amonghomosexuals in the United States. The same principle may apply to het-erosexuals in central Africa, where female circumcision is still a widespreadpractice. In its most extreme form referred to as inbulation, the operationconsists of the removal of some or all of the vulval tissue, after which thetwo sides of the wound are sewn together, leaving only a small opening forthe passage of urine and menstrual blood. Subsequent vaginal intercourseis therefore difcult if not impossible and is chronically associated with tis-sue damage, tears and bleeding. Anal intercourse is a common recourse forheterosexual partners ....U n d e r standing the pattern of AIDS in Africa will probably rst require understanding the cross cultural differences in sexualpractices. (Linke 1986, 203) It would appear that the author of this letter, anthropologist Uli Linke, has generalized the geographical context of the practice of inbulation. One of his colleagues responded: Uli Linke's letter about AIDS in Africa suggests that contact with blood during intercourse may be an indirect consequence of the African prac-tice of female circumcision. It then describes an extreme and rare formof female circumcision\u2014inbulation. Inbulation is found only in a partof Northeastern Africa outside the region where AIDS has been reportedand is very different in its social and biological effects from the kind offemale circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa. A secondaryCompeting Logics and the Construction of Risk 135Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 135problem with the logic of hypothesizing that AIDS is transmitted by tra- ditional custom is that in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban dis-ease, as it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as femalecircumcision have their origins in the rural sector. I think it would bemost productive to look at data pertaining to life in African cities and toexamine such phenomena as male labor migration, often described asbeing disruptive to marriage and family life. (Burton 1986 ,1236) In relation to the geographical generalization of African AIDS issues, Simon Watney argues: . . . the specic character-istics of the different AIDS epidemics in these countries, constructingthem in the spurious unity of an \"Africa\" which is immediately deniedany of the cultural, social, economic, and ethnic diversity which is takenfor granted in Europe and North and South America.\" (Watney 1990 ,94) What is clear from the literature on Africa and AIDS is that much of the data which is used to describe cultural practices takes a part of the story and confuses it with the whole. AIDS researchers in Africa, knowing that they aredealing with a very different lifestyle, have gone looking through the ethno-graphic data for cases of \"risky behavior.\" In this sense the literature searchesout the deviant and uses it to understand the health needs of the entire culture.Reports are taken at face value, with little thought given to how the data wascollected, by whom, and under what circumstances. The researchers do not recognize that ethnographic data, like scientic data, is not all methodologi- cally sound. One must understand the methodological orientation before adopting it as a source of factual information. Much of the data used in thesediscussions were originally collected and interpreted in a context of condem-nation, emphasizing the failure of Africans to adjust to the conditions ofWestern society. The data tend to be patchy and unsystematic in nature, and yetthe health and lives of an entire country are being tied to its implications. Thedata exclude the less exotic, more mundane sexual behaviors and by so doingtarget the unusual for health education efforts and health development policy. But another problem with the portrayal of African sexual culture in this literature has to do with the issue of how normalcy, deviance, and risk aredened. Prostitution, said to be widespread in African culture, is frequentlydened in the medical literature as sexual exchange with a monetary compo-nent (Packard and Epstein 1991), but clearly the risks of such an exchange are based on the numbers of partners and on the practice of unsafe sex. Awoman, paid by one man who is only sexually active with her, would accord-ing to such denitions still be classied as a prostitute. While such a case may136 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 136seem unlikely, it points to the more widespread limitations of risk involved with prostitutes who service a small regular cliental versus those who engagein such services with an unknown larger public. Clearly the risks are differ-ent, perhaps indicating one of the reasons why urban populations must bedealt with differently than rural populations. Cross-cultural researchers needto consider the issue of what counts as equivalent phenomena. The well- known association of African sexuality with polygamy is a good example.While polygamous relationships do increase the number of partners one has,the assumption, seen regularly in the medical literature, that polygamy con-stitutes promiscuity, is unjustiable. While numbers of partners exceed thoseconsidered the norm in Western society, individuals are not necessarily activeoutside of those relationships, and such activities do not in themselves con-stitute a risk. Folk Culture as Risk I am not suggesting here that such risk behaviors do not occur or that they arenot potential avenues for HIV infection, but I am suggesting that medical evi-dence concerning AIDS in Africa has been constructed to t preexistingnotions about African sexuality and disease, and to t preexisting notions ofthe exoticism of traditional cultures. Western research on AIDS had alreadydened AIDS as a behavioral problem associated with \"aberrant\" lifestyles;perhaps this provided a predisposition to looking for deviance in an Africansetting. The result, however, is a discourse which privileges those patterns ofsocial intercourse suggesting that Africans have multiple sexual partners orinject monkey blood, and excludes from discussion the broader patterns ofsexuality found on a day-to-day basis. This search for the exotic invariably leads medical researchers to folklore and particularly customary practice. In Africa, risk becomes associated withtraditional healing, children's games, and initiations such as those associatedwith blood brotherhood. Daniel B. Hrdy writes in Review of Infectious Diseases: Factors thought to influence sexual transmission in Africa include 1) promiscuity, with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases; 2) sexual practices that have been associated with increased risk of trans- mission of HIV (homosexuality and anal intercourse); and 3) cultural practices that are possibly connected with increased virus transmission(female circumcision and inbulation). Other nonsexual cultural practicesthat do not t the age distribution pattern of AIDS but may expose indi-viduals to HIV include 1) practices resulting in exposure to blood (medici- nal bloodletting, rituals establishing blood brotherhood and possibly ritualCompeting Logics and the Construction of Risk 137Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 137and medicinal enemas; 2) practices involving the use of shared instru- ments (injection of medicines, ritual scarication, group circumcision, genital tattooing and shaving of body hair; and 3) contact with nonhuman primates. ( 1987, 1109- 10) The discussion of African AIDS and risk is part of an authoritative and sophisticated medical discourse of control and exclusion, which uses folklore as an index to socialization and traditional culture as a flag of physical danger. Thenew wrapping paper on this old evolutionary argument, though, is outwardlybiomedical and scientic and, as such, passes for nonideological and neutral. Central to the perception of African health issues is the evolutionary image of the \"primitive native\" making a difcult adjustment to conditions ofa \"civilized\" industrial world. The development discourse of which this is apart is much older than the battle with AIDS. In 1963 the director of Kenyan medical services stated: The African in his rural setting is strictly bound by tribal patterns of behavior, beliefs and customs. He is an integral part of his communityand his thinking tends to be communal ....W ith the transposition to the town he forsakes the communal life for an individualistic life, unsupport-ed by tribal rules and regulations. While forsaking these supports, he isnot yet ready to adopt the codes and rules which have brought social sta-bility to western civilizations. Furthermore, he is abandoning ingrainedcenturies of agricultural and pastoral tradition and learning the technicalskills of an industrial world quite strange to him. (Fendell 1963, 574) What is perhaps most interesting about the concentration on exotic tribal customs of the natives is that while tribal life is seen as uncivilized and risky, it is simultaneously discussed as protective and constrained. The dilem-ma is fascinating. One researcher indicated: As people leave rural villages and migrate to urban areas, the general level of promiscuity increases. This increase may be attributable in partto the relaxation of traditional village values ....( H r d y 1987,1112) Risk Reduction What I have presented here is meant neither to oppose the efforts of those researchers attempting to slow the rate of HIV infection in Africa, nor to attackthe attempts made to allow for the consideration of cultural issues in AIDS edu-cation and policy making. Quite the reverse is true. It is meant, however, to argue that shoving health care workers in the direction of ethnographic material is not138 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 138enough. We must raise awareness of the need to understand the methodologies of cultural study and their radical impact on health issues. Understanding sexu-al and cultural issues cannot be a process of deviance seeking or risk seeking. Itmust be a process of investigating a range of cultural issues which bear on sexu-al behavior, a range which may include marriage, divorce, kinship, fertility beliefs,initiation rites, gender roles, child rearing, and so on. But it must also be a processof trying to understand not just the exotic, but also the mundane. We must, as health researchers and as social scientists, place more value on the subtleties of ethnographic research. Is the data contextualized histori-cally, geographically, or in terms of groups and subgroups? What are the polit-ical, social, and economic ideologies which motivated ethnographiccollection? Is a part of a behavioral complex being taken for the whole? Is cul-tural difference being taken to constitute danger or commanding a focuswhich obscures more pervasive mundane threats? Are very different types ofhealth behavior with different degrees of risk being assumed to constituteequivalent phenomena? More to the point, we must involve the lay public in the identication of risk, if for no other reason than to have them articulate community percep- tions . At worst, such information could provide public health needs analysis. At best, it could indicate a whole new set of unknown risks or put to rest thosebased on exoticism. We should not lose track of the special skills which are required in the treatment of cultural information. Without those skills, epidemiology maybecome neocolonialist ideology and risk might become what we take when westeer physicians in the direction of ethnography. Dressed up as biomedicineand couched in a discourse of risk, even colonialist ethnography passes forneutral and nonideological. Notes 1. The phrase \"African AIDS\" is intended here to refer to the discursive construc- tion of AIDS in Africa. Simon Watney ( 1990 ) cites Cindy Patton as initially coining the phrase in \"Inventing African AIDS\" ( 1988). 2. Simon Watney notes: As a cultural and psychic construction, \"African AIDS\" exhibits at least ve consistent aspects. First, it speaks of a peculiar and special afnitybetween a virus and a continent. Second, it reads the modes of transmis-sion of HIV as signs of a generalized and homogenous African \"primi-tiveness\" whether sexual or medical. Third, it singles out the allegedCompeting Logics and the Construction of Risk 139Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 139\"misreporting\" of African HIV and AIDS statistics as further evidence of \"backwardness\" and \"unreliability.\" Fourth, it equates black Africans andWestern gay men as willful \"perverts\" who are equally threatening to\"family values.\" Fifth, it regards \"Africa\" as the source of the HIV infec-tion in the sense of origin and of cause .(1990 ,94) References Burton, M. 1986 .

Clements the10August 1997 issue of the Westchester Weekly , a section of the Sunday New York Times , includes an article entitled \"Prayer Group in Patterson Follows Rituals of Indian Purifying\" (Fullam 1997). The piece recounts the use of the Lakota Indian sweat lodge ritual accompanied by a \"drum ceremony\" adapted from the Micmacs by a group of suburbanites who call themselves the\"Red Road.\" Though some of the participants state that they have been adopt-ed by Native American families, \"the closest thing to an actual American Indianin the group\" is a person of Italian and Shoshone descent (the latter four gener-ations removed) who studied with Ed McGaa, a Lakota spiritual leader whoworks with participants in contemporary alternative spirituality. The group,who share such common problems as \"divorce, addictions, [and] grandchildrenthrust on us in our later years\" which the Christianity into which they wereenculturated does not effectively address, sweats once a week and operates outof White Buffalo, a craft shop run by a woman of Greek-Portuguese descent.The Times reporter notes the effects of their participation in the sweat lodge experience: \"While all members claimed to have had changes in their personallives as a result of their American Indian spiritual practices, some also claimedmore awareness in their political lives,\" especially in regard to issues affectingNative Americans. The location of the Red Road sweat lodge, though, is keptsecret out of fear of reprisals from Native Americans who object to non-Indians\"co-opting\" their ceremonies. The use of American Indian ceremonies for heal-ing and other spiritual ends in Westchester County represents a practice whoseroots go back to the beginning of contact between Europeans and their prede-cessors in the Western Hemisphere. But it has grown exponentially during thelast decade or so, often associated with protocols of alternative spirituality which /ornament21 143/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 143are usually placed under the general rubric \"new age.\"1Accounts of sweat lodge use, for example, abound in literature by and about adherents of alternative spirituality. One person has written of her experience at a sweat ceremony at aUnitarian Universalist retreat and camp in western Massachusetts (Fairclough1992); paying guests at the Open Spoke Ranch near Stillwater, Oklahoma, canenjoy the experience of sweat lodge hot tubs (Lee 1995, 254); the sweat lodge experience is among the amenities offered to guests who stay at some vegetari-an-oriented bed and breakfast hostelries (Ryan 1996); students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute can participate in the sweat lodge as part of a programcalled \"Passages\" (Gose 1996); and the \"exciting week\" offered by the Sunrise Retreat Center of Rimrock, Arizona, begins with a sweat lodge. 2Examples could be multiplied on end, but the Westchester County example can be consideredsomewhat paradigmatic of the current popularity of sweat lodge ceremonial-ism: its association with a commercially oriented arts and crafts venture, theapparent lack of involvement of people with primary cultural roots in NativeAmerican societies, its eclectic borrowing of procedures from different Indianethnic groups, the experience's impact for participants on both personal andsocial levels, and the recognition that Indians may be uncomfortable\u2014to thepoint of vaguely conceived \"reprisals\"\u2014with the adoption and adaptation oftraditional spiritual customs by cultural outsiders. Or consider the testimonial of Colin Pringle regarding his rst sweat lodge, which took place at a 1979 Rainbow Gathering. Led by a \"Native American medicine man\" named Medicine Story, the ritual involved abouthalf a dozen participants. After they had entered the dome-shaped structureand heated rocks had been placed in a pit in the middle of the lodge,Medicine Story said a few words \"to help center the energy\" while the otherpeople chanted. Pringle reports that the couple of hours spent in the lodgeproduced sensations \"like being in an isolation tank.\" While the sweat lodgeis communal in contrast to the solitary isolation tank, \"both experiences tendto give you the we are all one feeling that LSD is known to produce.\" Thelodge has its risks. The intense heat requires the same kind of consciousnessalteration needed for coal-walking, Pringle avers. But the result is \"a spiritu-al boost.\" He testies to the immediately positive effects that his rst experi-ence produced: Like other forms of meditation, it clears your mind of all the worries, fears and other distractions of everyday life, and it works without drugsor expensive equipment like isolation tanks or bio-feedback equipment.It's such a simple ritual, yet it's so powerful. I think it gave me the energyto get through a mishap that happened the next day, when I accidentlyconsumed more LSD than I would have liked. 3144 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 144What are students of alternative healing methodologies to make of the Westchester County use of the sweat lodge and of this account, which (except for its references to LSD) represents the experiences of a number of non-Indians who have participated in the sweat lodge? On one hand, glowinglypositive testimonials by sweat lodge leaders as well as by satised participantsappear in a variety of books and articles, on the internet, and in oral tradition.These accounts suggest that for people seeking alternatives to mainline reli-gion and medicine, the sweat lodge seems to be lling some real needs. But atthe same time, many traditional Native Americans and individuals who per-ceive themselves as their spokespersons see new age uses of the sweat lodgeand other manifestations of Native American spirituality as another instanceof the ve-hundred-year-old appropriation of things Indian by Europeansand Euro-Americans. The purpose here is not to assume sides in what is anoften passionate, sometimes acrimonious debate. Instead, I am concernedwith the \"logics\" that inform the use of the sweat lodge outside its original cul-tural contexts as a method for healing in the broadest sense of that term forpeople who have turned to spiritual and medical alternatives to making them-selves and their environment whole. Ceremonial sweating may be the most widely known ritual healing practice in native North America. The earliest contact documents report theuse of sweat baths for hygienic and therapeutic purposes, sometimes for spe-cic ailments but often as a general cure-all. Not conned to any ethnic groupor culture area, sweating occurred among native communities in virtuallyevery part of the continent (Vogel 1970, 254-57). Methods of administering sweat baths varied, of course, as did the degree to which the practice had spir-itual signicance. The approach to sweating that has exerted the most influ-ence in contemporary alternative spirituality is that of the Lakota of thenorthern Plains, probably because of the influence of Joseph Epes Brown'sbook The Sacred Pipe (1953; Bucko 1998,51-53), which presents a detailed description of the Lakota sweat lodge ritual, or inipi , recorded from the Oglala Lakota spiritual leader Nicholas Black Elk. The reputation that Black Elkdeveloped as a result of John G. Neihardt's poetic presentation of his life his-tory in Black Elk Speaks , which has enjoyed considerable popularity since the 1960s especially in the new age movement, undoubtedly contributed to theforegrounding of Lakota ceremonialism in alternative spirituality. Moreover,the high visibility of two Lakota spiritual practitioners, Wallace Black Elk (aspiritual, though not genealogical descendant of Nicholas Black Elk) and EdMcGaa (Eagle Man), has contributed to the prominence of the Lakota versionof the sweat lodge. The popular reception of Richard Erdoes's treatment of thelife history of John Fire Lame Deer is another relevant factor. Undoubtedly,The New Age Sweat Lodge 145Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 145the Lakota prominence in popular culture images of the generic \"Indian\" must be taken into account as well. Considerable variation characterizes even Lakota sweating; in fact, the more punctilious a sweat lodge leader is about the exactness of procedures,the more likely he or she has derived knowledge of those procedures from newage publications rather than traditional Lakota sources. In general terms,though, the ceremony does follow a standardized pattern. The venue for theceremony is a dome-shaped structure, whose frame usually consists of pliablesaplings secured into the earth and bent together. A single door may be direc-tionally oriented toward either east or west. The sweat lodge (sometimes sim-ply referred to as a \"sweat,\" also a term for the ceremony itself) is covered withhides, blankets, tarpaulins, or plastic. The object is to capture and retain asmuch heat and to exclude as much light as possible. The sweat lodge may bea relatively permanent structure; leaders, both traditional Lakota and new age,may have lodges erected in their backyards. Often, though, participants will beexpected to assist in constructing a lodge for a particular sweat, the resultbeing a structure that is disassembled as soon as the ceremony concludes. The ceremonial leader or an assistant heats rocks on a re built outside the lodge (hence the alternate term \"stone-people lodge\"). Some ceremonial-ists insist that a certain number of rocks be heated, while others make no spe-cic recommendations. Igneous rocks of some sort (\"lava rocks\") are thoughtto be best for ceremonial purposes. Meanwhile, participants enter the lodge bycrawling through the door perhaps after an introductory ritual involving anoffering of tobacco smoke. Traditionally, sweat lodge ceremonies seem to havebeen segregated by gender, in which cases the participants entered the lodgenaked. In the mixed sweats that occur among participants in contemporaryalternative spirituality, men and women are likely to wear bathing suits orother light garb. Participants position themselves around a central indentation in the earth into which the re tender introduces some of the heated rocks. Waterpoured over the rocks produces steam which begins to heat the darkenedenclosure. As the temperature builds, the leader may intone a prayer to Wakantanka, Tunkashila, Mother Earth, or another animatistic deity. Each partici-pant will have his or her turn at prayer, which both traditionally and in newage contexts often begins with the Lakota phrase Mit\u00e1kuye oy\u00e1s' (all my rela- tives). Prayers may be for personal needs, though the community (dened asranging from the immediate reference group to the cosmos in general) usual-ly receives some attention. After a period of time, the door of the lodge will beopened and participants given the chance to drink some water. The processmay be repeated for several rounds (or \"endurances\"), four being a frequent146 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 146number. Often sage is sprinkled over the heated stones, and a pipe lled with tobacco is passed among the participants.4 Europeans apparently adopted Native American practices of sweating for medicinal purposes very soon after contact. Several early accounts by mis-sionaries and explorers report the authors' participation in or observation ofthe ceremony. An example appears in the work of Moravian missionary JohnHeckewelder, whose 1819 account of the Lenni Lenape (Delawares) continues to receive high marks for its ethnographic value. In a chapter entitled \"Remedies,\" Heckewelder notes, \"The sweat oven is the rst thing that anIndian has recourse to when he feels the least indisposed; it is the place towhich the wearied traveller, hunter, or warrior looks for relief from thefatigues he has endured, the cold he has caught, or the restoration of his lostappetite\" (1819 ,225). The missionary provides a fairly good description of pro- cedures in the \"oven\" and more to the present purpose offers the followingaccount of its use by a Euro-American: In the year 1784, a gentleman whom I had been acquainted with at Detroit, and who had been for a long time in an inrm state of health, came from thence to the village of the Christian Indians on the Huronriver, in order to have the benet of the sweat oven. It being the middle of winter, when there was a deep snow on the ground, and the weatherwas excessively cold, I advised him to postpone his sweating to a warmerseason; but he persisting in his resolution, I advised him by no means toremain in the oven longer that fteen or at most twenty minutes. Butwhen he once was in it, feeling himself comfortable, he remained a fullhour, at the end of which he fainted, and was brought by two strongIndians to my house, in very great pain and not able to walk. Heremained with me until the next day, when we took him down in hissleigh to his family at Detroit. His situation was truly deplorable; hisphysicians at that place gave up all hopes of his recovery, and he fre-quently expressed his regret that he had not followed my advice.Suddenly, however, a change took place for the better, and he not onlyrecovered his perfect health, but became a stout corpulent man, so thathe would often say, that his going into the sweat oven was the best thinghe had ever done in his life for the benet of his health. ( 1819,226-27) Heckewelder encountered the man fteen years later, when he claimed to have suffered no illness at all in the interim. He died \"at an advanced age,\" some thirty years after his sweating experience ( 1819, 227). Similar accounts can be gleaned from such sources as Heckewelder: occasional instances of Europeans or Euro-Americans who enjoy relief from some ailment as a result of ceremoni-al sweating. These seem, though, to be isolated cases and exemplify individualsThe New Age Sweat Lodge 147Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 147who were willing to take advantage of any available curative procedures. T o my knowledge, in early accounts one does not encounter attempts to spread the useof the sweat lodge beyond the immediate community. That is just what began to happen in the 1970s with the emergence of new age consciousness. Some alternative religious communities during the1960s may have adopted the sweat lodge into their ceremonial agendas, butone does not hear of widespread new age use until the next decade whenexamples such as those reported at the beginning of this essay become moreand more commonplace. The period also marks the emerging visibility ofNative American (often Lakota) promoters of their indigenous spirituality (ormodied versions thereof) to non-Indian populations. Commentators on new age spirituality have noted the eclecticism and volatility of the \"movement.\" During the quarter-century or so that has passedsince alternative spirituality emerged into the mainline, various points ofstress have become foregrounded and then receded to a less visible position asnew emphases replace them. While the 1970s were marked by an emphasis on Eastern religions, especially those from India, and on the methodology ofchanneling spiritual entities from the past, more recently environmental con-cerns have come to the fore and spiritual agendas adapted from nativeAmerica and the Celtic cultures of northern Europe have received increasedattention (Lewis 1992 ,10). This does not mean that these emphases have not always been a part of contemporary alternative spirituality, just that fluctua-tions in prominence have occurred. For example, The Teachings of Don Juan (Castaneda 1968) has been an influence on alternative spirituality virtually since its publication, but Native Americana did not become one of the promi- nent new age themes until about a decade later. While sweat lodge ceremoni- alism adopted from Lakota and other American Indian groups may have beenconducted in new age contexts thirty years ago, now they have become ratherstandard features of new age spiritual experiences. The emergence of guressuch as Vincent La Duke, Ed McGaa, Jamie Sams, and Wallace Black Elk asostensible guides for non-Indians into Native American spirituality hadbrought the sweat lodge (and other adapted Native American ceremonies)into prominence by the 1980 s. La Duke, a Chippewa who used the name \"Sun Bear\" in his role as spiritual leader, focused much of his attention on orient-ing followers (members of what he called the \"Bear Tribe\") with the cosmicforces of earth using the medicine wheel. In the Bear Tribe, the sweat lodgeoffers individuals an opportunity to undergo ritual purication before themedicine wheel ceremonies. 5McGaa (a Lakota who is also called \"Eagle Man\") works with a \"Rainbow Tribe,\" whose membership extends to non- Indians. His earth-oriented spirituality adapts the seven rites which Nicholas148 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 148Black Elk had described to Brown in The Sacred Pipe so that the focus will be upon environmental consciousness and so that their accessibility will extend to non-Indians. Less coherent in polity than the others, Wallace Black Elk nev-ertheless sees the sweat lodge as part of what \"Earth People\" should be doingin order to reestablish their harmony with the earth. The work of these ceremonial leaders has engendered some vociferous responses, and the new age sweat lodge because of its prominence has receivedspecial attention from critics, most of whom are either Indians or personssympathetic to traditional Indian cultures. Though the reaction of someNative Americans to the use of the sweat lodge by non-Indians in the new agemovement has been indifferent or even sometimes favorable, a vocal group ofspokespersons has been adamantly opposed to what they consider appropria-tion of Indian spirituality by non-Indians\u2014hence, the perceived need to con-ceal the location of their sweats by the Red Road group in Westchester County,New Y ork. Many have extended their criticism especially to other Indians suchas Wallace Black Elk and Ed McGaa who have been responsible for introduc-ing new agers to the sweat lodge and other manifestations of Native Americanspirituality. The principal charges involve the \"selling\" of Indian ceremonies\u2014that is, the fact that some practitioners, Indian and non-Indian, charge fees forconducting the sweat lodge (Shaw 1995, 86). The website for the Earth Circle Association's sweat lodge (www.sn.com/org/earthcircle/sweatlodge.html)suggests that participants make \"a donation comparable to a doctors [ sic] visit\" to defray ceremonial expenses and \"to the support of the ceremonialleader.\" Frequently, though, according to critics, those leaders have little in theway of traditional credentials or claims to expertise. While Euro-Americanswho lead sweats almost invariably claim to have received instruction andauthorization from a tribal teacher, many traditionalists hold that assuming aleadership role requires that one have previously participated in other Lakotaceremonies such as the Sun Dance or at least have the ability to speak Lakota(Bucko 1998,64,102). Those who fail these tests lack the \"conrmation of the [traditional Indian] community\" for their role as spiritual leader (Hobson1979,106). They are, in the frequently cited words of Ward Churchill, one of the leading critics of the new age movement's use of things Indian, \"plasticmedicine men\" ( 1996, 355-65) whose principal motivation is nancial. But criticisms extend to issues more fundamental than commercialism and credentialing. For one thing, critics argue that the sweat lodge has mean-ing only within a larger religious context\u2014that of Lakota or other specicallytribal spirituality (St. Pierre and Long Soldier 1995,35,207). There is indeed a tendency to \"mix and match\" elements of various Native American religiousThe New Age Sweat Lodge 149Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 149systems as if they together comprised a coherent whole (Bell 1997), a process exemplified by the use of Lakota and Micmac ceremonialism by the Westchester County Red Road group. For another instance, the \"Seven DayNative American Spiritual Journey\" offered by the Sunrise Retreat Center ofArizona offers not only the sweat lodge (using the Lakota term inipi to refer to the experience), but also the \"Cherokee and Navajo Prayer Way.\" 6Extracting the sweat lodge from its traditional context, argue critics, renders it meaning-less and perhaps even dangerous. New agers who enter the sweat lodge withoutperceiving it as part of a larger ceremonial continuum trivialize the experience,and that has ramications for the very real role that the sweat lodge is playingin the revival of traditional spirituality. Sweats have come to gure into situa-tions of crisis which contemporary Native Americans face. They play a role intreatments for dependency, for example, and prisons with signicant NativeAmerican populations have sometimes provided sweat lodges as part of theirrehabilitation programs (Farnsworth 1996 ; Johnson 1997). New agers \"playing Indian\" by entering the sweat lodge undercut the power of the sweat lodgeexperience for Native Americans who are trying to come to terms with theirown cultural identity, a nebulous view of which may contribute to drug abuseand criminal behavior. For Lakota and some other Indians, the sweat lodge hasa role in cultural identity similar to that of the sauna among Finnish Americans(Lockwood 1977). Consequently, its use by people from other ethnicities seemsinappropriate. According to Cynthia R. Kasee, While the \"franchising\" of Indian religions would deal a death blow to cultures practiced collectively by Native people, the loss of group identi-ty conveyed by these faiths would devastate those who also rely on themas the Red Road to recovery. If Indian religions can be bought by anydilettante with a credit card, they lose their ability to require commit-ment, reform, and dimunition of ego. In other words, the practicingIndian Traditionalist is the antithesis of the Ramada Inn SweatlodgeYuppie. (1995, 86) According to this view, the new age sweat lodge is but another instance of Euro-American theft from Native Americans, part of a continuing pattern that began with land and continues through spirituality. Religious historianMartin E. Marty has characterized the behavior of what he calls \"Bouldertypes\" (from the Colorado city that is a locus for much new age activity) who\"believe that they can and should jump out of their cultural skin and can sim-ply take over the elements of the 'other.' They will do thus at whatever cost tothe integrity of the borrowed-from, or stolen-from\" ( 1994 ,564). A suggestion frequently made by critics of the new age use of Native American spirituality150 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 150is that Euro-Americans in search of spiritual fulllment should instead explore the mystical tradition of Western Christianity (Shaw 1995, 89). Critics also note the physical distress\u2014on a few occasions to the point of fatality\u2014that has sometimes affected non-Indians who are unprepared forthe intense heat and potentially claustrophobic atmosphere of a sweat(D'Antonio 1992,55). The spiritual powers which the sweat invokes may also be too much for the uninitiated to handle. Finally, new age use of the sweat lodge is perceived by Native American critics as being too oriented to individual interest in self-actualization. Whensuch ceremonialism occurs within the context of contemporary alternativespirituality, participants tend to downplay the community orientation thatgures into traditional enactments. Christopher Jocks has noted, \"Typically,practices that seem to involve 'mystical' individual experiences are promoted,while other elements considered equally or more important by Native partic-ipants are ignored: elements such as kinship obligations, hard work, suffering,and the sometimes crazy realities of everyday reservation life\" ( 1996, 418). The tendency has been to use Indianness as represented in borrowed ceremoniesas a way of nding \"personal solutions to the question of living the good life\"(Deloria 1998,174). My failure to evaluate and then either to endorse or refute these criti- cisms does not necessarily mean that I agree or disagree with them. 7My pur- pose here is to note their existence before exploring the context of the use of the Lakota sweat lodge in contemporary alternative spirituality. That contextlies in a healing logic that involves historical precedent both in terms of therole of sweating in Western medicine and the contact relationships betweenNative Americans and Europeans and in the general new age search for per-sonal fulllment and for a sense of holistic community. Indeed, the new age use of the Lakota sweat lodge constitutes an instance in a recurrent phenomenon in the contact history of Indians and Europeans, the incorporation of cultural material from the former into thebelief and behavioral systems of the latter\u2014what is dismissively referred to as\"playing Indian\" for purposes of revelry and rebellion, of assertion of a dis-tinctly Euro-American identity and artistic inspiration, of ecological sensitiv- ity and spiritual renewal (Deloria 1998). One impetus for that incorporation came from the economics of survival: the Indians had already adopted suc-cessful lifestyle strategies to the environments into which Europeans wereintruding. Incorporating at least some native hunting, gathering, and horti-cultural techniques made practical sense. On the medical front, the inclusionof Indian pharmacopeia into European-based healing systems also madesense, as the plants and other natural substances from which palliatives mightThe New Age Sweat Lodge 151Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 151be derived were often unfamiliar to new arrivals. This inclusion contributed to the use of Native American imagery in the promotion of patent medicinesduring the nineteenth century. The \"Indian medicine show,\" in fact, enduredas late as into the 1970s. The technique was to advertise a product, largely con- sisting of alcohol, by connecting it by name with a Native American origin andby association with the show's performers, who donned Indian costume andsang and danced in what were perceived as Indian rhythms (Green 1988,40). The contemporary image of the Indian as healer in new age contexts has ample historical precedent, but the persistent presence of Indian influences inEuro-American life, long after adjustments to European lifeways had madethem adaptive to the \"New World,\" suggests something that transcends the pro-saically practical. Much has been written about the attraction of the \"primitive\"to people jaded by the articialities of Western civilization (for example,T orgovnick 1990). The discovery of Indians in the Americas by Columbus and his successors revealed real people to whom the idealized concept of the primi-tive could be attached. Though an anti-image which equated savagery with bes-tiality was often concurrent, one prevailing image of the American nativescharacterized them as representing what all of mankind had once been: natural philosophers, living in harmony and at ease with their environment. This con-cept of the \"noble savage,\" which may have rst been connected with AmericanIndians by Montaigne, had a particular appeal for the Enlightenment andromantic philosophies which contributed to the formative moments in theAmerican republican experience. In broad outline, the ethical aspects of thenoble savage concept for overcivilized humanity held that a person who hadbecome enervated by the unnecessary complexities of the institutions ofEuropean-derived society could experience physical, intellectual, and spiritualregeneration by learning from the Indian (Slotkin 1973). Based on generations of living close to a specic tract of earth, the Indian as noble savage intuitivelysensed the higher truths of existence. While one should avoid the excesses ofunbridled license that could emerge in the savage state (especially among peo-ple for whom that state was something adopted after already being corrupted bycivilized articiality), a person could become healthily harmonious with thecosmos by learning from an Indian. A common gure in American literatureand popular culture is the Indian \"sidekick\" who provides a Euro-Americanprotagonist with the spiritual (and often other) support needed to become fullyhuman. Chingachgook plays this role in classic American literature for NattyBumppo, for example, as does T onto for the Lone Ranger in more recent expres-sive culture. Particularly relevant to new age spirituality is a reading ofCastaneda's The Teachings of Don Juan that places it within this tradition: the Y aqui shaman as guide for the spiritual maturation of the young Western152 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 152anthropologist (Clements 1985). That new agers, disgruntled with the mainline Judeo-Christian heritage and already opened to alternatives by their contacts with Eastern religious influences, would nd native Americana attractive seemsinevitable. Not only do Indian cultures offer a primitivistic answer to the over-civilization that may be responsible for new age anomie, but they do so from anAmerican perspective. One need not turn to the exotic East\u2014for spiritualitycoming from those who have spoken for the \"spirit of the continent,\" in D. H.Lawrence's words (quoted in Deloria 1998, 3), has roots in this portion of Mother Earth. Those who are dissatised with what the mainstream offers canturn to a source of autochthonous spirituality and cite many precursors inEuro-American-Native American contact history for doing so. That new agers are concerned about establishing a spiritual identity with American roots is evident in the claims made by some Euro-American partic-ipants in contemporary alternative spirituality that they had, in fact, beenNative Americans in previous lives (Bucko 1998,230-31; Smith 1991). They consequently justify their use of spiritual and healing procedures such as thesweat lodge by asserting that they are reclaiming what was once their propercultural inheritance. Of course, other Indian ceremonials besides the sweatlodge can and are being reinterpreted by new agers, but none to the extent ofthe Lakota sweat lodge. This spiritually based healing ritual has several advan-tages: unlike a Navajo sing, it is relatively easy to conduct and it requires littlein the way of specialized ritual paraphernalia; unlike the vision quest, it can beextracted from its distinctive spiritual context and introduced into a variety ofnew age and even mainstream Judeo-Christian environments (as well as intosecular contexts); unlike the Sun Dance, it does not call for intense and painfulsacricial commitment; and it does have some forerunners as a healing pro-cedure in Western medicine. Though mainstream medicine now regards sweating primarily in terms of its role in regulating body temperature, this physiological process has a longhistory as a puricatory and healing procedure in the Western tradition.Humoralism, for instance, which advocated a holistic approach to preventingand responding to disease, made use of sweating as one way of regulating thebalance between such physiological states as moist and dry, hot and cold.Hildegard of Bingen, a twelfth-century religious whose writings on a medicinegrounded in humoralism have been enjoying a revival of interest in the 1990s, recommended steam baths for corpulent individuals, \"since the humors that are superfluous in them are controlled and lessened\" (Flanagan 1996, 117-18;s e e Malpezzi, this volume). She also advised those suffering from arthritis andlameness as well as from various psychological imbalances to take baths inwhich the steam had been sweetened with extracts from chestnuts or oatsThe New Age Sweat Lodge 153Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 153(Strehlow and Hertzka 1988, 110-11). But while it may have fallen from favor as a purifying mechanism in mainstream Euro-American medicine, folk medi- cine continues to endorse the benecial effects of sweating. In addition to thegeneral folk idea that sweating is good for a person and that one who sweatsprofusely in response to exertion or intense heat is demonstrating a normal,healthy reaction (Hand, Casetta, and Thiederman 1981, 258)\u2014an idea support- ed by contemporary exercise physiologists (for example, Bailey 1994, 218-19)\u2014 sweating receives specic recommendation as a way of breaking a fever.Plant-based folk medicine suggests a variety of teas (such as corn pone or wil-low bark) as a way of inducing sweating for that purpose (Hand 1961, 188,191). Tying red onions to the feet and rubbing the body with warm vinegar will alsoproduce a fever-breaking sweat (Hand 1961, 189). Other ailments for which folk medical practitioners have endorsed sweating include cramps and neuralgia(Hand 1961, 163,239). Regardless of the role that sweating has played in the therapeutic her- itage of the West and of the history of borrowing from American Indians byEuropeans and Euro-Americans, the new age movement would not have beenattracted to the sweat lodge if it did not serve the ends of alternative spiritu-ality. The roots of the new age lie principally in Western adaptations ofEastern religions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. As other sources ofspirituality that are compatible with the ways in which new agers have usedthose religious traditions have become known, they have become part of themovement. One important focus of new age spirituality has been on thetransformative nature of religious experience. For the individual, this meansgrowth, continual learning, and a movement toward holistic perfectionism(Lewis 1992). T estimonials about the sweat lodge experience indicate that it has a role in accomplishing these goals. T o begin with, some participants stressthat the sweat may be part of a regimen of physical healing: \"Any illness thatneeds to be sweated out is so done in the sweat lodge\" (Lee 1995, 54). Adolph Hungry Wolf, who was popularizing Native American traditions several yearsbefore the dawn of the new age, noted about \"sweat bathing\": \"The expulsionof dirt and germs through profuse sweating literally causes the removal of evilfrom the body\" ( 1973, 24). The role of sweating in physical healing coincides with the Western notions that the process cleanses the body of toxic sub-stances. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, a physician of Cherokee heritage with an M.D.from Stanford University, includes the sweat lodge in what he calls a \"healingintensive\" for the chronically ill. Patients usually participate in a seven-dayprogram that combines Native American medicinal practices from variousethnic traditions with Morita therapy from Japan. Mehl-Madrona uses thesweat lodge for purication on the third or fourth night of the program ( 1997,154 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 154254-60). Sweats under the auspices of the Woptura Medicine Society \"will prevent common illnesses and begin to heal even chronic ill- nesses such as all forms of cancer, lupus, Parkinson's disease and even AIDS.The ceremony will purify the organs of the body, the blood, the heart, lungs,liver, kidneys, pancreas, gall bladder and all others.\" 8 But new age testimonials about the sweat lodge experience suggest that it contributes to personal growth and healing in ways other than just the phys-ical. Ceremonial sweating can be a rite de passage during which one is person- ally transformed while sharing the fraternal and sororal ritual ambience thatVictor Turner has called communitas (1969). A common analogy is drawn between sweating and the Christian rites of baptism and being born again(which, of course, in some Christian groups occur concurrently; Lee 1995, 55-56). 9Beth Moscov, a new age practitioner who has adapted American Indian ceremonials primarily for Euro-American women participants, hasstressed this feature of the sweat lodge experience in a poem she wrote in 1993 \"after a women-only sweatlodge ceremony on the spring equinox\": I was born again today. I went in on my hands and knees,bowing reverence to the many things.I came out on my hands and knees,This time as a newly born infant seeing the world for the rst time. 10 Common imagery about the lodge itself stresses its womb-like nature: the circular shape, the narrow passage through which one enters and exits, the darkness, and the moistness. It is perceived as \"the moist womb of MotherEarth\" (McGaa 1992,83). And, of course, it is more than just the physical sen- sations, which may require considerable fortitude and endurance from par-ticipants, that contribute to the passage aspects of the experience. The prayers,which often involve frank revelations of their sense of self, afford participantsa kind of group therapy (Garrett and Osborne 1995). As Wallace Black Elk has described the experience of healing and rebirth in the sweat lodge, This little guy [the spiritual force encountered in the sweat] goes inside and investigates everything. He sees everything. So the enemy does damage tothe brain or heart or liver or kidney or whatever. He goes there. He sees, likeX-ray. He sees it, and he goes there and repairs whatever is damaged. He recreates all the molecules, genes, organics, bers, or whatever the enemy damages. He recreates and reforms it. That is why he has his name. That iswhy we call him Creator. So he reconstructs the human mind and physicalbody. He recreates the human spirit, so that the spirit could wear its robe[physical body] and walk with a clear mind. (Black Elk and Lyon 1990, 41)The New Age Sweat Lodge 155Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 155Moreover (and in support of this new age emphasis), imagery of rebirth permeates traditional Lakota accounts of sweat lodge participation, and Raymond A. Bucko has published several narratives of \"conversion\" by Lakotaparticipants which foreground the rite de passage aspects of sweating ( 1998, 171-96). The communitas element of the sweat lodge is perhaps most clearly evi- dent in the adoption of the Lakota phrase meaning \"all my relatives.\"Theoretically, the distinctions that categorize people in ordinary existence dis-appear in a sense of community that includes not only the other human par-ticipants, but the nonhuman natural and spiritual realms. Defenders of newage uses of ceremonial sweating and other manifestations of Native Americanspirituality stress the universal inclusiveness of the phrase: that \"relatives\" ismeant to incorporate not only traditional Lakota religionists but anyone withthe proper attitude of humility and sense of community. In fact, one ofMcGaa's disciples has suggested that the Lakota phrase means \"we are relatedto all things\" (1992 ,85). Other ways in which communitas becomes apparent in the sweat lodge include the fact that one crawls in an act of personaldebasement on hands and knees into the structure, the seating of participantsin a nonhierarchical circle around the heated stones, and the leveling naked-ness or scanty clothing worn while in the lodge. The darkness contributes tothe loss of ordinary identity and the sense of kinship with the other partici-pants. As one is being purged of the toxins that have generated physical illness,one is also emptied of the trappings of structured self. A person emerges fromthe lodge physically cleansed and receptive to new influences, those from thespiritual powers that the experience has invoked. The sweat lodge fullls the new age program for the individual. The per- son who participates supposedly leaves the lodge as more nearly perfected inbody and spirit. The individual fulllment afforded by the sweat lodge becomesparticularly apparent from a couple of sets of divinatory cards that new agepractitioners have developed. Jamie Sams has created a set of tarot-like cardscalled Sacred Path Cards (1990). The second in the series of forty-one is thesweat lodge. If one draws this card, Sams writes in a book explicating the cards,the person \"may be asking for a cleansing,\" subconsciously taking note of theneed for purication of the body, mind, or spirit ( 1991, 11). A similar card set focuses exclusively on the sweat lodge. An internet advertisement for the LakotaSweat Lodge Cards, designed by Chief Archie Fire Lame Deer and Helene Sarkis(1994), informs the surfer, \"Sitting in the sweat lodge, an improvised womb of Mother Earth, you may experiencean [ sic] expanded vision of your being and purpose as well as an intimate sense of walking in balance between the con-scious world and the world of spirit.\" The cards use \"the timeless to direct the user's consciousness toward \"the source of personal power, insight, release, and self-awakening.\"11 While critics have suggested that using the sweat solely for personal ful- llment violates traditional values for the ceremony, the appeal of the sweatlodge to new agers does transcend the personal. Especially for those who havecome to the sweat through the influence of Native American leaders such asWallace Black Elk and Ed McGaa, the sweat lodge is part of a program that hascosmic ramications. As \"a medicine man from the Chippewa tribe of theNorth Plains\" told journalist Michael D'Antonio, \"'We have a philosophy thatsays everything has a spirit: trees, rocks, animals. Our way of life has let usdevelop along the theological lines that give us a responsible role in the world,not ownership. . . . Y ou go in [the sweat lodge], you listen, and we help you participate....W h e n i t ' s o v e r w e a r e spiritually and physically puried. A cleansing takes place, and if it helps people develop a consciousness for thesacred nature of the Earth, that's good too'\" (D'Antonio 1992, \"Earth holdsthat \"the land on which we live shapes our experience of the sacred and that, infact, certain religious movements, ceremonies, and artifacts are present in theland itself\" (Buhner 1997, 217). The sweat lodge, which \"allows a special close- ness to Mother Earth\" (McGaa 1990, 7), is one of these autochthonous cere- monies. Participants in sweats emulate \"red brother and sister caretakers\" ofthe Americas, individuals who developed methods over millennia for achiev-ing oneness with Wakan tanka that are hemisphere-specic (McGaa 1990, 45). McGaa refers to the seven ceremonies, including the sweat lodge, which he hasadapted from the rituals described by Nicholas Black Elk to Brown, as \"MotherEarth ceremonies\" that arise from the \"realization that Mother Earth is a trulyholy being\" (1990, 204). The sweat is particularly effective for attaining oneness with this being because in what McGaa has called a \"spiritual sauna,\" partici-pants commingling (sweat)with the lifeblood of the planet\" ( 1990, 7). In a statement published a couple of years later, McGaa reiterated the way in which the sweat lodge is especiallyimportant for adherents of Mother Earth spirituality: \"Mother Earth is present.Y ou are sitting upon her. Father Sky is present. The sun's heat is within theglowing stones and brings forth your lifeblood, your sweat, to mix with thelifeblood of the world, the water within the bucket beside the lodge leader\"(1992, 83). Theoretically, the interior \"harmony and balance\" that individuals experience in a sweat \"will automatically translate outward to encompass theother worlds in which [they] live simultaneously\" (McGaa 1992, 84). Wallace Black Elk's \"Earth people philosophy\" essentially emphasizes the same point of view: that while sweating heals the individual, it also heals theThe New Age Sweat Lodge 157Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 157cosmos. He notes, \"The center is the Earth, and on this Earth we build the stone-people-lodge.\" The experience of the lodge involves all four of the basicconstituents that comprise the cosmos: re, rock, water, and \"green\"\u2014in otherwords, the sage, cedar, and sweetgrass that are sprinkled onto the heated rocks(Black Elk and Lyon 1990 ,59-60). Not all sweat lodge leaders stress the community-oriented aspects of the experience, nor do all participants who recount their experience emphasizethis aspect of it. But part of the healing logic of the sweat lodge (and at leastpart of its appeal in new age contexts which might have foregrounded other,non-Indian sweating protocols such as the sauna) lies in its connection withwhat proponents of contemporary alternative spirituality perceive as ecologi-cal awareness. The logic of the new age sweat lodge, despite its being the target of con- siderable criticism, stems from at least two historical settings: the role ofsweating in Western medicine, particularly that which has posed an alterna-tive to the mainstream, and the fascination with matters Indian that has beena constant feature of Euro-American culture. Meanwhile, proponents of thelodge testify to its role in physical healing\u2014a role that nds enhancementfrom its evocation of ceremonial patterns such as rite de passage and com-munitas. Moreover, the sweat lodge has a role in modern manifestations of thenature religion that Catherine L. Albanese has found pervasive in Americanspiritual life \"from the Algonkian Indians to the New Age\" ( 1990). The merg- ing of these forces in one experience creates a powerful healing procedure thatworks for its adherents on several diachronic and synchronic levels. The RedRoad in Westchester County with their tenuous claims to Native Americanethnicity and the offense that they give to many American Indians neverthe-less are operating from a coherent logic, a set of assumptions and precedentsthat makes them actors in a continuing subplot in the narrative of theAmerican experience, a subplot that has at times influenced the main currentsof the society's life as it seems to be doing more and more among new agersand others at millennium's end and beginning who have turned to the pre-European indigenes of the Western Hemisphere for a way to enhance theirown experience in that land. Notes 1. The term \"new age\" is, of course, problematic. Many participants in what out- siders call \"the new age movement\" reject the term altogether. And it certain- ly has been used to cover such a vast array of beliefs and practices as almost158 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 158to have lost utility.\"Alternative spirituality\" as a term has the advantage of not being as offensive to those involved, but it also lacks precision. Generally,what I mean are contemporary (in other words, 1990 s) beliefs and practices that lie outside the traditions of \"great religions,\" that represent an ofteneclectic attempt at blending traditions, that are oriented toward personaltransformation and fulllment, and that have some millenarian overtonesoften couched in ecological diction. 2.

The most comprehensive treatment of the procedures of the Lakota sweat lodge is Bucko's ( 1998). My account draws also upon a variety of descriptions by participants in and observers of the use of ceremonial sweating in con-temporary alternative spirituality. 5. La Duke published a number of books until his death in 1992. A generally positive account by an outsider to his movement was done by CatherineAlbanese (1990 ,155-63 ). 6. On the internet at www.photon.net/sunrise/seven.html (accessed 14May 1998). 7. For a response to most of these charges, see Buhner ( 1997,79-188). Stephen Harrod Buhner, who led a new age religious gathering in Boulder, Colorado,called the Church of Gaia has been one of the most outspoken defenders ofnon-Indian use of Indian ceremonials. He has had able opponents in thedebate in Ward Churchill, for example, and in the editorial staff of the week-ly newspaper Indian Country Today (formerly the Lakota Times ). The issues raised by critics and defenders of non-Indian use of Native American cere-monialism nd parallels in a variety of cross-cultural borrowings of what areperceived as \"traditions\": for example, the blues revival of the 1990 s, in which white performers have gured prominently and white audiences have domi-nated (Lornell 1998). A classic example from Indian-Euro-American rela- tions is the dispute over the ethnicity of artists who can sell their products atthe Portal of the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico (Evans-Pritchard 1987). These cases\u2014and many like them\u2014reflect the disparity that may arise from differing views of what constitutes \"tradition,\" a constructmore symbolic than substantive, as Richard Handler and Jocelyn Linnekinhave suggested ( 1984). 8.

The pletho-ra attention a \"saint\" canonized only through the vox populi, suggests these designations are more than merehyperbole.

Hildegard appears onwebsites devoted to early women writers, female composers, Catholic saints, aswell as on sites for alternative and new age medicine. 2Biographical and bibli- ographic information about Hildegard and selections from her works can begleaned from academic websites such as Bonnie Middle Ages\" (www.millersv.edu/~resound/women.html) and\"MedievalWomen\" devoted to the Benedictine order (www.osb.org/osb/index.html); herilluminations adorn each page of \"The Cosmic Egg\" web page (www.cltr.uq.oz.au8000/~pandora/welcome.html); \"Motherheart: Health and Wholeness\"(gnv.fdt.net/~mother/health_index.html), a website for those who involves \"nurturing our unied being\" includes Life \"painted by Bingen\" to Bonnie Duncan's material; \"One Degree Beyond\" (www.whidbey.com/onedegreebeyond/per-slink.htm) contains links to web pages on new cosmology, on Reiki, and to theMemorial University of Newfoundland Hildegard of Bingen page. One canpurchase her books and CDs on a variety of websites. References to her appearon a listserver devoted to the history of brewing because she may have been thefirst person to describe hopped beer (http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/hist-brewing/archive/ 0162.html). The recipe for \"St. Hildegard's Cookies of Joy\" can be found on a Boston public radio site (www.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/pri/spirit/specials/recipes/ 311recipes.html), and her herbal remedies are rec- ommended on a variety of sites. There is even a website for a Generation X youngman who believes he is the reincarnation of Hildegard (www.ordovirtutum.com).Wired as well as feted on several continents with concerts, lectures, confer-ences, and tours in honor of her nine-hundredth birthday, Hildegard indeedseems to be the woman of the millennium in her widespread appeal to a verydisparate audience. Clearly the interest of academicians in the work of this multitalented and complex woman is understandable, especially on the part of those con-cerned with expanding a heretofore patriarchal canon. However, the profu-sion of material about her is obviously not limited to dry tomes bymedievalists exploring early music and literature nor to mainstream religiousstudying the history of Benedictine spirituality or Christian mysticism.Hildegard's appeal is neither strictly academic nor elite; it is a mass appeal.Her followers include scholars as well as new age adherents. One academicwebsite bemoans the current popular appropriation of Hildegard: \"Less for-tunately, Hildegard's visions and music have been hijacked by the New Age164 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 164movement, Hildegard's ethereal airs\" (tweedledee.ucsb.edu/~kris/music/Hildegard.html). Although some academ-ics are discomted by Hildegardian enthusiasts who do not always understandthe complexities of her religio-historical context (some, in fact, even assigningher to an incorrect century), one cannot help but be astounded by the inter-national recognition of this woman who until quite recently would not evenhave been taught in specialized upper-level university classes. For thoseinspired by her beliefs, admiring of all she accomplished, nding her medicalconcepts relevant, the voice of this nine-hundred-year-old woman who con-sidered herself a feather on the breath of God resonates in our time. Details of Hildegard's life can be culled from the numerous letters she left behind; from the biography composed by two monks, Gottfried andDieter, incorporating memoirs dictated by Hildegard; and from the fragmen-tary biography produced by Guibert of Gembloux. Condensed biographicalinformation about Hildegard is available on many internet sources and isincluded in many scholarly studies, such as Peter Dronke's Women Writers of the Middle Ages (1984 ) and Barbara Newman's Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine (1989 ). A fuller study of her life is Sabina Flanagan's Hildegard of Bingen, 1098-1179: A Visionary Life (1989 ). Hildegard's popularity can be attested to by Routledge's 1998 release of a second and revised edition of that work. The tenth of her parents' children and, thus, their tithe to God as they dedicated her to the religious life when she was only eight years old, Hildegardof Bingen might, at rst glance, seem an unlikely gure to capture the imagi-nation and admiration of a twenty-rst century popular audience. Even thosewho would romanticize the medieval past might have difculty identifyingwith a child immured to the world when she was placed in the charge of Juttaof Sponheim, an anchoress whose enclosure was attached to the Benedictinemonastery at Disibodenberg, Germany. When Jutta's spirituality attractedmore disciples, their cell was eventually transformed into a Benedictine con-vent. Hildegard professed her vows as a young woman of fteen or sixteen,committing herself to obedience, stability, and conversion of life under theRule of St. Benedict. With Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was the choice of the other nuns to assume the leadership role. In 1141, after rst seeking counsel from Bernard of Clairvaux, she responded to a divine imperative to writeabout the visions of the living Light that she had experienced since childhood.Ultimately, the increase in nuns and divine instigation prompted Hildegard tomove the convent to Rupertsbert, in spite of opposition from church hierar-chy. Hildegard proved herself a capable administrator and a prolic writer.Her fame and her convent grew until she founded a second convent atEvergreen: The Enduring Voice of a Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 165Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 165Eibingen. Hildegard recorded her visions in the Scivias (Know the Ways of the Lord) ,Liber vitae meritorum (Book of Life's Merits) , and Liber divinorum ope- rum (Book of Divine Works). She also supervised illuminations illustrating her visions; these were probably produced by the nuns in the convent's scriptori-um. She is responsible for the rst extant morality play, the liturgical dramaOrdo virtutum (Play of the Virtues) . She cycle of seventy-seven songs, Symphonia harmoniae caelestium revelationum (The Symphony of the Harmony of Heavenly Revelations) . She is often designated Germany's rst woman doctor and scientist because of her encyclopedic Subtilitates natu- rarum diversarum creaturum (The Subtleties of the Diverse Natures of Created Things) , which includes both her Causae et curae (Causes and Cures) and Physica (Natural History) orLiber simplicis medicinae (Books of Simple Medicine) . In addition she carried on such an extensive correspondence with religious and secular gures from all walks of life who sought and received her frank advice that she has been likened to a medieval \"Dear Abby\" (Petroff1986 ,142). She embarked on four preaching tours, wrote a life of Saints Rupert and Disibod, a treatise on the Benedictine Rule and the Athanasian Creed, andis responsible for an invented language. Far from silent in her own time, Hildegard continues to speak to our age, most notably in her role as healer, a role that in many ways unies herother roles as prophet, visionary, abbess, composer, scientist, herbalist, anddramatist. Ruth M. Walker-Moskop has argued for the centrality of healing toall Hildegard's works; she asserts that health \"is a unifying theme in each ofher books\" ( 1985, 19). In her visionary Scivias she \"outlines the way to health through faith\" as she \"describes the way to harmony with God, a necessaryprerequisite for a person's internal spiritual and physical health\" ( 1985, 20); in thePhysica and Causae et curae she focuses on \"how to promote physical health\" by providing a \"practical handbook on medicine\" in the former and a\"holistic philosophy of healing\" in the latter ( 1985, 21); in Liber vitae merito- rum she writes \"a prescription to cure a sick ( in Liber divi- norum operum she \"describes the ultimate cosmic bonds on which human health depends\" and provides a \"guide for healing the body and soul\" ( 1985, 22). Many are specically interested in the natural remedies she provides inher scientic works. Her Natural History, divided into nine sections, contains descriptions of plants (including about three hundred herbs), animals, met-als, stones, and minerals, focusing on their medicinal properties; and theCauses and Cures, divided into ve sections, discusses the origin and treat- ment of disease with precise \"recipes\" for natural treatment. Y et, the philoso-phy of holistic healing that integrates the health of body and soul articulatedin these and her other works is a major reason for her current following. As166 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 166her own illnesses were pivotal factors in her life, healing the body, the spirit, and the mind was Hildegard's life and work. Her hands-on practice of medi-cine, her writing, her music, her art all focus on this multifaceted concept ofhealth. T o understand Hildegard as healer is to recognize that health is morethan the absence of disease or a palliating of the symptoms of disease.According to Walker-Moskup, \"Hildegard understands health in a broad,holistic sense. For twelfth-century thinkers, health was clearly a multidimen-sional concept that involved striving for harmony with God, for inner spiritu-al harmony, for balance among the physical humors, for concord between souland body, and for harmony between human beings and the cosmos\" ( 1985, 19). Hence, a 1994 edition of Causae et curae , an English translation of the German translation of the Latin text, is entitled Holistic Healing \u2014 taking liberties with the letter but not the spirit of Hildegard's title. Although there is some disagreement whether her Natural History and herCauses and Cures are based on visions, on Hildegard's experience as a practicing physician in the tradition of Benedictine medicine, or on somecombination of the two, the material in these scientic works as well as hermusic, the illuminations accompanying her visions, and her philosophy ofholistic health lend themselves to the adaptation of those concerned withalternative medicine with its stress on the importance of balance and harmo-ny in life and components such as proper diet, herbalism, aromatherapy, andsound therapy. Moreover, there are those like Matthew Fox who see Hildegardas affecting more than the health of the individual. Fox argues she is a forcefor healing society and the church: Hildegard gifts us today because she heals . She awakens and she heals. She awakens Christianity to some of the wisdom of the ancient women's religions and thereby offers healing to the male/female split in religion.She awakens the psyche to the cosmos and thereby offers healing to both.She awakens to the holiness of the earth and thereby heals the awful splitbetween matter and spirit in the West. She awakens art to science andscience to music and religion to science. And thereby heals the dangerousrift between science and religion that has dominated the culture the pastthree hundred years in the West. ( 1988,20) For Fox, disseminating an understanding of Hildegard's philosophy as it is expressed in her writing, her music, and her art has a therapeutic value that is truly transformative. Although Hildegard often appeals to those dissatised with convention- al or orthodox medicine and religion, the philosophy Hildegard espouses is one which in its emphasis on the interrelationship of the physical, mental,Evergreen: The Enduring Voice of a Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 167Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 167emotional, and spiritual is wholeheartedly the product of medieval and Renaissance Christianity. Barbara Newman cautions, \"The stunning original-ity of her formulations must not be allowed to obscure her fundamentalorthodoxy or her classic Benedictine approach to the spiritual life\" (1989 , xvii). Likewise, Sabina Flanagan notes, Hildegard is far from unconventionalin her time: \"Contrary to some modern perceptions of Hildegard, her thoughtwas in many ways more conservative than revolutionary, depending on thetime-honored methodology and learning of the monastic milieu in which shespent her life\" ( 1996, 2). From the perspective of this worldview, humankind at creation was in harmony with the divine. Sin injected the discordant note, a cacophony that had a range of physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, andsocial ramications. The equation between sin and sickness (both physicaland spiritual) is consistent throughout the medieval and Renaissance period.Sin debilitates in a variety of ways. One need only consider Dante's graphictenth bolgia, the Valley of Disease, in circle 8ofThe Inferno; Edmund Spenser's parade of the seven deadly sins\u2014each afflicted with an appropriately corre- sponding physical malady\u2014in the House of Pride in book 1ofThe Faerie Queene ; John Donne's extended treatment of the analogy between physical and spiritual health in his Devotions upon Emergent Occasions ; or John Milton's catalog of human suffering in Adam's vision of the Lazar-house inbook 11ofParadise Lost as the archangel Michael instructs him about the con- sequences for humankind of the intemperance and disobedience of the rstparents. Hildegard is part of an extensive Christian tradition that sees illnessas a result of the Fall and recognizes health as more than a physical matter. Atthe same time Hildegard is also part of a Christian tradition that sees creationas a reflection of the Creator and recognizes both the symbolic and practicaluse of all aspects of creation. As Katharina M. Wilson notes in her introduc-tion to selections from Hildegard in an anthology of medieval women writers,\"For a person of the twelfth century, the world was a storehouse of meaning,all its objects and activities referring ultimately to a realm both transcendentand divine\" ( 1984,118). Hence, herbs, precious stones, and animals have spe- cial application in the healing process of humankind. Heinrich Schippergesmaintains Hildegard's \"religious teachings contained nothing new; they sim-ply explain and proclaim traditional doctrine\" ( 1997,4): Hildegard's writings show us the structure of the universe as a unied whole\u2014a universe, though, that is out of joint\u2014and how the parts willbe conjoined again for the salvation of humankind. The interrelatednessof everything\u2014humankind and the cosmos, body and spirit, nature andgrace\u2014and the interdependence of everything were not just so many168 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 168empty words to Hildegard. They went to make up a functional holistic picture of the world, down to the minutest detail. Her entire work ischaracterized by a clear-headed realism that focuses on the history of sal-vation: the vision of a world created out of nothing; the creation and fallof humanity; the Incarnation of the son of God; and the resurrection ofthe body at the end of time. ( 3-4) Hildegard's worldview of the interconnectedness of Creator and all of creation is wholly consistent with the Christian tradition she is embedded in and underlies her medical practice. That medical practice itself was based on conventional science. Elisabeth Brooke in her study of the tradition of women healers notes that Hildegard \"was familiar with classical authors such as Pliny and Galen, as well as withcontemporary medical texts from Salerno and other medical schools\" ( 1997, 23). Timothy P . Daaleman has examined the way Hildegard was influenced byclassical medicine and by the tradition of \"monastic medicine\" which \"assim-ilated the local traditions which existed outside the cloister walls\" ( 1993, 282). The foreword to Holistic Healing acknowledges: \" Holistic Healing , as a hand- book providing information and suggestions in matters of sickness and heal-ing, stands foursquare in the tradition of monastic and popular medicinewhich itself was based on the medical knowledge of antiquity. Added to thisare oral traditions and Hildegard's own experience in medicine and care of thesick. The entire book bears the stamp of the author's faith and Christian cul-ture\" (Hildegard 1994 , xiii). Hildegard's understanding that disease is the result of an imbalance of the humors (though she makes some signicantadaptations) comes from the classics, but she also blends into her practice folkand magical traditions\u2014the latter most notably demonstrated through heruse of charms and incantations. The power of these is recognized by her fol-lowers today and one can find Hildegardian charms on the internet(webs.linkport.com/~grimnir/magichealing/charms.htm) against mental ill-ness, against bewitchment, to heal jaundice, against melancholy, againstmigraines, against obsessions, and to ease delivery; others are occasionallyincluded in texts such as Elisabeth Brooke's Medicine Women (1997 ,35-36). A key Hildegardian concept, viriditas, while uniquely expressed, illustrates Hildegard's orthodoxy. Barbara Newman comments: \" Viriditas for Hildegard was more than a color; the fresh green that recurs so often in her visions repre-sents the principle of all life, growth, and fertility flowing from the life-creatingpower of God\" ( 1989, 102). Flanagan notes that even some of Hildegard's cures involving trees \"derive their effectiveness by association from other qualities ofthe tree, such as its vigour or viriditas, freshness, or tenderness\" ( 1989, \"Hildegard uses the word viriditas to refer to all living things, the energy of life which comes from God, the power of youth and of sexuality, the power in seeds, the reproduction of cells, the power ofregeneration, freshness, and creativity\" ( 1988, xxvii). In contrast, illness is the drying out of this life-force. Because this life-force comes from God, healingmust be more than a physical process. Matthew Fox discusses this core compo-nent of Hildegard's belief and imagery and nds three sources for her use ofviriditas: Scripture, her environment (the lush Rhine Valley), and her own surgeof creativity ( 1985, 32-33). The Judeo-Christian associations of fructication and dessication are long-standing. The withered garden and the burgeoning Eden have long emblematized the physical, spiritual, and creative status of humanity.The psalmist thirsting for God as the hart for flowing streams (Psalms 42 ), thirsting for God as his flesh fainted for him \"as in a dry and weary land where no water is\" (Psalms 63 ) decried the aridity of the soul cut off from the fountain of life. Edmund Spenser's Colin Clout, the shepherd-poet wasting away physi-cally and spiritually in the \"December Eclogue\" of The Shepheardes Calender laments that the flowers which once bloomed in his garden had withered, theirroots dried up for lack of dew. He and his poesy are blighted gardens. Havingsinned against Nature and God, Coleridge's ancient mariner is surrounded byundrinkable water. His burning thirst on the sea externalizes the spiritual thirstof the man who has cut himself off from God. In our own time, poets such asT. S. Eliot have led readers through heaps of broken images, dead trees, and drystones, the wasteland of hollow men. Aridity is sickness, sin, sterility. For theheart is the biblical hortus conclusus , the enclosed garden. When its center is God, the fountain of life, grace transforms that garden to the restored Edenraised in the waste wilderness of postlapsarian humanity, the paradise within.The seventeenth century British poet-priest George Herbert compared thesterility of the soul to a withered garden in his poem \"Grace\" (Hutchinson 1941, 60-61), and in \"The Flower\" (165- 167) he describes the spiritual renewal through grace as he rejoices that his \"shrivel'd heart\" has \"recover'd greenesse\" ( 2.8-9). This influx of grace brings with it the creative spirit: \"After so many deaths I liveand write\" ( 1.37). Like Hildegard, he associates sin not only with dessication but also with disease as his speaker complains in \"The Sinner\": \"I am all ague\" ( 1.1; see Hutchinson 1941, 38). The pattern is a conventional one: the Christian spir- it knows both paradise lost and paradise regained in the cyclic fall and spring ofthe soul. Adamant in sin, the hardened heart is a cursed ground bearing littlefruit; or a hortus green with energized life. This is the great Christian narrative that spans the arid deserts of the individual's separation from God (bringingwith it physical illness and the drought of creativity) as well as the oases of spir-itual renewal when the presence of grace brings harmony with the divine and170 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 170consequent physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The heart of Hildegard's imagery is very traditionally Christian. Both in spite of and becauseof her own religious and medical orthodoxy, Hildegard's appeal today is to thoselooking for alternatives to conventional medicine. Some of her followers aredevoted Christians who regard Hildegard as a spokesperson for the divine; oth-ers are seeking religious as well as medical alternatives and see Hildegard as thewisdom of the past that legitimates the choices they make. In her doctoral dis-sertation, Sue Spencer Cannon documented the relevance of Hildegard's medi-cine for a modern audience: \"Hildegard's medicine, in many of its facets, isseriously practiced today in Western society as an alternative to Western bio-medicine by a growing number of people\" ( 1993, 124). In Europe this has been formalized in the practice of Hildegard-medicine, primarily as a result of thework of Dr. Gottfried Hertzka and his successor, Wighard Strehlow. Hertzka, agraduate of the University of Vienna medical school, opened the HildegardPractice in Konstanz and published several books on Hildegard's medicine.Currently there are in Europe a number of societies, journals, and symposia offered for adherents of Hildegard-medicine. For Hertzka, Hildegard-medicineis of value for reasons \"based on the considerations, stemming from his Catholicfaith, that Hildegard was not an innovative twelfth-century thinker, but rather amere conduit through which God revealed his medicine to humankind\"(Cannon 1993, 147). Hertzka is one of those who interprets Hildegard's medical material to be a direct result of her visions and sees her functioning as the HolyGhost's secretary (Cannon 1993, 162). For Hertzka and many others, Hildegard- medicine \"is desirable to its adherents because it is medicine from the mostknowledgeable source possible: humankind's creator. For the faithful,Hildegard-Medicine becomes a comfort whether an ailment is relieved or notbecause it allows them the conviction that whatever the outcome, it is the willof God and therefore the best for them\" (Cannon 1993 ,173). While the impetus for the formalization of Hildegard-medicine stemmed from Hertzka's Catholic faith, the adaptability and applicability ofthis practice extends beyond such mainline religious beliefs. Hildegard hasgained a signicant following among those searching for medical and reli-gious alternatives, including new age adherents. This has occurred for severalreasons: (1) Gender. As a woman who lived in what is perceived to be an extreme- ly restrictive and chauvinistic age, Hildegard accomplished a great deal and was outspoken in her dealings with a number of male authority gures fromabbots and bishops to emperors. Further, her visions of the feminine divine inthe form of Sapientia and Caritas, while deriving from the ancient WisdomEvergreen: The Enduring Voice of a Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 171Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 171tradition, strike a very modern note. Moreover, she not only discusses matters of human sexuality openly in her writings but specically treats medical mat-ters of concern to women: \"conception and birth, complications in childbirthand gynecological diseases, menopause are all extensivelydescribed\" (Hildegard 1994 , xix). 3 (2) Holistic health. Her approach to health care is a holistic one that encompasses body, mind, spirit, and cosmos. She believes that the individualis a microcosm of the greater world, that the harmony of both was disruptedas a result of the Fall, and that for true health both must be re-tuned to thedivine symphony. Health is more than the absence of symptoms of disease butcalls for balance and moderation in all aspects of life and cannot be effectedwithout the operation of grace. (3) V ariety. Her health care methodology incorporates many aspects from which a modern audience can pick and choose: herbalism, aromatherapy, dietand fasting, laying on of hands, therapeutic stones, prayer and incantation,light energy, sound therapy, art therapy, and hydrotherapy. One need onlyskim through the table of contents for a reference work such as Alternative Medicine: The Denitive Guide (1994 ) to recognize how relevant the many facets of Hildegard's medicine are today. (4) Ecological consciousness. As Matthew Fox argues, \"Hildegard is deeply ecological in her spirituality\" (1985 ,8). Because she believes in both the sacral- ity and the interconnectedness of all creation, she respects Nature and recog-nizes its power. Those interested in Green Power cannot help but nd theHildegardian image of viriditas intriguing. When Bear and Company, a new age publisher, provided an English translation of Strehlow and Hertzka's work ( 1988), basic concepts of Hildegard-medicine were made accessible to a larger and specically new ageaudience. As Michael D'Antonio has shown in Heaven on Earth, healing is \"one of the primary concerns of the New Age\": \"The New Age has also fos-tered a proliferation of alternative therapies: herbal medicine, acupressure,Reiki massage, enema therapy, even flower essence treatments. In virtuallyevery case, advocates claim these remedies are based on ancient wisdom andthat they bring relief without pain\" ( 1992,67). The introduction to Alternative Medicine: The Denitive Guide reinforces this concept that alternative medi- cine has a signicant tradition: The underlying concepts of alternative medicine are not new. They repre- sent a return to the principles that have been part of human understanding172 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 172of health and disease for thousands of years. Over the centuries, medical wisdom evolved within a framework which linked health to a state of har-mony or balance, and disease to a state of disharmony or imbalance, andtook into account the factors that contributed to both. ( 1994, 5) References to Hildegard often legitimate alternative treatments. As a twelfth-century visionary and \"saint\" (albeit uncanonized), she is the \"ancient wisdom\" that lends a stamp of authority to modern practitioners. She is oftenreferred to in advice provided by modern herbalists. For example, MichaelCastleman in The Healing Herbs: The Ultimate Guide to the Curative Power of Nature's Medicines cites numerous Hildegardian remedies throughout his book and nds her unique as \"the only medieval woman who left any account of 'wisewoman' healing practices\" ( 1995, 17). He nds her recommendations for a bal- anced diet and tooth brushing with aloe and myrrh especially sensible (1995, 7). Rosemary Gladstar in Herbal Healing for Women cites Hildegard's recommen- dation of comfrey for wounds (1993, 237), the inclusion of licorice in her mate- ria medica (1993, 247), and the use of valerian as a sedative ( 1993, 256). On the internet a page on healing herbs recommends vervain to aid digestion, relievedepression, and ease headaches and aches and pains and points out, \"Thetwelfth-century German abbess and herbalist Hildegard of Bingen 'toxic 'discharges from the brain to the teeth'\" (www.healthyideas.com/healing/herb/her). The same website also cites Hildegard in its recommendationof cinnamon and notes that she used it \"as 'the universal spice for sinuses,' andto treat colds, flu, cancer and 'inner decay and slime,' whatever that means.\" Y etanother website from Snow Mountain Botanicals argues for the importance ofvalerian as a safe and effective medicine by noting, \"Hildegard of Bingin [ sic], famous abbess/herbalist of Germany, used it as a sedative in the twelfth centu-ry\" (www.pacic.net/~smb/valerian_notes.html). Another website points toHildegard's recommendation of tansy to treat a cold and includes a passagefrom Hildegard on the humors (homepage.rconnect.com/Karyn/colds.htm).The resume for the nutritionist Ward W. Bond of Carol Bond Health Foods notonly lists his membership in such organizations as the Herb ResearchFoundation and the Herbalist Guild but also in the International Society ofHildegard von Bingen (www.carolbond.com/ward.htm). The mention of thistwelfth century visionary's name confers authority on the advice and advisorsof herbal lore. Moreover, she confers not only authority but the authority of aWestern rather than Eastern tradition, an important distinction David Frawleymakes in his foreword to the English translation of the Strehlow and Hertzkabook as he asserts that Hildegard's \"knowledge can help Western herbal medicineEvergreen: The Enduring Voice a Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 173Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 173return itself to an equal level of sophistication with the Eastern systems that are becoming popular today. Hildegard's medicine, therefore, has a special importtoday for this regeneration of our own older natural-healing tradition\" ( 1988, ix). Authentication through association with Hildegard occurs not only with herbalists but also with those concerned with the therapeutic use of stones. AsSi and Ann Frazier remark, \"A small portion of her commentaries describes themedicinal uses of gemstones, a fact that makes Hildegard von Bingen very bigamong those with a 'metaphysical' interest in minerals, the phenomenon thathas put the word 'crystal' into the everyday vocabularies of many people whopreviously never gave minerals a thought\" ( 1998, 34). The Fraziers note Hildegard's popularity in German and Swiss metaphysical circles and herincreasing popularity in the United States. Cannon writes of attending a sym-posium on Hildegard in Engelberg, Switzerland, in 1991: \"I met several people who, following Hildegard's advice, wore pelts or jewelry which they believed had healing and protective qualities. My symposium session neighbor, FrauGrun, who told me that she specialized in Hildegard's lapidary medicine, sin-cerely believed in the healing powers of semi-precious stones as described byHildegard\" ( 1993, 170). Hildegard included material on twenty-six precious stones in her Natural History. On her use of gems, Frawley comments, Like the medieval alchemists with whom she has much in common, Hildegard integrates the use of gems and minerals into her usage ofherbs. She recommends such remedies as gold for arthritis, emerald forheart pain, jasper for hay fever or for cardiac arrhythmia, gold topaz forloss of vision, and blue sapphire for eye inflammation. She uses gemwines, similar to the gem tinctures now being used more widely today.(Strehlow and Hertzka 1988, xii) As with her comments on herblore, her lapidary prescriptions are part of an important Western tradition for those who believe in the medicinal use of crystals and stones today. For Hildegard, music served an important liturgical function. As a reflection of divine harmony, music could both praise the deity and bring the individual into harmony with God. Fox regards Hildegard's music as \"cosmic\"and says of The Symphony of the Harmony of Heavenly Revelations that Hildegard \"expressed musically and poetically her deep mystical experiencesof the Cosmic Christ. She believed that singing of words reveals their truemeaning directly to the soul through bodily vibrations. Even today these songsevoke mystical experiences in those who sing them\" ( 1988,110). And, indeed, her music is seen to elicit both mystical and healing experiences. One of theforms of alternative medicine practiced by some Hildegardian followers is174 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 174sound therapy, a belief in the therapeutic power of sound. A web page main- tained by Bison Publishers on Sound and Healing notes, Each and every person has a core sound, a vibration or set of vibrations that emanate from our being and our body. Sounding this sound restoresus to balance, aligns our energies, releases our powers. When we are dis-eased, our bodies vibrate in dissonance to our being. We can help our-selves return to health and balance by recalling and reinforcing ournatural sound vibrations. Y ou can sing yourself back to health. This isthe essence of sound healing. Arguing that this is not a new concept but one that was recognized by \"ancient tribes of humankind,\" this document also cites Hildegard as an ancient practitioner who \"employed these sounds to effect change in the realworld of here and now.\" The site designed \"to provide a bibliography ofrecorded, printed and Web-published resources on the use of sound for heal-ing\" includes information about Hildegard's music (www.bison.com/heal-ing.html). The web page of Norma Gentile also testies to the importance ofHildegard's music as part of a healing methodology. Gentile is a professionalsinger, vocal coach, and auric healer. She has recorded two CDs of Hildegard'smusic, Meditation Chants and Unfurling Love's Creation . In an article from Continuo magazine (www.continuo.com/oct 97/gentile3.htm), she discusses her discovery of Hildegard's music and her own role as healer and musician.Through Hildegardian chants she experienced \"healing currents in sound\"and now performs concerts, offers workshops, and leads seminars in the useof sound for healing and meditation. Like Matthew Fox, who sees Hildegardoffering a \"radical opportunity for global religious ecumenism\" ( 1985, 16), she is impressed by the diversity of those interested in Hildegard, the ecumenicaloutreach Hildegard encompasses. Gentile writes, In the past year I've shared Hildegard's music with a Motherhouse of nuns, a Wiccan conference, a gathering of feminists, members of the Creation Spirituality movement, scholars attending an InternationalMedieval Studies Institute, and religious groups from mainstreamCatholics to liberal Protestants and the metaphysical Unity Church. I amamazed by the entry that Hildegard's music allows me into differentworlds. In addition, a website for Healing Y oga classes provides a catalog of music used in these classes. One of the offerings includes Richard Souther's The Music of Hildegard von Bingen with the notation that this CD is appropriate for use with the Sun Salutations series (www.io.com/helingyoga/cd.html). Just as HildegardEvergreen: The Enduring Voice Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 175Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 175maintains an active role as healer through her literary work, she also continues to function as healer through her music. Nancy Fierro explains, \"The word 'sym-phonia,' or symphony, had a special meaning for Hildegard. Living in symphonymeant living a life of virtue in tune with the harmonious praises of the ninechoirs of angels in paradise. Such a life would be inspired, lled with Divine pur-pose, and so powerful that everything would work together for the person in aharmonious way\" (1994, 24). In other words, Hildegard believed music could effect the holistically healthy individual. Many of Hildegard's followers believethat as well and see her music as especially effective in this health process. The illuminations of Hildegard's visions are also perceived as therapeutic, especially in her use of the mandala, that magic sphere Carl G. Jung\u2014a majorinfluence for many new agers\u2014saw as a \"symbolic representation of the 'nuclearatom' of the human psyche\" ( 1964, 213). Jung believed many cultures used the mandala as a healing tool to restore psychic balance, to bring the sick individual\"back into harmony with himself and with the cosmos\" (1964, 213). Fox perceives Hildegard's mandalas as fullling such a healing function for her and for others: Readers and pray-ers of Hildegard's illuminations will see ples of mandalas, those \"Maps of the cosmos\" developed in East as wellas in the medieval West to \"liberate the consciousness\" and return us to aprimeval consciousness which is fundamentally one of unity. Clearly,Hildegard's illuminations played that role with herself, a role of reinte-gration and holistic relating, which is her intention in sharing them withothers that they too may be healed. For Hildegard, her mandalas becomea primary means by which the microcosm/macrocosm, the human andthe universe, are brought together again. ( 1985, 16) Fox points to the way Hildegard through these illuminations enables us to \"connect\" with an \"'essential pattern'\" \"to nd God again, to vation or healing for self and others\" ( 1985, 25). Like Fox, others see Hildegardian mandalas as both salubrious and salvic. A website on healing and dreams maintained by Harry Bosma stresses the importance of mandalas(www.xs4 all.nl/~hbosma/healing_dreams/mandala.html) and includes a depic- tion of Tree of Life \"painted by Hildegard of Bingen\" with information on how to access others of her mandalas on the Bonnie Duncan website. \"Veriditas: The World Wide Labyrinth Project,\" developed by Rev. Dr. Lauren Artress of GraceCathedral in San Francisco, has been much influenced by the illuminations ofHildegard. The project itself is \"committed to reintroduce the labyrinth in itsmany forms as a spiritual tool. Its deeply healing qualities have been lying dor-mant for centuries so labyrinths need to be established in cathedrals, churches,retreat centers, hospitals, prisons, parks, airports and community spaces Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 176the world\" Artress and lectures worldwide on labyrinths and on Hildegard andplanned to conduct a tour in 1998, \"Labyrinths of Europe: Walking a SacredPath,\" that included a stay at Bingen to participate in the festivities con-nected with the celebration of Hildegard's nine-hundredth anniversary(www.noetic.org/Travel/labyrinths.html). A licensed psychotherapist, Dr. Artresssees the labyrinth as a mandala that can bring healing change to the individualand society. \"Earth Echo,\" a website maintained by artist Fred Casselman, con-tains a section on healing images and features \"images empowered to assist in ourpersonal and planetary healing\" (www.earthecho.com/heal/_healing.html). Oneof the galleries includes a painting titled Fires of Saint Hildegard , dedicated to her with the comment \"We love you Saint Hildegard.\" The Word Gallery has an artis-tic rendering of the following phrase from Hildegard. The rst ve lines radiatefrom a circle formed by the words of the last two lines: The earth should not be injured The earth should not be destroyedAs often as the elements, the elements of the worldAre violated by ill-treatment. So God will cleanse themGod will cleanse them thru the suffering, thru the hardships of humankind. God desires that all the worldBe pure in his sight. At the center of the circle we nd the words \"Hildegard of Bingen.\" The image visually illustrates the importance of healing Mother Earth which Matthew Fox sees as one of Hildegard's roles. Information is also included onother websites where one might gain information about Hildegard (www.earthecho.com/words/hild.html). \"Earth Echo\" afrms the power of art to heal andcelebrates the individual, ecological, and cosmic power of Hildegard's healing art. One of the more remarked upon aspects of Hildegard's life has been her longevity in an age of typically abbreviated life-spans. Even more remarkable is the longevity of her healing practice. T oday, through technology, her medicalpractice may be more extensive than it was in her lifetime as she continues toapply her healing touch through the dissemination of her writing, music, andart. While some may scoff at the popular appropriation of her work by an audi-ence largely incapable of reading her material in the Latin original and not fullyaware of the religious, historical, literary, and musical traditions that contextu-alize her, the same might well be said of her contemporary patients. Hildegardspeaks to the learned and the unlearned, to those in the mainstream of reli-gious tradition and those on the periphery. The proliferation of books, CDs,Evergreen: The Enduring Voice of a Nine-Hundred-Year-Old Healer 177Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 177and internet resources clearly indicates the number of people turning to her for healing of the body, of the spirit, and of the earth. Representative of their needis one web page that contains an illumination of Hildegard at work, a depic-tion of the current Abbey of St. Hildegard in Ibingen, Germany, and an elo-quent prayer lamenting the pain of individual souls and of the earth itself. Theprayer calls upon Hildegard for help: Guide us to participate in the healing of suffering souls. Let us restore the earth and her children to the joy of singing to Y ou. Find the musicaltones that once played the Fall. T each us to sing with the Angels, Saints,and our Ancestors, in the praise and worship of the Trinity.(ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/PTBrown/) Viriditas: through the wisdom preserved in her writings, through herbal remedies, charms and lapidary prescriptions, through music and art, the ever- green voice of Hildegard of Bingen endures today as her writings, music, and artprovide answers to the prayers of the sick who come to her for holistic healing.

Bonnie Glass-Cofn once again, the ninth week of a ten-week quarter in introductory anthro- pology had arrived. For eight weeks I had stressed how comparison and objectivity in anthropological research has helped us make sense of subjects asvaried as human evolution and human activity patterns, the logic of kinship,and economic systems. Now it was time to turn from a discussion of anthro-pology as science to a discussion of anthropology as an interpretive discipline.It was time to focus class attentions on the variety of meanings with which socialgroups inscribe human experience and on the role of \"culture\" in shaping these. I was at once relieved and anxious. Relieved because I was heading into an area that, for me, is familiar territory. With a research emphasis in shaman-ism and theoretical interests in interpretive anthropology and the anthropol-ogy of religion, I felt comfortable in presenting the hermeneutic side ofanthropology to my students. Additionally, this was the time of the quarterwhen I would present accounts of my own eldwork to my students\u2014when Icould speak about the discipline with \"ethnographic authority.\" But, I was alsoanxious\u2014as I had been in every previous ninth week of every quarter that Ihad taught Anthropology 101 . I was anxious because of the inevitable ques- tions I knew I would be asked as students responded to the presentation of my eldwork experience. For mine is a eldwork experience rich in the discussionof spirit entities, of soul loss and recovery, of hexing and curing, and of theenvy between friends and family that underlies a desire to seek out sorcerersand to cause intentional harm. /ornament21 183/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 183The Account I began by telling my students how I became interested in studying anthro- pology while living in Trujillo, a sprawling city located eight hours north ofLima in the heart of Peru's coastal desert. There, as an exchange student foreleven months in 1975 -76, I lived with a middle-class family and attended a Catholic high school. After conquering the culture shock, estrangement, andennui so commonly experienced by those who step outside the boundaries oftheir own cultural traditions, I began to feel very much at home in this far-away place. Over the course of my stay I mastered the language and became quite comfortable with the roles of daughter, sister, and student into which Iwas being socialized. I came to the (premature) conclusion that underneaththe veneer of culture, people are pretty much the same wherever you go. Then one day, a good friend (whom I'll call Sylvia) told me very matter- of-factly that her grandmother had died because of sorcery. According to theaccount, the grandmother had taken a pitchfork to her neighbor's guinea pigswhen they invaded and destroyed her garden. A few weeks later, the neighborcelebrated a birthday and, as is customary, she prepared a feast to entertain allthe guests who would drop by her home to extend their best wishes. Sylvia'sgrandmother, still smarting from the guinea pig incident, didn't go to the cel-ebration. The neighbor, as a kind of \"peace offering,\" sent over a large portionof roast pork from the feast she had prepared for the well-wishers. But, afteraccepting and eating the pork, Sylvia's grandmother became very ill, sufferingstomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss. Sylvia hurriedly took her grandmother to the doctor. She suspected that the grandmother was suffering from a food- or water-borne parasitic infection.But the tests revealed nothing. After more tests and a trip to a private clinic toconsult a medical specialist, the infectious cause of her suffering was still a mys-tery. Finally, desperate to help her grandmother, Sylvia took her to acurandero\u2014a kind of healer who specializes in diagnosing and treating sorcery. During the all-night session (called a mesa) the curandero\u2014like shamanic healers in other cultural traditions\u2014\"saw\" behind the veil of ordi-nary reality and communed with spirit entities who might know the cause ofthe old woman's suffering. He told Sylvia's grandmother that, wantingrevenge, the neighbor had swept up the impression left by the grandmother'sfootprint and had taken it to a sorcerer. He saw how the sorcerer had given theneighbor hueso de muerto (powdered human bone) to slip into the roast pork. He explained that when Sylvia's grandmother ate the pork, she sealed herdoom. Unfortunately, according to the healer, the sorcery was pasado\u2014it had been done too long before\u2014and he would be unable to undo the harm. As184 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 184Sylvia nished recounting the story she sighed deeply, \"If only we had gone to a healer earlier we might have saved her. But she died within the month.\" In an aside to my students, I described how the healers I've worked with have explained sorcery to me. I told them how, according to their logic (andwhile under the influence of a hallucinogenic mixture brewed from the SanPedro or Trichocereus pachanoi cactus), the curandero would have seen the rit- ual in which the sorcerer effected the magic that would eventually kill myfriend's grandmother. This magic would have consisted of the sorcerer \"call-ing\" the grandmother's shadow-soul away from her body. This ability to lurethe shadow-soul into leaving the grandmother's body and appearing beforethe mesa would be possible through the use of sympathetic magic. Like a pho-tograph, the image of her footprint which had been gathered up would serve as a kind of double or \"stand-in\" for the grandmother and the shadow-soulwould come to the mesa because of it. Once her shadow-soul presented itself,the sorcerer would have persuaded one of his allies\u2014probably an \u00e1nima or spirit of the dead\u2014to imprison the grandmother's shadow so that it couldn'treturn to her body. The hueso de muerto given to the neighbor would be froma cadaver whose spirit had been unable to rise to heaven because of sins com-mitted in this life. Ingesting this powder would seal the bond between thegrandmother's shadow-soul and that of the \u00e1nima, so that her shadow-soulwould not be able to return to her body. If her soul were not released withina set amount of time by the magical interventions of a healer, the result of thisforced separation would be sickness and death. Accordingly, her symptomswould reflect the kind of sorcery she had ingested. Because her shadow-soulwas tied to that of a cadaver, she would become more and more emaciated andcadaver-like as her conditions worsened. The Reaction As I had done in previous terms, after finishing the story I looked aroundthe room and tried to read my students' reactions. I asked for \"comments,questions, concerns . . . ?\" and let the silence that followed do its work. Onestudent\u2014an anthropology major\u2014suggested that we should not be ethno-centric in our assessment of my friend's belief in sorcery. \"Even if sorcerydoesn't make sense to us, it is part of their culture and we can't judge it byany other standards,\" the student insisted. Then, several others students whowere obviously less indoctrinated in this anthropological paradigm of cul-tural relativism asked what most students in the room want to know when-ever I tell this story. \"Does sorcery really exist or is a patient's suffering just 'in their heads'? Is it the patient's belief in sorcery that actually causes theirReflections on the Experience of Healing: Whose Logic? Whose Experience? 185Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 185affliction or are there really spirit powers that sorcerers and healers manip- ulate? Do you believe in it, Dr. Glass-Coffin?\" The First Response: The Logic of Sorcery These are the questions which underscore my anxiety when I present this material to my students. In part, the anxiety arises from the fact that I have noready answers. The scientic method does not easily lend itself to measuringthe activity of spirit entities and whether observable consequences result from\"good\" or \"evil\" intentions. Translating belief into seemingly culture-freephysiological consequences attributed to placebo and nocebo effects may sat-isfy the interrogator as to the mechanisms by which sorcery and healing aretranslated into body function, but it doesn't negate the fact that underlyingcauses for cultural belief may, in fact, exist in the \"real\" world. Neither does itexplain how sorcery can affect the unbeliever. 1Also, such reductionistic responses undermine the very anthropological contributions to human understanding that makes our discipline important. Specically, anthropological theory and practice has shown the power of cultural belief and tradition in shaping perceptions, not only of our \"inform- ants\" but also of the researcher and the audience.2As Richard Robbins ( 1997, 80-87) has shown, magic is invoked to explain physical events because ofselective perception, rationalization, secondary elaboration, and appeals tofaith, mystery, or authority. Tanya Luhrmann ( 1989) has used the term \"inter- pretive drift\" to label the process by which people come to view magic as anefcacious and rational explanation of events (even in the face of contradic-tory evidence). According to her analysis, interpretive drift includes three ele-ments, which might be summarized as perceptual or cognitive, affective, andintellectual or analytical. In her model, a ritual participant experiences somekind of catharsis, revelation, insight, or direct numinous experience that pro-vides emotional rather than cognitive certainty of veracity. Whether preced-ing, concurrent, or as a consequence of this experience, the participant alsoexperiences basic shifts in perception and analysis of observable events, andconcludes that human will or spirit power has, indeed, influenced these.Finally, the participant seeks intellectual strategies to explain the phenomenonexperienced that minimizes dissonance or disjunction between magical andscientic explanations of observable consequences. In the account described above (as well as the scores of stories I have been told by victims in the twenty-plus years since my rst encounter with Peruviansorcery), interpretive drift can be used to make sense of sorcery as follows: 3an individual experiences some kind of suffering and attempts to relieve the186 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 186symptoms. If symptoms are somatic, and if the victim has had no previous experience with sorcery, he or she will rst rely on home remedies or pharma-ceutical products and will seek information about how to alleviate the symp-toms from family, friends, or health care professionals. If symptoms do notsubside after exhausting all biomedical resources, the victim will pragmatical-ly seek other alternatives. In the search for explanation, the victim will likely beurged by someone who has had a similar experience with symptoms that didnot respond to medical treatment to consider sorcery as a possibility. 4 When they visit a curandero, these suspicions are likely to be conrmed. During the ritual curing session, the healer will often describe how another'senvy or unexpressed hostilities towards the victim led them to seek out theservices of a sorcerer to cause the suffering. If the narrative ts the victim'salready conscious suspicions, or brings to consciousness previously unac-knowledged anxieties, the victim will likely experience both catharsis andinsight. If the victim did not previously believe in the power of spirits and theevil intentions of family and friends, he or she will probably experience a tem-porary shift in worldview to accommodate these possibilities. Then, depend-ing on the victim's faith in the healer's ability to undo the sorcery and effect acure, expectations may be raised, and a wholehearted embrace of the healer'sinstructions may take place, replacing resignation to suffering with hope anda determination to overcome. 5 Of course, this process of interpretive drift is not limited to a discussion of the efcacy of shamanic healing for explaining otherwise unexplainablesuffering (sorcery) and healing (via participation in a healer's mesa). Similar\"shifts\" seem to occur in all kinds of \"symbolic\" healing including psy-chotherapy (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1963;S c h e f f 1979;A c h t e r b e r g 1985;D o w 1986 ;T o r r e y 1986 ). Regardless of healing tradition, these cognitive, affective, and analytical shifts generally include the following elements: rst, there is acceptance ofboth the illness label and the etiology that an expert assigns to the experienceof suffering. Second, the victim experiences emotional engagement or cathar-sis. This leads to an experiential change in consciousness associated with\"insight\" or \"revelation\" about the cause of affliction as well as to condencein the chosen healer and expectation of cure. Finally, the victim's new sense ofinsight and condence in the healer who facilitated this shift in awarenessleads the victim to have a sense of mastery over the illness. Thus, interpretive drift provides a very rational explanation for seem- ingly irrational belief and practice (Luhrmann 1989 ,7). However, when researchers invoke this process as a means of dismissing the veracity of magicor the potential harm of sorcery, they sometimes underplay the fact that all paradigms\u2014including the kind of observational positivism commonly,Reflections on the Healing: 9/9/03 as \"science\"\u2014limit perception. Just as Evans-Pritchard suggested for the magically oriented Nuer (1956), our paradigms work to keep us from hav- ing to face contradiction. The following example will sufce to illustrate this point. In a recent article, C. Roderick Wilson ( 1994 ) recounts how one informant, when asked to describe a strongly bluish color card with an indigenous color term,described the card as \"leaf-colored.\" Wilson and a fellow researcher had seenmany leaves in the months they had spent with these people but they hadnever seen blue ones. So, they asked the man to demonstrate just where he hadseen a leaf of that color. Without rising, the informant pointed to some treeson a faraway hillside and the two social scientists had to admit that the colormatched perfectly. Wilson describes his point as follows: As members of scientically oriented North American culture, [we] \"knew\" that forested hillsides that appear to be bluish or purplish are infact \"normal\" green. Moreover, we both knew that the apparent colorchange has to do with such phenomena as the diffraction of light, the exis-tence of particulate matter in the air, and so on. T o put it another way, wecarried around with us scientic explanations of natural phenomena thatallowed us to \"normalize\" observations, to bring observations that rancounter to the usual into conformity with the expected. I have no seriousdoubt that these particular \"scientic\" explanations are essentially correct.But still, I am concerned about the fact that my vision is so \"normalized\"that I could not see what was literally in front of my face. ( 1994, 199) The Second Response: The Logistics of Sorcery While the above paragraphs make sense of magic by problematizing reason, an alternative view has been to assert that the practice of magic has more todo with logistics than with logic. Advanced by social scientists, this responsesidesteps altogether a discussion of the relationship between belief and prac-tice. (It can also provide the anxious professor a way to avoid the questionabout what he or she personally thinks). Instead, this response looks at the utility of cultural beliefs for solving real-world problems. The \"functionalists\" assert that magic provides explanations for the otherwise unexplainable or manages the tension between individual desire and social imperative. The\"structuralists\" assert that magic is invoked to explain and to give shape to anotherwise incoherent reality. The \"symbolists\" contend that magic ismetaphor\u2014a way of expressing meaning poetically. 6 In the Peruvian case, functional views of sorcery draw attention to the conflict between erce competition for limited resources and the structured188 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 188relations of social dependence. In this light, sorcery is seen as a projective mechanism for inexpressible hostilities. Alternatively, because the fear of sor-cery can help diffuse expressions of conflict between the individually desir-able and the socially necessary, it has been considered a means of socialcontrol. Structural views of sorcery (with their predilection for illuminating the dichotomous categories of deep structure and how these are glossed withmeaning) focus on the way Peruvians have accommodated tensions betweenpre-Columbian and post-conquest worldviews. Before the arrival ofCatholicism in the mid 1500s and before the ensuing campaigns to \"extirpate idolatries,\" pre-Columbian cosmologies explained dualism in natural, social,and spiritual relations in terms of a moral code that was both complementa-ry and ambiguous. Both order and chaos, good and evil, culture and nature,man and woman (or any other paired opposite that can be named) were nec-essary for the proper functioning of the universe. But after the Spanish con-quest, an imposed Christian paradigm viewed these universal forces asabsolute and contradictory. Both \"good\" and \"evil\" were reied, and Peruviansorcery\u2014at least as we know it today\u2014was born. Symbolic views of sorcery provide outsiders with a means of \"teasing apart\" the absolute and the relative in human existence. Suffering and, ulti-mately, death are universal phenomena, but they are expressed (and experi-enced) in widely different ways cross-culturally. Symbolic studies of sorceryfocus on the meaning that is given to these experiences in specic contexts(physical, social, economic, and political). Thus, they give outsiders insightinto the key role played by culture for shaping, contesting, and resistingresponses to these realities. But implicit in all these strategies\u2014whether functional, structural, or symbolic\u2014is an assertion of cultural relativism that smacks of ethnocentrism.Beneath the apparent epistemological generosity of the relativist argumentlies a dangerous disclaimer\u2014what may be true for others is not at all true for ourselves . T o draw again from Wilson's article on the subject, he reports the following curious phenomenon: when he brought a Cree medicine man to hisclassroom to discuss illness etiologies and healing cosmologies, he notes thathis students listened with rapt attention and respect. But when he later sug-gested that shamanic practices are dynamic\u2014that they have a pragmatic basisfor their continued practice and should therefore be considered scientically,his students patently denied this possibility. As he concludes, \"Beliefs or prac-tices which can be accorded respect by reasonably enlightened people whenencountering aboriginal populations are dismissed from serious considera-tion within our own intellectual tradition . . . the moment an attempt is madeReflections on of Healing: Whose Logic? Whose Experience? 189Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 189to bring alien beliefs and practices into the arena of scientic investigation, one is dismissed as a crank\" (Wilson 1994 ,201). The Third Response: Intersubjectivity in Logic and Experience What alternatives exist to \"explaining away\" that which is beyond our visionas delusion, as metaphor, or as simply functionally proscribed? The authors ofa recent collection on the anthropology of extraordinary experience recom-mend taking sacred worldviews seriously. They also ask researchers to enter-tain the possibility that an informant's explanation of an extraordinaryexperience might be true instead of dismissing their accounts a priori as fan-tasy or superstition. This is not the same as wholeheartedly accepting theseaccounts without skepticism\u2014which is tantamount to \"going native\" andwhich negates our ability to translate responses to other audiences. Neither isit the same thing as stepping outside our paradigms when interpreting theworld around us, for this is a difcult, if not impossible, task (Pandian 1985). But this response demands awareness that allexplanations, including our own, are limited by paradigmatic persuasions. One way to challenge our own perceptions and to come to a closer real- ization of the intersections of paradigm and practice is through extendedeldwork and rsthand experience of the kinds of phenomena which ourinformants explain in magical terms. This approach to ethnographic researchhas been termed \"experiential\" (Goulet and Y oung 1994 ,304) or \"radically empirical\" (Jackson 1989). The rationale for this kind of eldwork stems part- ly from the assertion that personal experience \"becomes a mode of experi-mentation, of testing and exploring the ways in which our experiences conjoinor connect us with others, rather than the ways they set us apart\" (Goulet andY oung 1994 ,305). In other words, by living and doing as our informants do, we may at least approximate what it is like to see the world through their eyes.By using ourselves as \"primary data,\" we become able to comment on thatwhich is not observable, except through our own experience. In short, experi-ential eldwork allows us to explore the possibility (also raised by Luhrmann)that people come to believe in the reality of magic after experiencing effective results rather than the other way around. If an experiential approach to eldwork allows us to, at least temporar- ily, step into a new physical (and phenomenological) space, it also moves us toconclude that reality is shaped somewhere in the interstices between externalevent and the perception or meaning given it. As Goulet and Y oung put it,interpretation and understanding certainly go hand in hand with that of190 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 190\"experience\" ( 1994 ,313). They give the analogy of language acquisition to illus- trate their point: In the context of repeated and prolonged exposure to members of a lin- guistic community, a process of assimilation occurs, involving a level ofschemata formation of which even the individual who is assimilating thelanguage is unaware. The anthropologist comes to live, as it were, in anacoustic world distinct from that which prevails in his or her own cul-ture. Similarly the anthropologist may come to inhabit other domains ofthe native speaker's society, be it kinship, economic, or ritual, attendingto socially constituted realities that would otherwise remain beyond hisor her reach. ( 1994 ,314) In other words, meaning is \"intertwined with intersubjectivity, and communication codes can best be understood in performances where the meaning is created.\"7 In my own eldwork with northern Peruvian shamans, I came to real- ize how the intersections of ontological structure, perceived meaning, and intersubjectivity change the lives of both the researcher and the research sub-ject one sunny day in November 1988. On that occasion, an amber-colored bottle that occupied a central space on the healing altar of my primary informant broke. In terms of the event itself, the breakage was a direct resultof her taking out the mesa on a day I had asked to photograph the sacredobjects on her altar. Had I not intervened in her life, the bottle would nothave broken (at least, not at that particular time). At the time of the break-age, she and I both assumed the event to be of little signicance. But sixmonths later, while under the influence of the psychoactive San Pedro cactus,she learned that the breakage of that little bottle would shorten her life spanby one-third. She exhorted me on that occasion to \"make something of yourlife, so that this event, which has shortened my life and for which you wereresponsible, will not have been for nothing.\" Her invocation has stayed withme as a touchstone since that day and has had a profound impact on everyaspect of my existence. Finally, to return to the question of the definition of \"rational\" scien- tific inquiry and the way this is often contrasted with \"irrational\" claims of the veracity of magic, I would remind the reader that, at its root, the scien-tific method is empirical and that empiricism is based as much in experienceas in observation. As Ken Wilber suggests in his latest work, scientificinquiry does not necessarily preclude a serious investigation of the numi-nous. Instead of dismissing that which is difficult to measure or observe asReflections on the Experience of Healing: Whose 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 191patently \"unscientific,\" we should seek new ways to measure, replicate, and validate empirical experiences that go beyond those available to a detached,\"objective\" observer. Conclusion: Experience Reconsidered So, what does all this have to do with the question that my students ask and myanxieties about answering it? Does sorcery really exist? And how does it work? Is it \"just\" a question of belief and of neuropsychological processes that resultfrom emotional engagement with a set of symbols? Or is there \"really\" someessential, yet largely invisible, force that certain individuals have the ability to tapinto in order to alter the physical world? And, if this force is nonexistent, why dowe have so many recorded instances of so-called supernatural phenomena in folklore and in the anthropological record (Walker 1995)? Called things like god, devil, vital energy, psi, or electromagnetism depending on the worldviews of theone doing the labeling, there are multiple millions of people who share suchbeliefs. Have they all been duped? In other words, do psychological theories ofprojective mechanisms, sociological theories of functionalism and social controlmechanisms, or cognitive analyses of varying worldviews adequately accountfor the continued practice of magical rituals among otherwise rational (andhighly literate, technologically sophisticated) people? Based on my own dissertation eldwork with female curanderas from 1987 to 1989, I know that shifts in perception are personally unconvincing if not accompanied by direct experience. I also know that the reality of magicexists somewhere between the ontology of structure and the inscription ofmeaning. Did I undergo interpretive drift while in the eld? Undoubtedly. Didthis interpretive drift influence my perception of external phenomena?Probably. Certainly, I was much more attuned to the night cries of distant ani-mals, the appearance of the night sky, and to meteorological phenomenawhen I left Peru in 1989 than when I rst arrived. I also reconceptualized my own attitudes and values while in the eld based on the moral principles of\"good\" and \"evil\" which I saw in others (and experienced in myself). I waschanged by my eldwork and I saw sorcery change the lives of many otherpeople. But during my stay in this enchanted country, I also saw phenomena that I cannot explain, and experienced states that I cannot replicate. I know them tobe true as certainly as I know the color of the leaves on the trees outside myofce window. Among these events, I have seen a healer produce rain in acloudless sky and I have also seen the rain cease instantly when commanded. Ihave witnessed the extinguishing of starlight in the night sky as if at the touch192 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 192of a light switch.8I have seen visions, both under the influence of hallucino- gens and in what has been called an \"ordinary\" state of consciousness. I also know that I interpret these shared experiences differently than do either the healers or the victims of sorcery that I worked with. This is so because the meaning I give to life experiences comes from my own stock ofknowledge which has been gathered in the course of a lifetime of events thatpredate as well as postdate my immersion into the ethnographic experience.My understanding is as Wagner ( 1981,12) has suggested. words, \"what the analogies he createsare extensions of his own notions and those of his culture, transformed by hisexperiences in the eld situation.\" 9Because I have no cultural logic with which to attach these experiences I nd sorcery a difcult concept to grasp ata phenomenological level. Thus, when students ask if sorcery exists, I usually hesitate and then answer in the afrmative, or admit that I do not yet know. For, to suggest thatsorcery only exists at the intersection of meaning and experience seems tooreminiscent of the culturally relative response that explains away the relevanceof sorcery with arguments of functionalism, structuralism, or metaphoricmeaning. But to assert that sorcery exists because I experienced phenomenawhich I can't explain both violates phenomenological principles of my ownparadigms and falls short of the standards of validity and reliability which mystudents mainly share. And so, until I can articulate a model for explainingsorcery that makes sense both to me and to my students without violating theclaims of my informants, 10my \"ninth-week anxiety\" will not (and should not) abate. My students will have to learn to live with the ambiguities of empiri-cism. And, as researchers, we should continue to consider the role of experi-ence in anthropology\u2014as both science and interpretive discipline. Notes I extend my heartfelt thanks to Erika Brady, David Hufford, Bonnie O'Connor, Barre T oelken, Barbara Walker, and all the ne faculty fellows of the Fife FolkloreConferences who have inspired my thinking on this topic over the years. T oMaruja Barrig, Mario Chiappe, Luis Guerrero, and all the other investigators whohave contributed to our understanding of Peruvian sorcery, I also extend mythanks. I am also immensely grateful to all the Peruvians, healers, patients, friends,and \"family,\" who have shared their lives with me (and, thus, become part of myReflections on the Experience of Healing: Whose Logic? Whose Experience? 9/9/03 11:43 AM Page 193life) over the last twenty-ve years. Finally, my thanks to Joralemon and Sharon for including me in a grant which made my dissertation research possible and tothe many colleagues and students and various Utah State University ofces whichhave since supported and encouraged my research.1. Although the people I interviewed (both patients and healers) assert that belief in the power of sorcerers and healers certainly underlies the petition-er's susceptibility to harm and likelihood of a cure, I also encountered manypatients who claimed to experience the effects of sorcery before they ever believed in its power. In fact, a common disclaimer among rst-time patientsto healers was that \"I never believed in sorcery until it happened to me.\" 2. For a good review of the scope of anthropological responses to \"magic,\" see Luhrmann from which the fol- lowing summary is drawn. 3. The following summary is based on my own research (Glass-Cofn 1984) in urban and peri-urban Trujillo, where multiple health resources are readilyavailable. In rural areas, where access to biomedical resources is more limit-ed, alternative health care options tend to be invoked earlier in the process ofhealth decision making. 4. For reasons I have more fully described elsewhere (Glass-Cofn 1991), sorcery beliefs are common in northern Peru. One element of this belief asserts thatthere exist two categories of illness\u2014those with natural causes and thosecaused by sorcery. While the former are best cured by a doctor, the latternever respond to biomedical intervention. If symptoms are not somatic, butrather economic (a thriving business suddenly fails), relational (a familymember suddenly becomes abusive or distant), or affective (one experiencesan otherwise unaccountable change in behavior or personality), the victimwill likely suspect sorcery as the cause of their sudden turn of bad luck earlyin the diagnostic process. 5. Of course, it is difcult to unravel whether this felt experience of healing pre- cedes or follows these changes in perception and emotional engagement.Most theories of symbolic healing (discussed following) suggest that theemotional engagement precedes the physical consequence, but I am inclinedto support Luhrmann's suggestion that belief often follows practice. I say thisbecause of the number of people I have encountered in Peru who assure methat they never would have believed in sorcery as an explanation for theirafflictions if they hadn't experienced it directly for themselves. Certainly,belief and practice, experience and analysis are mutually important ingredi-ents when considering the efcacy of symbolic healing. 6. For a good introduction to these orientations in anthropological theory, see Langness ( 1987). In the following text, I have summarized functional, struc- tural, and symbolic contributions of over fty years of research into northernPeruvian sorcery in other publications. For discussion, see Glass-Cofn (1991 , 1996, 1998,1999 ).194 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 1947.

These perceptions were not experienced alone, but in the company of other patients and ritual participants. Additionally, the rain incidents occurred before the start of the ritual, and before the ingestion of any psychoactivesubstances that might alter perception. The starlight incident occurred afterthe ritual was in progress, but was simultaneously commented on by at leasta dozen other ritual participants at the instant of its occurrence. 9.

Y oung and The Logic of Navajo Healing Barre Toelken before entering into this discussion, I need to make clear that these com- ments and observations are not made by a Navajo but by a non-Navajo who has spent more than forty years as an adopted member of a Navajo fam-ily, the Y ellowmans. This does not confer on me any special right to speak foror represent the Navajos in general or the Y ellowman family in particular; itdoes not entitle me to dispense Navajo ritual \"secrets,\" or to claim that I amproviding the reader with an inside view of Navajo spiritual healing. Indeed, Iregard all books by non-Natives which make such claims to be exploitativeand destructive frauds. This essay does not offer anything more complicatedthan some perspectives formed from years of acquaintance, respect, and lovefor the people who rst became known to me when they saved my life (I hadcome down with pneumonia while camped near their home in MontezumaCreek Canyon in southeastern Utah). They made the simple (but expensive)decision to hire a hataal ii, literally, a singer or chanter, to treat my illness. At that moment, I was transformed from a stranger to a guest, from an odd prospector camping nearby in a flimsy tent to a familiar, coughing, fever-ridden resident in their one-room hoghan; from a hopeful employer ofNavajo guides to a panicked consumer of Navajo medicine; from a harmlesscuriosity to a burden and a health threat; from a benevolent exploiter ofNavajos to a desperate participant-observer of Navajo culture\u2014a prime can-didate, in other words, for achieving an experience-centered perspective onhealing whether I wanted to or not. Little Wagon, the elderly father-in-law of Hugh Y ellowman, had dropped by at my camp a number of times to squint at all the strange equipment and to /ornament21 197/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 197satisfy himself that indeed there was a white person who was actually being paid to look for ts\u00e9(stones) in the desert. One day he found me barely able to sit up (my prospecting partner had gone to Salt Lake City some days before), andpromptly (and roughly) hauled me to the back end of his wagon, dumped mein, and later\u2014with a witty remark about having bagged a bilag\u00e1ana (white person)\u2014deposited me at the feet of his white-haired wife, who looked away witha stricken \"Oh, God, now there's one right here in our own home\" expression. Little Wagon's daughter, Helen, and her husband, Y ellowman, and several of their children also lived in the large, circular traditional hoghan (which ismade of logs, branches, and rocks, covered with mud). The four adults and sixchildren (sometimes more, when the older ones were home from boardingschool) were now joined in their cozy circle by a sick man. Why did they take mein? Why did they go to the considerable expense of bringing in, rst, a diagnos-tician, and then a hataal ii? What did he do for me, medically, and how did it all work out? These are not only questions which I posed to myself at the time, but they are also important medical and cultural questions which lead us to someinteresting observations about the validity of another form of healing. In tryingto account for and understand what happened to me personally, I willy-nilly haveto make sense of Navajo healing logic\u2014or else conclude that I was coincidental- ly healed by a chance group of ignorant and untrained Indians. Naturally, in this case, it would be easier to end this account with the line used by so many story-tellers and yarn-spinners when their young audiences demand, \"What happenedthen, Grandpa?\"\"Well, I died.\" But it's a bit more difcult to account for an expe-rience which initially makes no sense in one's own mind: in order to achieve anunderstanding, one must do what all folklorists and anthropologists do, and thatis to place the event fairly within the supporting frameworks of its own cultureto nd out not only what it \"means,\" but how it means. An experience-centereddiscussion, then, is not simply an exercise in self-indulgent validation of the par-ticipant-observer method, but rather must be viewed as an attempt to clarify andaccount for ( 1) an occurrence one might otherwise not have witnessed or been conscious of except for having been a participant, ( 2) utilizing the perspectives and nuances of the experience itself (not invented or imposed by the observer),(3) in a way that is true to the logical constellations of those among whom the event occurred and who understand its principal parts, and (perhaps most dif-cult of all) ( 4) articulated in such a way that the participant-observer brings the whole concept across as illustrative of something worth learning. It does us nogood for someone to describe a fascinating cultural encounter and then just dropthe subject as if it's just too, too impossible to grapple with. A serious account of this sort entails the responsibility to report not only the event's surface features, but to examine fairly the system of thinking and198 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 198believing that renders the cultural occurrence normal and valid rather than inexplicable or nonsensical. An experience-centered discussion of Navajohealing requires me to look seriously at their assumptions about health andsickness, and it should provide me with a level of understanding which lies atleast as close to their voice as it does to my theory. In my attempt to makesense of the way my adopted family healed me, I began by asking questions ofthe singer, and I had the luxury of augmenting my perceptions in ongoingconversations with the Little Wagon and Y ellowman families. These perspec-tives have been enlarged through the years by a continual return to issueswhich were not quite clear to me, and slowly by this means, a traumatic per-sonal experience has yielded a tremendous richness of insight into Navajoworldview. One of several things I have learned in this process is that experi-ence-centered discovery can be profound; another is that it apparently neverincludes closure on the ramications of the subject. Another is that suchlearning is not bounded or controlled by deadlines: the pace is measured inyears, not in months. In 1954, I began the process by asking the hataal ii what it was he had done; I am still processing the layers of information and cultur-al nuance as I write this essay. A hataal ii is the cultural equivalent of our doctor, but is often referred to in English by the primitive term \"medicine man.\" Sufce it to say, neither theterm nor the practitioner is limited by gender. Most singers are indeed men, but this is mostly due to the years it takes an apprentice to learn a ceremonyfully. There is no impediment to a woman becoming a singer, but sincewomen own the children, the home, and most of the livestock, they seldomcare to leave their position of power (where a husband can be divorced sim-ply by his wife leaving his personal effects outside the door) to follow someolder singer around\u2014with little or no pay\u2014for twenty years or so learningthe words, tunes, rituals, sand paintings, and medicines necessary to the mas-tery of any one of the several hundred healing \"ways\" employed in Navajohealing. Besides, as several Navajo women have told me, men need somethingimportant to do in the world. Actually, there are several kinds of healers in addition to the singers: diagnosticians (the most common employ hand trembling [ ndishniih ], or crystal gazing [d\u00e9est'\u00ed\u00ed' '\u00e1shl\u00e9\u00e9h ]), who determine not only what ailment the patient has, but what particular ritual would offer the most appropriateresponse; herbalists, whose own expertise is shared with singers and with oth-ers in need of a symptomatic cure (a colleague of mine, a sociologist doingeld research on the Navajo reservation, came down with a sudden asthmaticcondition and was cured immediately by a Navajo woman who had an herbalremedy on hand); and rare, talented practitioners who act somewhat like faithThe H\u00f3zh\u00f3 Factor: The Logic of Navajo Healing 199Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 199healers. Only the last of these would come anywhere near the standard deni- tion of shaman, by strict denition a person who\u2014usually by having died andcome back to life\u2014has the magical or personal power to affect the health ofothers (for better or for worse). Shamans are rare in Navajo culture except for the yenaaldlooshi (literal- ly \"evil trotting canine-like\"), the Navajo embodiment of evil, or \"skinwalker\"as such a person is usually called in English. This is a Navajo who studies akind of reverse medicine which is used to injure or kill others in the belief thatin so doing the perpetrator gains personal health, power, or property. There isno doubt that there are such people: I have met a few of them and have seenthe results of their work. While stories about them make up much of the leg-endary repertoire of young Navajos, the yenaaldlooshi themselves are not typ-ical of Navajo medical thought (except insofar as they validate Navajo beliefsby contrast, working in opposition to the kinds of healing logic I will discussin this paper). That's as much as I want to say or think about the skinwalkers;I do not care to come any closer to them than reading about them in a T onyHillerman novel. Most Navajo healers, from informal herbalists to carefullypracticed singers, learn their profession through years of intense education inand memorization of medicines, songs, arts, psychology, and ritual practice.It's medicine, not magic, and it constitutes the core of Navajo religious prac-tice in general, since virtually every Navajo ritual focuses on a patient and asinger-doctor. Of course, I did not know any of this in the winter of 1954, as I lay\u2014 dying, I supposed\u2014on the dirt floor of Little Wagon's family's hoghan.Coughing uncontrollably one night, I was nudged by Y ellowman, who wastrying to offer me something out of a small container, shining a small flash-light's yellow beam on it so I could see what it was. It was a tin of Sucretscough lozenges, but how it got into that remote canyon\u2014or how long it hadbeen there\u2014was a complete mystery to me. Y ellowman kept saying, \" Nizee'! Nizee'! \" which means \"your medicine,\" but\u2014because of the tonal possibilities in Navajo which allow for puns in almost any circumstance\u2014also means\"your mouth,\" or, \"shut up!\" Leaning on my elbow in the dark hoghan, I unwrapped one of the cough drops and got it into my mouth. My next memory is of waking\u2014apparently aday or so later, also at night\u2014and sensing that the hoghan was full of people.I had been dragged or carried to the west side of the hoghan opposite thedoor. I noticed that the door was open, the space lled by a white sheet thatbillowed back and forth as the wind blew outside. Next to my head sat a manI didn't recognize, singing a chant I didn't understand. From somewhere elsein the hoghan I could hear another voice or two joining in. Occasionally, some200 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 200bitter liquid was poured in my mouth, and I was at least partly relieved to see that the bowl was then passed around so everyone else could share its con-tents. But I remember thinking I must be at the end of things; I would die inthis roadless desert canyon and my folks in Massachusetts would never knowthe details. As I learned later on, the ceremony which had now focused on me was the Red Antway, which had been recommended by the hand trembler diag-nostician during a previous ceremony held while I was unconscious or asleep.Red Antway is usually used for lower intestinal complaints and maladies asso-ciated in Navajo custom with inadvertently breaking the taboo against urinat-ing on ant hills, so why it was chosen for my upper respiratory problems Icannot say. My Navajo family later suggested that perhaps my camp had dis-turbed the ants somehow, and that was why the imagery came to the handtrembler. The ceremony made constant (and very effective) use of emetics,accompanied by songs which described evils being expelled from my lips, andso there was also the possibility that the ceremony was aimed at some form ofwitchery which had affected me. Later, I was told that the purgatives which made me vomit onto sand paintings of Horned T oad were expelling Red AntPeople (later rephrased as \"antness\") from me. There was a succession of sand paintings depicting variously colored Ant People, Horned T oad, Sunray Girl, Pollen People, and Corn People (all ofthem icons of sacred living aspects of nature). I was bathed several times withyucca suds, required to crawl through a succession of hoops outside thehoghan door, and on one occasion was frightened out of my wits by the sud-den appearance of a \"bear,\" a man blackened with soot and decorated withbear footprints who jumped at me from concealment behind a blanket.Although the Red Antway often lasts for eight or nine nights, mine ended onthe morning of the sixth day, and was followed by a short protection rite fromthe Blessingway. My fever was gone and, although I was too weak to walkaround much, I was able to breathe better and was coughing less each day. Now, in terms of medicines, I have no doubt that what I was given to drink, to chew, to swallow whole, and on one occasion to smoke, must have hadactual healing properties. Some of them tasted like pine tar, one concoctionhad a light mold on it and a moldy taste, and the \"mountain tobacco\" I smokedcaused my nose to run uncontrollably and loosened the mucous in my throat. The ritual activities were somewhat more difcult for me to understand, and I cannot claim to this day that I have a full intellectual command of theirlogical principles. But I can come close. Navajo rituals are said to create or torestore the quality of h\u00f3zh\u00f3 , a term which means something like a combina- tion of beauty, stability, balance, and harmony. The medicines are believed toThe H\u00f3zh\u00f3 Factor: The Logic of Navajo Healing 201Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 201have the capacity of addressing the symptoms of illness, but not of curing the illness itself more than supercially, for it is thought to be the direct result ofimbalances and disharmonies brought about by accident, by inattention toproper behavior, by reckless or immoderate actions (including excessive com-petitiveness), or by the ill will of others (including skinwalkers). The sand paintings used during the ceremonies provide visual icons of the natural forces one must heed in order to be receptive to the restoration ofbalance and harmony; the songs and prayers (usually characterized byquadruple repetition of phrase, color, and action representing the four cardi-nal directions) set up a vocal context of redundant, interactive, circular pat-terns which are thought to reestablish normal reciprocative balances in themind of the patient. Characters like the Red Ant People (living beings of thevery rst world in the Navajo Emergence story) represent the basic naturalsubterranean powers that epitomize the earth's \"inner being,\" for which thosewho live on the surface constitute the \"outer being\" (yet another balanced, rec-iprocative model for natural relationships). When the patient is placed on asand painting, he or she actually becomes part of, indeed an actor in, thissacred icon; when the colored sands are swept up and thrown away outsidebefore sundown, the focused symbols are atomized, returned to their general-ized presence in the universe, and the patient thus envisions the sickness, too,physically being taken out of the hoghan and redistributed in the worldinstead of concentrated in the individual. Movement within the hoghan isalways circular, almost always sunwise. In other words, virtually all actions,words, tunes, movements, colors, and places are phrased in such a way as actu-ally to articulate and dramatize the desired condition of balance for the patient (and by extension, all those present) in the setting of the natural worldand universe. This reestablishment of h\u00f3zh\u00f3 is no more beautifully expressedthan in the songs sung at dawn on each morning of the ceremony, with greatdetail on the last morning: the dawn is rst described as a horizontal thinwhite line (indeed what the very rst moment of dawn looks like in thedesert); then dawn is depicted as spreading, then moving upwards, then pass-ing overhead, then becoming complete; then the sunrise itself is described asit moves to completion; and then\u2014in the formula so familiar to students ofthe Navajo\u2014h\u00f3zh\u00f3, or beauty, is described as spreading out around us in alldirections, ahead of us, behind us, on all sides of us, above us and below us;nally, beauty has settled everywhere around us. T o understand the impact of such imagery on Navajos (of course it's admittedly powerful for anyone), we need to remember that Navajos do notsee language as merely describing reality: rather, language creates the reality inwhich we live. With these images being sung close behind you, you experience202 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 202the moment of dawn as the conclusion of a healing ritual and the symbol of restoration (in fact, in some ceremonies, like the H\u00f3zh\u00f3-j\u00ed , or Beauty Way, the patient faces the dawn at the moment the thin white line appears and actual-ly \"breathes it in\"); it is a powerful combination of personal experience andthe ritual articulation of restoration. This intersection of ritual, language, action, and reality is rarely found in Anglo-American medical practice, or at least so the Navajos feel. In fact, tra-ditional Native people often encounter its principles in macabre reversal whenthey visit a non-Navajo medical doctor. Blood and urine samples, skin scrap-ings, and other \"specimens\" are taken away into other rooms (just what skin-walkers might do with them); long objects like needles, tongue depressors,thermometers, and doctors' ngers are pointed at them in gestures exactly likethose which indicate an intention to kill; and language is directed at them forits information capacity, not for its restorative powers. T o be sure, times havechanged, and Navajo people have been abroad in the world enough to havebecome sophisticated about such things: they may register such outragestoday more as impolite behavior than as traumatic miscarriages of healingpower. Nonetheless, especially for older patients, the aggregate impact of\"Anglo medicine\" can be quite frightening. And if it is true that the psycho-logical state of the patient has a substantial effect on the healing process, wecan say that much of what passes as healing logic for non-Navajos not onlystrikes the Navajos as deranged and dangerous, but indeed becomes an actualimpediment to healing. In this regard, I cannot think of a better example of the power of lan- guage to inhibit healing than the time I was asked to visit a physician to ndout why he was \"trying to kill\" his elderly Navajo patient. The old man hadrefused to go back to his doctor, and indeed appeared close to terried even atthe thought of it. The doctor's opinion was that the old man was endangeringhis own life by stubbornly refusing to take his medicine regularly (he wasbeing treated for diabetes).\"I told him right out, if he didn't take his medicine,he was going to die.\" I pointed out that in the worldviews of many Native peo-ples, speaking of something created a reality, and that probably the old manhad been frightened by the doctor's phrasing. \"Well, what am I supposed todo? Hug him and tell him he's a wonderful old man and just let him die? Myobligation is to tell him the truth: and the truth is, if he doesn't take his med-icine, he's going to die.\" I said, \"Why couldn't you tell him: 'If you do take yourmedicine, you're going to live and be with your grandchildren'?\" \"Neverthought of that,\" he said. I mention this episode not only because it illustrateshow language may function differently in such situations (in one case, the lan-guage is a vehicle of information\u2014sterile, incontrovertible fact; in 203Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 203language is a creative, powerful force which actually had a palpable impact on the patient), but also to show how near we often are to each other withoutrealizing it. Worldview differences can sometimes act like walls, but moreoften they are veils; realizing this might lead us to see these differences as excit-ing resources rather than as problems. A psychiatrist doing research on the psychological dimensions of Navajo healing once remarked to a group of friends that while he was interviewing anelderly medicine man he himself had suddenly received something just shortof a visionary experience. The old man was in the midst of recalling how manyyears he had \"followed,\" studied under, various elderly singers, each of whomin his own lifetime had spent years learning the words, songs, medicines, andritual movements of several healing ceremonies. The old singer noted howdifcult it had been to learn all the phrasing exactly, so that the depth ofknowledge and power in the ceremonies would not erode over the years. Thepsychologist-researcher suddenly realized that he was listening to an oralaccount of unbroken medicinal and psychological practice and theory whichhad already been ancient when Freud and Jung were developing the moderneld of psychology in which he himself had been trained. Doctors at the Indian Health Service hospital in Tuba City, Arizona, told me that they had started \"allowing\" Navajo chanters to visit patients in thehospital, in the hopes that hearing a trusted and familiar voice would makethem feel more at home and relaxed. Indeed it did, and the doctors had a sensethat healing rates and successful treatments had gone up. They were not pre-pared to discover one day that the chanters also were able to bring Navajos outof comas almost every time (unless there had been massive brain damage). Achanter would sit at the head of the patient's bed and quietly sing and talk tothe comatose Navajo for hours on end, taking a break now and again, until theperson came out of the coma. I am not aware of any formal study being madeof this process, but one doctor friend of mine said that his impression was thatthe chanters had about an 80percent rate of success. What logic accounts for this? In the absence of data \"readable\" by Western science, we have the tendency to grasp for ideas like \"coincidence,\" but thatwould not account for a score of 80percent\u2014or even 40percent for that mat- ter. The Navajos do have a logic for this phenomenon, and it is based in part ontheir concept of the spirit or soul, n\u00edlch'i, literally wind, air, breeze. This is a liv- ing entity residing within us which relates us to the larger wind outside. It isshaped and mediated by our mouths when we speak (which is one of the rea-sons speaking is thought to have a direct effect on outer reality); but more tothe point, it animates us in ways that are not under our conscious control. Inother words, it functions not only as a life-force which ties us to the rest of204 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 204nature, but it also acts very much like what we call the unconscious. Navajo singers have told me that even when the body is incapacitated (as in a coma) orunconscious (as in sleep), the n\u00edlch'i is still alive and functional as long as thepatient is breathing. The singer contacts the wind-spirit through the patient'sear, and, in effect, encourages it to reanimate the body. I have been told by non-Navajo friends who have experienced comas that they remember much of whatwas said around them, even though they could not respond, so it seems that theexperience is not isolated to Navajos, though the logical assumption that theminds of comatose patients can be reached with therapeutic results is appar-ently more advanced among the Navajos than it is among us. Other culturally constructed phenomena are not so easy to account for. One of the doctors at Tuba City hospital told me about the teenage boy theyhad taken in as a burn victim on one occasion. He had been repairing hismotorcycle, and the gasoline he was using to cut the grease had exploded andburned him over much of his body. He was convinced the incident was noaccident, and that it had been precipitated by an old lady in his neighborhoodwho was suspected of being a witch, a skinwalker. He had accidentally backedinto her propane tank some months earlier, and she had threatened to geteven with him. He begged the doctors and nurses to make sure the old womandid not get to him in the hospital. The doctors assured him they would pro-tect him, assured him the old woman was not a witch, assured him that he wason the mend. His burns, while serious, were responding to treatment, and hewas feeling better every day. Nonetheless, the old woman was discoveredroaming the hospital corridors, and was noisily ejected by the staff on severaloccasions. And while everyone was sure she had never reached the boy's room,he died in his bed suddenly of undetermined causes. The Navajo concept of witchcraft understands it as operating in oppo- sition to healing: it separates and alienates, it kills and injures, it destabilizesand deharmonizes\u2014all usually under the command of someone who thinksto gain power (or revenge) by destroying the health of another. A witch ischaracterized by aggressive behavior, by serious personal competition, by anti-social actions of any sort. The logic of it\u2014especially in contradistinction tothe logic of Navajo healing\u2014is clear enough. But my intellectual appreciationof this neat, bifurcated symmetry does not allow me to penetrate the mysteryof the burned boy in Tuba City. I could dismiss it as one of those many puz-zles I will never understand were it not for the fact that the young man was thefather of my Navajo daughter's rst child, a baby boy who also died inexpli-cably soon after birth. As we might expect, the Navajo assumptions about balance and harmo- ny also work on a much larger scale than just the human. In fact, it seems clearThe H\u00f3zh\u00f3 Factor: The Logic of Navajo Healing 205Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 205to concepts of h\u00f3zh\u00f3, \"harmony,\" \"beauty,\" and \"balance,\" that inform the logic of healing are the local manifestations of conditions thoughtto be ideally present in the whole of the universe. When these balances innature are threatened or destabilized, the result can be devastating for every-one, as was richly illustrated in the Four Corners area in 1993, when healthy Navajos began dying of a mysterious flu-like illness. The Associated Pressquoted local and Indian Health Service doctors who theorized that the \"baf-fling syndrome\" was some kind of plague, and in an attempt to capture theNative perspective, AP quoted Navajo elders' explanations that the illness wasa signal from nature that Navajos were neglecting their traditional values. Scientists discovered that the virus was being carried by rodents, and the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta eventually identied the culprit as thehantavirus, named after the Hantaan River, where an outbreak had causedmany casualties during the Korean War. Apparently, flooding and the bomb-ing campaigns during the war had driven thousands of rodents from theirhomes and into the paths of humans, who picked up the virus from dustwhich carried dried mouse urine and droppings. In 1993 the southwestern United States had experienced unusually heavy and extended rains, one resultof which was that the pinyon trees bore a tremendous harvest of nuts\u2014attracting both the rodents and human gatherers into the same area. Navajo tradition holds that when rodents, especially mice, become so numerous that people become aware of them at night running over their bed-ding, then all clothes and bedding should be immediately taken outside andburned. Navajo singers recalled that in 1918 and 1933 there had been similar years: heavy rains, large pinyon nut harvests, numerous mice, and\u2014as onemight expect\u2014a pulmonary affliction that killed many people. The diseasewas considered to be the result of the imbalance in nature. By ignoring theolder custom of burning clothes and bedding when such an infestationoccurred in 1993, modern Navajos had indeed endangered their lives. And even before the scientists had isolated and identied the virus, the Navajosingers had already placed the event in the context of customary anecdote,oral history, and healing practice\u2014to say nothing of understanding the phe-nomenon in terms of changes in the natural setting. Hantavirus is in fact theresult of environmental imbalances, and is not simply a plague spread byhuman-to-human contact. While the Navajo understanding of this situationcannot be used as a claim that they somehow know something which the restof us do not, it certainly stands as an example of how another culture's logicof health can generate insights as reliable as our own. Some years ago, it was common to see Navajos wearing strings of col- ored glass beads and juniper seeds around their necks Called206 Healing LogicsHealing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 206\"ghost beads\" by white tourists to whom they were also sold in souvenir stands along the highways, these items were called gad bi n\u00e1\u00e1' (literally, \"juniper's eyes\") by the Navajo. It was said that they represented in physical form thenetwork of cooperation and reciprocation which could bring about harmonyand balance in one's life: the juniper tree supplied the berries; the smallground animals collected them, taking them to their burrows and worryingthe cap off one end so they could get to the tiny nut meat inside; the Navajochildren gathered them from the animals' burrows, keeping only those whichhad already been opened (so they would not deprive the animals of food). Thebeads, worn around some part of the body, represented a physical surround-ing by the interactive components of the natural world\u2014the plants, animals,and people. T o wear them was to feel enclosed in a symbol of environmentalbalance, of h\u00f3zh\u00f3. One doesn't see the juniper necklaces as much these days (except on tourists), and I cannot help but feel that their absence from the scene may sig-nal a departure\u2014an apostasy, if you will\u2014from the logical assumptionswhich gave them intense meaning for many previous generations. Sadlyenough, during the hantavirus episode in 1993, many Navajo young people went to their doctors instead of to their singers, no doubt because their will-ingness to accept the validity of their own cultural logic had been underminedor denigrated by the culture around them, the culture which now dominatestheir education, their economy, their environment, and, alas, their sense of sci-ence. It seems to me that one advantage of study in the eld of culturally con-structed medicine\u2014especially in the mode of what David Hufford has called\"experience-centered\" scholarship\u2014is that we can help to foster the idea thatcultural diversity in thinking is neither a virtuous political exercise nor athreat to science but a rich and underestimated source of insight forhumankind in general. Notes A personal essay of the sort attempted here is not dependent on secondary sources which can be footnoted. Nonetheless, a number of works provide further illustra-tion and explanation for basic issues brought up here which have been dealt withmore extensively by scholars of the Navajo, noted by anthropologists and other students of Native American cultures, and reported in the news media. Readersmay wish to consult Leland C. Wyman, The Red Antway of the Navaho (Santa Fe, New Mexico: Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art, 1965) for a fuller description of several versions of the central healing ritual discussed here. The complexity ofThe H\u00f3zh\u00f3 Factor: The Logic of Navajo Healing 207Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 207Navajo language, with special reference to worldview and logical assumptions, is explored by Gary Witherspoon in Language and Art in the Navajo Universe (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1977). A basic and thorough study of Navajo healing thought is Gladys A. Reichard, Navaho Religion: A Study of Symbolism (New Y ork: Bollingen Foundation, 1950; republished in one volume by Princeton University in 1974). The principal healing ritual of the Navajos, from which all others are said to branch, is discussed by Leland C. Wyman in Blessingway (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1970). The idea of cultural apostasy or despiritualization was put forward by Calvin Martin in an essay about the erosiveeffects of European disease and religion on the Micmacs of northeastern Canada,\"The European Impact on the Culture of a Northeastern Algonquian Tribe: AnEcological Interpretation\" (William and Mary Quarterly 31(1974): 3-21). The han- tavirus epidemic was discussed in Associated Press releases across the country inJune 1993, followed by a special editorial in the Baltimore Sun on28July 1995.\" A l l Things Considered\" aired a lengthy interview on the subject on National PublicRadio on 11February 1995 (I am indebted to Bert Jenson of Vernal, Utah, for bringing the latter two instances to my attention). The reader of these notes maybe relieved to know that \"Navajo\" is the Spanish spelling of a word which is stillunder contentious debate. During the 1930s and 1940 s, wishing to downplay the Hispanic look of the word, the tribe and most scholars used the spelling\"Navaho,\" but in recent years the preference has been for \"Navajo\"; hence, onends both spellings of the term in the literature. The Navajos call themselves Din\u00e9,which means \"people\" 11:44 AM 210Bibliography Folklore and Medicine Michael Owen Jones and Erika Brady, with Jacob Owen and Cara Hoglund any bibliography treating a topic so complex, addressed in the literature of so many disciplines, must nally be a selective one. The criterion used in compiling this list has been the inclusion of representative works ofgreatest interest and utility to two groups of readers: cultural specialists (espe-cially folklorists), and those in the healing professions. With these readers inmind, we have adapted the structure of the excellent bibliography found inHerbal and Magical Medicine , which should also be consulted (Kirkland et al. 1992,197-233). As with this work, we have not attempted to cross-reference entries; the reader should check all categories pertinent to the topic. Unlikethe previous bibliography, however, in those entries involving a practice com-mon within a particular population we have given categorical priority to thecommunity rather than the practice. In searching for information concerningAfrican-American practice relating to childbirth, for example, the rst placeto look is 3B, then 1G for more general references on the topic, and possibly 4C for information concerning African origins. This choice was made to assistthose in medical settings who are often called upon to address clinical issuesrelating to practice common within a specic population. We also suggest thatthe reader review the references cited in the articles included in this collection. The ancillary areas of medical sociology and medical anthropology are merely touched on; the reader is encouraged to consult bibliographies avail-able in the standard works in those elds. Researchers should also investigatethe extensive and growing resources available electronically through the inter-net, which range from the biomedical mainstay MEDLINE to eccentric andhighly individual web pages devoted to the most esoteric of healing practices. /ornament21 211/ornament21Healing_Logics.v3 9/9/03 11:44 AM Page 211The entries in this bibliography are included because they elucidate nonconventional health practice within cultural systems of belief. Readers interested solely in scientically supported data concerning pharmaceuticalefcacy or potential negative interaction with conventional treatment shouldinvestigate sources such as Mark Blumenthal's compendium, The Complete German Commission E Monographs (Austin T exas: American Botanical Council; Boston: Integrative Medicine Communications, 1998 ) or The Physicians Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines (Montvale, NJ: Medical Economics Company, 2000 ), or the online database NAPRALERT.
