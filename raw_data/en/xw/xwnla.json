In 2014, the International Household Survey Network published a desk review of the reliability and relevance of survey ques- tions as included in 100 household surveys from low- and middle-income countries. The report was presented in March 2014 at the forty-fifth session of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC), in a seminar organized by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Food Security, Agricultural and Rural Statistics (IAEG-AG). The assessment painted a bleak picture in terms of heterogeneity in survey design and overall relevance and reliability of the data being collected. On the positive side, it pointed to many areas in which even marginal changes to survey and question- naire design could lead to a significant increase in reliability and consequently, great improvements in measurement accuracy. The report, which sparked a lot of interest from development partners and UNSC member countries, prompted IAEG-AG to pursue this area of work with the ultimate objective of developing, validating, and promoting scalable standards for the mea- surement of food consumption in household surveys. The work started with an expert workshop that took place in Rome in November 2014. Successive versions of the guidelines were drafted and discussed at various IAEG-AG meetings, and in another expert workshop organized in November 2016 in Rome. The guidelines were put together by a joint FAO-World Bank team, with inputs and comments received from representa - tives of national statistical offices, international organizations, survey practitioners, academics, and experts in different disciplines (statistics, economics, nutrition, food security, and analysis). A list of the main contributors is included in the acknowledgment section. In December 2017 a draft of the guidelines was circulated to 148 National Statistical Offices from low- to high-income countries for comments. The document was revised following that consultation and submitted to UNSC which endorsed it at its forty-ninth session in March 2018 under item 3(j) of the agenda, agricultural and rural statistics. The version presented here reflects what was endorsed by the Commission, edited for language. The process received support from the Global Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Statistics. The document is intended to be a reference document for National Statistical Offices, survey practitioners, and national and international agencies designing household surveys that involve the collection of food consumption and expenditure data. vACKNOWLEDGMENTS These guidelines were drafted under the aegis of the IAEG-AG.

It makes up the largest share of total household expenditure in low-income countries, accounting, on average, for about 50 percent of the household budget (United States Department of Agriculture, 2011), and accordingly, constitutes a sizeable share of the economy. Proper measurement of food consumption is, therefore, central to the assessment and monitoring of various dimensions of well-being of any population, and hence of interest to multiple international, national, and local agencies, and to several development domains - social, economic, and human. Food consumption data are needed to monitor global targets, such as the newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals. The measurement of food consumption is crucial to assess and guide the mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to eradicate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, as well as the World Bank's twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty; and boosting shared prosperity. It is also important for national accounts measures of the overall size of the econ- omy, such as gross domestic product (GDP). Finally, it is of interest to national and local governments and non-governmental organizations to guide local and regional analysis and policy, as the mismeasurement of food consumption can lead to the mis- allocation of funds and compromise the design, monitoring, and evaluation of relevant policies and programs. The main vehicle used to collect information on food consumption for these purposes are household consumption and expendi - ture surveys (HCES). However, current practices for collecting consumption data differ widely across types of surveys, between countries, and over time, compromising the quality and comparability of resulting data and measures. In the interest of improving food consumption measures and to ensure that data collected respond to the needs of a wide range of users, several develop- ment partners have come together around a common agenda aimed at harmonizing practices and recommendations for design of food consumption modules in HCES. In the present report, a preliminary set of internationally agreed recommendations to adopt in future HCES is proposed in order to collect food data aimed at improving the measurement of food consumption. Taking stock of current practices Since the early 1990s, unprecedented progress has been made with regard to the quantity of household consumption and expenditure data across the developing world. In 1990, the World Development Report published by the World Bank, was based on data from only 22 countries, and no country had more than one survey (Jolliffe et al., 2014). T o date, at least 137 countries have consumption or expenditure information, and many of them conduct multiple surveys, adding to a total of more than 845 surveys. The number of countries with no poverty data (which is primarily estimated from consumption expenditure data) between 2002 and 2011 declined from 33 percent to 19 percent, while the share of countries with three or more data points increased from 27 to 41 percent over the same period (Serajuddin et al., 2015). Depending on their primary objective, the surveys that collect information on household consumption or expenditure can take different forms, such as household budget surveys, income and expenditure surveys or \"multi-purpose\" or \"integrated\" household surveys, such as the Living Standards Measurement Study surveys. This family of surveys, which are often nation - ally representative, is referred to as household consumption and expenditure surveys. While the variety of purposes naturally translates into different designs, the dramatic increase in the number of household surveys in developing countries has been associated with a proliferation of instruments and methods in the collection of food data that cannot be explained only on the basis of their different purposes or of country-specificity. T o a large extent, this is a manifestation of the lack of globally agreed standards to guide the collection of food consumption in household surveys, which is evident by the heterogeneity in methods observed within the same type of survey across countries and within countries across time. In a recent desk review, jointly led by the International Household Survey Network, FAO, and the World Bank (Smith et al., 2014), the multiple purposes those household surveys served were identified, and a method to assess the reliability and rele- vance of survey questions was proposed and applied to 100 household surveys from low- and middle-income countries. Only viii the most recent nationally representative household surveys from each developing country for which enough documentation was available were part of the sample. The assessment found large differences in data-collection methods across surveys and paints a bleak picture with regard to the comparability and quality of resulting measures. It points to many areas in which survey design and questionnaires can be significantly improved. The multiplicity in methods, variation in quality, and diversity of uses are of increasing concern in academic and policy circles, leading to calls for a more systematic approach to survey design and a better understanding of its consequences when it comes to measuring food consumption or expenditure. Survey design does matter The international statistical community is well aware that poverty and hunger estimates are inconsistent across countries and over time, and that the lack of harmonization of survey methods contributes to that situation. The notion that survey design matters is not new, as indicated in the work of Mahalanobis and Sen (1954) or Neter and Waksberg (1964). While the issue has been largely neglected in the economics literature for a long time (Browning et al., 2014), in recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the measurement of household expenditure also among economists, mostly spurred by two factors: 1) an increasing body of evidence suggests that inferences from comparisons of survey estimates across space and time can be seri- ously compromised by variations in survey design and practice, and 2) the persistent fall in the quality of consumer expenditure surveys across several developed countries, particularly associated with non-response and underreporting. With respect to evidence from developing countries, Deaton and Grosh (2000) provide a comprehensive review of the issues and data needs for the measurement of consumption in household surveys, drawing on the lessons learned from Living Stan- dards Measurement Study surveys. A recent special issue in the journal Food Policy includes case studies from a diverse set of developing and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries analyzing, theoretically and empirically, how different surveys design options affect the quality of the data being collected and, in turn, the implications for statistical inference and policy analysis (Zezza et al. 2017). In several other studies the implications of particular aspects of sur - vey design for total expenditures, poverty and inequality measures have been analyzed. For example, Jolliffe (2001) and Pradhan (2001) evaluated the impact of varying the length of the consumption list in El Salvador and Indonesia, respectively; Gibson et al. (2003) looked at the effect of changing the length of the data-collection period for the case of China; Beegle et al. (2012) compared results from eight questionnaire designs, which include variations in methods of data capture, level of the respondent, length of reference period, number of items in the recall list, and nature of the cognitive task required of the respondent; and Backiny-Yetna et al. (2017) compared different data-collection methods, which include a seven-day recall period, a seven-day diary, and a \"usual month.\" In all of those studies, it was found that the design and implementation of survey instruments for collecting food consumption affects resulting measures considerably. As economies develop, implementing quality surveys is bound to become more difficult and require changes to current approaches in many countries. First of all, respondents tend to become less compliant and harder to survey as their incomes increase, leading to greater non-response, attrition, and bias. Second, inequality rather than poverty per se becomes a more com - mon objective for measurement efforts; even countries that have escaped mass poverty have policy concerns over inequality, and poverty itself becomes more sensitive to inequality the more the poverty rate falls. This change in focus places additional demands on surveys. Meanwhile, with lower levels of poverty, errors have a greater effect on the measurement of poverty and hunger, especially when attention turns to the contribution of transitory poverty and transitory hunger. Finally, existing survey methods that may do well for staple ingredients do less well for income elastic food items and for changes in consumption pat- terns. For instance, as consumption of food away from home increases, the person responsible for reporting the household's food consumption is less aware of the amount or type of food consumed by other household members. On the road to better food data There is arguably need for more systematic research before general recommendations for the collection of food consumption or expenditure data in HCES can be provided. While the lack of broadly accepted practices affects all aspects of household con - sumption or expenditure analysis, it is significantly pronounced in the case of food consumption. This is not only because few existing papers focus explicitly on food (one example is the work by Backiny-Yetna et al. (2017), but also because the research has almost exclusively looked at mean expenditure, and poverty or inequality measures. However, the impact of survey design ixon other measures is less well understood, and there is an increasing interest in using the data to analyse other dimensions of well-being, such as food security, health, and nutrition. The United Nations Statistical Commission endorsed, in 2012, the creation of the IAEG, as part of the governance framework of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistic, with the mandate of \"guiding methodological developments in statistics for food security, sustainable agriculture, and rural development\" (UNSC, 2012, p.10). In the spirit of that mandate, a work- shop was convened in Rome, in November 2014, bringing together experts to discuss the measurement of food consumption derived from HCES. The workshop included presentations of the latest methodological developments and a discussion of the main limitations in current practices. Also, during the workshop, priority areas for future research were identified. Following the workshop, another expert consultation was organized, in Rome, in November 2016 to discuss possible guidelines and form the first set of recommendations. The first draft of the present guidelines document was discussed by the members of the IAEG-AG and presented in an open seminar during the forty-eighth session of UNSC in New Y ork in March 2017. The results of those discussions are reflected in the present document. Conclusion and recommendations The recommendations in these guidelines are intended to assist practitioners in improving survey design, while taking into account the cost of organizing a survey and the constraints statistical offices in low- and middle-income countries face. T o stay relevant, the recommendations will have to evolve over time as additional research and new technologies become available. For instance, changes in consumer behaviour and in how food systems evolve may lead to a rethinking of the underlying sur - vey design principles, such as the priority placed on collecting data on ingredients and relying primarily on quantities reported. The main recommendations of the guidelines can be summarized as follows: Recall versus diary, and length of reference period. For HCES, a seven-day recall period for food consumption measurement should be adopted. In low- and middle-income countries, recall surveys are generally preferable to diary surveys, which should only be deployed with careful and continuous supervision and should not exceed 14 days. While a well-implemented diary is generally held as the gold standard for food expenditure data collection, there is ample evidence that in low-income settings with a prevalence of illiterate respondents, diaries are often implemented as a series of short recall interviews, with issues of respondent and enumerator fatigue affecting data quality, and with unsustainable implementation costs. Any change in the recall period or method should be accompanied by an experimental component that assesses the impact of methodological changes on survey estimates and enables temporal reconciliation. Seasonality and number of visits. The data collection for HCES should be spread out in order to capture seasonal variation in food consumption and expenditure patterns. T wo main approaches can be adopted: one visit per household with the sample spread over a 12-month period; or two visits per household over a 12-month period. Acquisition and consumption. Data from HCES should be collected on the main modes of acquisition (food purchases, own production, and food received in kind) and it should be made clear to respondents, enumerators, and data users whether the survey is collecting data on food acquisition or food consumption or both (with or without waste). Survey design should avoid sources of incomplete or ambiguous enumeration, such as food consumed from own production versus food harvested and routine month versus specific months, and equivocal leading questions. Meal participation. Information should be collected on the number of meals and the number of individuals (household and non-household members) who participated in each meal. It is recommended that in all HCES, adding an individual household member-based meal module should be considered. List of food items. Data should be collected on all types of foods and beverages that make up a country's human diet. Lists should be kept up to date to take into account changes in dietary habits and should be made having in mind that products that account for minimal budget shares can have particular nutritional values. A list of general principles that can guide the design of a food list is in the guidelines, and includes the following criteria:x Ensure that survey food lists are sufficiently detailed to accurately capture consumption of all major food groups making up the human diet. T o facilitate data integration and analysis, the categories used in the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), FoodEx2, but also in food composition tables, should be considered; Include exclusively food (no other commodities); Processed foods (from moderately to highly processed) need to be adequately represented; All food groups need to be represented and include a reasonable number of food products; Broad categories, such as fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables, should be avoided and for each basic food group list the most common items and add \"other\" category as needed. Items from subsidized programs, food fortification programs, and micro - nutrient rich foods should be listed individually. Non-standard units of measurement. Surveys should allow respondents to report in both standard and non-standard units, according to what they are most familiar with for each item reported. It is critical to establish (define or collect) conversion factors for all non-standard units that will be used. Additional features to improve the accuracy of reported non-standard units quantities, such as market surveys, to establish accurate non-standard units and conversion factors, photo reference aides, and on-the-spot value verification using computer assisted personal interviewing, may also be considered. National statistics offices and implementation partners should work together to establish non-standard units databases that can be used across surveys, effectively increasing the standardization of the units, while also limiting the cost of their implementation. T o this end, survey implementers should thoroughly document all non-standard unit protocols and related conversion factors and make them publicly available. Food away from home. The practice of collecting food away from home information with just one question should be dis- continued. The importance of food away from home warrants the design of a separate module based on a clear definition of food away from home. In particular, surveys should be clear in identifying how to collect information on potentially ambiguous categories of food: \"food prepared at home and consumed outside\" and \"food prepared outside and consumed at home.\" The latter can be integrated in the food at home module, such as takeout food, provided there is clarity to enumerators, respon - dents, and data users that that is the case. Data collection should be organized around meal events, including snacks and drinks. At a minimum, surveys should collect information on the monetary value of each meal consumed away from home (breakfast, lunch, dinner, solid snacks, and drinks). The meal events list should be adapted to the local context. Food away from home is best collected through individual-level interviews of adults. A proxy respondent can be used to report on children's meals away from home and other adults. Surveys should use the same reference period for food away from home as the one used for the food consumed at home module. The data to estimate food away from home-related nutrient content, when feasible, will have to come from other data sources integrated to HCES, such as a survey of food establishments or administrative data on the content of public meals (e.g. schools and social programs). 11.Introduction 1.1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Food is an important component of many fundamental dimen - sions of welfare, such as food security, nutrition, and health. It comprises the largest share of total household expenditure in low-income countries, accounting for about 50 percent of the average household budget (USDA, 2011) and accordingly, it is key for consumption and poverty analysis. Low levels of food access play a role in explaining why around 815 million individuals were estimated to be chronically undernourished in 2016 (FAO, WFP , IFAD, UNICEF , and WHO, 2017). Data on food consumption and expenditure underpin the most widely used measures of poverty and of food security. The collection of high-quality food consumption data is, therefore, central to the assessment and monitoring of the well-being of any human population, and is of interest to governments, international agencies, and anyone concerned with monitoring and under - standing trends in social, economic, and human development. Data on food consumption are needed, for example, to build the indicators and monitor some of the targets set for Sustain - able Development Goals 1 and 2 (ending poverty and hunger). Similarly, data on food consumption are needed to assess and guide the mandate of FAO to help eradicate hunger, food inse - curity, and malnutrition and the twin goals of the World Bank to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.1 Even more importantly, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations need high-quality food con- sumption data to guide local and regional analysis and policy, as the mismeasurement of food consumption can lead to the misallocation of funds and may compromise the design, moni- toring, and evaluation of relevant policies and programs. During the past two decades, unprecedented progress was made in the production and dissemination of household con- sumption and expenditure data across the developing world. In 1990, the World Development Report published by the World Bank was based on data from only 22 countries, and 1 For a list of indicators that can be derived from food data collected in HCES, see Moltedo et al. (2014); Foster et al. (2013).BOX 1 \u2014 THE CONCEPTS OF FOOD CON- SUMPTION Food data collected in HCES can be diverse, and often refer to diverse concepts. Even the term \"food consumption\" lends itself to multiple meanings. When the focus of the analysis is expenditure, the term \"consumption\" can designate the pur - chase of foods, disregarding the end-use of what was pur - chased. At the opposite end, analyses and surveys that focus on nutrition use the term \"food consumption\" to designate the intake of a food, possibly net of unusable parts. Through - out this document the term \"food consumption\" is used in a general sense and encompasses concepts or data that include food consumption, acquisition, expenditure, and intake. Addi- tional descriptive are specifically used in places where their specific meanings are addressed or contrasted, or for details that relate to that precise terminology no country had more than one survey (Jolliffe et al., 2014). T o date, at least 137 countries compile consumption or expendi - ture information, and many of them have multiple surveys, add - ing to a total of more than 845 surveys2 (Ferreira et al., 2016). The number of countries with no poverty data (which is pri- marily estimated from food consumption data) between 2002 and 2011 declined from 33 percent to 19 percent, whereas the share of countries with three or more data points increased from 27 to 41 percent over the same 10-year period (Sera - juddin et al., 2015). When FAO started publishing estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment to monitor the hunger targets set by the World Food Summit in 1999, it used food consumption data collected in household surveys for only 15 countries, relying on indirect estimates of the distribution of food consumption for most countries. The most recent assessment, conducted in 2017, used data from 57 surveys for 39 countries. 2 These figures are based on a count of consumption surveys available from PovcalNet, Eurostat and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of September 2017.2 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS Despite that progress by 2011, 29 countries still lacked a survey to measure poverty, and another 28 had just one survey that would enable estimating national poverty figures (Serajud - din et al., 2015). Without such data, it is impossible for those countries or for international development actors to analyze trends and progress (or lack thereof) in poverty eradication, a fact that has prompted the World Bank President to pledge to assist 78 of the poorest countries in the world to conduct at least one such survey every three years. At the same time, UNSC established the Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys at its forty-sixth session \"to foster coordi - nation and harmonization of household survey activities across agencies and member countries\" (UNSC, 2014). Those initia- tives will result in a surge in the number of household surveys in developing countries in the coming years, underscoring the urgent need for more rigorous guidance on survey design. A challenge facing low- and middle-income countries is that implementing quality surveys is bound to become more diffi- cult in many respects as their economies develop. One aspect national statistics offices need to prepare for is that people become less compliant and harder to survey as their incomes increase. Another is that, with per capita income growth, pol- icy concerns relate more to issues of inequality rather than to poverty per se. Moreover, even when poverty remains a concern, measures of poverty become increasingly sensitive to measures of inequality as the poverty rate falls. Thus, from a measurement point of view, this means that inequality and vari- ance of welfare measures become more important. At the same time, with lower levels of poverty, errors have a larger effect on the measurement of poverty and hunger, especially as interest grows in the transient components of those welfare shortfalls. Furthermore, existing survey methods that may be effective for staple ingredients and the traditional view of the household shar - ing food from a common pot, are less effective for income elastic food items and for changes in consumption patterns. For instance, as an increasing share of food consumption happens away from home resulting from actions and decisions of individual household members, it will become increasingly difficult for \"the main food preparer\" to report on the content and value of those consump - tion episodes (meals or snacks). Depending on their objectives, surveys collecting infor - mation on household consumption take different forms and labels, such as household budget surveys, income and expen- diture surveys, or \"multi-purpose\" or \"integrated\" household surveys, such as the Living Standards Measurement Study sur - veys. This family of surveys, which are almost always nationally and sub nationally representative, is collectively referred to as Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). The primary objectives of HCES are to measure poverty and consumption levels, derive consumption patterns needed for the calculation of consumer price indices, and provide inputs to the compilation of national accounts. In many cases, those surveys are the only available source of information to estimate the distribution of food consumption in the popula- tion. While the variety of HCES purposes naturally translates into different survey designs, the dramatic increase in the num - ber of household surveys in developing countries is associated with a proliferation of approaches and methods of food data collection, which is not only the result of different purposes or country-specific considerations. This is because international guidelines and recommendations for the design and implemen- tation of each of the distinct types of household consumption and expenditure surveys that exist are specific to each type of survey, are generally not prescriptive, often lack coherence, and usually leave much flexibility to national survey statisti - cians and to the consultants and donors who may support their survey efforts. Consequently, heterogeneity in methods is observed across countries and within countries over time. Household consumption and expenditure surveys are also increasingly being used to address the food and nutrition infor - mation gap, even though they may not necessarily have been designed for that purpose, because they contain a wealth of information about food acquisition and consumption, are con - ducted with increasing frequency in an increasing number of countries (Serajuddin et al., 2015), have large samples, and are often statistically representative at subnational levels. These multi-purpose surveys are also much less costly than other (stand-alone) dietary assessment data sources, as they are already being conducted and paid for by government agen - cies (Fiedler, 2013). Increasingly, HCES data are repurposed and used to calculate food security indicators,3 compile food balance sheets, plan and monitor food-based nutrition inter - ventions, serve the information needs of the private sector, and contribute to other research work. The degree to which a survey dataset is \"fit for purpose\" is specific to each one of these particular uses (Smith et al., 2014). 3 Food consumption data are used in the calculation of not only the prevalence of undernourishment indicator of FAO, but also of other indicators, such as the food budget share and dietary diversity indicators, such as simple food counts or counts of food groups. Other common food security indicators, such as the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, the Household (and Individual) Dietary Diversity indicators, and the World Food Program Food Consumption Score are collected using purposely designed survey modules.While there has been a surge of interest in HCES analyses of food security and nutrition issues, to date, food security ana- lysts and nutritionists have been overwhelmingly passive users of already-collected household consumption and expenditure surveys data. As a result, the full potential of those particular types of repurposing of household consumption and expendi - ture surveys has yet to be realized. There is a lack of awareness among non-economists about what those data contain and need for further research and action to improve the quality and utility of those data and the methods that can be applied to analyze them from a food security and nutrition lens. If the food security and nutrition community \u2014 with its unique skills and experiences \u2014 were to become more proactively involved in the design, implementation, and analyses of house - hold consumption and expenditure surveys, such surveys could be strengthened substantially as tools for evidence-based food and nutrition programming and policymaking. There are a few recent antecedents to the present docu - ment in terms of attempts to create a common ground for international household survey data on poverty and consump - tion. One highly relevant document is the report of the sev- enteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians on Household Income and Expenditure Statistics (ILO, 2003). That report is very useful as a reference for internationally agreed upon definitions and concepts. It contains an excellent discussion on many of the survey design issues relevant to the present document, but lacks specific recommendations on survey design, which is the main objective of this document. Other documents provide guidelines for the implementation of high-quality consumption surveys in Europe, such as the guidelines provided by Eurostat for the implementation of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions,4 and by the Household Finance and Consumption Network.5 Both surveys have sections on measuring consumption, and both are supported by documents providing specific guidelines for survey design. While those surveys and the supporting doc - umentation can provide ideas on how to design consumption surveys elsewhere, they are at best only partially relevant for the issues faced by statistical offices and food consumers in low- and middle-income countries.6 4 Available online at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/ european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions. 5 Available online at https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-research/ research-networks/html/researcher_hfcn.en.html. 6 FAO guidelines are also available for nutrition assessments (e.g. EFTA, 2014; visit FAO website: http://www.fao.org/nutrition/assessment/en), but those are less relevant for designing HCES.The United Nations Handbook on Poverty Statistics (UNSD, 2005) is intended to assist practitioners by providing clarity with regard to poverty measurement issues and the key deci- sions involved in choosing and applying methods for poverty measurement. Though in the handbook issues with consump - tion data were explicitly covered (Gibson, 2005), it did not provide specific guidance for survey design. The Living Stan - dard Measurement Study surveys \"Blue Book\" (Grosh and Glewwe, 2000), on the other hand, provided such guidance in the chapter on consumption, authored by Deaton and Grosh (2000). The present document builds on that chapter, revisit- ing the same themes but with new evidence accumulated over almost two decades of experience since that publication. The focus of this document is also somewhat different as those guidelines also provide guidance that is relevant to the differ - ent users of HCES surveys (including food security and nutri- tion analysists and consumer price index (CPI) and national accounts compilers), whereas Deaton and Grosh were mainly targeting an audience of poverty economists using Living Stan - dards Measurement Survey data. In this document, a set of recommendations for practitioners engaged in the collection of food consumption data in HCES is presented. The recommendations are drawn from the results of a desk assessment of questionnaires from 100 nationally representative surveys conducted in low- and middle-income countries, commissioned by the International Household Sur - vey Network (IHSN), the World Bank and FAO (Smith et al.,). That assessment revealed an unwarranted level of variation in survey practices around the world, identifying clearly subopti- mal practices still being used in a number of countries. Based on the assessment, it was concluded that while many basic reli- ability criteria are met by the large majority of current HCES, only13 percent of the questionnaires analyzed met the seven criteria used to classify a survey as reliable. As a result, FAO and the World Bank initiated a collaborative effort to identify and disseminate best practices for food con- sumption measurement through HCES, which includes meth- odological work and the publication of guidance material, of which this document is the first output. This work program was presented at the first meeting of the IAEG-AG, held in February 2015, and endorsed by the IAEG-AG members. The guidelines were finalized through an extensive consultation process, drawing on inputs from experts on relevant disci - plines and from representative national statistical authorities from all developing regions and presentations at the margin of the UNSC sessions held in 2015 and in 2017. The current version of those guidelines also draws on expert workshops INTRODUCTION 34 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS organized by the Global Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Statistics, in Rome, in November 2014, and in November 2016, and by the World Bank in Washington DC, in November 2015. The guidelines stop short of articulating recommendations in a strongly prescriptive manner, particularly given that for several survey design decisions, there is no consensus among experts or not enough evidence from methodological research or both for there to be a clear best practice to be recom - mended for adoption.7 While more methodological research is needed in most of the areas covered by the guidelines, survey practitioners and national statistical authorities need to imple - ment surveys, and international organizations are requested to provide technical support to data-collection efforts. The guide - lines are intended to offer users a set of recommendations proposed by a group of experts and national statistical offices given the current status of knowledge. At the same time, in the document, it is explicitly recognized that as more knowledge is generated through survey experience and methodological research, and with technological advances in survey data col- lection, the guidelines will need to be periodically updated to keep or increase their relevance. Additionally, it should be noted that as food consumption data are used for different purposes, not all decisions are of the same degree of relevance to all users. In that sense Smith et al. (2014) distinguish issues around the reliability of survey data (i.e. whether the survey design and method comply with good practice) and their relevance (i.e. whether the data pro- vide the information or indicators needed by different users). For instance, users interested in consumption data for the cal - culation of CPI are less interested in details of the quantities of specific food items consumed compared with users interested in analyzing nutrient consumption and deficiency. Following the guidelines in full would allow for HCES data to satisfy the needs of all the main uses (poverty, CPI calculations, national accounts, food security and nutrition). Given the costs involved in data collection, there are clear advantages to ensuring that food consumption data include information relevant to as many users as possible, yet with - out compromising quality. Survey design requires striking an appropriate balance between those competing demands. It is important that all core users of the data are consulted while 7 The guidelines are also limited to issues pertaining to questionnaire design and major decisions in field implementation (timing, number of visits). Other survey implementation features that are as important for data quality, such as training and data entry, are not covered by the guidelines. Important emerging issues in which consolidated international practices are still lacking, such as the measurement of food waste, are also not covered in the document. developing the questionnaire, sampling plan and fieldwork. There should also be realistic and pragmatic recognition, however, of the extent to which repurposing is feasible. A household consumption and expenditure survey will never be a substitute for an assess- ment of dietary intake, and analyses of food consumption based on HCES data will always have limitations compared to analyses based on purposely designed surveys. 1.2. OBJECTIVES AND AUDIENCE A product of a consultation process within the international statistical community, which culminated in the endorsement by UNSC member countries at its 49th Session, these guide- lines are intended to be a reference document for national statistical offices and survey practitioners designing house - hold consumption and expenditure surveys. In putting forward these scalable standards the IAEG-AG also seeks to promote an increase in the harmonization of survey instruments and the comparability of the resulting data. Against the backdrop of this institutional context, the guidelines have multiple aims: First, they will provide survey practitioners tasked with designing and implementing HCES in low-income settings with a harmonized set of guiding principles. The aim is to inform the main decisions that need to be taken when design- ing HCES, factoring in the objective of serving a wide range of users, without compromising data quality. Second, by putting forward a vision for some of these principles, the guidelines can serve as the basis for an international dialogue between practitioners and data users coming from different dis- ciplines and looking for different features in the data. Third, a set of guidelines that can be widely shared and agreed upon will increase the harmonization of the surveys that are implemented (and the resulting data) and give greater coherence to the advice that national statistical offices receive from the international statistical community. Often, different users and institutions head in different directions, resulting in countries adopting very different approaches. Resulting sur - vey design can end up reflecting priorities of donors rather than those of countries and detract from the comparability of data across countries and with other surveys within the same country. Fourth, by identifying areas in which the consensus is based on a limited evidence-base, the guidelines can be used to chart the way for an internationally agreed survey method - ology research agenda. Importantly, the guidelines can be an entry point for sustaining an interdisciplinary dialogue for the advancement of this agenda, which can bring together statis - ticians, economists, food security analysts, and nutritionists to contribute to an effective repurposing of HCES that can increase the surveys' \"value for money.\" 1.3. EMERGING ISSUES The international statistical community is well aware that pov - erty and hunger estimates are inconsistent across countries and over time, and that lack of harmonization of survey meth - ods plays an important part in that. During the consultative process that generated these guidelines, national statistics offices in several low- and middle-income countries expressed their concern that they were not well-equipped to adapt sur - vey practices to the changes that are happening in their societ - ies and food systems, making it difficult to continue to collect relevant and reliable data. More concretely, the urgency to address outstanding and emerging methodological issues in survey design for measuring food consumption is immediately apparent if one looks at how adopting different survey design approaches results in markedly different estimates of poverty and hunger, as exemplified in Figure 1 (based on data from the United Republic of Tanzania SHWALITA study). It is also important for this document to be explicit about a number of areas in which the current state of knowledge is not able to provide satisfactory solutions. Some of those chal - lenges are likely to become increasingly important for statistical offices as economies grow and poverty is reduced. T o contrib - ute to addressing such questions (some long-standing, some recently emerging), the priorities for future methodological research are identified in the document. Deaton and Grosh (2000) identified a number of outstanding methodological research issues in measuring consumption in household sur - veys. T o date, remarkably little research has been conducted on many of them since their study was published. Further - more, the research that has been carried out is mostly from a few countries, such as Bangladesh and the United Republic of Tanzania, casting some doubts on the validity of the findings to other settings. More research is, therefore, needed to pin down all the relevant survey design issues. The stance taken in the present document is that while those gaps in knowl - edge are being filled, surveys still need to be implemented and advice needs to be given; accordingly, it is useful to be prag - matic and agree on what is practical, while also be mindful that some perspectives may change as new evidence emerges. National statistical offices and researchers will face the difficult challenge of keeping up with some of the emerging concerns. First, some aspects of the measurement task get harder, not easier, with rising affluence. Respondents become less compliant and harder to survey, particularly in the higher income strata, and national statistics offices will have to learn to deal more with non-response than is currently the case in low- and middle-income countries. Lessons can be learned from countries that have dealt with those issues, but some degree of new learning will be required. T o the extent that the recommendations included in the guidelines entail a greater burden on respondents, this might aggravate issues of item and unit non-response and increase implementation costs. Coun- tries should, as a result, carefully evaluate those trade-offs Figure 1\u2014 Differences in poverty, inequality and hunger measures associated with different survey design options Sources: Beegle et al.

Training, enhancing field supervisions, and using technology, on the other hand, can help keep some of those concerns in check when the complexity in implementing the survey increases. From a policy perspective, inequality has become higher on the global agenda, but what matters even more for a mea - surement agenda is that as countries escape mass poverty, headcount poverty measures become more sensitive to dif - ferences in the distribution. The intuition for this argument is conveyed in Figure 2. The comparison of the distributions in the figure shows that the same degree of inequality has a much larger impact on the poverty headcount (given a poverty line) when average per capita consumption is higher. Accordingly, as economies grow and people rise out of absolute poverty, it will become more important for surveys to be able to do a good job of measuring inequality and mean consumption. Most of the available methodological survey work is informative about the impact of survey design on central tendency measures, but much less so on what happens to the shape of the distribution.8 Compounding that is the fact that, with per capita income growth, diets become more diverse - income elastic consump - tion items and foods not eaten from a common household pot become rapidly more important, and these are the food (and non-food) items that surveys are generally less well-equipped to capture. That is associated with larger measurement error, and measurement error has a greater bearing on distribu - tion-sensitive measures of welfare, such as the severity of poverty and hunger, which are also the measures receiving 8 This statement might be somewhat less true for high-income countries in which the preoccupation of capturing the income at top of the distribution has been is long-standing. For low- and middle-income countries measurement error at both ends of the consumption distribution is much less well researched.increasing political attention. It is also difficult to separate measurement error from transitory fluctuations, and as more people escape chronic poverty, it is likely that more attention will be paid to transitory welfare shortfalls. In these guidelines some of the key questions survey methods research should prioritize in order to provide practitioners with the tools to address these challenges are singled out. The target audience for the guidelines is comprised of all those who have an interest in the design, implementation, and analysis of high-quality, relevant HCES in low- and middle-in - come countries. First and foremost, are the national statistical authorities that are tasked with implementing HCES to generate high-quality data for the formulation and monitoring of national policies and programs, and need to meet the challenges of mon- itoring progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The guide- lines are also directed at staff in international and national techni- cal organizations that give advice to national statistical authorities in HCES design and implementation. As mentioned in the previous section, while there are some antecedents to this document, currently there is no single ref- erence document that experts can refer to when advising countries on survey design choices regarding the collection of food consumption data. This results, on the one hand, in short - comings of survey design, such as those identified by Smith et al. (2014) and on the other, in a high degree of heterogeneity in survey designs, which limits comparability. Finally, the guide- lines are also directed at survey method researchers and other parties interested in engaging in a global research agenda to advance knowledge on the data quality implications of different survey design choices from the perspective of different users. The vision is to update these guidelines periodically as new knowledge is generated by methodological research and sur - vey practice, as new challenges to survey design and implemen - tation emerge, and as new opportunities emerge as a result of advances in technology. The remainder of this document is organized in two parts. In Section 2, there is a brief summary of the main uses of food consumption and expenditure data, and desirable features for each of these uses. Then, the arguments, theory, and empirical evidence that can inform specific survey design choices are reviewed. This section is organized around a selection of key choices in the process of designing a quality survey to collect food consumption or expenditure data. Based on that discus - sion and evidence, Section 3 offers practical guidance, summa - rizing the main findings and offering specific recommendations.Figure 2 \u2014 Headcount becomes more sensitive to inequality as poverty rate falls Source: John Gibson (2016). 0 0 1 2 320406080100Head count poverty rate (%) Per capita consumption ($/day)Less EqualPoverty Line More Equal Less Equal (+g) More Equal (+g) 72. Review of the Evidence and Summary of the Main Issues A comprehensive review of the different uses of HCES is pro- vided in Smith et al. (2014). Among those uses are poverty measurement, informing food security assessment, providing inputs in the compilation of food balance sheets, providing information for the planning and monitoring of nutrition inter - ventions, informing the compilation of national accounts, and collecting data for compilation of CPI. As a result of the dif - ferent uses, and the constituencies of users associated with them, the demands from the data vary, and depending on the exact nature of HCES being designed, there are going to be different sets of constraints and opportunities for repurposing. Any attempt at adjusting the design of a survey needs to take into account the analytical needs of the different users. In this document, the main uses considered in setting the criteria for guiding survey design are food security assessments, poverty measurement, and nutrition policy and programming. Some key issues in the measurement of poverty and food security, and for monitoring nutrition interventions, that are useful for understanding the data needs connected to those uses are presented in the Annex 1.9 In what follows, the docu - ment contains a summary of the literature on key choices that confront practitioners as they design and implement HCES questionnaires. Those aspects were identified as priority areas in a review conducted by Smith et al. (2014) and by experts that participated in the consultation process convened by the IAEG-AG and led by FAO and the World Bank. Several of those issues are also treated, theoretically and empirically, in a recent issue of the journal Food Policy. The volume includes case studies from a diverse set of developing and OECD coun - tries, analyzing how different survey design options affect the quality of the data being collected and, in turn, the implications for statistical inference and policy analysis (Zezza et al., 2017). 9 See Annex 1.2.1. RECALL VERSUS DIARY AND LENGTH OF REFERENCE PERIOD Data on household food consumption (and acquisition) is commonly collected either by asking households to keep a diary over a reference period (e.g. days or weeks) or through interviews in which respondents are asked to recall consump - tion for a specific period (e.g. the past week or the past 30 days). A large body of evidence from research and practical experience shows that the method chosen can significantly affect the resulting estimates of consumption. The recall period is referred to as the period over which respondents are asked to recall the consumption of food items. The recall period differs from the reference period when households are interviewed multiple times during multiple vis - its to the household Smith et al., (2014). For example, if house - holds are interviewed about their food consumption in the last seven days over four weekly visits, the recall period is seven days and the reference period is 28 days. In diary methods, households are generally asked to record consumption at the moment in which it takes place (e.g. at meal times or at time of purchase). However, in practice, households often fill in information about their consump - tion at the end of the day, or during supervised visits from enumerators (for example, for two-day recall periods if vis - ited every other day). This blurs the line between diary and recall methods, especially when respondent illiteracy is high and supervisors support completion of the diary with visits every few days. The choice of recall period has long been a critical element of survey design for which there has been limited agreement and evidence of best practice. Scott and Amenuvegbe (1990) suggested the \"wide variations [in recall period] reflect the almost total absence of evidence for developing countries on 8 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS the level of recall error and its relation to recall duration.\" Similarly, Deaton, and Grosh (2000) commented that \"there are no definitive answers about the optimal recall period(...). In the meantime, however, surveys must be designed.\" This uncertainty is reflected in the large variation observed in the choice of recall periods across surveys. The review of 100 HCES undertaken by Smith et al. (2014) reveals that of the 56 surveys using exclusively interview methods, 26 surveys were using multiple recall periods depending on the source of acquisition or the nature of the purchase (frequently or less frequently purchased). Of the 30 surveys using only one recall period, 13 used a recall period of seven days, four used a recall period of 14 to 15 days, two used a recall period of one month, five used the \"usual month\" or \"usual week\" approach, and the rest used a different recall period. The \"usual month\" or \"usual week\" approach uses a recall period longer than the month (usually the past 12 months) and is aimed at capturing seasonality and other short-term fluctuations in food consumption. Households are asked to recall their average monthly or weekly consumption over the past year, sometimes by breaking this into questions about the number of months per year that they consume (or acquire) the food in question, the times per month that they acquire it in those months and the typical quantity and value on each acquisition occasion. Consequently, the recall period is the year and the reference period is meant to be the typical month within that year, although there is evidence that respondents anchor their answers in the economic conditions of the most recent month (Gibson, 2007). For recall surveys, the challenge is to choose an effective method for measuring the concept of interest while avoiding biases resulting from two main sources: memory decay and telescoping. A longer recall period may be desirable to better capture items consumed infrequently and to obtain a better sense of the true distribution of consumption over a longer time period (addressing the seasonality of consumption). How - ever, one common effect of longer recall periods is memory decay (or \"progressive forgetting\" on the part of the respon - dent), to use the terminology of Deaton and Grosh (2000), which can lead to under-reporting of consumption. Scott and Amenuvegbe (1991) investigated the magnitude of recall error in Living Standards Measurement Study style surveys in exper - iments with the Ghanaian Living Standards Survey. For 13 fre- quently purchased items, expenditure reported in the survey fell an average of 2.9 percent per additional day of recall. For seven-day recall, expenditure was 87 percent of what it was for single-day recall; after two weeks, the recall error levelled out at around 20 percent. Similarly, the Indian National Sam- ple Survey conducted experiments on recall period using \"last week\" and \"last month\" in which it was found food expendi- ture estimates in the weekly recall was more than 20 percent higher than in the monthly recall (NSSO, 2003). Although a shorter recall period reduces error caused by memory decay, choosing a short recall period introduces another set of problems. As noted by Deaton and Grosh (2000), even under perfect recall, when the recall period is shorter than the period used for analysis, the measure includes variance that does not reflect the true distribution of living standards. A short recall period of one day may eliminate bias in the mean10, but it poorly reflects the distribution of expen- diture and consumption over a longer time period, such as a month or a year, which generally is the key statistic of inter - est for household surveys. While the \"usual month\" approach was advocated by Deaton and Grosh as a way to structure a long recall period to make it more feasible for respondents to answer, while providing analysts with a measure of more typi- cal living standards than is available from a short recall period, the evidence is that this method is not able to overcome the tension between what is feasible to ask and what is desirable to know. In particular, the \"usual month\" method has proven to be cognitively burdensome, and it, therefore, introduces edu- cational-related inequality into the measure of consumption inequality, takes almost twice as long to field as a fixed recall survey over the same foods, and introduces errors on both the extensive and intensive margins (Friedman et al, 2017). Another strategy used in some surveys is to break the lon- ger reference period into a series of short, adjacent, recall periods. For example, in the Ghana Living Standards Mea - surement Study, households are visited up to 10 times over a one-month period, so that there are only short recall periods between each visit. A similar design is present in many dia - ry-keeping surveys for illiterate respondents, who may be vis- ited every day or second day over the 14 to 28-day reference period. While there may be some novelty for a respondent being interviewed the first time, a high frequency of repeti - tious interview visits is likely to induce non-compliance, and clear evidence of that is shown in the Ghana Living Standards Measurement Study by Sch\u00fcndeln (2017), who finds that data quality is highest for the first interview and falls monotonically 10 Assuming the sample of household is sufficiently distributed throughout seasons.with each successive interview. Thus, measured food poverty would be 13 percentage points higher if all 10 interviews of the same household are used, compared with using just the data from the first visit. The trade-off between shorter reference periods that allow recall over that same period to be less prone to forgetting, but provide a poor guide to typical, long-run living standards also affects studies focused on estimating average daily per cap - ita dietary energy consumption (DEC).11 In particular, shorter reference periods are found to affect the variability in energy and nutritional estimates. Using data for Myanmar collected over two monthly rounds per household approximately six months apart, Gibson (2016) annualizes estimates of daily cal- ories per capita from each survey round in two ways: a na\u00efve extrapolation that multiplies estimates from each round by six and then adds them, and a corrected extrapolation, which is based on the intra-year correlation in daily calorie per capita across survey rounds of 0.45. The implications for measures of hunger by doing this correction is exemplified in Figure 3. Given two distributions with the same median calories per capita per day, the one based on na\u00efve extrapolation of the monthly data will have a greater dispersion compared to the adjusted one, resulting in a greater incidence of hunger for a given threshold (2000 kcal/day in this case).12 An analysis performed by the FAO Statistics Division using the 2010 data of the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey illustrates how the variance of the per capita DEC is significantly reduced over longer observation periods. (Box 1). Short recall periods can also lead to telescoping in which respondents report consumption that has taken place outside the reference period, also causing a bias in estimates. Several studies suggest that there cannot be one optimal recall length, as, depending on the type of good and the frequency of con- sumption, telescoping or decay may be observed (Bradburn 2010; Hurd and Rohwedder, 2009). In general, telescoping is more likely for large and infrequently purchased or consumed items under shorter recall periods, while a longer recall period 11 This is a key variable in the measurement of undernourishment, as estimated by FAO and reported in the State of Food Insecurity in the World Report series. 12 To estimate the prevalence of undernourishment (Sustainable Development Goals indicator 2.1.1), FAO is using the minimum dietary energy requirement that depends on the age, sex structure of the population, the fifth percentile of the body mass index distribution for adults, the height of the individuals in the population and the average of the sedentary lifestyle range for physical activity levels in the country. This threshold is not fixed and varies from one country to the other.leads to recall decay and underreporting of more common and frequent purchases (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Moltedo et al., 1964). The Indian National Statis- tical Office designed an experimental survey including three types of data collections: daily visits with direct measurement (benchmark), seven-day recall, and 30-day recall by food group. The report of the Indian National Statistical Office (NSSO, 2003) shows that optimal recall period depends on the food group and frequency of consumption. The 30-day recall works better than the seven-day recall in measuring staple food like cereals and is not inferior in measuring high-frequency items. One explanation for those patterns is that staple foods, and other high-frequency items, lend themselves to more accurate \"rule of thumb\" reporting, based on their regularity (Friedman et al, 2017), so strictly speaking they are being \"estimated\" rather than \"recalled\", and with a 30-day period, the effect of any telescoping is diluted compared with a seven-day period. A possible solution for dealing with telescoping is a bounded recall approach, suggested by Neter and Waksberg (1964). In that approach, a first visit to the household by the enumer - ator is used to establish the bound of the recall period for a second visit, which is when the actual interview takes place. The enumerator can, accordingly, ask the respondent about consumption since the first interview, reducing the likelihood of respondents reporting consumption or acquisitions taking place outside the recall period. This approach can, however, be costly to administer as it requires two visits to the same household, and despite having a long history (including within the Living Standards Measurement Study program), there have not been enough studies to provide convincing evidence that it offers a significant advantage in terms of data quality (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Gibson, 2005). This is, therefore, an area in which future methodological research could usefully focus on to establish whether such advantage exists in practice. Diaries present an approach which in theory can deal with important shortfalls of regular (longer) recall methods, such as telescoping and recall bias. They are in fact the method of choice and are successfully implemented in many countries for collecting data on food and other frequent expenditures. However, they can be practically challenging to implement in the conditions prevalent in many low-and middle-income countries. Diaries are far more demanding in terms of super - vision, especially with illiterate respondents, when they are implemented as a series of short recall interviews, and as a result, become more expensive and demand higher capacity. While a well-implemented diary is generally considered the REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 910 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS gold standard for measuring consumption, poorly implemented ones are often inferior to a good recall survey. Even in the context of the United States of America, where the set of challenges for diaries and recall may be different than in lower income coun- tries, evidence suggests that recall surveys might outperform diaries (Bee et al., 2012). A growing body of research has shown how the diary method causes considerable response burden and fatigue, particularly when the length of the diary increases, ultimately affecting data quality and reli - ability. Studying the Canadian Food Expenditure Sur - vey, Ahmed, Brzozowski, and Crossley, (2006) find a decrease in reporting because of \"diary exhaustion\" with reporting decreasing by 10 percent from the first to the second week of filling diaries. Similarly, studying the United States, Stephens (2003) finds significantly higher values in the first diary week and on the first day of each diary week relative to the remaining days, attributable to respondent fatigue. Analyzing the 2009/10 data of Papua New Guinea, Gibson (2013) also finds that the total value of consumption transactions declined by 4.4 percent per day during the diary-keeping period. A large set of other studies, such as Kemsley (1961), T urner (1961), Sudman and Ferber (1971), McWhinney and Champion (1974), and Silberstein and Scott (1991), find similar evidence of fatigue and decay in information collection in diaries over time. With high levels of supervision and careful implementation, diaries can and are being implemented in some countries, with good results. In analyzing the Bangladesh 2010 House- hold Income and Expenditure Survey, the FAO Statistics Divi- sion reported a negligibly low decrease of DEC because of fatigue, likely because of very good respondent supervision practices, with enumerator visits taking place every one or two days.13 Such levels of supervision lead to a mix of diary and interview methods that are not likely to be affordable; diaries do not, therefore, appear to be the most suitable method for resource-constrained statistical offices in low- and middle-in- come countries. Furthermore, even for well-implemented diaries, the evidence clearly suggests that longer periods of implementation do not add to the quality of information (they actually detract from it) and entail higher implementa - tion costs. Expanding mobile phone coverage throughout the world opens possibilities for remotely assisting diary comple- tion (as well as recall interviews) at a fraction of the cost. This 13 Food consumption reporting dropped on average by less than 0.1 percent per diary day.is an emerging trend (or an established one in some high-in- come countries), but not an area for which there is enough experience at scale in low-income settings for it to be recom- mended as a common practice during the time these guidelines are being formulated. One final aspect of diary implementation is that often the analyst is presented with data that have already been to some extent aggregated (e.g. by adding up the 7 or 14 days of data), which does not allow for detecting and correcting possible patterns in the data, such as diary fatigue (Troubat and Gr\u00fcn- berger, 2017). When diaries are implemented, it is important that they are reported together with full metadata, allowing the user to evaluate the data-collection process, including the role of the enumerator in aiding the data-collection process, the number and timing of supervision visits, and similar details. In the Living Standards Measurement Study handbook, Dea - ton and Grosh (2000) provided a discussion of the issues out- lined above and concluded by recommending only changes on the margins of the Living Standards Measurement Study status quo. Specifically, that meant using bounded recall for purchases, coupled with a usual month question for purchases and con- sumption of food from own production, plus one 12-month recall question on the value of food gifts received by the household. Deaton and Grosh has already observed, how - ever, a decline in the actual use of bounded recall in the Liv - ing Standards Measurement Study survey practice for reasons related to the added cost and burden (for enumerators and respondents) of the additional household visit.

Despite the lack of conclusive evidence lamented by Deaton and Grosh, and their call for \"every survey [to] have a bud - get for experimentation\", there has been a limited number of new studies undertaken in low- and middle-income coun- tries focusing on those methodological questions. One that has been particularly influential is the SHWALITA study (\"Survey of Household Welfare and Labour in Tanzania\") (Beegle et al., 2012; Gibson et al., 2015; de Weerdt et al., 2016). New evi - dence has also been produced through the work reported by Backiny-Yetna et al. (2017) in Niger. Based on those stud - ies and increased practical experience, practitioners involved in living conditions surveys have come to favour a seven-day recall period over longer reference periods. Deaton and Grosh had already noted signs of the bounded approach falling out of fashion with practitioners because of its higher complexity.The SHWALITA study (Beegle et al., 2012) provides con - vincing evidence, from an experimental setting, that recall interviews inquiring about \"usual\" monthly consumption food underestimated household consumption expenditure when compared to the benchmark assisted individual diary (see Figure 1), whereas the seven-day recall was reasonably close to the benchmark. At the same time, the usual month inter - views also had the longest completion times (76 minutes com - pared to just under 50 minutes for the 7- and 14-day recall), and were not associated with a significantly smaller coefficient of variation when compared to the shorter recall methods. In addition to the resource implications of longer fieldwork time, the longer completion time for the usual month approach is suggestive of a greater burden on the respondent who, with the enumerator, needs to engage in a demanding estimation procedure to work out the response for a typical month start - ing from recalling consumption episodes over a 12-month period. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the usual month may be a lose-lose proposition if it is less accurate and more cumbersome to implement when compared to a sev - en-day recall. This is possibly the most important single devel- opment in the evidence base since the publication of Deaton and Grosh (2000).BOX 2 \u2014 CASE STUDY: BANGLADESH 2010 HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND EXPENDITURE SURVEY The Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 was carried out from February 2010 to January 2011. Within those 12 months of investigation, the survey was divided into 18 periods, each 20 days. Food consumption was collected through a diary over a period of 14 days. Through - out the period, households were visited frequently (from 7 to 14 visits). The Dietary Energy Consumption (DEC) was estimated for each day of the diary. The figure below shows the coefficient of variation (CV) of DEC obtained using different numbers of diary days. From the plot, it can be clearly seen that the vari- ability is highest (CV=35 percent) when using observations from the first day only and decreases convexly and converges at a value of CV of around 24 percent after the seventh day. After the first week, the variability does not seem to decrease much, suggesting that a reference period of seven days might be enough for estimating the variability of DEC. 0.38CV of DEC by diary daysCV of 0.30 0.29 0.28 0.27 0.26 0.25 0.24 0.23 0.22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14Source: Gr\u00fcnberger (2017a)REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 1112 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS Importantly, another plea made by Grosh and Deaton (2000) two decades ago remains unanswered and just as valid today. As changing the recall period or method leads to incompa - rability issues with previous surveys using other methods, changes in survey methods over time should be accompanied by an experimental study to make it possible to reconcile the figures produced by the survey before and after the change in methods. Experiments, such as Beegle et al. (2012) and Back- iny-Yetna et al. (2017) have provided good practical examples of how changes in methods can be assessed and thus allow for valid comparisons when methods are changed. 2.2. SEASONALITY, NUMBER OF VISITS Consumption and expenditure patterns often show seasonal variations that are linked to the agricultural production sea - son, cyclical events, such as floods and droughts, or cultural events (e.g. Ramadan, Christmas), which affect food availability, prices and customary consumption practices. The existence of seasonality in food consumption patterns is well-established (Paxson 1992, 1993; Alderman, 1996) but its extent depends greatly on the context. Seasonality can be particularly important for food consump - tion because seasonal variations in dietary patterns, overall quantities of food consumed, and the consumption of partic- ular nutrients can be pronounced, partly because of its rela - tionship with food production cycles (Coates et al., 2012). D'Souza and Jolliffe (2012) find that household consumption in Afghanistan can be as much as one third lower in the lean season compared with the post-harvest season. The different levels of consumption, if taken at face value, would result in estimates of the poverty headcount doubling from 23 percent in the fall to 46 in the following summer (D'Souza and Jolliffe, 2012). Seasonality in food prices is a key concern as it is found to be significant and can affect estimates of poverty and con- sumption (Gilbert et al., 2016). That is of course a major issue for surveys collecting data for the calculation of CPI. Seasonal variations can also originate from increased expen - diture during festivals and holidays. In the United States, it has been established that consumption is higher during holidays and summer months (Barsky and Miron, 1988). In low- and middle-income countries, expenditure can vary significantly with holidays, festivals, and religious observances. Jolliffe and Serajuddin (2015), using data for Jordan, note that during the period of Ramadan, consumption levels are 1 1 percent greater than during other periods of the year. The festive expenditures can be difficult to capture in surveys because it is often difficult for survey fieldwork to operate as normal during festive peri- ods. A few surveys, such as the Living Standards Surveys in Viet Nam, use a special recall module for food consumption during festive periods, with analysis typically then spread over the consumption estimates for the households observed in the rest of the year. Within-year temporal variation can originate from other patterns, such as those associated with payment schedules for wages or social assistance (Stephens, 2003). Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017), in studying the urban subsample of the Household Socio-Economic Survey 2007-2008 of Mongolia, have found cyclical variations in food acquisition levels not only between months but also within months and weeks. Because of Independence Day, a major national holiday occurring in December (see Figure 4, left panel), results in the mean consumption in that month are substantially higher than for the other months of the year. A systematic pattern is also apparent for data collected at the end of each month when food consumption is significantly higher (centre panel). House - holds also tend to spend significantly more on food on T ues- day and Fridays as compared with Mondays and Wednesdays (right panel). Even if such patterns are difficult to generalize given the con - text specificity, they remain an important example of sources of bias that should be mitigated to the extent possible in sur - vey design (Fielder and Mwangi, 2016). If seasonality is not taken into account when there is marked seasonal variability in food consumption, the use of short reference periods bias the estimates of the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of habitual food consumption in the population. Recorded mean consumption may be higher or lower, depend - ing on the season when the data are collected, and estimates of the coefficient of variation may be biased by the confounding effect of seasonal variation. A survey carried out at a specific time of the year (say a sea - son, month, or week), misses seasonal variation in consump - tion and risk being unrepresentative of typical consumption across the year, even when it manages to accurately capture consumption over the period of data collection. Also, surveys that are not adequately capturing the entire year pose prob- lems for international comparability. Comparisons of consump - tion data for a country conducting a survey in the lean season and one conducting it in the harvest season are difficult to make in the absence of elements that enable the habitual con- sumption levels in both countries to be gauged. Even over time, comparisons of surveys undertaken within the same country Figure 4 \u2014 Variation in mean food consumption by month, day of the month, and day of the week, urban Mongolia Source: Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017).REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 13 .25 .2 .15 .1 -.25 0 Point estimate Reference category 95%-CI10 20 30 Point estimates Reference category 95%-CIDay of the the month .25 .2 .15 .1 .05 0 -.05 -.1 -.15 -.2 -.25 Monday T uesday Thursday Friday Saturday SundayCoefficient Point estimate Reference category 95%-CIand during the same period of the year might be invalidated if major events correlated with consumption patterns move in and out of the survey implementation period. This may hap - pen with Ramadan, the dates for it move from year to year, or when harvest periods are delayed or pushed forward by weather events. For all those reasons, it has been recom - mended that HCES should cover a full year to properly cap- ture seasonal variations in expenditures (ILO, 2003), although this is by no means a universal practice. Deaton and Grosh (2000) suggest the use of a \"usual month\" approach to overcome seasonal variation, but in the previous section, it was shown how the reliability of that approach appears questionable, and is associated with longer interview times and heavier cognitive burden on the respondents. Dea- ton and Zaidi (2002) suggest that for capturing household con - sumption, the optimal survey implementation and design is the one likely to provide the most precise estimate of annual con - sumption for each household, not just for households on aver - age. Based on this objective, the ideal design is one in which households are visited each \"season\" and habitual consump - tion is then derived as an average over the year of seasonal consumption. For variance-based measures, those intra-year revisits make possible corrected extrapolation, along the lines of what is shown for estimates of hunger in Gibson (2016). A drawback of revisiting the same households is the cost and the trade-off with overall sample size, as for any given sample size, the survey costs increase with the number of multiple visits.Just over half (53 percent) of the surveys reviewed by Smith et al. (2014) considered seasonality by using one of two approaches. The first approach (used in 41 percent of assess - ment surveys) is to distribute data collection throughout a year by surveying subsets (usually one twelfth of the house - holds in the sample) in each month of the year, with subsam - ples representative nationally for each quarter. This approach (which conforms to the ILO recommendation) requires care - ful planning of the sampling strategy and survey implementa- tion, but it can ensure that the seasonal variation across space and time is captured, at least for a \"synthetic\" household albeit not for any particular household in the sample, and represents a lower burden on households as they are visited only in 14 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS one period of the year. This method can present advantages in terms of organization when survey staff are employed to just work on one survey, as it smooths the need for the work - force over the survey year and can allow working with smaller teams, hence ensuring tighter supervisions. The second approach (used in 12 percent of the surveys reviewed) is to conduct two to four visits during the year on the same households. It was noted above how additional visits to the same households come at a cost, pose logistical challenges, and increase the burden on the respondents. This option can, however, be attractive when the survey also has other objectives, such as collecting data on agricultural activ- ities, to the extent that the visits can be timed around salient moments for both objectives; for example different points in the agricultural season (e.g. post-planting and post-harvest) as is done in the Nigeria National Panel Survey (2010-2011, 2012-2013, 2014-15) and in Enqu\u00eate Nationale sur les Con- ditions de vie des M\u00e9nages et l'Agriculture (2011, 2014) con- ducted for Niger. Finally, three of the surveys reviewed by Smith et al. (2014) collected data in four visits over a 12-month period. This approach is widely deemed to be very difficult to implement and excessively cumbersome in terms of organi - zation, with the burden on respondents at its highest. Some countries implement two rounds of data collection in different periods of the year, but on a different cross-section of house - holds. That does away with the added interview burden for the household, but it only allows controlling for seasonality for the sample aggregate and not for each specific household. Also, it does not provide an opportunity for correcting variance-based measures for excess variability due to intra-year fluctuations. Forty-seven percent of the surveys reviewed by Smith et al. (2014) do not satisfactorily account for seasonality in their design, as they are implemented through one household visit over the span of a few months. This approach returns data that are subject to all the biases discussed at the beginning of this section, but it is quite common because the approach is easy to implement. When staff are employed by different sur - veys implemented by the same statistical office, the approach allows the office to move them on to the next project when the household income and expenditure survey fieldwork is completed. It is often also motivated by the idea that if the period of implementation does not vary, then at least over time, comparison would be safeguarded. This is, however, a questionable assumption, as the extent and timing of seasonal variations may not be the same from one year to the next. Also, any unforeseen implementation issues that would delay the onset of the fieldwork from its planned schedule would invalidate over time comparability of the data. These are very serious concerns that point to the need to abandon this prac- tice for one that takes seasonality fully into account. A hybrid approach that could be experimented, which at least partly limits the more serious shortcomings of the \"one visit over a few months\" approach, would entail complement- ing that one visit with a second visit on a subsample of house - holds. This additional subset visit could provide the information required to correctly annualize the data from the first visit. This is, however, only a hypothetical survey design that would need to be carefully tested before being applied at scale, and as such, it represents at best an indication for further research.14 2.3. ACQUISITION VERSUS CONSUMPTION15 Early on, food consumption data were mainly collected in HCES (in particular, in household budget surveys) to construct the consumer price indices or to inform national accounts. For such uses, the interest was mainly in collecting data on food items acquired through expenditures. Obtaining food through expenditures is now widespread throughout the world and has become the prominent form of food acquisition in many locations, especially in urban areas. However, in many coun - tries, a considerable share of households obtains some food from their own production, such as from crop cultivation, live - stock rearing, fishing and aquaculture, or hunting and gather - ing. It is also quite common for households to obtain some of their food in kind, in the form of gifts from other households, payments from an employer, or public or private assistance (school feeding, food assistance programs, or social or private transfers in kind). As HCES are increasingly used for poverty and food security analysis, the emphasis of the surveys has shifted to also collect - ing data on food items obtained through not only expenditures, but also through other sources of acquisition. Accessibility is one of the dimensions of food and nutrition security, as defined by FAO, which includes access to food from all pos - sible sources. For poverty analysis, all sources of food acqui - sition enter the consumption aggregate, not only those that imply an outlay of cash. With regard to nutritional assessments, 14 An example of this design, using a 20 percent subsample who were revisited approximately five months after the initial visit, is provided by Gibson (2001). The second visit was estimated to add about 10 percent to total survey costs, and made it possible to partition poverty estimates into chronic and transient components. 15 This section is based on and reproduces parts of Conforti, Gr\u00fcnberger, and Troubat (2017).what is actually ingested matters. Again, that implies a focus on consumption (or more specifically, intake) of food regard- less of how it was acquired. Understanding how food systems work and evolve, what share of foods households in different socio-economic groups acquire from different channels, what the relative prices are for households in different locations, and what the nutrition and welfare implications are, requires having access to food data. For national accounts, food produced for own consumption is part of the household final consumption expenditure. Get- ting information on own-account production and consumption of food (as well as other goods) by households is, therefore, critical, even though agriculture surveys or censuses may also provide that information. Such food should be valued at \"basic prices\" of similar goods, which can be approximated by the price of similar goods sold on a local market, or the price declared by the household producer if he or she had sold the food rather than consumed it. Information on food and meals acquired through in-kind transfers is also important. Valuation should be based on actual cost if actually purchased by the provider or production cost, both being unknown and difficult to evaluate by the beneficiary. Not all surveys, however, are designed to capture informa - tion on all the food that is consumed or available for consump - tion in a household from all the sources of acquisition. Three different approaches to collecting food data can be identified, following Conforti et al. (2017): Acquisition. Households report on food they acquired through purchases, own production and in-kind transfers. Actual consumption of the same food is not reported. Combination of acquisition and consumption. House - holds report on acquisition for food they incurred an expenditure for purchases, without specifying the amount of food consumed. Food consumption de - rived from own production or received from trans - fers is reported. Consumption . Households report on food con - sumed, and on whether that same food was purchased, own-produced or received as a transfer. Differences in food measurement among surveys focused on acquisition and consumption are not always clear. In prin- ciple, the difference between the two measures is essentially a change in stocks, and food wasted in households. For surveys based on efficient representative samples homogeneously spread across time and space, changes in stocks should on average be close to zero. In any given reference period, some households may build stocks while others may consume food from stocks. However, surveys with less effective timing of household visits may show significant differences between acquisition and consumption (e.g. if the survey is implemented in one visit when most households are stocking or destocking). Smith et al. (2006) provide a general discussion about the difference between estimates of consumption and acquisition. Depending on the length of survey coverage and reference period, the distribution of acquired food is expected to have a higher variance and a higher mean than the distribution of consumption. The variance of acquisition surveys is higher because daily food consumption is smoother than acquisition. This difference is expected to decrease to zero as the length of the survey period increases. During the reference period, households can either consume from stocks (underestimating household consumption using an acquisition survey) or build stocks (overestimating household consumption using an acqui - sition survey). As a consequence, households can have zero expenditure during a given reference period, albeit consum - ing from stocks (Gibson and Kim, 2012). Acquisition surveys should be used to approximate aggregated consumption of population groups, rather than habitual consumption of indi - vidual households. Acquisition data are assumed to have a higher mean than consumption because food waste, rotten stocks, or food given to pets is already detracted in consump - tion estimates (Smith Alderman and Aduayom, 2006). However, empirical studies suggest that the difference between averages of food acquisition and consumption is not always positive, but they can sometimes be close to zero or even negative (Kaara and Ramasawmy, 2008; Martirosova, 2008; Bouis, 1994). Conforti et al. (2017) analyzed 81 HCES16 conducted between 1988 and 2014 and found that the average dietary energy consumption from surveys focusing on acquisitions was only slightly higher than that from surveys focusing on con - sumption, but the variability was, in turn, much higher (an aver - age coefficient of variation of 76 compared to 52). Though the difference in the aggregate measure is not that significant, the difference in the coefficient of variation is of real concern for FAO, which is using the coefficient of varia - tion derived from food data collected in HCES to estimate the 16 Surveys analysed by the FAO food security and nutrition statistics team from 2006 to 2014, using the ADePT-FSM software developed jointly by FAO and the World Bank (Moltedo et al., 2014).REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 1516 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS prevalence of undernourishment. FAO has developed a meth- odology to overcome the issue of excess variability encoun - tered in the food consumption measurement (Wanner et al., 2014). Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017) applied this method - ology to the Household Socio-Economic Survey 2007/2008 of Mongolia, which collected food consumption and food acquisition.17 They found that the difference in variability that exists between DEC from acquisition and DEC from con - sumption disappears after both distributions are corrected for excess variability (coefficient of variation decreased from 63 to 31 percent for food consumption measurement based on acquisition-type data and from 52 to 30 percent for food consumption measurement based on consumption-type data). The decision to collect acquisition or consumption data is not expected to have a large impact on the estimate of the prevalence of undernourishment, nor poverty, as there is no significant effect on the mean and the impact on variability can be reduced using the control for excess variability. However, for countries with a large population and low average DEC, a small difference in kilocalories per capita per day can still affect food security and nutrition assessments. In addition to those general questions, there is a more spe- cific - but not less important - set of risks associated with survey design that does not explicitly take into account the difference between consumption and acquisition. According to the review performed by Smith et al. (2014), in surveys based on recall interviews, it is not uncommon for questionnaires to include poorly worded leading questions or other forms of design ambiguity that can lead to incomplete enumeration of foods consumed. Such issues arise when the survey design fails to properly consider that not all the food acquired by a household is consumed during the survey reference period, and that food can be consumed during the reference period that was acquired earlier. Their findings are reproduced with minor changes in the remainder of this section and summa - rized in Table 1. For the food data in HCES to be reliably collected, there must be full accounting of either all acquired food intended for consumption or all food that was consumed over the recall period. Additionally, only the food intended for consumption (when acquisition focused) or consumed (when consump - tion focused) during the reference period must be included, not any additional food. The following exclusion and inclusion 17 The latter survey measures a household's food acquisition, and food stocks at the beginning and the end of the reference period. Combining the information of acquisition and stock variation, the household's food consumption can also be derived from food acquisition.accounting errors can adversely affect the collection of HCES food data: 1. Acquisition surveys: rule-out leading question on consumption. If a leading or \"filter\" question on consumption of each food item over the recall period is answered \"no,\" collection of further data on the acquisition of the food can be ruled out. In this case, respondents are first asked whether they consumed each food item in the food list for a recall period of up to one year before the time of the survey. Then, they are asked how much was purchased, consumed from own production, or received in kind over the survey recall period for food data collection. However, if the respondent answers \"no\" to the leading question, the instructions skip to the next item, then, the household receives a zero for acquisitions of the food item regardless of whether or not it was acquired. This leads to systematic underestimation of the quantities and expenditures on food acquired. A rule- out leading question on consumption is considered to be a problem when the two recall periods are less than or equal to two months apart. Note that this issue does not affect diary surveys because there is no pre-listing of foods to rule out. 2. Acquisition surveys: rule-out, short-recall-period leading question on acquisition. Here, if answered \"no,\" a short-recall-period leading question on acquisition of each food item rules out further data collection on the acquisition of the food over the (longer) survey recall period. In this case, respondents are first asked whether or not they acquired each food item over the short recall period (e.g., two weeks). Further information is collected on the acquisitions of the food for the longer recall period for food data collection only for those food items that were acquired over the shorter recall period. This leads to underestimation of mean food acquisi- tion for the population. 3. Acquisition surveys: rule-out leading question on food purchases. In this case, if a respondent reports that the household did not purchase a food item, then no further information is col - lected on other forms of acquisition of that food item. As home-produced or in-kind receipts are left out, this prob- lem also leads to underestimation of mean food acquisition for the population. 4. Data collected on food harvested rather than food consumed from home production. When interviewees declare food har - vested instead of food consumed from own production or food from own production for consumption, the quantities and expenditure on food acquired include those entering into the households' production stocks - not the household pantry for immediate consumption - and are systematic overestimates of food consumed from home production. A similar situation occurs when there are household animals, such as poultry and pigs, that may eat some of the food that was harvested from household food gardens (e.g., under - sized tubers, and food that is deemed as otherwise unfit for human consumption given the food availability at the time). 5. Ambiguity about whether to report on acquisition or consump - tion. The question asked to respondents does not make it clear whether they are expected to report on their acqui- sitions or consumption of each food item over the recall period. This problem leads to inaccuracies in the calculation of the mean acquisition or consumption for the population and measures of inequality. 6. Routine month surveys: Ambiguity about whether respondents should report on the routine month in the recall period or only on those months in which the food item is actually consumed. In many routine-month surveys, respondents are first asked to report on the number of months in the past year in which each food item was consumed. Immediately following, they are asked about the usual or average amount per month. Some questionnaires, however, fail to specify whether the average should be for those months in which it was consumed or for any month in the last year. When this type of accounting error occurs, some households may report on the former and some the latter, leading to over- or underestimation of their consumption of any food item for which a positive number of months was reported for the initial question. As can be seen in Table 1, 11 percent of the assessment sur - veys suffer from the use of the three types of rule-out leading questions. The collection of data on food harvested rather than food consumed from home production is a relatively rare problem, which affects only 2 percent of the surveys. A full 14 percent of the surveys had problems of ambiguity in what is to be reported, which likely leads to incomplete enu- meration for some households. The problem of ambiguity in expected reporting for routine month surveys was identified in 8 percent of the surveys. Overall, 25 percent of the sur - veys had not met the reliability criterion for completeness of enumeration, that is, they were affected by some of the identified problems of incomplete enumeration. Note that the large majority of the surveys with those types of accounting problems are interview surveys.2.4. MEAL PARTICIPATION The size of a household is only a proxy for the number of food consumers in the household during the reference period. Per-capita measures of food consumption should be based on the number of people who actually take part in the meals (food partakers) in the household (Smith et al., 2014; Weisell and Dop, 2012). People other than household members who could take part in the household's meals include employees who had their meals in the household, guests, and visitors. The number of food partakers should exclude household members not present in the household during the reference period. Adjustment for food partakers may not be an issue for pov - erty measures, but collecting that information is essential for the analysis of habitual per capita food consumption and food security estimates. Indeed, nutrient inadequacy is assessed with reference to requirements that are expressed in a per per - son basis. Household surveys collect information on total amount of food consumed by households over a certain reference period. T o convert this information to a per capita basis, it is Table 1 \u2014 Completeness of enumeration of food aquisition and/ or food consumption Interview Diary All (percent) Whether aquisition or consumption data are collected Aquisition 36.1 48.7 41.0 Consumption 36.1 10.3 26.0 Both 27.9 41.0 33.0 Problems of incomplete enumeration Rule-out leading question on consumption13.1 0.0 8.0 Rule-out short-recall-period leading question on aquisition3.3 0.0 2.0 Rule-out leading question on food purchases1.6 0.0 1.0 Own production question refers to food harvested rather than consumed3.3 0.0 2.0 Ambiguity whether to report on aquisition or consumption6.6 6.0 \"Usual month\" surveys: Ambiguity whether to report consumption in any month or months with positive consumption13.1 0.0 8.0 Percent of surveys with problems of incomplete enumeration37.7 5.1 25.0 Note: N=100 surveysREVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 1718 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS important to account for meal participation in the household. The most common way to do this is to consider the number of people who consumed the total amount of food reported by the household. However, there is no standard approach to capturing infor - mation on meal participation in households, and many surveys fail to collect that information. Smith et al. (2014), in their sur - vey assessment, find that only 15 of 100 surveys ask whether non-household members were present or consumed meals in the household during the recall period. Even within this small number, there is variability on the additional informa - tion collected, with 11 asking about the number of visitors in the household, 10 about the number of meals they consumed, and a handful also asking information on the length of stay, type of meals they consumed, and age and sex of the guests. Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) provide a thorough description of approaches to collecting partakers. Reviewing 17 recent surveys, they found 16 different possible questions combined in various ways, with no two countries collecting the same information on partakers (Table 2). Partaker correction should in theory have no impact on the overall sample mean of per capita food consumption because positive and negative deviations from the household size bal- ance out.18 On average, the household size should be equal to the number of partakers. The multivariate analysis of 81 HCES19 that were conducted between 1988 and 2014 (Con- forti, Gr\u00fcnberger, and Troubat, 2017) indicated no significant difference between the mean and the coefficient of variance of DEC per capita accounting for partakers, when controlling for other survey characteristics. However, there is empirical evidence to believe that not accounting for partakers distorts the distribution of per capita DEC. In analyzing surveys from Kenya and the Philippines that collect information on partakers, Bouis et al. (1992) and Bouis (1994) show that the relative difference between mean DEC of the first and fourth quartile is much lower when partakers are accounted for. Similarly, using an urban survey, Gibson and Rozelle (2012) show how using the roster of meal partakers lowers the apparent calorie availability of the richest quartile by 7 percent and raises the calories of the poorest, in cases in which this pattern results from a coping strategy of the poor, which is to visit their wealthier kinfolk at meal times. Those 18 If meals consumed in another household have a corresponding entry as meals given to another household. 19 Surveys analysed by the FAO food security analysis team from 2006 to 2014, using the ADePT-FSM software developed jointly by FAO and the World Bank (Moltedo et al., 2 014).studies, therefore, provide evidence that the variability of DEC conditional on household income is lower if data are adjusted for partakers. Results in line with those of Bouis, Haddad, and Kennedy (1992) were confirmed by a similar analysis conducted by FAO on food data collected in the 2010 Bangladesh survey (Gr\u00fcn- berger, 2017b). In that survey, information was collected daily on the number of people partaking in the meal, by gender and age groups. The variability of DEC conditional on income is much lower once DEC was adjusted for partakers, and the difference between household size and the number of par - takers increased monotonically with income (Figure 5). A clear upward trend in the difference between per capita and BOX 3 \u2014 ESTIMATING AVERAGE PER CAPITA DIETARY ENERGY CONSUMPTION Based on household size and the number of partakers, per capita DEC of a household i can be calculated in two ways. First by dividing the total number of daily calories consumed in a household by the exact number of people who partic- ipated in the meals or, if the above is not available, by dividing total household calories by the number of household members In the latter case, food consumption is underestimated if mean consumption is calculated on the basis of household size. When food is provided also to non-household mem - ber partakers, the total food consumption in the house - hold increases. The household's mean consumption should be correctly calculated by dividing total household food consumption by household size plus additional partakers minus absent household members. In omitting the additional partakers from the calculation, the denominator is smaller and the household's mean consumption is overestimated. If absent household members are not subtracted from house - hold size, the denominator is higher and household's mean consumption is underestimated.DECp i = TotalDECi DECHH i = TotalDECi HHsizeiPartakerspartakers-adjusted mean DEC can be observed between the bottom and the top decile. Researchers from the FAO Statistics Division analyzed five surveys that collected information on partakers and found that the coefficient of variation of DEC was systematically lower when household size was adjusted for partakers, even though the five surveys used different approaches to collect data on partakers (Table 3). In the 2010 Bangladesh House - hold Income and Expenditure Survey, the respondents were asked to report daily on the number of people present in the household and their demographic characteristics. In the Household Socio-Economic Survey 2007-2008 of Mongolia, information on the number of visitors and the number of days they stayed in the household was collected. In the 2007-08 Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment and a survey conducted by Niger in 2011, respondents were asked to report on the number of meals and number of days that visitors stayed in their house.

One must be careful not to conclude from this evidence that meal participation is not an important issue; indeed, it still needs to be addressed.21 Household socio-economic surveys that currently attempt to make those adjustments are few and highly diverse. In several countries, the questionnaires appear to capture only a portion of the requisite information and the results are likely subject to considerable measurement error. Furthermore, there are several reasons why it is believed that the importance of, and need for, those adjustments is increasing; foremost is the secular, seemingly universal trend of the growing practice of consuming food away from home. It is noteworthy that, by implication, those studies may not pro- vide an accurate portrayal of the actual situation in several of the studied countries: i.e. the findings may be false negatives regarding the importance of making adjustments for meal par - ticipation. This is especially likely to be the case in countries where there is greater travel away from home and where, more generally, there is a more widespread practice of eating away from home. It is, therefore, difficult to make any defin - itive assessments about the value of making adjustments for meals, or about the feasibility or best practices of collecting the requisite information to make the adjustments. A review of select questionnaires of more recent household socio-economic surveys have revealed that over the course of the past few years a number of countries \u2014 India, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tan- zania, among others \u2014 have introduced new questions to identify who among the household's members were meal par - takers and which meals were eaten away from home, and by 20 The FAO methodology should be able to correct for the excess variability because of the non-adjustment for partakers: for two (Bangladesh and Uganda) of the five countries analysed, the coefficient of variation corrected based on DEC using household size and the coefficient of variation corrected based on DEC using partakers were found to be different. 21 This discussion is based on Fiedler and Mwang (2016).REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 21 whom. Several of the surveys have also inquired about meals that households provide to non-household members. Those modifications appear to have been motivated by concerns that food away from home is increasing in frequency, is significantly underreported, and is distorting the precision of food secu - rity analyses. 2.5. FOOD AWAY FROM HOME Consumption patterns are rapidly changing across the devel- oping world, with prepared and packaged meals and meals consumed outside the home taking an ever-growing share of the households' food budget. Amid rising incomes, urbaniza - tion, women entering the labor force, and children eating at schools, among various reasons, this trend is expected to per - sist as economies transition to middle-income status (Maxwell and Slater, 2003; FAO, 2006; Popkin, 2008; Smith, 2013; USDA, 2011). As food away from home gains importance, failing to appropriately measure this component of food consumption and expenditure will make comparisons of consumption pat- terns and poverty less and less meaningful. In the United States, the share of food away from home in total food expenditure increased from 10 to 50 percent during the twentieth century. In urban China, total expenditure on food away from home increased by 63 percent between 1995 and 2001 (Ma et al., 2006; see Figure 6). Household per cap- ita expenditure on food away from home rose at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent in China from 2002 to 2011, while the share of food away from home in total food expenditure increased from 18.2 percent to 21.5 percent (Y ou, 2014). In Egypt and India, the prevalence of meals eaten away from home almost doubled in less than 20 years. Taking into account food away from home consumption is particularly important for measuring calorie consumption, as food consumed outside the home tends to be more calo- rie-dense than food consumed at home (Poti et al.,Mancino et al., 2009) and the amount of food consumed away tends to increase more rapidly, in line with increases in income. Food away from home has been found to contribute to as much as 36 percent of the daily energy intake among men in urban Kenya, and 59 percent among women in urban Nigeria (Oguntona and T ella, 1999; van't Riet et al., 2003). Among the younger population, food away from home contributes, for example, to 18 percent and 40 percent of the daily energy intake among Chinese children and school-going adolescents in Benin, respectively (Liu et al., 2015; Nago et al., 2010).Most nationally representative household surveys have not kept up with the pace of change in food pathways and collect very limited information on food away from home. Smith et al. (2014), when assessing the relevance and reliability of their sample of 100 surveys, found that 90 percent of the surveys consider food away from home in some form, but that most of the approaches are \"ad hoc and unsatisfactory.\" For example, 25 percent of the surveys aim to capture all related household consumption from food away from home using just one ques- tion; one in five surveys considers multiple places of consump - tion; only 35 percent take snacks explicitly into account (when most snacking is expected to take place out of the home); and close to 50 percent of the surveys do not include food away from home received in kind. While it is widely recognized that food away from home is subject to considerable measurement error, the exact amount it contributes to underestimating consumption is unknown. However, as food away from home is expected to increase as a proportion of total food consumed and total food expenditure, if no changes are made in the way that information is collected, the magnitude of that underestimation is expected to increase. As it does, it will exacerbate the instability of household con- sumption and expenditure surveys based on estimates of food insecurity and under-nutrition as currently measured, (Tandon and Landes, 2011; D'Souza and Tandon, 2014; Smith, 2015), obfuscate trends, and prompt more researchers to question whether even the general order of magnitude of the estimates of global under-nutrition should be accepted (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). The inadequate collection of food away from home data urgently needs to be better understood and sys- tematically improved. Only a few studies have analyzed the implications that failing to account for food away from home can have on food secu- rity analysis.22, 23 In a study conducted in India, Smith (2013) argues that the great Indian calorie debate, originated by an 22 With obesity increasingly becoming a pressing health issue in some middle-income countries, the link between eating out and obesity is also drawing attention in the developing world (Bezerra and Sichieri, 2009). 23 The literature on food away from home in the developed world has a longer history in which the main focus has been on health and nutrition issues. There is widespread interest in studying the differences in the caloric and nutritional composition of the food provided by commercial outlets relative to home-made food, with the objective of understanding the health consequences of eating out (Vandevijvere et al., 2009). In particular, high calorie concentration found in certain meals raised particular concern, giving rise to a body of research devoted to understanding the link between obesity and eating out, among other health outcomes Burns et al., 2002; Guthrie et al., 2002; Kant and Graubard, 2004; Binkley et al., 2004). There is also interest in establishing food-based dietary guidelines to prevent obesity and related chronic diseases developed later in life (Phillips et al., 2013).22 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS apparent increase in undernourishment at the time of falling poverty rates, can be partly explained by inaccurate data on calorie intake because of the lack of measurement of food away from home. Similarly, Borlizzi et al. (2017) show in Brazil how the distribution of food consumption by income strata changes once food consumed at school is taken into account. In par - ticular, they show that proper accounting for food received through a school feeding program targeted at the poorer strata of the population results in a more equal distribution of food consumption than previously thought. Capturing food away from home increases mean DEC, as it is an important food source, especially in urban areas. Smith (2015) shows that food away from home is positively correlated with the estimated mean dietary energy consumption. In many house - hold consumption and expenditure surveys, food away from home is only measured in terms of monetary value. However, as meals eaten outside the home are different than meals at home (Rimmer, 2001), the conversion of monetary value into calories can be misleading if home food consumption is used as a benchmark to calculate calories from food away from home. Using data for Peru, Farf\u00e1n et al. (2017) evaluated the impact of accounting for food away from home on poverty and con- sumption inequality estimates. They show that from a theo - retical point of view the direction of the effect on poverty or inequality cannot be predicted ex ante. Empirically, they demonstrate that failure to adequately capture food away from home may generate serious biases in estimates of households' expenditure patterns and welfare measures and may change the underlying profile of the poor. There is considerable evidence about a large variety of socio-economic factors associated with eating away from home. Measurement error from neglecting food away from home may, therefore, bias welfare analyses along those lines. In several countries, geography, household size and composition have been shown to be systematically related to the incidence and level of food away from home consumption and expendi- ture (Meenakshi and Ray, Jones, 1997; Mutlu and Gracia, 2006; Meng et al., 2012). Households composed mainly of the elderly have also been found to have lower probabilities of relying on, and lower expenditure on, food away from home (Redman, 1980; Meng et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015). Conceptual and practical challenges make integrating food away from home in household surveys a complex exercise. First, a clear definition of what is meant by food away from home is needed.Figure 8 contains an outline of a useful way to concep - tualize and measure food away from home along with some key measurement issues to consider. Food away from home can refer to food produced outside, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. In that case, takeout meals would be considered food away from home. Alternatively, it can refer to food consumed outside irrespec- tive of the origin of the food. Under that scenario, home-made meals consumed at work or at school would be a component of food away from home. While there is a general preference towards defining food away from home based on the place of preparation of the food, a clear protocol that takes into account all the different pieces is required to be well defined regardless of the concept that is adopted. A second element to consider when collecting information on food away from home is snacks, which in modern eating habits are more likely to be consumed outside the home. Finally, there can be dif - ferent modes of acquisition of the food, including purchased Figure 6 \u2014 The rapid rise of food away from home in the United States and China 0,050,100,150,200,25 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012Share of Total Food ExpenditureUrban China Eating Out/Total Food Grain/Total Food0,010,020,030,0 40,050,060,0 1929 1954 1957 1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 2011 2014Food away from home as a share of food expenditures, USA, (1929-2014) Source: Calculated by the Economic Research Service, USDA, from various data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. USDA-ERS (26/1/2016) (left panel); Gibson (2016) (right panel).food or food received in kind, each of which can originate from multiple sources, such as from commercial establish - ments, social programs, and other households. While a great deal of attention has been paid to food that household mem- ber purchases and, to a lesser extent, food (or meals) that household members receive free as part of a social interven- tion (most commonly a school meal), there is evidence from China and India that \"hosted\" meals provided free to friends or relatives are also an important, distinct category (Bai et al., 2010; Fiedler 2015). In China, \"hosted\" meals were found to account for nearly 50 percent of all food away from home and to be disproportionately important for lower income groups. In India, they accounted for 29 percent of all meals away from home, and 36 percent of all persons with at least one meal away from home reported having at least one hosted meal provided by another household. Of the issues covered in the guidelines, this is probably the area which is the most difficult to trace one set of agreed upon international practices. The discussion that follows is centred on a food away from home definition based on where the food is prepared. The inclusion of food prepared at home but eaten outside would most likely result in double count - ing as the ingredients would already be accounted for under the category food available in the household from different sources. In addition, while for food at home, the main food preparer is likely to be adequately informed about the food consumed by all household members, no one individual will be in such a privileged position to report about the food con - sumption patterns of other household members away from home. Food away from home may, therefore, needs to be captured at the individual level, interviewing different respon- dents when possible.24 An additional question relates to what information to col- lect from respondents. For nutrition and food security analysis, it is important to have information (from within the survey or from other sources that can be integrated into the survey) on what is eaten, which is a challenge for food away from home, as meal content is likely unknown to the consumer.25 Options include: differentiating between meal, drink and snacks; asking by eating occasion (breakfast, midday snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner); reporting the source of preparation (commer - cial, government or social program, employer, other house- hold); differentiating by the type of establishment (fine dining, fast-food restaurant, street vendor); reporting day of the week (or weekday or weekend). Note that snacks can be as if not more important than some meals in terms of both calories and expenditure. As a result, it is very important that they are adequately captured in the data-collection instrument. In recognition of those challenges, several low- and mid - dle-income countries have in recent years adopted innovative approaches to food away from home data collection. Details of experiences from India, Peru and the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union are detailed in the Annex 2.26 In the United States, USDA has recently introduced the Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, which collects data at the individual level through food books. Attention to food away from home is ensured by including a reminder in the food books to record meals, snacks and drinks consumed at a number of different outlets, such as at school, work, a relative's home, or recreational sites. Kirlin and Denbaly (2017) provide a detailed account of data collection in this survey. With all their differences, those approaches to collecting food away from home in recent Household Consumption and 24 In a small-scale study in an urban slum in India Sujatha et al. (1997) interviewed husbands and wives about the men's dietary intake, and found that women are not aware of the foods consumed by their spouses outside of their home. Similarly, Gewa et al. (2007) found that mothers of rural school-aged Kenyan children missed 77 percent and 41 percent of the energy intake originated in food away from home in the food shortage and harvest seasons, respectively (where food away from home contributes to 13 percent and 19 percent of daily energy intake in each season.) Collecting data from children is particularly challenging and not commonly done in household surveys in low- and middle- income countries. The report recommends a proxy respondent for children mainly because this is a widely accepted approach in practice and there is no established viable alternative implemented at scale. This is a topic that warrants further research given the growing importance of food away from home and publicly financed feeding programs, on children's diets. 25 The caloric and nutritional content of meals consumed away from home can be sourced through complementary data sources, either purposely run surveys (as the survey of food establishments conducted in Lima and described in (Farf\u00e1n et al., 2017) or via administrative data, such as in the case of school meals. 26 See Annex 2.Figure 7 \u2014 Energy intake from food away from home (%) Sources: R.

LIST OF FOOD ITEMS The design of the list of food items included in a survey affects how food consumption is reported by respondents (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Gibson, 2005). As a list with more items is likely to help respondents more accurately remembering their consumption or acquisition events, a longer and more disaggre - gated food list results in higher reported consumption (Beegle et al., 2012; Carrol, Crossely and Sabelhaus, 2015). However, very long food lists can quickly lead to greater respondent and interviewer fatigue (Gibson, 2005). The choice of items to be included needs also to be country specific to reflect dif - ferences in diets. An \"optimal\" food list length should balance the lower memory lapses and the lower costs and interview time associated with short lists, with the better recall and more comprehensive reporting associated with the longer list.What is Food a way from home (FAFH)?

The list should fit all households in a given popula - tion, from poorest rural to richest urban households consuming a very wide variety of foods. Diary-based surveys can use a predefined list or be open-ended. The sample of surveys analyzed in Smith, Dupriez, and Troubat (2014)27 reveals sub - stantial variability in the number of food items in HCES globally. The mean number of food items in dia- ry-based surveys in their review is far higher than in interview-based surveys (229 and 102, respectively). The number of food items spans greatly across surveys, from a low of 19 to a high of 677. When the number of food items recorded by respondents is not predetermined, the aggregated list of items is usually far longer than the predefined list, which, in turn, affect the value of reported consumption. T ucker and Bennett (1988) report that diaries of an experimental United States survey with preprinted items lead to higher total expenditure esti - mates than blank fill-in diaries, especially for older persons (see also T ucker, 1992). Several studies in low- and middle-income countries indi - cate that longer disaggregated lists result in higher food consumption reporting than shorter aggregated lists. In the experimental study of Beegle et al. (2012), seven-day recall interviews with lists of 58, 17 and 11 food items were tested; the list with 58 items returned the highest consumption esti- mate. Jolliffe (2001) reports that for a survey in El Salvador, a longer food item list (72 items) resulted in 20 percent higher food consumption compared to questionnaires with only 18 aggregated food categories. Food data collected in a Jamaican experimental survey show 26 percent higher consumption 27 The numbers reported herein exclude the Brazil diary survey, which is a significant outlier at 5,407 items. Many of the items are, however, simply similar items named or spelled differently.Source: Smith, Lisa C. and Timothy R. Frankenberger. 2012. Typology of food away from home. TANGO International, T ucson, AZ.with 119 items compared to 37 items (Statistical Institute and Planning Institute of Jamaica, 1996). In Indonesia's SUSENAS survey, questionnaires with exten- sive item lists (218 items) showed about 7 percent higher food consumption than questionnaires that had only 15 aggregated food categories (Pradhan, 2009). The longer list required a much smaller than proportionate increase in time relative to the increase in the number of items, although published figures from the study combined the food and non-food consumption lists (52 minutes for 23 items and 82 minutes for 320 items). Similarly, in the United Republic of Tanzania (Beegle et al. 2012), reducing the list length by as much as 80 percent resulted in a reduction in interview times by only 17 percent (49 and 41 minutes for the 58- and 17-item lists, respectively). Additionally, Bradburn (2010) has noted that grouping ques - tions (and food types) can help to minimize the cognitive effort for respondents to recall the requested information, leading to lower recall error. This implies, for example, that food away from home questions should be reported in a separate group. \"Friedman et al. (2017) decompose the error response in food consumption measurement into two different compo - nents: the omission of any consumption item, and the error in reporting the value. The shorter food list has lower con- sumption incidence as compared to a diary survey benchmark for the large majority of food groups. For consumption value, on the other hand, a shorter food list module is character - ized as having the most over-reports of consumption values in comparison to the diary benchmark, conditional on positive consumption.\" Analyses of the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) often used by nutritionists also support the use of longer lists. Wakai (2009) finds that long FFQs (97+ foods) display higher correlation with weighed food records (r=0.42 to 0.52), than short FFQs (< 70 food items, r=0.31 to 0.45). Similarly, Hen- r\u00edquez-S\u00e1nchez (2009) finds that FFQs with >100 food items correlated more strongly with weighed food records (r=0.52) than FFQs with less than 100 items (r=0.47). A longer, more qualitatively differentiated food list is preferable. In summary, given that the incremental interview time required for additional items is relatively small, having a rela - tively long list is recommended. On the other hand, one should not underplay the possibility that a longer interview time may prompt enumerators to take shortcuts in interviewing (Finn and Ranchhod, 2015) and respondents to refuse to participate or terminate the interview ahead of the required time (Deaton and Grosh, 2000). This is particularly the case when a ques - tionnaire has a cascading structure, as respondents are more likely to not report some expenditure to skip other questions (Kreuter et al., 2011). In the following paragraphs, some criteria that can help practitioners deal with this complex balancing act are discussed. A major recommendation in drawing a food list is to align the food list with standard international classification systems. The United Nations COICOP provides the reference interna - tional classification for individual consumption expenditures. It is an integral part of the System of National Accounts, intended for use in household consumption and expenditure surveys and for the compilation of consumer price indices, as well as international comparisons of gross domestic product and its component expenditures through purchasing power pari- ties. Between 2012 and 2017, COICOP went through a major revision, resulting in COICOP 201828. This version, which was endorsed by UNSC in March 201829, provides greater gran - ularity as compared to the past, thanks to the introduction of an additional level of detail (from a three- to four-level structure).30 FAO actively participated in the process, leading the revision of Division 01 on food and non-alcoholic bev - erages, particularly taking into account and advocating the need to ensure relevance for low- and middle-income coun- tries. T o supplement the official structure, and to guide coun- tries expanding Division 01 in their national versions, FAO also developed an official annex to COICOP , which includes 307 additional food products at the fifth level. The annex is included in the COICOP publication Another source for standard classification is FoodEx2, a comprehensive food classification carried out by the Euro - pean Food Safety Authority, which was recently updated to cover global needs (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). FoodEx 2 is an additional reference classification of particular relevance when a survey is expected to be used to conduct nutrition analysis. An important external reference to consider when drawing a survey food list is food composition tables. Included items in the food list must match unambiguously to an entry in the food composition table in order to convert food quantities into 28 COICOP 2018 can be downloaded at (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/ statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item3l-Classification-2-E.pdf). 29 Offici al Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2018, Supplement No. 4 (E/2018/24-E/CN.3/2018/3). 30 Sixty-eight new classes at the third level and 337 new subclasses at the fourth level.REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 2526 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS nutrient quantities (FAO/INFOODS, 2012).31 This is extremely important if the data are to be used for nutrition and food security analysis, as calorie and nutrient composition can only be derived if the food items can be matched at the analysis stage to a corresponding relevant food composition table. The conversion table should ideally be finalized before the survey goes to the field to ensure that the breakdown of the food items is compatible and that the availability of nutrient content data can inform the design of the survey food list.32 The length and composition of the food list should be for - mulated, bearing in mind how data are supposed to be used. From a welfare perspective, it is essential that the items rep- resenting the large majority of food expenditures are included. From a nutrition perspective, the food items that are import- ant sources of nutrients in individual diets must be included; items that contribute little to the understanding of individual nutrient intake are less important. As a result, welfare and nutrition requirements do not necessarily correspond. Accord - ingly, choices pertaining to the food list tend to be \"topic ori- ented\", even if surveys are meant to be designed for a wide range of users. A nutrition-oriented food list is likely to include more items than a welfare-oriented list. One common solution in HCES is to list the most common food items consumed by the population, and include \"other, specify\" items in each cat- egory in the parts of the survey in which acquisition or con- sumption of additional food items can be recorded. However, this entails additional challenges if the intention is to estimate nutrient contents, as the matching with a food composition table becomes uncertain.33 Finally, when the objective is to collect data in order to eval - uate the impact of a nutrient fortification program, the food list should include all food items that are directly fortified with such nutrients and their products. For example, if there is an interest in assessing the nutritional impact of fortified wheat flour, the list of foods should include fortified wheat flour and the products made with that type of flour, such as bread, bis- cuits, and pies. As diets evolve, food lists must be regularly updated to reflect dietary changes. This is particularly relevant in urban areas where a wider variety of foods is typically eaten, and 31 It is also recommended that countries invest in the development of good reference food composition tables and in keeping them up to date. 32 If a food composition table is available, it can also be used to pre- program computer-assisted personal interviewing software to perform built-in checks for excessive consumption and speed up data analysis and cleaning. 33 See Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) for a discussion on this issue.processed foods34 and prepared foods form a larger share of the diets (Popkin et al., 2012) and budgets. Again, a nutrition perspective entails a higher specificity of the food list, including and distinguishing different levels of food processing, from min - imally processed foods such as yogurt, cheese, bread and fro- zen vegetables, to highly-processed and ultra-processed foods rich in sugar, fat, and salt, which have been shown to be associ - ated with obesity and other diet-related diseases.35 Using data from Brazil, for instance, a recent paper by Louzada et al. (2017) concludes that HCES hold potential in reporting consumption of ultra-processed foods, as there is substantial convergence between the data collected in an individual dietary intake sur - vey and HCES data in terms of relative energy consumption from ultra-processed foods. 2.7. NON-STANDARD UNITS OF MEASUREMENT T o be meaningful, food quantities collected through HCES need to be standardized; this allows for the aggregation and comparison of consumption across food items and geographical areas, or for translation into nutrient content.36 In many surveys, units are not standardized, especially in those conducted in sub-Saharan Africa where non-standard units are commonly used in daily life (Deaton and Dupriez, 2011). Smith and Subandoro (2007) have identified seven primary methods for collecting information about consumption quan- tities, and advocate using a combination of those methods, as one method may be the optimal solution for certain items, but it may not be appropriate for others. 1. Metric (i.e. standard) units: Respondents report quantities in metric units, such as kilograms or liters. 2. Monetary value: Respondents report the monetary value of the quantity consumed. 3. Local (i.e. non-standard) units, such as piles, baskets, or bunches. 4. A count of pieces: a type of non-standard unit. 34 Processed food is defined as: \"Any food other than a raw agricultural commodity and includes any raw agricultural commodity that has been subject to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration, or milling\" (USDA, 1946). 35 The Brazilian dietary guidelines include a classification of foods by level of processing. See, for example Brazil, Ministry of Health (2015). 36 Estimating the quantities of foods consumed away from home poses its own set of issues, mainly concerning the paucity of data broken down by individual food items. Nevertheless, quantities can be estimated if respondents report on the foods and dishes that were consumed rather than only their total expenditures (see Smith and Subandoro (2007) for the detailed methodology to be used when this information is available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom.5. Volumetric equivalents: respondents demonstrate how much space the food they consumed would take up.37 6. Linear dimensions: respondents provide linear measure - ments (length and width or circumference) for the amount of food consumed. As Smith and Subandoro (2007) point out, this method likely takes more time to complete, as it requires physical measurement rather than a simple vocal response. 7. Food models: respondents choose a two- or three-dimen- sional depiction of a food item that best corresponds to their consumption. Three-dimensional models can provide very accurate estimates, but it can be costly to prepare the models and calculate their weights. For all but the first method, additional data are required to convert the reported information into standardized, compa- rable (metric) quantities. Collecting quantities in non-standard units or restricting respondents to only reporting in standard units involves trade-offs in accuracy and feasibility. In the sam- ple of HCES analyzed by Smith et al. (2014), the most com - mon method employed is requiring respondents to report in a metric unit of measure. This method is usually the easiest to administer with the lowest budget and time cost; it also requires the least amount of post-data processing, as the units are already comparable across items. However, restricting respondents to using only standard units may result in inaccurate estimates, especially when respondents are not accustomed to using them for all of the items they consume. Reporting quantities in non-standard units is quite common for a wide range of commodities, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in the second wave of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey from 2013 to 2014 in which non-standard units were allowed, nearly 50 percent of farmers chose to report their harvests in non-standard units. In the Malawi National Panel Survey, respondents chose non-standard units about 73 percent of the time. This strongly indicates that many respondents are more comfortable reporting quanti - ties in non-standard units. Accordingly, allowing them to be used eases the burden on respondents in terms of memory 37 An advantage of bounded recall is that the initial visit to begin the recall period also allows survey teams to distribute standardized volumetric containers, such as an empty sack. This can be especially helpful in cases in which bulky root crops or plantains are dietary staples because a rural household might fill a sack several times over in the course of a week, with root crop consumption of 50 kg or more. The Papua New Guinea survey used by Gibson (2001) distributed empty 25 kg sacks and these were the preferred non-standard units for all root crops and vegetables, with local weighing trials for converting sacks (and partial sacks) into kilograms.recall and conversion calculations, reducing the accuracy of the resulting data. Recent studies show that asking respondents to combine memory recall with cognitive tasks, such as abstracting con - sumption to a \"typical week or month,\" leads to less accurate self-reporting (Beegle et al., 2010). The forced conversion from non-standard to standard units similarly combines cognitive and memory recall; respondents must (a) have a clear under - standing of what a standard unit of the food item is (e.g. how much is a kilogram of rice); (b) estimate how many standard units correspond to the non-standard unit they are familiar with; and (c) use the conversion from step two to convert the quantity consumed into standard units. The three stages place a cognitive burden on the respondent and can lead to a sizable measurement error. It is also common practice for such calculations to be conducted in-situ, often on-the-fly (as the respondent makes the calculations in their head, perhaps prompted or assisted by an interviewer), further increasing the likelihood for error. Accordingly, the most important and overriding benefit of allowing respondents to report quantities using non-stan - dard units is that they will likely report more accurately on consumed quantities. Results from a recent methodologi - cal study of land area measurement support the preference for non-standard units. Carletto et al. (2016) finds that when respondents are allowed to report land area in non-standard units - instead of being forced to convert an area to stan - dard units - the self-reported estimates are much more accu- rate. The additional costs and challenges associated with this method broadly fall into two categories: those associated with preparation and implementation of a survey with non-standard units; and ensuring that non-standard units measurements can be converted into comparable standard units. Before non-standard units can be used, country-spe - cific information on common non-standard units is needed to determine the list of allowable item-unit combinations. Non-standard units must also be accompanied by standard unit conversion factors. T o directly compare and aggregate quantities, the data user must convert all quantities into a common standard unit, such as kilograms. Cap\u00e9au (1995) and Cap\u00e9au and Dercon (2006) suggest using econometric tech - niques to compare unit values and estimate conversion factors that are relatively simple to implement. The challenge with that approach is that unit values can vary as a result of quality differences (Deaton, 1997), or from price discounts on larger units (Attanasio and Frayne, 2006), or over time and space REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 2728 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS because of the impact of transport and storage costs (Gib - son and Kim, 2015). The sources of variability in unit values that are unrelated to mass or volume can result in distorted or imprecisely estimated conversion factors (Oseni, Durazo, and McGee, 2017). An alternative method is to collect weights for each allow- able item-unit combination and use them to create conversion factors. This is a relatively straightforward concept. However, there are a whole set of challenges involved in properly imple - menting this concept. The standard weight for the same item- unit combination can vary, even within a country. For example, Casley and Kumar (1988) found that in Nigeria, an average \"bundle\" of sorghum weighed between 26 and 49 kilograms, depending on the area. Thus, region-specific conversion fac - tors also need to be considered. Complicating matters further, different levels of processing (fresh, dried or powered) lead to different conversion factors for the same food item.38 This method has also been recently implemented in the context of a project of survey harmonization in the countries belonging to the West African Economic and Monetary Union, following the recent guidebook published by the World Bank ((Oseni et al., 2017) (see Box 4 for details). 38 This is similar to food crops harvested under different conditions, such as threshed, shelled, fresh, and dried, which are proven to have a large impact on reported harvest quantities (Fermont and Benson, 2011; Diskin 1999; Murphy, Casley, and Curry, 1991).BOX 4 \u2014 COLLECTION OF CONVERSION FACTORS IN CONTEXT OF THE WESTERN AFRICA ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNIT PROJECT As part of the Regional Program to Harmonize and Modernize Living Conditions Surveys in the West African Monetary Union, participating national statistical offices collect consumption data that allows reporting in non-standard units of measurement. T o prepare for this, market surveys were conducted to establish conversion factors from non-standard units, such as bowls and heaps, to standard units (kg, litre) for commonly consumed food items. Following guidance from Oseni et al. (2017), the national statistical offices conducted market surveys ahead of the main household surveys. In the spirit of harmonization, all countries involved in the program followed the same procedure. a. Preparation phase: included a review of previous surveys and preliminary markets visits to identify products and commonly used non-standard units. The resulting product-unit list - and options to report additional found units - were programmed into Survey Solutions, a computer-assisted personal interview software for data collection. b. Field work: was conducted in the post-harvest season to ensure wider availability of products. Enumerators visited six markets (three rural, three urban) in each region, using tablets to collect measurements from up to three different vendors for each product-unit combination. They also took photographs of each mea - surement which, thanks to the computer-assisted personal interview application, were automatically linked to the measurement data. c . Data analysis: includes: Data cleaning to detect outliers and rearrange unit sizes according to the actual weights; Calculation of national- and regional-level conversion factors using the median measured weight for each product-unit combination; and Identification of the best photographs with actual weights closest to each conversion factor. The resulting library of non-standard units materials will support the main household survey. Enumerators will use the photo albums to guide respondents in reporting food consumption quantities and the conversion factors will be used to flag unreasonable quantities for further verification, all ensuring greater data accuracy.Unit conversion factors are often incomplete and lack sup- porting documentation, which decreases the number of usable observations and makes it difficult to cross-reference quanti- ties or apply conversions across different datasets. Smith et al. (2014) pointed out that calculating metric food quantities is feasible for only 53 percent of the surveys reviewed. Most of the difficulties associated with this method can be addressed by ensuring that unit conversion factor data are thoroughly collected and properly documented. When information on most common non-standard units used and unit conversion factors is limited or not available, the survey team must col - lect those data. This is most effectively done by consulting with local experts and conducting a market survey prior to the start of the regular data collection.REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ISSUES 2930 3. Conclusions and Recommendations This section presents the core of the guidelines, providing a set of recommended practices for data collection. The recom - mendations are based on the literature, empirical evidence, and considerations discussed in Section 2. The objective is to promote the adoption of good practices and encourage the abandonment of some bad practices that are still employed in some surveys. Some of those recommendations are straight - forward and easy to implement and some are grounded in firm empirical evidence, but some are based on balancing incom - plete pieces of evidence with practical considerations. Addi - tional research will be useful to reinforce the evidence base behind the entire set of recommendations. A set of guidelines can, therefore, be extremely useful in informing design deci - sions and fostering cross-country comparability in approaches. Such guidelines can only be seen as temporary as best prac - tices will evolve and depend on circumstances. As food con - sumption patterns evolve, statistical systems change, and new technologies become available, survey design will have to be adapted to stay relevant and cost- effective. It is anticipated that as more survey methodological work is performed, and new lessons are learned from survey implementation, these guidelines will have to be periodically revised to incorporate the new knowledge being generated and to respond to addi- tional or different data needs that may emerge. Furthermore, consumption patterns change with income growth, changes in food technology and the modernization of food systems, response rates tend to decline in higher income economies and technology is already proceeding at a rapid pace with new technologies relevant to survey operations entering the market every day. In such a rapidly changing environment, the shelf life of these guidelines is inevitably going to be limited. Accordingly, it would be desirable to revise and update them at least every 10 years. The overarching concern in drawing these recommen - dations has been to ensure the most appropriate balance between accuracy and cost effectiveness, keeping in mind the typical constraints facing low- and middle-income country sta - tistical offices. In some cases, the recommendations offered might entail a costlier option than what is currently practiced while, in other cases, it might imply a cost saving. The benefits should be assessed not only in terms of greater accuracy and comparability of the data being collected, but also whether the data can be made relevant for a wider user base (e.g. nutri - tionists and food security analysts, as well as statisticians and economists). While professionals from those four fields contributed to the preparation of the guidelines, future revisions would bene - fit from the involvement of an even broader range of scholars and experts. Food is part of our cultures and societies, and the way in which society (and survey respondents) relate to food is mediated by social and cultural constructs. Perhaps, anthro- pologists can be recruited to help in devising questionnaires that are better able to incorporate social and cultural aspects in data-collection processes and outcomes. Similarly, psychol- ogists can help in designing more effective survey approaches by providing insights on the cognitive process behind how respondents answer questions, when and how they shift from enumeration to estimation strategies, and how survey design should take that into account when thinking about such details as the recall period, the length of a list, and the sequencing of survey modules. One notable gap in the guidelines is the discussion of price data collection. Prices are clearly an important element of any analysis of poverty, and are essential for welfare compar - isons across households, regions and time. Price data collec - tion is also a major goal of HCES when they are required to inform CPI calculations. However, even just from a perspec - tive of analyzing food consumption, food prices are needed to properly value consumption quantities, and attaining informa - tion on prices is invaluable in cross-checking the plausibility of reported values and quantities, especially when non-stan - dard units are used. Also, as food policy often relies heavily on price interventions, measuring food prices is an important item for analysis in its own right. However, price data collec- tion was omitted from the guidelines because it has implica - tions that go well beyond food consumption, and also because it is such an overarching topic, the view was taken that price data collection would probably be best served by its own set of guidelines. It would have been difficult to discuss and make recommendations about price data collection with reference to food alone, abstracting from all the other demands on price data from other uses and users. It is also important to remind users that any change in method should have a controlled comparison to \"bridge\" the effects of the old and new methodologies on the resulting data. Concerns about losing comparability over time, and the difficulty of explaining to the public the difference in estimates that come with changes in methodology often prompt statis- tical offices to shy away from changes in survey design, even when it is clear that there would be gains in accuracy and cost savings in doing so. Building a controlled comparison in sur - vey planning would ease those concerns somewhat. From that standpoint, this should be considered by statistical offices in low- and middle-income countries and the donors and inter - national agencies assisting them whenever the implementation of a methodological change is being reviewed. One idea that was put forward as part of the international discussion lead- ing to the guidelines was to create a global fund to support such controlled comparisons, as they are a source of invaluable learning and hence might be considered a global public good. Box 5 contains a summary of priority research areas for the collection of data on food consumption, based on gaps identi- fied during the preparation of the guidelines. Finally, as with all survey design choices, countries imple - menting these recommendations should carefully evaluate the extent to which the adoption of them may increase the bur - den on the respondent, how that risk can be mitigated, and whether the return in terms of data quality is large enough to justify a possible increase in non-response. As for the evalu - ation of survey costs, it is impossible to evaluate in principle those trade-offs with any level of accuracy and hence to be prescriptive about how to handle those survey design choices. When implementing the guidelines in practice, however, care must be taken in finding the right balance between keeping the overall length of the survey manageable so as not to compro- mise the quality of the information collected.This section is developed as follows: for each domain dis - cussed in Section 2, a summary of main findings is provided, followed by a set of recommendations. 3.1. RECALL VERSUS DIARY AND LENGTH OF REFERENCE PERIOD Summary The trade-offs between diary and recall and between shorter and longer recall periods have been highlighted in various sur - vey experiments and analyses of diary and recall approaches. In low-income economies, evidence suggests that recall inter - views are generally preferable to diary methods for captur - ing food consumption when balancing implementation costs and the reliability of the resulting estimates. The majority of the studies have found that food consumption or monetary value data collected with recall interviews provides estimates that are similar to or higher than those recorded in diaries. However, depending on the implementation methods, diaries often show patterns of rapidly declining consumption (and data quality) over the reference period. Lower and decreasing consumption recorded in diaries is frequently attributed to respondents' fatigue and illiteracy in combination with poor supervision. Under close supervision, diaries have proven to be reliable in several contexts and are sometimes considered to be the gold standard, but when implemented with appro - priate levels of supervision (such as daily visits to households), they are generally costlier than recall surveys; the detailed cost calculations by Beegle et al. (2012), suggest that diaries are from 6 to 10 times more expensive than recall after taking into account the fieldwork and the time-consuming coding and data entry requirements. Recall surveys are affected by memory decay (memory loss) as the recall period increases, and telescoping error (report- ing of consumption outside of the recall period) for shorter periods. The experimental evidence suggests that a seven-day recall can perform as well as a diary in capturing food expen- ditures and their variability. Recall periods that exceed 14 days are adversely affected by significant memory decay, while diary fatigue already appears to be significant after the first week. Regardless of how accurately they capture mean consumption, surveys based on short recall periods (\"snapshots\") always overestimate the variability in habitual consumption. For individual food items, short recall periods (such as a sev - en-day recall) are affected on the one hand by underestimation of the incidence of consumption, particularly for infrequently consumed items, and on the other by overestimation of the CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATONS 3132 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS account in survey design. The two options to consider, in order of preference are: Conduct one visit per household, spreading the sam - ple over 12 months of fieldwork. The overall sample should be stratified quarterly (e.g. split the overall sam - ple into 12 monthly subsamples in a manner that allows them to be aggregated into quarterly, nationally repre- sentative subsamples).BOX 5 \u2014 A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR FOOD CONSUMPTION DATA COLLECTION The guidelines put forward clear recommendations based on existing evidence and experience accumulated in survey practices over the past decades, but also recognize that in several areas there is little sound methodolog - ical work to base recommendations on. A list of priority areas based on the gaps that were identified during the preparation of the document is provided below. Food away from home is an area from which different approaches are emerging, but there are only a limited num- ber experimental methodological studies available. Given the increasing importance of this component in calories and expenditure, this is probably the area in which methodological research would be the largest. Several national statistical offices have signaled their interest in participating in methodological studies that would help improve the quality of the data they collect on food away from home. There are a number of different aspects of the choice between diary and recall, and the length of the recall period that would benefit from more methodological studies. Only a handful of experimental studies have been conducted on the topic in low- and middle-income countries and a larger evidence base would be required to make the extrap - olation of results more robust. Specific questions in need of investigation in this domain are: Bounding of recall. One concern with a short recall period (such as seven-days) is telescoping. \"Bounding\" the recall period for a household with another visit to mark the beginning of the recall period can, in principle, help reduce telescoping and improve the quality of the recall. While this idea has been around for many years, it has not been formally tested and compared to unbounded recall in a low- and middle-income country setting. Telephone interview aids. T elephones are increasingly used in surveys, including in low- and middle-income coun- tries, as the coverage of the mobile phone network increases. One way in which phones could help in person interviews is by using follow-up phone calls to aid the filling of a diary, or the collection of a second set of recall data. Multiple visits. One issue with seven-day recall discussed in the guidelines is that the data are affected by \"excess variability\". One way to reduce that is to perform a second non-consecutive interview to the same households (in person or possibly via telephone) (Gibson, 2016). This option is potentially attractive, but it has not been tested at scale. Expand the evidence-base. In general, many of the conclusions in the guidelines come from a small number of studies, with the SHWALITA dataset from United Republic of Tanzania exerting probably an excessive influence on the current consensus simply because of its uniqueness. Replicating more studies, in different settings and regions with a similar set-up would help to expand the knowledge base and provide more confidence when extrapolating results across countries. There are other topics that might benefit from more research that the guidelines have not touched upon. Some of them, which were also brought up during the global consultation, include the measurement of food waste, the measurement of individual consumption of specific population subgroups, such as children and women of reproductive age, and the integration of different data sources. The IAEG-AG has called on countries to consider setting up a global fund that could finance the implementation of methodological studies and experiments to test and validate survey design options in those domains.value of consumption (conditional on positive consumption) because of telescoping error. The recall error appears to be larger for less-frequently consumed items and on short recall periods. The \"usual month\" consumption was designed to deal with the conflict between a long reference period (to get \"typ - ical\" living standards) and a short recall period for feasible interviewing. However, it has not worked as expected because \"usual month\" consumption results tend to overestimate the incidence of consumption, particularly for infrequently con - sumed items, and underestimate consumption values for sta - ples. Importantly, the \"usual month\" approach also imposes a significantly higher burden on the respondent and results in longer interviews. Bounding the recall period with an earlier visit and asking a household to recall their consumption since the last visit of the enumerator is a possible option for improving the quality of recall data. The evidence on the effectiveness of bounding is limited. As this approach requires an additional visit to the household, it is a costlier method. Accordingly, it cannot be recommended until more research is performed to evaluate its benefits. Another approach gaining ground recently is to complement seven-day consumption recall with data on the last purchase in the past 30 days. The purpose of that approach is to better capture the unit values of purchased food items. More methodological work is needed to assess the perfor - mance of those approaches. Recommendations The following recommendations are provided for the choice of methods in capturing food consumption in HCES surveys: Low-income countries are advised to adopt recall interviews and a seven-day recall period, as this method provides the best balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness. Any survey using diary methods must be closely supervised to ensure proper and consistent com - pletion, especially in areas where illiteracy rates are high. The reference period should not exceed 14 days. Detailed metadata on how the diary was administered and supervised should be distributed with the primary survey data. The \"usual month\" approach should not be used. Any change in the recall period or method (recall ver - sus diary) should be accompanied by an experimental component aimed at assessing the impact of the change in survey estimates, which would allow for the recon- ciliation of estimates before and after the change in methodology. The studies by Backiny-Yetna et al. (2017) and Beegle et al. (2012) provide examples on how this can be done in practice. 3.2. SEASONALITY, NUMBER OF VISITS Summary Food consumption and expenditure can show systematic vari - ation related to the time of the year, month or week, as well as for agricultural seasons, holidays, and festivals. Such seasonal patterns need to be considered in survey design and analysis, as they are possible sources of significant bias and measure - ment error. A survey that only captures food consumption or expendi- ture data in one period of the year misses seasonal variations and is not likely to be representative of habitual consumption throughout the year. Many surveys collect data using one visit per household, concentrated over three to four months of fieldwork (48 percent of the surveys assessed by Smith et al., 2014). That approach cannot capture seasonality effects and is, therefore, not recommended. If it is adopted, to ensure that the timing of each round does not affect comparability in the estimates from one year to the other, maintaining maintain consistency in the timing of the fieldwork is imperative. It should be noted, however, that even that provision may not be enough to ensure comparability over time as seasonal weather patterns and dates of some important festivities affecting con - sumption events, such the dates of Ramadan may change from year to year. One possible way to capture seasonality may be to implement multiple visits on a subsample of households, but as that approach has not been tested widely, it is not offered as a recommendation. The only way to accurately capture habitual consumption for each household is to survey them multiple times over the year, but this is also the most expensive option and in prac - tice, is difficult to implement. Data collection spread over the year, but with only one interview per household (and using a short recall period) results in an accurate estimate of average consumption for the population, but excess variability around the mean (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002; Deaton and Grosh, 2000). Recommendations When interest is in analyzing the habitual consumption of a population through an extended period of time (usually one year), it is recommended that seasonality be taken into CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATONS 3334 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS Conduct two visits per household, when the timing of the visits is scheduled to capture seasonal variations (for instance, the first visit could be during the lean period and the second after the main harvest). Countries should carefully consider using more than two visits because of the higher cost and the difficulty in managing teams that are associated with more visits. Implementing more than two visits is not impossible, but in several cases in which it has been attempted, there have been implementation problems. Respon - dents' burden also increases more than proportionally with each additional visit. Regardless of the approach chosen, care should be exercised to ensure that enumeration is equally spread throughout the days of the week and the month and change in timing in holidays, festivals, and harvest must be considered. 3.3. ACQUISITION VERSUS CONSUMPTION Summary Surveys differ as to whether and how they capture food con- sumption and acquisition. Typically, household budget surveys focus on collecting data to construct CPIs, and as a conse - quence, recording food items acquired through market pur - chases. However, as HCES are increasingly used for poverty and food security analysis, emphasis has shifted towards also collecting data on food items procured through own produc - tion, barter, gifts, and payments in kind, which are particularly common in rural areas. Information on own production, bar - ter, gifts, and payments in kind is also important for national accounts statistics mainly because food acquired through those channels are included in the household final consumption. Conforti et al. (2017) classified food data-collection prac - tices in three approaches: (a) Acquisition: Households report food acquired through purchases, own production, and in-kind transfers, while consumption of food is not reported; (b) Com- bination of acquisition and consumption: Households report food acquired through purchases without specifying the amount consumed and report food consumption from own production or in-kind transfers; and (c) Consumption : Households report food actually consumed, and indicate whether that same food was purchased, own-produced, or received as a transfer. Irrespective of which of the three approaches is adopted by a survey, it is important that information is collected on all the food that becomes available to the household through all te possible means of acquisition. It is also important that the survey objectives are clear on whether the information being collected is on acquisition, consumption, or both. Regarding consumption, clarity is needed on whether surveys refer to food intended for consumption (i.e. including food waste) or food actually consumed, which excludes food waste. In the review by Smith et al. (2014), issues have emerged related to current practices on the neglect of food received in kind, which were not collected in 14 percent of the surveys (4 percent did not collect information on own-produced food). When combining information on sources of acquisition and consumption, care should be taken to ensure that the ques - tion wording does not lead to incompleteness or ambiguity in enumeration. Smith et al. (2014) have found that 38 percent of HCES have issues with the wording of rule out questions, namely ambiguity on whether acquisition or consumption is being asked. Recommendations All surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely: Purchases. Household's own production. Received in kind. Surveys need to explicitly inquire about in-kind sources that are otherwise likely to be missed, such as payments for labour and participation in social programs. Those in-kind sources can be aggregated, but care should be taken to avoid duplicating information captured in other sections of the survey (e.g. employment and social assis - tance). If public social assistance transfers are not captured elsewhere then it would be important to disaggregate the data. Surveys should be designed so that it is clear to respondents, enumerators, and data users exactly what information is requested and reported, whether the information required is on acquisition, or consumption, or both. In the case of consumption, it should be clear whether the questions concern food intended for consumption (includ - ing food waste) or food actually consumed (net of food waste). If total amount of food purchased over the recall period is the variable of interest, it is then recommended to add an additional question on the amount consumed out of those purchases to avoid mixing acquisitions from purchases with consumption from own production and in-kind transfers. Surveys should exercise care to avoid possible sources of incomplete or ambiguous enumeration commonly found in current survey practices. When using a filter question (30 percent of surveys assessed by Smith et al. (2015) have a leading or filter question): \u00bbAvoid leading or filter questions in cases in which respondents are asked first if they consumed a food over a certain recall period instead of details about consumption. A negative response to the first question results in skipping questions on quantities acquired but not consumed during the recall period. This leads to systematic underestimation of the quantities or expen - diture of food acquired. \u00bbAvoid filter questions that focus on food purchases. This leads to underestimation of mean food acquisi - tion for the population by failing to account for food acquired through own production or in-kind transfers. For consumption from own production, the question must be worded to clearly indicate food consumed from own production rather than all food harvested. When this distinction is not made, the quantities or expenditure reported may include food entering the households' pro- duction stocks - not for immediate consumption - and as a result, food consumed from home production is system - atically overestimated. 3.4. MEAL PARTICIPATION Summary Household surveys collect information on the total amount of food to be consumed by a household over a certain reference period. T o convert this information to a per capita basis and to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of food consumption and nutrient intake, it is important to know exactly how many peo - ple (partakers) consumed the total amount of food reported by the household. For food and nutrition security analyses, it is also useful to collect data on the physiological status of the partakers (e.g. pregnant or lactating status for women), as that affects nutrition requirements. Furthermore, food may be shared with non-household members, or household mem- bers may not be in the household when the food is consumed. Neglecting those occurrences adds measurement error to the distribution of per capita food consumption. There are two main approaches to adjust household per capita consumption for the number of partakers. The first approach entails counting the number of people who shared the household's meals and then dividing the total household consumption by the number. That approach, however, is not very precise, as it is not easy to account for situations in which people participate only in some meals per day, such as employ - ees. The second approach involves counting the number of meals taken by each household member and non-household members over the reference period for which food data are collected. It is more precise, but it is also more difficult to implement. As very little methodological work has been car - ried out to formally test the cost and benefits of adopting competing options for accounting for partakers, this is an area to focus on in future research. The recommendations provided below, therefore, are also somewhat more generic than those provided for other areas of survey design. Recommendations It is recommended that all HCES should consider adding an individual household member-based meal module. As collecting information on individuals is expensive and difficult, this can be implemented as part of the module collecting information on food away from home (see below). On the other hand, practitioners should realize that adding an individual house - hold member-based meal module would make it possible to eliminate other questions that are commonly used in surveys.39 If an individual member-based meal module cannot be adopted, a less preferred alternative, would be to collect the following information at the household level through a proxy respondent: How many meals does [NAME] usually take in a day? How many days in the past X days was [NAME] pres- ent in the household? How many meals during the past X days, did [NAME] purchase or receive, and eat away from home? How many meals during the past X days, did [NAME] eat at home? Does [NAME] get meals at school? 39 This includes questions such as \"How many meals are usually taken per day in your household?\", \"How many days in the past X days was [NAME] present in the household?\", \"Did [NAME] eat meals in this household in the last X days?\", \"Does [NAME] get meals at school?\", \"Did [NAME] consume any meals/snacks/ drinks outside the household in the past X days?\". The information collected in these questions would now be captured in an individual level module.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATONS 3536 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS How many meals were served to non-household mem - bers during the last X days? Did the household host a ceremony, party or festival in the past X days, during which a large number of meals (not just snacks) were served to non-household mem- bers? If \"yes\": How many attended? During the last X days, were there non-household members who stayed one or more nights in the house - hold as a guest? If \"yes\": How many nights did they stay? How many meals were they (summed together) served during their stay? How many of the guests were chil - dren <15 years old? How many adults 16 and older? During the last X days, were any meals served to non-household members? (Other than those served guests who stayed overnight.) 3.5. FOOD AWAY FROM HOME Summary Rapid urbanization and economic growth are typically associ - ated with an increase in the consumption of food away from home in absolute terms and as a share of calories and food expenditure. Implementing traditional HCES questionnaires that are focused on household food consumption at home has the risk of underestimating food away from home by missing the increasing effect on the proportion of calories and expen - diture through changes in food systems. Food away from home consumption is particularly important because food consumed outside the home tends to be more calorie-dense and less nutrient-dense than food consumed at home. The increase in the amount of food consumed away from tends to rise with increases in income. Failing to account for food away from home has been shown to affect measures of poverty and inequality, including inequal - ity in the distribution of dietary energy consumption. There is a variety of sources for attaining food away from home, including, among them, restaurants, schools, places of work, and street vendors. Survey design needs to be able to account for all of them, as they can be of varying importance to different groups in the population. Failing to account for food away from home affects not only the mean, but also the distribution of the indicators of interest. An additional challenge is that while the \"main food pre - parer\" can be expected to be reasonably informed about food at home, it is much more difficult for that person to respond to questions on food away from home, as they relate mostly to meal events taking place out of his or her sight. Proxy respon- dents may be able to report on which household members consumed which meals away from the households, but they are unlikely to be informed about the cost or content of those meals. Such information can only be reliably collected through individual interviews. Recommendations Data collection on food away from home should preferably be done at the individual level, asking the questions separately for each individual. For all individuals who report having consumed meals outside the home, the minimum information attained should be on the value of the meals by meal event (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks). While more research on this topic is urgently needed, based on current knowledge, the following guidelines are suggested for the design and implementation of a survey module for the measurement of consumption of food away from home in recall surveys: The practice of collecting food away from home information with just one question should be discontinued. The importance of food away from home warrants the design of a separate module, based on a clear definition of food away from home. In particular, surveys should be clear in identifying how to collect information on po - tentially ambiguous categories of food: \"food prepared at home and consumed outside\" and \"food prepared outside and consumed at home.\" The latter can be inte - grated into the food at home module (e.g. takeout food) provided that it is made clear to enumerators, respon- dents and data users that this is the case. Data collection should be organized around meal events, including snacks and drinks. At a minimum, surveys should collect information on the value of all meals con - sumed during a meal event away from home (breakfast, lunch, dinner, solid snacks or drinks). The meal events list should be adapted to the local context. Considerations regarding the feasibility, costs, and accura - cy should inform the determination of which option to choose between individual modules and the proxy respondent. Food away from home is best collected though individual-level interviews of adults. A proxy respondent can be used to report on children's meals away from home and other adults. Possible variations include: 1. Proxy respondents (i.e. a household level module) can be used to report on the number of individuals who consumed meals away (as in block 4 of the sixty-eighth round of the India Survey). Detailed information on the meals, such as cost and meal content, should be collected directly from the relevant household member, including possibly on a tar - geted, carefully designed subsample. 2. T otal expenditure on food away from home can be collected at the household level using a daily food away from home record sheet provided to a trained proxy respondent. Surveys should identify the most frequent place of consump - tion for each meal event, such as restaurants, street vendors, work, or schools, adapting the place of consumption categories to the local context. Surveys should use the same reference period for food away from home as what is used in the food consumed at home module. The data to estimate food away from home-related nutrient content, when feasible, should come from other data sources integrated to the HCES, such as a survey of food establish - ments (Farf\u00e1n, Genoni, and Vakis, 2017) or administrative data on the content of public meals, such as those given by schools and social programs. 3.6. LIST OF FOOD ITEMS Summary The following basic principles should inform the design of the HCES list of food items: The number of food items should balance the lower memory lapses, costs, and interview time associated with short lists, with the better recall and more com- prehensive reporting associated with the longer list. Food items representing the large majority of food expenditure, including nutrient-rich food items, should be included on the list. The description of the food items must be explicit enough to match only one entry in the reference food composition table. Each food item must be exclusive, each food group should be represented and each food item should belong to only one food group).Adoption of a food classification system may help in meeting those criteria. Although the adoption of a standard classifi - cation system may involve some challenges given the country specificity of the diet, such a classification is recommended as it allows survey harmonization in terms of methodology, analysis and findings. For many of the basic purposes of HCES, such as for the computation of CPI or for input into national account systems, by far, the most widely adopted standard classification is COICOP . Harmonization eases cross-survey comparability, ensures international comparability of inflation and purchasing power parities, and allows for the assessment of the compre- hensiveness of the food lists. For surveys that are not intended to be used for the calcu- lation of CPI calculation or for national accounts, COICOP list may be too extensive. There is a widely acknowledge trade-off in the number of items to be included in a food list. Aggre - gated item lists (usually about 15 items) provide lower esti - mates than more detailed item lists. On the other hand, a too detailed list of items might have a negative effect, increasing enumerator and respondent fatigue. A universally valid solution does not exist because the optimal quantity of items strongly depends on regional food consumption habits. Accordingly, a food list must be country specific, representative of the dietary and consumption habits of all segments of a population, and capture evolving trends in dietary patterns. Useful informa - tion about the frequency and importance of each food item's dietary and expenditure patterns can be drawn from previous HCES or dietary survey data carried out in a given country. As noted, food lists will inevitably be country-specific. Even so, some rules-of-thumb or general guiding principles can be identified to help survey designers determine food lists to capture food consumption and expenditure information that is disaggregated in a way that can be useful for dietary qual - ity analysis. Involving nutritionists in the design of the food lists can ensure that their data needs are properly taken into account. Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) suggest that to meet all of those requirements, in most cases a list of 100 to 125 items is needed. Many experts agree with that view, but it can only be seen as an indicative rule of thumb. Recommendations Different classifications can be used to harmonize data and foster comparability across surveys. These guidelines encour - age survey designers to use the COICOP system, as it is cur - rently the basis of classification used in a wide number of datasets, in line with the requirements specified in the System of National Accounts 2008. Food COICOP classifications are CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATONS 3738 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS mainly structured using the basic food groups described in Table 4.40 Additional regional or global food lists that can inform the development of a survey food list include the Foo - dEx241 classification, which is being tested in Asian countries (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). Data should be collected on all of the types of foods and beverages that make up the country's human diet. Lists should be kept up to date to take into account changing dietary hab- its, while keeping in mind that products that account for mini- mal budget shares can have particular nutritional values. A list of general principles that can guide the design of a food list includes the following criteria: The presence of foods from all the main food groups (e.g. the 16-food group classification on which the Household Dietary Diversity Score is based (Kennedy et al., 2011). An adequate representation of processed foods (with all the degree of processing from highly processed to moderately processed). The inclusion of only foods and no other commodities (principle of \"food exclusivity\"; e.g. the food list should not include an item composed by food and non-food items, such as \"alcohol and tobacco\") The list needs to include a reasonable number of indi- vidual items (the most common ones) for each of the main food groups. An \"other\" category should be added when relevant (e.g. \"other fruits\" or \"other veg - etables\") to record the acquisition or consumption of additional food items. It is important that such catego- ries remain marginal as quantities cannot be collected under those categories and food matching is imperfect. Food items (other than prepared dishes) should not span multiple food groups (e.g. avoid \"eggs or milk products\" as one group). Only group food items with similar nutritional properties in one question (e.g. avoid \"Mineral water or soft drinks\"). Avoid grouping differ - ent status of the same food item with different nutri- tional properties (e.g. fresh or dried fish, fresh or dried milk). 40 See also the revisions discussed at the forty-ninth session of the United Nation Statistics Commission, which was held in New York, 6-9 March 2018 (Technical Subgroup for the Revision of COICOP (2018)). 41 See https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-804 for more details on FoddEx 2 classification.Avoid broad categories that do not allow identifying the type of food, such as \"snacks\", \"canned foods\" and \"baby food.\"Table 4 \u2014 Basic food groups for COICOP classifications Basic food group Food items in each group Bread and cereals Rice Other cereals, flour, and other products Bread Other bakery products Pasta products Meat Beef and veal Pork Lamb, mutton, and goat Poultry Other meats and meat preparations Fish and seafood Fresh, chilled, or frozen fish and seafood Preserved or processed fish and seafood Milk, cheese, and eggsFresh milk Preserved milk and other milk products Cheeses Eggs and egg-based products Oils and fats Butter and margarine Other edible oils and fats Fruit Fresh or chilled fruits Frozen, preserved, or processed fruit and fruit-based products Vegetables Fresh or chilled vegetables other than potatoes Fresh or chilled potatoes and other tubers Frozen, preserved, or processed vegetables and vegetable- based products Sugar, jam, honey, chocolate, and confectionerySugar Jams, marmalades, and honey Confectionery, chocolate, and ice cream Food products not elsewhere classifiedSalt, spices, condiments Dessert preparations, soups, and broths Baby food and dietary preparations Non-alcoholic beveragesCoffee, tea, and cocoa Mineral waters, soft drinks, fruit and vegetable juices Alcoholic beveragesSpirits Wine Beer Stimulants Catering services Restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and others CanteensFood items that are the object of product-specific gov - ernment-subsidized programs should be listed individ- ually on the food list. Foods that are fortified or have the potential to be the vehicle of food fortification programs (e.g. iodized salt, fortified flour or cooking oil) should be listed individ- ually in the food list. Micronutrient (e.g. vitamin-A or iron) rich foods, such as sweet potatoes and liver should be listed individually. Food lists can be built from national food composi - tion tables or databases to ease later food matching. Because of the importance of having good and updated food composition tables or databases, it is also recom- mended that countries invest in the update or develop - ment of country or regional food composition tables. 3.7. NON-STANDARD UNITS OF MEASUREMENT Summary T o date, there is no standard methodology applied to the col- lection of food quantities in cases in which respondents (and enumerators) are less familiar with standard measurement units. Common practice has been either to require households to report everything in standard units, or for enumerators to estimate the standard unit conversions on an ad hoc basis. Both approaches are problematic and lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data reported. Several national statistical offices maintain a library of conversion factors for local units, but they are often incomplete, not updated, and tend not to be consistently implemented. Units of measurement are crit- ical for many aspects of data collection and quality assurance. Qualitative feedback from field practitioners, and extensive feedback from initial piloting of those methods, suggest that allowing non-standard units of measurement can increase the accuracy of reported quantities, primarily by reducing respon - dent burden. T o properly benefit from allowing non-standard units options, reporting must be paired with a framework for consistently converting non-standard units into standard units, based on reliably documented conversion factors. As conver - sion factors typically involve weighing and measuring, which are some of the activities carried out in price surveys - at least for unpackaged foods, such as root crops and vegetables - the treatment of non-standard units should also be covered in guidelines for price surveys. RecommendationsThe decision on whether to allow the use of non-stan - dard units of measurement should be addressed during the design phase. By doing this, the tendency for units of measurement to be determined on an ad hoc or inconsistent basis during fieldwork is reduced. Though non-standard units are used around the world (in countries of all income levels) the cost-benefit ratio of incorporating them into each survey should be eval - uated, focusing particularly on their prevalence of use. If needed, conduct a pilot survey to determine the extent to which respondents need non-standard units- exten - sively, minimally, or not at all. When feasible, allow households to report in both stan - dard and non-standard units of measure based on what they are most familiar with for each item reported. If avoiding formal use of non-standard unit still leads to ad hoc field conversions, then even a rather limited set of non-standard units with less of an implementation burden, may still be worthwhile. It is critical to establish (define or collect) conver - sion factors for all non-standard units that are to be used. Additional features to improve the accuracy of reported non-standard units quantities, such as market surveys to establish accurate non-standard units and conversion factors, photo reference aides, and on-the- spot value verification using computer-assisted per - sonal interviews, may also be considered. National statistical offices and implementation part - ners should work together to establish non-standard units databases that can be used across surveys, effec- tively increasing the standardization of the units, while also limiting the cost to implement them. T o this end, survey implementers should thoroughly document all non-standard units protocols and related conversion factors and make them publicly available.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATONS 3940 Annex 1 Analytical uses of household consumption and expenditure survey data POVERTY ASSESSMENTS The data collected in national HCES have been used to measure absolute poverty regularly for an extended period, that is the percentage of people in a country's population whose total income or expenditure fall below a money-metric poverty line anchored to some measure of needs.42 This indicator is widely used for monitoring poverty, targeting, and planning interventions, as well as for conducting research that supports policies and programs to combat poverty. The primary users of the data for that purpose are the national and international institutions tasked with estimating and monitoring poverty levels, trends, and strategies. At the national level, they are mainly the national statistical offices mandated with estimating official poverty numbers and the ministries (usually of economy, planning, or finance) charged with monitoring national progress in poverty reduction. At the international level, the same data are inputs for the Global Poverty Database of the World Bank and the monitoring of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,43 and are used by donor agencies, international non-governmental orga - nizations, researchers, and policy analysts interested in monitoring and understanding poverty. The two most commonly used methods for measuring absolute income poverty are the Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) and the Food Energy Intake (FEI) (Ravallion, 1998; UNSD, 2005). Those methods rely on two essential pieces of information: a welfare measure households' total income or, more often, total expenditure44; and a poverty threshold for determining whether a household is poor. A substantial percentage of households' expenditure is devoted to food in most developing countries (typ- ically more than 50 percent, (Smith and Subandoro 2007). Thus, the quality of the food data used to calculate total expenditure is of concern regardless of which method is employed. The two methods are \"anchored in some absolute standard of what households should be able to count on in order to meet their basic needs\" (Coudouel et al. 2002, p. 33), which generally relate to a minimum food basket plus some allowance for non-food needs. They, therefore, depend on an accurate estimation of households' total expenditure,45 while differing in the formulation of the poverty line. 42 The discussion here is limited to absolute measures of income poverty. Poverty can also be expressed in relative terms, or based on more dimensions that just income, or on subjective perceptions. While all those measures have their own merits, they are less relevant for this discussion because they are either less commonly applied in developing countries (relative poverty measures) or have less direct implications for food consumption expenditure data collection (multidimensional and subjective poverty measures). For a discussion of those measures, see Ravallion and Bidani, (1994); (2011); and Kapteyn (1994). In what follows the term poverty is used to refer to absolute consumption-based poverty, unless otherwise noted. 43 In September 2015 the Millennium Development Goals were replaced by a new set of internationally agreed development goals, the Sustainable Development Goals. Poverty has continued to be a key indicator within the new set of goals. 44 A UNSD survey of national statistical offices undertaken in 2004-2005 found that almost 50 percent of them base their poverty calculations on expenditure data, 30 percent on income, and 12 on both of them (UNSD 2005). 45 See Deaton and Zaidi (2002) for a primer on estimating measures of total household consumption from household surveys for poverty analysis.The CBN approach is most commonly used, but it is also more computationally demanding. Its poverty line is the level of total expenditure that allows a household to cover its energy requirement plus non-food basic needs, such as housing, edu- cation, health, and transport. HCES food data are used to identify a \"basket\" of foods that cover the energy requirement. T o do so, information on the calorie content of foods commonly consumed by the poor is needed. Some arbitrary allowance for non-food basic needs is added to the food component, usually also based on the observed consumption patterns of the poor. Detailed price data are needed for the version of the CBN that is most commonly used in practice, as they are then used to value the food and non-food items to arrive at the amount of expenditure needed to acquire them, and to account for relative price differences that allow consistency of poverty definitions across time and space. The FEI method \"proceeds by finding the consumption expenditure or income level at which a person's typical food energy intake is just sufficient to meet a predetermined food energy requirement\" (Ravallion and Bidani, 1994, p. 78). That method is less computationally demanding when compared to CBN, as it does not require price data and it implicitly accounts for the non-food allowance. Those computational advantages, however, come at the expense of a lack of consistency in the poverty estimates, as households with the same \"command\" over resources may be classified differently as poor and non-poor, depending on variables, such as their place of residence, as differences in cost of living and relative prices are not being taken into account.46 International poverty comparisons of absolute poverty level are based on the CBN method, but with a poverty line that is identified as the mean poverty line among the poorest countries in the world and a welfare measure that makes national data comparable internationally by deflating them using a purchasing-power-parity exchange rate (Chen and Ravallion, 2010).47 These are the poverty estimates produced by the World Bank used to monitor the Sustainable Development Goal 1, to eradicate poverty by 2030. FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENTS The prevalence of undernourishment was one of the official indicators used to monitor target 1.c of the Millennium Devel- opment Goals and has been recently adopted as indicator 2.1.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals. The prevalence of undernourishment corresponds to the \"proportion of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consump - tion\". HCES collecting food consumption data have been used in many countries to inform the compilation of that indicator. The simplest way this has been done is by converting recorded expenditure on food and/or quantities of food acquired by households into corresponding amounts of dietary energy to estimate a household daily per capita DEC. Then, counting the proportion of households in the sample for which such daily household DEC is below a certain reference threshold, set at or around 2,100 kcal/person/day, which is an estimate of the recommended level of daily dietary energy intake for an average individual, or at a given percentage of that level (e.g. 70 percent of the recommended dietary energy intake level).48 The relative simplicity of this approach, however, hides several problems. First, given that energy requirements vary consid - erably, depending on sex, age, physiological status, body mass, and physical activity, the condition of insufficient dietary energy consumption should be determined at the individual level rather than at the household level. The percentage of households with average DEC below the average requirements may not correspond to the percentage of individuals with insufficient food consumption in the population, as there may be individuals consuming enough food even in households reporting insufficient overall quantities or undernourished individuals in household with sufficient overall food consumption. T o reduce the risk of estimation error, an estimate can be made of the household-specific average dietary energy requirement by considering the sex, age, physiological status, normative body size for actual height, and normative physical activity level for actual life style (see, for example, Smith and Subandoro, 2007) of the household members. However, the energy requirements were developed for groups of healthy individuals and should not be applied to single individuals. Furthermore, energy requirements are determined per unit of body mass and different body sizes compatible with good health (as captured by normative values of the body mass 46 In principle, cost of living adjustments can be used with the FEI method, but that implies the use of detailed price data, and giving up part of the computational simplicity for which the method may be favoured by some users over CBN. 47 The poverty line used for the most recent estimates is $1.25 (Chen and Ravallion 2010). 48 This approach is followed, for example, in Indonesia and several other countries in Asia when computing the percentage of households with inadequate food consumption.ANNEX 1 4142 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS index (BMI), ranging approximately from 18.5 to 24.5). Also, there are a number of different lifestyles associated with a range of physical activity levels compatible with good health. Consequently, there is also a range of energy requirement levels com- patible with good health within a group of individuals that are of the same sex, physiological status and a similar age. Because of this range, of energy requirements compatible with good health, using household-specific average energy requirements results in an overestimation of the actual extent of undernourishment as individuals who eat according to their individual requirement but less than the average recommended level for the entire group are falsely identified as being undernourished. For those reasons, the assessment of the percentage of people undernourished based on the observation of food consump - tion data - at household or individual levels - should take into consideration the existence of a range of acceptable energy requirements induced by a range of body size and different lifestyles compatible with good health in a group. That is done by using the minimum of the range of energy requirement instead of the average requirements. The second problem in using food consumption data as collected in surveys is that these data provide only a rough approxima - tion of the level of habitual daily energy consumption of households or individuals. Food expenditure, acquisition, or consumption data collected in surveys usually refer to short reference periods, and as a result, may reflect the impact of temporarily higher or lower food consumption levels associated with seasonality or other phenomena that may cause the food consumption level observed during a week or a month to depart from the habitual consumption level of the household or the individual. Failing to recognize such excess variability may also lead to biases in estimating the extent of undernourishment. Those difficulties have led to some doubts that household-level food consumption data collected with surveys may never be sufficient to inform a reliable assessment of the prevalence of undernourishment in a population, and that data collected through carefully conducted individual dietary intake surveys are needed instead. Fortunately, this is not the case. In its State of Food Security in the World (SOFI) publication, FAO has compiled an indicator of the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (i.e. the percentage of individuals likely consuming on a regular basis amounts of food that provide less dietary energy than their own energy requirements) for most countries and all regions in the world since 1974, using a procedure developed in the early 1960s by P .V. Sukhatme (former Chief of the FAO Statistic Division). The method is based on a statistical model that represents the probability distribution of habitual levels of dietary energy con - sumption in a population. PoU can be estimated by contrasting such distribution with the one that would prevail in the same population if everybody were well-nourished, which means that everybody would be eating according to their requirements (as inferred from data on the composition of the population by sex, age, physiological status, height, and physical activity level). The statistical approach informing the FAO method combines the information on the distribution of dietary energy consump - tion in the population, as revealed by data from household surveys, with additional information on food consumption available, for example, through macroeconomic accounts of food supply and utilization, and with demographic information on the char - acteristics of the population that determines energy requirements (sex, age, height, and physical activity levels), in a model that takes into consideration the idiosyncratic nature of individual energy requirements and the possible errors that affect individual household habitual food consumption levels. Although indirect methods have also been proposed to estimate the parameters of the PoU model, the information collected through HCES, and particularly the quality of the food consumption data (quantities or expenditure of food consumed/acquired are converted into amounts of dietary energy) is essential to estimate as precisely as possible the parameters in the model that reflect the mean, variability, and asymmetry of the distribution of habitual dietary energy consumption within the population. T o establish whether individuals within a population are consuming an adequate amount of dietary energy, data are needed on habitual food consumption levels. Food consumption data collected over short reference periods can be used as a proxy, but they will always contain significant measurement error. Independently of the survey design, variability of DEC can be increased by simple data entry error (Smith et al. 2006). The nature of this measurement error is important for econometric modelling. Gibson et al. (2015) showed in the United Republic of Tanzania experiment that the measurement error has a negative correlation with the true value of consumption. Conventional statistical corrections do not work in that case. Regressions using consumption as both dependent or independent variable, will be biased. This raises the issue of the trade-off between the extent to which a reported measurement approaches the true value of the quantity measured and the degree of exactness in the measurement. Both are affected by method, instrument, or human errors. INFORMING FOOD-BASED NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS In recent years there has been increased interest among nutritionists in using the food data collected in HCES to inform nutri- tion interventions that aim to increase consumption of micronutrients in deficient populations. The type of interventions that this report focuses on are food fortification programs in which a government regulates the addition of micronutrients to com- monly consumed foods.49 Other examples of food-based nutrition interventions are biofortification, food supplementation, the establishment of horticultural and home garden projects, and nutrition education. The goal of those programs is to improve the health and nutrition status of a population by providing a predictable, supplementary quantity of micronutrients in a widely consumed food. The micronutrients of most interest are vitamin A, folate, iron, zinc, and iodine (Fiedler et al., 2008; Bailey et al., 2015). Because micronutrient deficiencies among children under five and their mothers make a significant contribution to mortality and disease burdens among those groups (Black et al. 2008), they are often targets of the interventions. The historical lack of data on national food consumption patterns has been a major obstacle for planning, implementing, and evaluating food fortification programs (Neufeld and T olentino 2012). Previously, program planners relied by necessity on food balance sheet data to obtain the needed information. However, being based on national averages, food balance sheet data do not contain the appropriate data for answering key distributional questions. What are regarded by some to be the \"gold standard\", 24-hour recall food consumption surveys, are prohibitively costly to implement on a national scale and, therefore, are rarely implemented at that level.50 Thus planners are increasingly turning to HCES data for more precise evidence (Fiedler et al., 2012). T wo core pieces of information are needed to plan and implement a national food fortification program (Fiedler and Macdon - ald, 2009), (a) Which foods should be fortified? and (b) What amount of micronutrients should be added to fortify them? T o answer those questions, analysts need to know: The percent of households consuming foods that are potential fortification vehicles. This indicator of \"coverage\" is needed to determine which foods are most widely consumed. Commonly fortification vehicles are vegetable oil, wheat flour, salt, and sugar. The percent of households purchasing potentially fortifiable foods. A food can only be fortified if it is produced at a commer - cial facility and distributed through market channels. Thus, food purchases (as opposed to food produced by households) are the acquisition mode of interest in food fortification programs. The quantities consumed of potentially fortifiable foods by entire populations for purchasers of the foods and for target age and sex groups. This information is needed in order to determine whether a food would be a good fortification vehicle (Is enough of it consumed to warrant its fortification?) and to set fortification levels. Age and sex disaggregation of the information is highly desirable because targeted groups (e.g. women and children) may consume different foods in dif- ferent quantities from the general population. The quantities of micronutrients consumed by entire populations, for purchasers of the potentially fortifiable foods, and by target age and sex groups. Planners need to know which micronutrients are insufficient in the population's diet, and by how much, to enable them to set fortification levels. Fortification levels are set with the goal of maximizing the potential for 49 Food fortification is defined as \"the addition of one or more essential nutrients to a food, whether or not it is normally contained in the food, for the purpose of preventing or correcting a demonstrated deficiency of one or more nutrients in the population or specific population groups\" (FAO/WHO 1994). 50 Fiedler, Martin-Pr\u00e9vel and Moursi (2013) estimate that the cost of conducting a 24-hour recall survey with a sample size of a typical HCES to be 75 times the cost of analysing data from a pre-existing HCES. Note also that, as discussed in Coates et al. (2012), for the purposes of producing information needed for decision making in food fortification programs, neither of those two data sources can be considered a perfect gold standard, each having strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific purpose to which it is applied.ANNEX 1 4344 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS reducing micronutrient deficiencies and protecting people from the risk of excess intake because of fortification. Thus, the full distribution of micronutrient consumption across populations likely to purchase and consume potentially for - tifiable foods is needed. Information on micronutrient consumption is desired by age and sex group because specific groups may have different micronutrient needs and degrees of insufficiency. T o date, HCES data have been used to investigate the feasibility of food fortification and to estimate the coverage, impact, and cost of fortifying various foods in only a few countries, namely Guatemala, India, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda, (studies cited in Coates et al. 2012), and Zambia (Fiedler et al. 2012). The need for conducting such evidence-based analyses in additional countries with high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies is high. The nutrition community is working to identify and find ways to address the shortcomings in HCES data related to informing food-based nutrition interventions so that this need can be met (Fiedler et al., 2012). 45Annex II Examples of food away from home experiences from India, Peru and the West Africa Economic and Monetary Unit This appendix outlines three examples that can be useful starting points to develop a proposal for an international standard for col- lecting data on food away from home. The three examples are a module adopted by the National Survey Sample Organization (NSSO) of India, a module implemented by Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica (INEI) of Peru (and by other countries in Latin America), and the approach recently designed by the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA, by its French acronym) in an effort to harmonize household survey approaches in the region. The three approaches collect some information at the individ- ual level, use meal events as an organizing principle to aid the data collection, and attempt to collect information on both values and quantities and use a separate module for food away from home from the standard food consumption one. The 2011/12 India National Sample Survey (sixty-eighth round) questionnaire contains three different sets of questions about meals.51 One set is designed to develop an understanding of each household members' usual daily meal consumption pattern over the past 30 days. It consists of a series of seven questions about the number of meals usually consumed in a day, whether each individual household member was away from home for more than 24 hours, the number and sources (or types) of meals individual household members ate away from home, and the number they ate at home. It asks specifically about four categories of meals away from home; meals obtained at school, from employers, from others (other households, government and non-governmental organization-related programs), and meals received on payment.52 The responses to the seven questions together constitute a unifying conceptual framework that comprises a memory aid sensitizing the respondent and the interviewer to each individual household member's pattern of meal consumption and consumption of food away from home during the reference period. It provides a tool for both the respondent and the interviewer to perform various con- sistency checks across the different numbers and types of meals consumed The second section, which includes questions about meals, is part of the food consumption module's food list-related questions. The respondent is asked the quantity and the value of the household's consumption during the past 30 days of each of the items in the questionnaire's 132 item food list. Prior to 2011/12, the questionnaire had two items, \"cooked meals received from as assistance or payment\" and \"cooked meals purchased,\" on the food list that captured food away from home. In round 68, the question had five items on that food list.53 In the Indian approach, the place of food away from home consumption is not identified. However, it does identify distinct types of meals, which may provide similar insights into systematic differences in individuals' and households' food away from home, and, in turn, can be helpful in devising ways to better capture food away from home. In other countries it may be that substituting specific places at which food away from home is consumed for the type of free meals provided would be more useful. 51 This discussion of the Indian experience reproduces text in Fielder and Yadav (2017). 52 The NSSO Instruction to field staff guidelines notes: \"A meal will be considered to be taken at home if the meal is prepared at home irrespective of the place where it is consumed\" (NSSO 2012: Chapter Three, paragraph 3.4.12). It also notes that if \"school/ balwadi's etc.\" (column 10 of the schedule) are \"received free it will be recorded in column (10). Meals received at subsidized rate will be recorded in column (13)\" (NSSO 2014: Chapter Three, paragraph 3.4.14). (This suggests that the common, ambiguous appellation \"food away from home\" would be more accurately labeled as \"food that is purchased and consumed away from home\"). 53 The five items are: cooked meals purchased; cooked meals received free in the workplace; cooked meals received as assistance; cooked snacks purchased; and other served processed food.46 FOOD DATA COLLECTION IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS A priori, one would expect that the Block 4 data (Figure 1 in this annex) would be more accurate because it asks specifically about each individual household member's behavior, rather than requesting the respondent to recall all of the meals consumed away from home by all of the household members over the reference period. As noted earlier, answering household-level questions is a more demanding cognitive task and is subject to greater memory and computational errors. Both approaches, however, rely on a single household respondent to provide information on all household members, which likely makes them subject to measurement error, as the respondent may simply not know about all of the meals all of the household members ate away from home. This is especially true when household members have stayed away from home for more than 24 hours, which in India is highly correlated with the number of meals eaten away from home. In both approaches, the magnitude of the measurement error is likely to be highly correlated with household size, owing to the increasing difficulty of tracking the behavior of larger numbers of household members. It is also likely to be correlated with other variables that are associated with increased consumption of food away from home, including more frequently staying away from home for 24 hours or more, urban residence, source of meal, male, the age of the household members and other factors and variables that were captured in the two distinct typologies of meals away from home discussed earlier. The meals away from home-linked approach facilitates the cognitive process of developing those estimates by providing a tool to break down the recalling (estimating) process into several steps, making it more manageable, and a less memory- and arithmetically demanding activity, and is likely to yield results that are considerably more accurate. A study by Fiedler and Yadav (forthcoming) demonstrates that, notwithstanding the concern about one respondent providing information on other household members, com - bining information of individual-specific meal data that can be linked with the HCES food list for capturing at-home consumption can capture a substantially larger quantity of food away from home, which the authors infer constitutes a significant reduction in the measurement error in that source of consumption. It is worth noting that although this discussion has focused on meals, another, related improvement in the round 68 questionnaire was the introduction of cooked snacks (food item 283). Earlier rounds contained no food item for cooked snacks, although they may have been partially captured in \"other processed food\" (food item 308 in round 64) and perhaps elsewhere.54 The National Sample Survey interviewer field guidelines have long attempted to distinguish between meals and snacks, and yet the questionnaires prior to round 68 have not included any explicitly identified item to capture snacks. With the introduction of the three types of cooked meals and a cooked snack variable, the snack component is found to account for 25 percent of the total value of the sum of the three cooked meals and cooked snack values. The introduction of \"cooked snacks\" may, therefore, have been another a source of reduced measurement error\u2014 in particular, the under-reporting of consumption \u2014 compared with earlier rounds. The National Household Survey of PERU (ENAHO by its Spanish acronym) has collected detailed information on food away from home since 2004. The questionnaire is more detailed when compared to the one used by India, as each adult is required to report about their food away from home over the past seven days. Meals are broken down by meal events (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack) and by place, such as street vendor, restaurant and work), and information is collected on the frequency and cost of the meal events. ENHAO complements this adult individual questionnaire with Information on food away from home for children and on takeout meals (both through a household informant). It attempts to reduce measurement error linked to the use of proxy respondents, at least for adults and meals eaten outside. Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica\u00f1 e Inform\u00e1tica has also started implementing a survey of food establishments to assess the nutritional contents of meals eaten outside in different types of establishments, currently limited to the capital city (Farfan Genoni, and Vakis, 2017). This is certainly a valuable addition in terms of information gathered, but it comes at a cost in terms of fieldwork organization and response burden, as it requires contact with all adults in the household. Most recently, UEMOA member countries have undertaken a collaborative effort to harmonize their HCES at the regional level. For food away from home, the UEMOA module asks for each individual in the household to report separately on whether they have, in the past seven days, consumed any breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, hot beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, or alcoholic beverages outside of the house - and if so, the amount spent or the estimated value in the case of gifts. That approach also organizes data collection at the individual level, and around meal events. It does not, however, collect information on the location of the even, the frequency, or the origin of the in-kind food (with meals not paid for generically referred to as \"gifts\"). 54 Snacks are included in other items as well\u2014especially in the category of packaged processed foods (food list items 290-296), which includes sweets, cake, pastry, biscuits, chocolates, chips, papad, bhujia, namkeen, and chanachur.ANNEX II 47 Figure 2 \u2014 The Indian HCES Block 5 questions introduced in 2011/12, round 68 Item codeconsumption out of home producetotal consumption sourcequanity@ (0.000)value (Rs.)quanity@ (0.000)value (Rs.)

Food Policy, 72: 16. 57GLOSSARY Coefficient of Variation (CV) - it is a measure of dispersion of a (frequency or probability) distribution, and is defined as the ratio of the distribution's standard deviation to the mean. Cost of basic needs - cost of acquiring enough food for adequate dietary energy- usually 2,100 calories per person per day -with the addition of the cost of other essentials, such as clothing and shelter. Diary - method of data collection. One or more individuals in the household are asked to record at a daily level the household's or individual's food acquired or consumed or both during the reference period of food data collection. Dietary energy consumption (DEC) - measure of calories consumed by a population group. It is expressed in kilocalories per capita per day, and is estimated from households' food quantities collected in the survey after being adjusted for non-edible portions (e.g. bones and peels). DEC is calculated by converting consumed quantities into calories using a food composition table. Food acquisition - food (in terms of quantity or monetary values or both) acquired by households during the reference period of food data collection for the purpose of proper consumption. It includes food from purchases, own production and from other sources, such as food received as a gift, aid or as a payment. Food away from home - (from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics) food away from home includes all meals (breakfast and brunch, lunch, dinner and snacks and nonalcoholic beverages), including fast food, takeouts and deliveries, meals consumed at con - cession stands, buffets and cafeterias, and full-service restaurants, and meals purchased at vending machines or from mobile vendors. Also included are board (including at school), meals as pay, special catered affairs, such as weddings, bar mitzvahs and confirmations, school lunches, and meals away from home on trips. Food composition table - table with information on nutritional properties of foods usually consumed in a country (national) or a group of countries (regional), which includes information on the content of selected macro and micronutrients and the fraction of edible portions. It is generated according to international guidelines to be comparable and reliable. Food consumption - food (in terms of quantity or monetary values or both) consumed by a household over the reference period of food data collection. The consumed food can come from food acquired during the same reference period or from household stocks. Food expenditure - monetary value that was paid to purchase a specific amount of food. Food exclusivity - the food list must include only foods and no other commodities, such as tobacco or chewed stimulants. Food from own production - food acquired by one or more household members from the household's own production for household's at-home consumption. Food monetary value - includes food expenditure for purchases and the amount of money that a respondent would have spent if he or she purchased food acquired from own production or received in kind. Food purchased - food acquired by one or more household members. It includes food consumed at-home or away from home. Food from other sources - food acquired or consumed at-home from sources different from purchases and own production (e.g. gift, charity, as part of payment, government programs, excluding those from which food is consumed away from home, such as a school feeding program) Fortified food - food to which the content of a vitamin or mineral was deliberately increased irrespective of whether the nutrient was in the food before processing it. The aim of food fortification efforts is to improve the nutritional status of individuals who consume that food. Household - usually defined as an individual or group of individuals, related or unrelated, who live together in the same dwelling unit, who acknowledge one adult male or female as the head of household, who share the same living arrangements, who pool some, or 58 all, of their income and wealth, and who consume certain types of goods and services collectively, mainly housing and food, and are considered as one unit. List of food items - foods listed in a pre-filled food consumption module. Memory decay - refers to the process of forgetting details (e.g. quantities, monetary values, or foods) linked to consumption or acquisition. Non-standard units - measurement units for food consumption (or acquired for consumption) different from those included in the metric system (e.g., kilogram and liter). Quantities expressed in non-standard units need to be converted into standard (metric) units to derive nutritional properties from food composition tables. Non-standard units can vary between and within countries. Partakers - number of individuals who actually consumed the total amount of food reported by the household during the reference period of food data collection. The household size may be different from the number of food partakers because foods may be shared with non-household members, such as guests, employees, and relatives, and household members may have been absent in the house- hold during the reference period. Percentile - within a probability distribution, identifies the value of the observed variable below which a percentage (equal to the per - centile) of the observations falls. For example, the twentieth percentile corresponding to 940 Kcal/caput/day means that 20 percent of the population consumed less than 940 Kcal/caput/day. Prevalence of undernourishment - Measure of the proportion of individuals in a population suffering from chronic hunger (a state, lasting for at least one year, of inability to acquire enough food, defined as a level of food intake insufficient to meet dietary energy require- ments). Within a probability distribution framework is the probability that a randomly selected individual from a population has an inadequate habitual access to food to satisfy his or her dietary energy requirements. Processed foods - The term \"processed food\" applies to any food that has been altered from its natural state in some way, either for safety reasons or convenience. Recall interviews - method of data collection. One or all individuals in the household are asked to recall the household's or individual's food acquired and consumed during the reference period of food data collection (recall period). Recall period - reference period of data collection of a food recall interview. Respondents report the amount of food consumed or acquired during the recall period. Reference period - time period for which respondents are asked to report food acquisitions and consumption. Relevance (as defined in Smith, Dupriez and Troubat, 2014) - whether the data provide the information or indicators needed by dif- ferent users. Reliability (as defined in Smith, Dupriez and Troubat, 2014) - whether the survey design and method comply with good practice, on the basis of a number of criteria. Respondent burden - effort required by the respondent to answer a questionnaire. A longer questionnaire usually increases the respon - dent burden and may decrease the response rate and the accuracy of the response. Round - the total period (usually 12 months) over which a survey is carried out. Seasonality - effect on variation of food acquired or consumer or both and related expenditure over a long period (e.g., six months, one year). Seasonality is usually linked to agricultural production season. Other cyclical events, such as floods and droughts, may cause such variation affecting both food availability and prices. Telescoping - the action of reporting food consumption or acquisition or both that actually occurred before or after the recall period. The most common type of telescoping is including events that occurred before a short recall period, leading to an overestimation of consumption or acquisition or both. Usual month - a typical month (during the previous year or other reference period such as six months) over which respondents are asked to remember their food acquisition and consumption. Visit - refers to the visit of enumerators conducting the interviews. Over a survey round, multiple visits may be made.Living Standards Measurement Study www.worldbank.org/lsms data.worldbank.orgSELECT LSMS GUIDEBOOKS Measuring Household Rakotonarivo December 2018 Spectral Household Surveys Sydney Gourlay, Ermias Aynekulu, Calogero Carletto, and Keith Shepherd October 2017 The Use of Non-Standard Units for the Collection of Food Quantity Gbemisola Oseni, Josefine Durazo, and Kevin McGee July 2017 Measuring the Role of Livestock in the Household Economy Alberto Zezza, Ugo Pica-Ciamarra, Harriet K.
