The Office of EMS asked t he Board for clarification on the Rule concerning Mechanical Certification . Specifically what level of an ASE or EVT certification would meet the intent of the rule. A potion statement from the Office was presented for the Board 's consideration. The ru le states that the mechanic must be qualified to work on the ambulances and the Consultants need clarification as to what certification the mechanic should have . Ms. Tidwell stated when Jackie Wilkerson was with us he had researched and had determined they should be certified at the medium to heavy duty truck level. We are just asking the Board to provide intent of the rule on certifications . The Board asked a few question. Mr. Hodges stated that they are just asking for the Boards interpretation. This rule has always been there the office is not asking for any new rule just an interruption on intent of rule . Mr. Mitchell asked if the potion statement have the effect of the rule. Mr. Hodges stated it did and when they get an opportunity to change the rule th ey would be able to change it. I n the mean time they would put this position statement on the website. However we are not looking to change the rule and if a service wishes to take their vehicles back to the manufacture for inspections that is fine. M s. Tidwell stated that they have looked into this and stated that the manufacture stated they only let the mechanic that is qualified to check that truck and no one else. A representative for First Call Ambulance came before the Board and explained some of the different levels for the mechanic certification. He stated they want to meet the requirements for the rule but they need some clarification of what that means. Mr. Webb motioned to make a committee to look over this and decide what the best way to go is. Mr. Hutsell seconded. Jimmie Edwards, Montgomery County EMS Service Director, came before the Board and let them know where he takes his trucks and why they take them there. Dr. Smith stated that if they send this to a committee it would delay this and they need some clarification now. He suggested that they take the poli cy statement and keep the first paragraph and on the second paragraph keep the first two lines but strike the rest of the paragraph and replace it with : \"certified commensurate for the specific vehicle and system being inspected. Ms. Tidwell stated they would still have to specify type of certification. There was an explanation on what different levels of the ASE. Ms. Tidwell advised you can be an ASE certified but not be EVT certif ied, so both certifications have to be in the policy statement. Mr. Webb and Mr. Hutsell pulled the motion. Mr. Davis motioned to table this policy and bring it back to the next board meeting and Mr. Thurman seconded. Motion cared. Dr. Smith suggested that Ms. Tidwell put a group together to look this over before the next board meeting. Dr. Smith stated that they will table this till the next board meeting. 8 Mr. Mitchell asked if the board needed to make a position statement in response to resent personnel issue in the Office of EMS with an EMS Consultant. Commissioner Michelle J. Long addressed the issue with the board and felt this was a personnel issue that had been dealt with through the Department and did not require a board position statement. PUBLIC COMMENTS Mr. Mosby came before the Board to speak about the way the Board member was put on the Education Committee. Mr. Hutsell asked Mr. Hodges if there was something to vote on from that Committee would that Board member recuse themselves from the vote. Ms. Tidwell stated they want to know if the Board member was appointed to that Committee is he a voting of the Committee or just there to repres ent the Board. Mr. Hodges stated he did not know that answer. Mr. Hutsell stated that if the Committee brings something to the Board to vote on would that Board members have to recuse themself or can they vote on it at the Board meeting. Mr. Hodges does no t think that is a problem. Mr. Holliday stated that if the Board member is on that Committee then they should not be allowed to vote on it at the board meeting if they make decisions or vote in the Committee.
